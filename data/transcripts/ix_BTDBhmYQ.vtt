00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
discussion and you might as well know
 
00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 align:start position:0%
that there is a provision in new
 
00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire that's probably pretty unique
 
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
it was negotiated over on the senate
 
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 align:start position:0%
side a couple of years back and so i'm
 
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
going to hand this out and then if i
 
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
might okay
 
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
for me at least uh that you go ahead and
 
00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
hand it out but um for me i need you to
 
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
email it to me because that's that's my
 
00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
file box
 
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:22.470 align:start position:0%
file box
so

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.750 align:start position:0%
so
but

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.550 align:start position:0%
but
and

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
they might want to say one for the
 
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.230 align:start position:0%
they might want to say one for the
sponsor

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
people looking at this need to look at
 
00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
and you will be looking at um rsa 417 e1
 
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
which you would have been looking at
 
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
last week and you're going to go to the
 
00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
and you will see roman 5 b
 
00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
and the sub-paragraphs below
 
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
are all looking precisely at the
 
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 align:start position:0%
reimbursement side
 
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.830 align:start position:0%
reimbursement side
and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 align:start position:0%
in the discussion or on the senate side
 
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
the exam had been ongoing i can't
 
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
remember tyler you can fill me in on
 
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.030 align:start position:0%
remember tyler you can fill me in on
that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
whether the final
 
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
reports or the settlement agreements
 
00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
have been filed i'm not quite sure
 
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 align:start position:0%
but basically what it sought to do was
 
00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
to come up with a
 
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.870 align:start position:0%
to come up with a
standard

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
which would
 
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
at least show a minimum sort of
 
00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799 align:start position:0%
standard of how this reimbursement works
 
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
so when you talk about and i think
 
00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
holly brought this up she looked at an
 
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
eob and noted that her behavioral health
 
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
provider was being reimbursed at a rate
 
00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 align:start position:0%
that seemed significantly low what a
 
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 align:start position:0%
med-surg physician would be getting
 
00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
what most plans are doing or have been
 
00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
doing and it's going to vary from plan
 
00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 align:start position:0%
to plan when looking at the bh
 
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
selection of licensees you would start
 
00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 align:start position:0%
with a psychiatrist who would drop down
 
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
to a psychologist licensed clinical
 
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 align:start position:0%
social workers
 
00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
mental health and marriage counselors
 
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
laid out so there's a whole array of
 
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.830 align:start position:0%
laid out so there's a whole array of
providers

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
medicare's process which is basically
 
00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
the touchstone that most plans use
 
00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
on the bh side is to look at
 
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.869 align:start position:0%
on the bh side is to look at
psychiatrists

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists
 
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
and psychologists and then other
 
00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
clinical social workers they don't
 
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether they currently
 
00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 align:start position:0%
include marriage and family counselors
 
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe they're reimbursed
 
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
directly for latex licensed alcohol and
 
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 align:start position:0%
drug or certified alcohol and drug
 
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.509 align:start position:0%
drug or certified alcohol and drug
providers

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:43.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
what it basically sets up at the
 
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
medicare side is the physician and the
 
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.509 align:start position:0%
medicare side is the physician and the
psychiatrist

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist
 
00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.550 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist
using

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
using
 
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.030 align:start position:0%
using
commonly

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
commonly
 
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
filed codes i.e if you're a physician
 
00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
and you're looking at evaluation and
 
00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
management codes those are sort of
 
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
analogous to the codes a
 
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
behavioral health provider would use in
 
00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 align:start position:0%
an office setting there aren't
 
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
procedures per se it's an analysis and
 
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
an evaluation of the presentation of the
 
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
client at the time you see them
 
00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 align:start position:0%
and it's sort of a low intensity
 
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
claim so if you were to compare the
 
00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
physician on an e m code
 
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 align:start position:0%
and a psychiatrist on an em code
 
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
most plans are going to say that they're
 
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much paying the same thing
 
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
same rate but as you back away from
 
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
physician to physician and go to
 
00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
clinical social worker
 
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 align:start position:0%
i believe it would be typically that it
 
00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 align:start position:0%
would be a discount off the rate that
 
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
the physician and the psychiatrist would
 
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
be having
 
00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
maybe a 20 i don't really know but
 
00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's a percentage discount of sorts
 
00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
based upon licensure
 
00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
that is the standard that i think you
 
00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
will see written out in paragraph 4b
 
00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:04.159 align:start position:0%
and it's filing
 
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
follow-on paragraphs so what it's really
 
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
getting at is when you're going to
 
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 align:start position:0%
analyze reimbursement you first have to
 
00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 align:start position:0%
look at hospital systems versus fee
 
00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:16.310 align:start position:0%
look at hospital systems versus fee
schedule

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
hospital systems negotiate their
 
00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
contracts with their own providers with
 
00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 align:start position:0%
the plans and they have an enormous
 
00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
amount of power
 
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
plans need hospital systems in their
 
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
networks to satisfy adequacy and to
 
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 align:start position:0%
satisfy their customers
 
00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
and so there's a bargaining um
 
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
situation there that is not replicated
 
00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with independent
 
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.189 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with independent
physicians

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
physicians
 
00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 align:start position:0%
who are not part of a hospital system or
 
00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:47.430 align:start position:0%
who are not part of a hospital system or
independent

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
independent
 
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 align:start position:0%
and mostly behavioral health providers
 
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
are not part of the hospital system so
 
00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 align:start position:0%
they're on a statewide fee schedule as
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
would be non-hospital system physicians
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
statewide fee schedule
 
00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 align:start position:0%
and so when you're going to analyze
 
00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.029 align:start position:0%
and so when you're going to analyze
these

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.550 align:start position:0%
these
rating

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
rating
 
00:05:07.749 --> 00:05:07.759 align:start position:0%
situations bh to m med surge
 
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
you need to separate the hospital
 
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
systems and remove them from the
 
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
analysis because they're an anomalies
 
00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
they they have huge bargaining power as
 
00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
i said that their significance for the
 
00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 align:start position:0%
network is is
 
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 align:start position:0%
is important
 
00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
if you go over to the
 
00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
other contracted providers they're on a
 
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
statewide fee schedule so if you're
 
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
going to analyze bh providers vast
 
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
majority on statewide fee schedules you
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
want to look statewide fee schedule
 
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
there to statewide fee schedule
 
00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.270 align:start position:0%
there to statewide fee schedule
physician

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
physician
 
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
you want to analyze claims that are
 
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:42.080 align:start position:0%
comparable evaluation and management
 
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
claims sort of low intensity but
 
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
important claims that get filed but they
 
00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
and then you perhaps would also want to
 
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
look to medicare and its system how do
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
they do this and so that is basically
 
00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 align:start position:0%
what is spelled out in this section
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
which is important to know because
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
people say well
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
how does new hampshire look at
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and it talks to it in this
 
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
section but it also goes on to say that
 
00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:14.800 align:start position:0%
even if a plan complies with this
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
and provides rates that satisfy these
 
00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 align:start position:0%
standards laid out in
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
paragraph v
 
00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 align:start position:0%
that does not immediately mean they are
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
in compliance with mental health parity
 
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
so it leaves with the department with a
 
00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
lot of room to say look i'm looking at
 
00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
more than that yes that may be helpful
 
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 align:start position:0%
and you can show me that you do it this
 
00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:35.510 align:start position:0%
and you can show me that you do it this
way

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
but that's not enough for us we retain
 
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority to look at other
 
00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:40.870 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority to look at other
factors

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
factors
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
and i think what i'd like to end with
 
00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
and it was maybe two or three years ago
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
the department had at its annual hearing
 
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 align:start position:0%
a panel on mental health parody
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
and they had an expert i think his name
 
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
i think so and he was from harvard and
 
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
obviously brought to the panel as an
 
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.430 align:start position:0%
obviously brought to the panel as an
expert

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:03.440 align:start position:0%
expert
 
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.430 align:start position:0%
expert
and

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
i remember his opening comments and it
 
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
was along the lines of he had a
 
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.350 align:start position:0%
was along the lines of he had a
powerpoint

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
powerpoint
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
and he led a panel discussion as well or
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
participated in the panel
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
he said you know mental health parties
 
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
have been around a long while and and
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
the chair mentioned that as well the
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
first mental health health parity
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
provision federally was 1996.
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
it actually
 
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
gathered momentum starting in 2014 with
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
the affordable care act
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
because before that time it didn't apply
 
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:37.280 align:start position:0%
to every insurance plan out there now it
 
00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
pretty much is uniform
 
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:41.360 align:start position:0%
and since then if you look at the
 
00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
department of labor site or cms site you
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
can find document after document to help
 
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
plans become compliant with the
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
expectations and there are complexities
 
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
around this
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
non-qualitative treatment limit
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
segment of the affordable care act
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
and when richard frank i want to call
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
him dr frank uh spoke he began his
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
comments and i thought well
 
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
you know he's at the forefront
 
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
what is he going to say and he said this
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
is very complicated
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
this is complicated stuff mental health
 
00:08:18.629 --> 00:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
parity is not easy it's not easy on the
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
compliance side it's not easy on the
 
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
regulator side we have to remember
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
consumers are in the midst of it but it
 
00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
was sort of comforting to hear because
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
quite frankly i think it is very
 
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.230 align:start position:0%
quite frankly i think it is very
complicated

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
complicated
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
and so i think the discussion around
 
00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
reimbursement is going to continue
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
as tyler said other jurisdictions are
 
00:08:38.949 --> 00:08:38.959 align:start position:0%
looking into it i sort of looked into
 
00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959 align:start position:0%
any cases come out had come out of the
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
u.s department of labor
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
i only found one i think it was a united
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
health case but it was pretty apparent
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
somehow united health on the behavioral
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
health side for an out-of-network
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
service was discounting when it wouldn't
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
have done the same on an out of network
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
service on the med surg side
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
that's sort of
 
00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
patently there when you get into the
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
subtlety of how you structure your
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
payments fee schedule to fee schedule
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
hospital system
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
to non-hospital system
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
different licensees
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
there's a bill coming over on
 
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:16.949 align:start position:0%
there's a bill coming over on
a

00:09:16.949 --> 00:09:16.959 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
physician side
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
that you're going to see where a lesser
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
licensee is going to have to collaborate
 
00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
with the physician and you immediately
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
look at that reimbursement and say well
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
this person is you know how do how do
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
you how do you reimburse a person who is
 
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
in a collaborative a collaborative
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
arrangement with a physician
 
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
a physician's assistant so it's
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
complicated and
 
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
i guess what i wanted to let you know is
 
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire has made this first
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
step whether that tyler might not even
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
approve of that anymore it could be
 
00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
antiquated but anyway it's in the law
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
and i think most plans have been aware
 
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
of that and i think it's a start but i
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
there's more to come because it is
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
terribly complicated and the issue of
 
00:10:01.829 --> 00:10:01.839 align:start position:0%
providers feeling that they're not
 
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.240 align:start position:0%
adequately reimbursed one of the things
 
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
that's very apparent to me is if you are
 
00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
a bh provider in a solo setting you have
 
00:10:11.430 --> 00:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
all sorts of you're now going to have
 
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:14.720 align:start position:0%
another thing to do which is when you're
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
when your appointment book is full
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to and i think this
 
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
is good you're going to have to alert
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
your carrier that you're not taking new
 
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
patients and then it shifts of course to
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
the carrier say well we've got to get
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
that up on our website
 
00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
and then another thing i will bring up i
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
believe under federal law and i'm not
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
sure it's so on the state law there has
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
to be some sort of uh
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
immediate telephone opportunity for
 
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
somebody who's struggling to find
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
a carrier and so that need and i think
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
when there's a complaint on that side i
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
think there's a federal turnaround time
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
that is one business day but i'd have to
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
i'd have to look further into that but i
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make those comments
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
because we're not sitting flat-footed
 
00:10:54.959 --> 00:10:55.750 align:start position:0%
because we're not sitting flat-footed
here

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
sort of unaware that there are stresses
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
in the system
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay don't leave yet
 
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
you always i i do i always try to take
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
the simplest path and and get a metric
 
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
that i want to reach and let somebody
 
00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:17.839 align:start position:0%
else figure out how to get there
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
if if we gave the authority to the
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.220 align:start position:0%
insurance department
to

00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:25.230 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:26.710 align:start position:0%
to
[Music]

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
regulate up to a certain metric of use
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
in other words they're we're satisfying
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
we're not no we're no longer
 
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.190 align:start position:0%
we're not no we're no longer
inadequately

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
inadequately
 
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
you know providing the service
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
which we apparently aren't at at this
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
point in time
 
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
rather than have the legislature try and
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
figure out all the various
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh permutations of what needs to be done
 
00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
in order to get to that metric
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
rather than have us do it here
 
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
why don't we just
 
00:11:59.910 --> 00:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
put it into the law
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
a lot working with the insurance
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
department you know in medicare and all
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
basically you're absolutely right the
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
department has authority at the moment
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
to monitor this in fact their challenge
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
as much as the carriers have a challenge
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure their reimbursements are in
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
sync with
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
the parity provisions as much as
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
compliance you know directives coming
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
down from the us department of labor the
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
department is challenged with
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
monitoring this so it's all very well to
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
say to the provider
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
you know call us up and let us know that
 
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
you no longer can take patience
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
and then we have to get it up on the
 
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.509 align:start position:0%
and then we have to get it up on the
website

00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
somebody's got to say well did the
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
provider call did it get up on the
 
00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
website was there's a telephone contact
 
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:50.240 align:start position:0%
of somebody did they provide out of
 
00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
network i mean their monitoring is is
 
00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
that is a huge challenge
 
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
uh the good part is they're funded
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
they're not funded by the general fund
 
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.389 align:start position:0%
they're not funded by the general fund
so

00:13:00.389 --> 00:13:00.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
they can expand under their authority to
 
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
do what's necessary to regulate and we
 
00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:06.399 align:start position:0%
pay for it
 
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
according to our presence in the state
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
so it's a system that's supposed to work
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
and i think the other issue is and i'm
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
hearing nami here i think they need to
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
advise their members of every little
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
thing that's around in the statute and
 
00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:23.360 align:start position:0%
about the authority of the department
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
it's going to be very hard for them
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
follow on my only my only point was
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
i don't think
 
00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
this legislative body should be
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
getting into the weeds here
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
and but we've got some weeds that need
 
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
to get into and i think that we have a
 
00:13:46.069 --> 00:13:46.079 align:start position:0%
department that is
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
purportedly uh got
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
is getting good at that i mean i think
 
00:13:51.279 --> 00:13:52.069 align:start position:0%
is getting good at that i mean i think
we

00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
had a reference to us an early study
 
00:13:57.670 --> 00:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
we were earlier than most states
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
so i would i would prefer to put some
 
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.350 align:start position:0%
so i would i would prefer to put some
muscle

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
muscle
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
legislative muscle in the law
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
that gives the authority
 
00:14:08.949 --> 00:14:08.959 align:start position:0%
to our government
 
00:14:11.189 --> 00:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
to negotiate
 
00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
up to a certain metric which is
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
the use
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
of uh you know people can get help
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh and and i don't you know
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
i don't want to put a sentence in there
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
people can get health according to hb
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
i just think that maybe maybe the
 
00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
department needs a little more
 
00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.150 align:start position:0%
department needs a little more
uh

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:36.069 align:start position:0%
uh
nudging

00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
nudging
 
00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:37.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the word is
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
but give them the authority
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
to come in and work with the insurance
 
00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:43.590 align:start position:0%
to come in and work with the insurance
companies

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
on a on an even keel and everybody knows
 
00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
what what the what the yes is
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:54.079 align:start position:0%
i don't want to be doing that work
 
00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:56.720 align:start position:0%
well my my theory is with this amendment
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
obviously we're bringing
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
to the front and center the importance
 
00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
to the front and center the importance
of

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
the network and that there are providers
 
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.509 align:start position:0%
the network and that there are providers
there

00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
and if they're not if the pro if the
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
predators are all closed or they're not
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
because they're
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
quitting because they're not getting
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
reimbursed enough
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
then the
 
00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
the insurance department is going to see
 
00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120 align:start position:0%
that right away but more importantly is
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
the insurance companies
 
00:15:28.870 --> 00:15:28.880 align:start position:0%
are going to have to deal with that
 
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:29.829 align:start position:0%
are going to have to deal with that
problem

00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
and they're going to have to pay more
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
but the law should say that
 
00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
the law is is left open for them to
 
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
negotiate with the providers
 
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day the law says
 
00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
they've got to have providers
 
00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:48.710 align:start position:0%
they've got to have providers
so

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
that means that the companies have got
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
to do whatever they can to get providers
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
into the network and it sounds like to
 
00:15:57.749 --> 00:15:57.759 align:start position:0%
me the number one reason they haven't is
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
because they don't reimburse enough
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
but for us to mandate them to pay more
 
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
well i don't know that's like it's price
 
00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
controls or that's
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
i mean regulations we don't do that do
 
00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.629 align:start position:0%
i mean regulations we don't do that do
we

00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
with all due respect
 
00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.150 align:start position:0%
with all due respect
uh

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
governments do regulate and
 
00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
if if we give them the authority
 
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.749 align:start position:0%
if if we give them the authority
to

00:16:25.749 --> 00:16:25.759 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
regulate in other words say look we're
 
00:16:30.629 --> 00:16:30.639 align:start position:0%
not making the metric here
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
let's let's figure out how to get there
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
and by the way you know if
 
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
if we don't get there
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
then there's going to be consequences
 
00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
that's called regulation i don't i don't
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
think the legislation should be
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
involved in those conversations i think
 
00:16:51.509 --> 00:16:51.519 align:start position:0%
that we should make it clear
 
00:16:53.910 --> 00:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
that the insurance department has that
 
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.990 align:start position:0%
that the insurance department has that
responsibility

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
and maybe it we haven't made it clear
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
yet because you they're saying oh well
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
it's already in the law well no it's not
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
working so i don't why
 
00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959 align:start position:0%
and it all falls back on
 
00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:09.909 align:start position:0%
and it all falls back on
the

00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
to me the government i you know the
 
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
market by itself apparently
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
cannot get down there
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
and still you know survive so
 
00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:22.390 align:start position:0%
and still you know survive so
um

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:23.189 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

00:17:23.189 --> 00:17:23.199 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
okay you gotta get the reimbursement
 
00:17:25.909 --> 00:17:25.919 align:start position:0%
rate up that's all i'm saying
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett sorry thank you
 
00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
mr chair um
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna go back to
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
discussion on this amendment
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
my feeling is that the
 
00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
amount of testimony that we heard last
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
week regarding the problems with the
 
00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
issue is not going to be addressed with
 
00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment is only talking about
 
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:47.350 align:start position:0%
this amendment is only talking about
well

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
it it
 
00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
talks about just
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
eliminating the whole bill
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
and just saying about notice that the
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
sole pro providers and most of the
 
00:17:59.909 --> 00:17:59.919 align:start position:0%
mental health providers our sole
 
00:17:59.919 --> 00:18:01.510 align:start position:0%
mental health providers our sole
providers

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
providers
 
00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
would have to be contacting the
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
insurance carriers and i think that the
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
amount of responsibility that this bill
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
would put
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment would put on the sole
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
providers would be more than they could
 
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.230 align:start position:0%
providers would be more than they could
handle

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
handle
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
because this could change from one week
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
to another you know there may be
 
00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
one week that they can't take um more
 
00:18:21.909 --> 00:18:21.919 align:start position:0%
more more patients and let the insurance
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
company know we know that there's going
 
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
to be a lag time between
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
being able for the various carriers and
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
it's probably more than one carrier
 
00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:29.830 align:start position:0%
it's probably more than one carrier
involved

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
to be able to update their website and
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
then it could change
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
um so i don't feel like that the
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
amendment is addressing the problems
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
that we heard in testimony i don't think
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
we're also i also don't think we're
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
going to resolve all of this in this
 
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting and i think we
 
00:18:47.909 --> 00:18:47.919 align:start position:0%
should meet again to continue this
 
00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.510 align:start position:0%
should meet again to continue this
discussion

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.310 align:start position:0%
discussion
um

00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
because i i'm very aware
 
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
that's what i've scheduled is that for
 
00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
next wednesday morning we will do
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittees whatever didn't get
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
resolved today
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
next at 1 15 that next wednesday
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
and what doesn't get exact would be
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
exact on thursday
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
okay so but that's but i do think we
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
have we have to get this beast
 
00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
everything these eight bills out of
 
00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:20.720 align:start position:0%
committee that
 
00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:23.280 align:start position:0%
next week okay but my feeling is
 
00:19:25.029 --> 00:19:25.039 align:start position:0%
i know you've got a schedule for today
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
that you're looking for i think
 
00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:28.720 align:start position:0%
that there's been a lot of discussion on
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
this one this morning i think we should
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
keep talking about it because i don't
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
think this amendment is going to meet
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
the needs
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
um that we heard about last week i'm
 
00:19:39.830 --> 00:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
more than willing to let this amendment
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
sit for a week and and see see where
 
00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
we're at okay thank you so
 
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.270 align:start position:0%
we're at okay thank you so
okay

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360 align:start position:0%
yeah representative greeson
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
uh in response to representative
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
herbert's concerns
 
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
currently in statute
 
00:19:58.310 --> 00:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
in paragraph
 
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:00.160 align:start position:0%
roman numeral 5b
 
00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:01.919 align:start position:0%
section 1
 
00:20:03.669 --> 00:20:03.679 align:start position:0%
reimbursements for services paid to
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
mental health and substance use disorder
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
treatment providers shall meet the
 
00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:09.919 align:start position:0%
required standard if the reimbursement
 
00:20:11.909 --> 00:20:11.919 align:start position:0%
are on average equal to or greater than
 
00:20:13.669 --> 00:20:13.679 align:start position:0%
the relative medicare reimbursements for
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
the same service
 
00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:17.919 align:start position:0%
so it's already in the law the
 
00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
legislature has already said this is
 
00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
what the law is and now the insurance
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
commission already knows what the law is
 
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
and they can now hold the insurance
 
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.470 align:start position:0%
and they can now hold the insurance
companies

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
responsible and accountable to this law
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
that when it comes to reimbursement
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
rates anything anything additional would
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
be the state
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
setting a price
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
and that is a bridge way too far
 
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.190 align:start position:0%
and that is a bridge way too far
um

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
that we've got the law
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
they're held accountable to the law and
 
00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.950 align:start position:0%
they're held accountable to the law and
so

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
and as far as what the concerns from
 
00:20:58.390 --> 00:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
we cannot allow the government to run
 
00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
private businesses
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
part of
 
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:06.630 align:start position:0%
part of
these

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.430 align:start position:0%
these
these

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
private practitioners
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
is the cost of doing business
 
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.510 align:start position:0%
is the cost of doing business
and

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
having been a business owner i
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
understand the stresses of it there's
 
00:21:19.830 --> 00:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things you've got plates
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
juggling in the air
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
and you're doing everything you can to
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
keep them from crashing
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
one of those things that you deal with
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
today is making sure that the insurance
 
00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:30.480 align:start position:0%
company knows you're not taking
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
new provi uh new patients at this time
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
yes it may change a week from now may
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
change six months from now you look at
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
your calendar
 
00:21:40.149 --> 00:21:40.159 align:start position:0%
but that's just
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
you are in private practice knowing
 
00:21:44.710 --> 00:21:44.720 align:start position:0%
that's part of the the business you're
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
in private practice knowing that that is
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
something that you're going to have to
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
deal with and if you have staff
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
you know you've got somebody who's got
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
answering the phones for you scheduling
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
the appointments for you you've got
 
00:21:55.039 --> 00:21:56.070 align:start position:0%
the appointments for you you've got
somebody

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:21:57.190 --> 00:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know doing all kinds of other
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
different things
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
and so that is just part of the team
 
00:22:03.029 --> 00:22:03.039 align:start position:0%
that you have
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
that you hire as part of your
 
00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919 align:start position:0%
your your business if you need to hire
 
00:22:09.909 --> 00:22:09.919 align:start position:0%
somebody else then you hire that but the
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
government doesn't need to be coming in
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
and saying you need to hire somebody to
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
do that so that you can be in compliance
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
that is a responsibility that you have
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
that's just the responsibilities of
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
being in private business if you don't
 
00:22:22.789 --> 00:22:22.799 align:start position:0%
like all those responsibilities as a lot
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
of people are doing they join a hospital
 
00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:26.470 align:start position:0%
of people are doing they join a hospital
network

00:22:26.470 --> 00:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
network
 
00:22:28.870 --> 00:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh and then they the hospital network
 
00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
has somebody that will make sure that
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
you are in compliance there are pros and
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
cons both ways um so i'm i'm neither in
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
favor nor opposed to somebody going into
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
a hospital network but that's just the
 
00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
way it is in a private practice
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
you you know that that's what you have
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
to do and that's what you do
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
every time we've had new laws passed
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
whether it be
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
allergen warnings on our food products
 
00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
or whether it be some other kind of
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
how we handle waste disposal or anything
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
else like that
 
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
you just
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
just just an observation um can you be
 
00:23:12.789 --> 00:23:12.799 align:start position:0%
very brief because very brief very brief
 
00:23:12.799 --> 00:23:14.390 align:start position:0%
very brief because very brief very brief
um

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
there's a difference between a normative
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
statement which is what you've made it's
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
an opinion that's correct and that's
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
what you're allowed to do that you know
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
what i'm saying is
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
if you make a law
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm not in the business of
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
insuring a profit for somebody
 
00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
so if
 
00:23:33.669 --> 00:23:33.679 align:start position:0%
if the law says we're not making parity
 
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
which is already part of the dang thing
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
we got to fix it
 
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.110 align:start position:0%
we got to fix it
so

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
the private market's not going to
 
00:23:43.029 --> 00:23:43.039 align:start position:0%
apparently not going to fix it so
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
the government has to put a base in
 
00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
which is what medicare is all about
 
00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:47.909 align:start position:0%
which is what medicare is all about
so

00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
i don't understand why we just don't put
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
a a little fang in there
 
00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
the law that says hey uh well chris i'll
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
tell you what you've got a week to go
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
figure that one out
 
00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
i could do it in one sentence okay you
 
00:24:04.549 --> 00:24:04.559 align:start position:0%
you go get that drawn up and and we'll
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
entertain that as an amendment to the to
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
the bill mr chair right okay mr chair 20
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.799 --> 00:24:14.310 align:start position:0%
 
as

00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
the representative from anthem pointed
 
00:24:17.909 --> 00:24:17.919 align:start position:0%
out the harvard expert said this is very
 
00:24:19.830 --> 00:24:19.840 align:start position:0%
complicated um
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
also pointed out that 1996 mhp aca 2014
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
momentum so forth
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
we're not in a static situation we're in
 
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
a dynamic situation and i just want to
 
00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:34.640 align:start position:0%
point out that we don't have
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
hospital networks on the one hand
 
00:24:38.159 --> 00:24:39.750 align:start position:0%
hospital networks on the one hand
and

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
independent providers only the market
 
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
forces will push
 
00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
independent providers to form groups
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
once they form groups they're better
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
able to hire staff to be able to do the
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
kinds of things that we're talking about
 
00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
bottom line we're in a dynamic situation
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
and i think we're going to see some big
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
changes here thank you
 
00:25:02.799 --> 00:25:04.070 align:start position:0%
changes here thank you
okay

00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
all right yes representative now
 
00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh john and i
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate it i appreciate your um
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
extending uh this just for another
 
00:25:16.710 --> 00:25:16.720 align:start position:0%
minute um
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
just a couple of comments here um i i
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
really appreciate your comments um
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
represent greason's comments uh
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
especially too with regards to um to
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
rate setting and allowing the market to
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh to determine uh what a reasonable
 
00:25:33.029 --> 00:25:33.039 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates and i think we went
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
a very similar way when we did the
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
balance billing legislation um along
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
with representative kirk several years
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
ago but as we all know health care is a
 
00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:42.630 align:start position:0%
ago but as we all know health care is a
highly

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
highly
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
regulated market it is certainly not a
 
00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
free market type of
 
00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
type of situations but some things can
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
certainly be left up to um to market
 
00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
forces uh to um
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
to resolve um and
 
00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
and i think you know i hope everyone can
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
remember that uh hospital 1622 is a
 
00:26:01.750 --> 00:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill
 
00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:05.120 align:start position:0%
um it uh it impacts granite staters uh
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
across the state in all walks of life
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
um our role as legislators is to adjust
 
00:26:14.549 --> 00:26:14.559 align:start position:0%
be responsive to the dynamic situations
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing here in the state and
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
we've certainly seen um and and and
 
00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
potentially made worse by you know other
 
00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
underlying situations but but an
 
00:26:29.750 --> 00:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
increase in substance use disorder and
 
00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the state you know affecting
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
so many lives affecting parents children
 
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
workforce families dcyf
 
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:44.870 align:start position:0%
workforce families dcyf
and

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
and obviously some of that is even
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
involved in current events that we that
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
we see all the time but but i've heard
 
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
it loud and clear from from this
 
00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
committee that um that the bill the
 
00:26:59.110 --> 00:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill is presented uh would
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
need to be changed and and i'm very
 
00:27:05.669 --> 00:27:05.679 align:start position:0%

anina hansen and i just it has been very
 
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
educational to me listening to this
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
process last week and this week
 
00:27:38.630 --> 00:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
i think we have a wonderful system here
 
00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:40.480 align:start position:0%
and a lot of committed people who are
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
really doing their best both in front of
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
me and and behind me here um
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
so i'm learning a lot and i appreciate
 
00:27:51.029 --> 00:27:51.039 align:start position:0%
the expertise everybody brings and the
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
one thing that i want to contribute in
 
00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.389 align:start position:0%
one thing that i want to contribute in
exchange

00:27:54.389 --> 00:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
exchange
 
00:27:56.789 --> 00:27:56.799 align:start position:0%
is just the reminder because there's
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
there's so much tech speak and obviously
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
that has to be part of any sort of
 
00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
legislative process it's very important
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
i won't be able to be here next week to
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
to speak to the ongoing conversation so
 
00:28:10.470 --> 00:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
i just want to get in my
 
00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
my plea for for the remembrance of the
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
big picture issue here which is the
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
wellness of people and and
 
00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
our communities and our loved ones
 
00:28:25.510 --> 00:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
and you know
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
when phil before his death
 
00:28:30.070 --> 00:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
was in mental health crisis we weren't
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
sitting around being like oh well you
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
know what are the reimbursement rates
 
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
like obviously that stuff has to be
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
managed but when we get down to the
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
humanity for whom these reimbursements
 
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.269 align:start position:0%
humanity for whom these reimbursements
exist

00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
exist
 
00:28:45.269 --> 00:28:45.279 align:start position:0%
in those moments of crisis there just
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
has to be availability
 
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
there has to be access
 
00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.870 align:start position:0%
there has to be access
and

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
the reason there has to be is because
 
00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
lives are at stake and so
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
my request is just that people remember
 
00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
the big picture side of it that there
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
are people we all
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
love and cherish who need behavioral
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
health services for their wellness and
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
their survival and that that not get
 
00:29:10.559 --> 00:29:11.669 align:start position:0%
their survival and that that not get
lost

00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
lost
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
inside all this other technical work
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
that also has to be done
 
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
so thank you everybody
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
in the wisdom of this committee
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
when we gave cigar bars the ability to
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
serve alcohol
 
00:32:18.149 --> 00:32:18.159 align:start position:0%
the assumption is at that time cigar
 
00:32:18.159 --> 00:32:19.750 align:start position:0%
the assumption is at that time cigar
bars

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
bars
 
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:22.480 align:start position:0%
were a thriving economic
 
00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.110 align:start position:0%
were a thriving economic
business

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
and that
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
having liquor was never
 
00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:32.480 align:start position:0%
contemplated as a
 
00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:34.389 align:start position:0%
contemplated as a
uh

00:32:34.389 --> 00:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
a a major
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
econom or how is to say a
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
an important revenue source
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
okay it was designed to be a
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
a bonus feature
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh so that the people who were smoking
 
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:50.480 align:start position:0%
their fine cigars
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
could could actually have a glass of
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
wine or
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
cocktail or something along that line
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
but it was never so the question being
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
is if we were to repeal
 
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:02.640 align:start position:0%
all together
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
cigar bars having alcohol
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
and go back to the old i don't know what
 
00:33:09.669 --> 00:33:09.679 align:start position:0%
i say if we had sunset at that original
 
00:33:09.679 --> 00:33:12.070 align:start position:0%
i say if we had sunset at that original
law

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
are you saying all these business all
 
00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
these cigar bars would go out of
 
00:33:18.230 --> 00:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
business that that this liquor is that
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
important to their revenue stream
 
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.110 align:start position:0%
important to their revenue stream
uh

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
i i'm just as i said this is an uh
 
00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:27.760 align:start position:0%
concern of my constituent based on his
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
experience with a bar in nashua and i i
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
represent staple and i brought this
 
00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:34.230 align:start position:0%
represent staple and i brought this
forward

00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:33:35.669 --> 00:33:35.679 align:start position:0%
to to reduce and it's sort of a
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
compromise we after consulting with
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
other people we didn't you know
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
understood that the value of the law
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
that was passed i know i think it was
 
00:33:45.029 --> 00:33:45.039 align:start position:0%
you and former representative butler in
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
2009 correct but i think
 
00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
and i voted for it so i'm not you know
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
i don't want to repeal it all together
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
but i think
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
we ought to look at it maybe by re
 
00:33:58.549 --> 00:33:58.559 align:start position:0%
reducing the revenue for for at least
 
00:34:00.549 --> 00:34:00.559 align:start position:0%
two years and i and i that's i put that
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
in i'm even willing to consider three or
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
four just as an experiment but i think
 
00:34:08.470 --> 00:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
from time to time the laws we pass we
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
ought to look at them again to make sure
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
they're working and
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
if they're working fine if not don't
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
change them if if they aren't working
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
what we can do either to modify them or
 
00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
repeal them and right now this is more
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
modifying the present law that says i
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
see it
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
right but
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
it goes back to what what is their
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
alcohol was never intended to be their
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
their economic mainstream i mean that
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
was never intended to be their model
 
00:34:41.109 --> 00:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
even whether 50 that's why the 60 was
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
sent i mean i think the one time in the
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
original bill it was started out at 80.
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
80 okay and i can i believe you because
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
obviously you were involved in crafting
 
00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:52.399 align:start position:0%
and that we kind of toned it down a
 
00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
little bit but
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
but you know at the end of the day you
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
know are you saying if we don't pass
 
00:35:01.190 --> 00:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
this this one your your constituent will
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
go out of business because he can't sell
 
00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:05.599 align:start position:0%
enough cigars yeah i don't i'll admit i
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
don't know miss uh my constituent
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
involved i'm not sure whether he's in i
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
assume he isn't in the business but he's
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately not able to hear to speak
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
today for himself my understanding he is
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
not involved
 
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
in the sakai business to my knowledge
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
but i mean
 
00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
he's not involved i don't understand how
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
could he not be involved in the cigar
 
00:35:25.990 --> 00:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
business he patronizes i think such oh
 
00:35:28.069 --> 00:35:28.079 align:start position:0%
he's a customer
 
00:35:29.829 --> 00:35:29.839 align:start position:0%
so he has no idea what the revenue
 
00:35:31.349 --> 00:35:31.359 align:start position:0%
stream is of the establishment i mean
 
00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding anyway uh and i
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
don't represent staple don't know if you
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
know him better but i mean that's just
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
your same buddy
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor i'm sorry he is in the
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative staples in room two so i
 
00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.349 align:start position:0%
representative staples in room two so i
don't

00:35:47.349 --> 00:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
are you involved with the revenue with
 
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
this company is this is a cigar shop or
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
are you just a customer
 
00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.829 align:start position:0%
are you just a customer
um

00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:55.839 --> 00:35:57.030 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
constituent is you know once you come
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
sit over here see if there's an op
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
normally when we have subcommittees we
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
don't we invite everybody right up and
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
so it's a free for all discussion
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
originally i got this request from
 
00:36:17.589 --> 00:36:17.599 align:start position:0%
the constituent and um
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
i was busy at the time and not familiar
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
with the details of liquor and cigar
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
bars operations and he mentioned a bar
 
00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:30.800 align:start position:0%
in nashua so i suggested if there was a
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
problem he was connected with the
 
00:36:36.069 --> 00:36:36.079 align:start position:0%
owner by his clientele
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
relationship there that maybe he should
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
ask the owner to get a hold of his
 
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
nashua rep
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
who might understand the situation
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
better and and better prepare a bill
 
00:36:52.069 --> 00:36:52.079 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen for whatever reason
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
but from the gist of several
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
conversations i got that
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
the 60 40 formula
 
00:37:01.589 --> 00:37:01.599 align:start position:0%
was difficult for
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
at least three
 
00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
establishments to make the grade on on
 
00:37:08.390 --> 00:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
that split
 
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.190 align:start position:0%
that split
um

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
in an email with
 
00:37:13.270 --> 00:37:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative allard
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
who was a little more familiar with this
 
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
he suggested that a
 
00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:19.829 align:start position:0%
he suggested that a
55-45

00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
55-45
 
00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680 align:start position:0%
would would enable
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
easier compliance by the three entities
 
00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
that are having difficulty
 
00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.950 align:start position:0%
that are having difficulty
and

00:37:28.950 --> 00:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you're going to adjust
 
00:37:34.310 --> 00:37:34.320 align:start position:0%
the formula is there any merit to 50 50
 
00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
so you can remove that difficulty in
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
compliance it sounds like
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
that the cigar bars once thriving
 
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.910 align:start position:0%
that the cigar bars once thriving
business

00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:37:45.670 --> 00:37:45.680 align:start position:0%
may have
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
had a little bit of setback or
 
00:37:52.150 --> 00:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
you know lost in favor of the public i
 
00:37:55.109 --> 00:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
don't know i'm not a smoker anymore
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
and i don't frequently
 
00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
go to bars or taverns so i'm at a loss
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
to give you the
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
hands-on detail but that's what i feel
 
00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.190 align:start position:0%
hands-on detail but that's what i feel
that

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
i've heard hearsay that there are three
 
00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:10.160 align:start position:0%
establishments struggling to make
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
the 60 40 requirement by the department
 
00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:14.870 align:start position:0%
the 60 40 requirement by the department
okay

00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:17.510 align:start position:0%
okay
keith

00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:18.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:38:21.349 --> 00:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
full disclosure i do frequent some cigar
 
00:38:23.109 --> 00:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
in bars
 
00:38:25.589 --> 00:38:25.599 align:start position:0%
and uh it's a it's a great
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
venue to hang out with people that have
 
00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:29.030 align:start position:0%
venue to hang out with people that have
different

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
political opinions than you do so
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know cigar
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
so i have a lot of democrat friends who
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
i sit around and uh you know we bust
 
00:38:41.829 --> 00:38:41.839 align:start position:0%
each other's chops over cigars and but
 
00:38:43.750 --> 00:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
you learn things that way right
 
00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:44.710 align:start position:0%
you learn things that way right
um

00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.750 align:start position:0%
um
cigar

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
cigar
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
shops are competing with online
 
00:38:47.839 --> 00:38:49.349 align:start position:0%
shops are competing with online
businesses

00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
i have another friend in pennsylvania he
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
works for famous smoke shop
 
00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's one of the largest online retailers
 
00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.069 align:start position:0%
it's one of the largest online retailers
cigar

00:38:58.069 --> 00:38:58.079 align:start position:0%
cigar
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
cigar shops brick and mortar shops
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
are competing with these online
 
00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.190 align:start position:0%
are competing with these online
companies

00:39:03.190 --> 00:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
companies
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
because uh they have to sustain you know
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
a lease and a premises and so allowing
 
00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
them to serve
 
00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.150 align:start position:0%
them to serve
uh

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.349 align:start position:0%
uh
wine

00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
wine
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
vodka maybe but probably bourbon
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
um allows the you know attracts uh a
 
00:39:20.069 --> 00:39:20.079 align:start position:0%
customer base it provides something
 
00:39:20.079 --> 00:39:21.109 align:start position:0%
customer base it provides something
extra

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
extra
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh that those online shops can't do we
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
did hear there were 15
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
i think there were 16 and the one went
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
out of business in nashua i think i have
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
an idea of what that company is now
 
00:39:33.589 --> 00:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
there's 15 and i think we heard that
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
three were right around that uh
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
you know we're
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
struggling with the compliance level and
 
00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
uh you know would you believe um maybe
 
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
if we gave them a little bit of slack
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
and i'd be interested in the liquor
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
commission's uh take on this but if we
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
give them a little bit of slack
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
would that uh you know allow those three
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i think
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
that would be a reasonable
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
move to make
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
some more information would be helpful
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
to know to what extent they're
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
struggling to make the
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
statutory uh the rule-making um limits
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
uh and i can't tell you what that is
 
00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
um instead of just picking a number out
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
of the air okay chief
 
00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119 align:start position:0%
do you want to come up and have a seat
 
00:40:21.119 --> 00:40:22.870 align:start position:0%
do you want to come up and have a seat
here

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
or do you want to
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
send somebody up who is an expert on
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
do you have a question jeff
 
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.470 align:start position:0%
do you have a question jeff
yeah

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:39.510 align:start position:0%
yeah
okay

00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative bartlett
 
00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um would you believe that i'm
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
having a tough time
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
feeling that we should be
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
moving on legislation based on hearsay
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
i really think we need some facts to be
 
00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
able to move this forward
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
right now i agree with you that did the
 
00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
business in nashua close simply because
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
of millwater that they they weren't
 
00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
competitive anymore i can't imagine it
 
00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
was because that if all of a sudden they
 
00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:09.750 align:start position:0%
was because that if all of a sudden they
could

00:41:09.750 --> 00:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
sell more booze they would suddenly
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
be successful
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's the question to you yes
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
so i don't know exactly so full
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%

enforcement licensing with me is uh
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
lieutenant matt culver uh who actually
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
oversees licensing and in our auditing
 
00:42:30.870 --> 00:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh department um
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh you have the this license
 
00:42:36.870 --> 00:42:36.880 align:start position:0%
type right on the nose um
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
it is and i'm similar to you
 
00:42:42.950 --> 00:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
um i frequent and and enjoy those
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
establishments um but they are
 
00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
cigar establishments
 
00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
giving us as patrons the opportunity to
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
have a drink
 
00:42:55.349 --> 00:42:55.359 align:start position:0%
um but they're actually starting to
 
00:42:55.359 --> 00:42:56.470 align:start position:0%
um but they're actually starting to
swing

00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
swing
 
00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:57.510 align:start position:0%
swing
and

00:42:57.510 --> 00:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
they're being utilized for not their
 
00:43:01.349 --> 00:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
purpose not their business structure
 
00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
that they should have that license type
 
00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:05.920 align:start position:0%
is being utilized to
 
00:43:07.349 --> 00:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
sell alcohol
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
and possibly sprinkle a little
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
cigar on top of it which is not the
 
00:43:14.790 --> 00:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
intent of the license height
 
00:43:17.190 --> 00:43:17.200 align:start position:0%
we have gone out of our way to actually
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
help these patrons or i'm sorry patrons
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
these licensees get into different
 
00:43:23.990 --> 00:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
license types that fit their business
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
model better
 
00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
i i know you've heard me talk about our
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
customer service base
 
00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
that's not even an understatement we go
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
out we talk to the licensee
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
if they if we feel they're not making
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
their numbers and we feel that the the
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
uh percentages are there to
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
solidify that they are a tobacco step or
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry a cigar establishment
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
not not a alcohol establishment uh the
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
alcohol should be a secondary to it
 
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.150 align:start position:0%
alcohol should be a secondary to it
so

00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:43:57.829 --> 00:43:57.839 align:start position:0%
lieutenant culver can actually speak to
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
the numbers we have those
 
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:02.319 align:start position:0%
pretty close to up to date
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:06.390 --> 00:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much chairman fellow
 
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:08.800 align:start position:0%
committee members um
 
00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:13.280 align:start position:0%
did you want me to comment just on the
 
00:44:15.270 --> 00:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
it's good times it's the actual name of
 
00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.230 align:start position:0%
it's good times it's the actual name of
shays

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
shays
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh but good times smoke shop do you want
 
00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:20.000 align:start position:0%
their numbers or
 
00:44:22.710 --> 00:44:22.720 align:start position:0%
is that appropriate i'm not i think you
 
00:44:25.510 --> 00:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned 10 to 15 off the previous
 
00:44:28.230 --> 00:44:28.240 align:start position:0%
hearing so okay that particular license
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
was not renewed because they were not in
 
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
compliance but i do have their um
 
00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:34.720 align:start position:0%
numbers here if you would like to hear
 
00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:35.510 align:start position:0%
numbers here if you would like to hear
them

00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
so so
 
00:44:39.670 --> 00:44:39.680 align:start position:0%
numbers in terms of what their revenue
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
liquor revenue was right and their
 
00:44:43.670 --> 00:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
percentage of the 60 requirement
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
and so i guess
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
he's a little tacky to be throwing
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
numbers people's numbers around but what
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
i want to know is did his tobacco
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
business decline was it that was is the
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
fundamental problem
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
not that they can't sell enough booze
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
but that their their cigar sales are in
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
decline right so well i i think your
 
00:45:05.839 --> 00:45:06.790 align:start position:0%
decline right so well i i think your
original

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
assessment is is spot on uh chairman and
 
00:45:14.069 --> 00:45:14.079 align:start position:0%
you're exactly right when this law was
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
originally designed it was designed for
 
00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
retail cigar locations
 
00:45:22.390 --> 00:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
okay in when when the law was passed the
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
cigar bar uh license type was passed it
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
was passed for the purpose of
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
having the privilege of
 
00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
a cigar a retail cigar location having
 
00:45:34.390 --> 00:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
an alcoholic beverage while they enjoy
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
their cigar
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years we've seen an
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
increase in the amount of
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
licensee applicants who have
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
founded a couple attractive qualities to
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
the cigar bar license
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
and they're
 
00:45:49.839 --> 00:45:50.790 align:start position:0%
and they're
um

00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
they're applying for that license type
 
00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:55.280 align:start position:0%
to perhaps circumvent some of the other
 
00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
license types
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
a couple of those
 
00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:02.240 align:start position:0%
a couple of a couple of those qualities
 
00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:02.950 align:start position:0%
a couple of a couple of those qualities
are

00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
uh the ability to smoke on the premise
 
00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
and the ability
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
to not have food available
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
for the patrons so they don't have to be
 
00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.150 align:start position:0%
for the patrons so they don't have to be
restaurants

00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:16.160 align:start position:0%
restaurants
 
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
what we've seen over the past couple
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
years is when these applications have
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
come in for these businesses with these
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
specific business models we've worked
 
00:46:28.630 --> 00:46:28.640 align:start position:0%
with them to make sure that they're
 
00:46:30.069 --> 00:46:30.079 align:start position:0%
going to be able to maintain their
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
compliance with this license type
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
now those compliance
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
policies that we've implemented have
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
have allowed us to monitor them
 
00:46:45.109 --> 00:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
throughout their temporary license type
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
issuance and
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
their their quarterly
 
00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
gross revenue requirements
 
00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
reporting to the commission we have all
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
of the data now and the data suggests to
 
00:46:57.119 --> 00:46:57.910 align:start position:0%
of the data now and the data suggests to
us

00:46:57.910 --> 00:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:46:57.920 --> 00:46:58.870 align:start position:0%
us
that

00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.750 align:start position:0%
for the
licensees

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
licensees
 
00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
who have always remained the retail
 
00:47:07.030 --> 00:47:07.040 align:start position:0%
cigar locations there's no compliance
 
00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.710 align:start position:0%
cigar locations there's no compliance
issues

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:47:11.109 --> 00:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
so the licensees that are utilizing the
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
license type for what it was intended
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
for there are no compliance issues it's
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
the licensees who have business models
 
00:47:19.109 --> 00:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
that don't
 
00:47:19.119 --> 00:47:20.230 align:start position:0%
that don't
um

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
correlate directly to that license type
 
00:47:25.670 --> 00:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
that are are creating the challenges
 
00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:26.870 align:start position:0%
that are are creating the challenges
here

00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
um in in
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
we can tell that by some of the business
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
models you know
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
the smoking on the premise
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
cigars our cigarette smoking is
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
prohibited by the statue
 
00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
correct everybody
 
00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:44.720 align:start position:0%
cigar or cigarette smoking is prohibited
 
00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
but other forms of tobacco are not
 
00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
prohibited to be smoked on the premise
 
00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
of a cigar bar one of those is flavored
 
00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
tobacco so flavored tobacco is now
 
00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
commonly being smoked through a hookah
 
00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.190 align:start position:0%
commonly being smoked through a hookah
pipe

00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
pipe
 
00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.950 align:start position:0%
pipe
and

00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
businesses that have models that want to
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
promote the hookah smoking on their
 
00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
premise are attracted to the cigar bar
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%
license type
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
now that's not what it was intended for
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
in every flavored tobacco
 
00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
product that they sell
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
actually works against the 60
 
00:48:17.520 --> 00:48:19.349 align:start position:0%
actually works against the 60
requirement

00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
now you add this that all of those
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
products that they're selling on top of
 
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:24.800 align:start position:0%
the alcohol they're selling and there's
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
likewise with
 
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.430 align:start position:0%
likewise with
the

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.230 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
business models that don't want to get
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
involved in the
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
restaurant business
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
they are attracted to the this license
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
type because they don't have to provide
 
00:48:43.599 --> 00:48:45.190 align:start position:0%
type because they don't have to provide
food

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
food
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:48.549 align:start position:0%
okay so
every

00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
product or their business model that
 
00:48:52.630 --> 00:48:52.640 align:start position:0%
they come up with in every product that
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
they sell that is not a cigar on their
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
on their premise and they have limited
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
numbers of cigars or cigar related
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
products everything that they sell on
 
00:49:03.349 --> 00:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
their premise
 
00:49:05.910 --> 00:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
technically goes against their 60
 
00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:07.190 align:start position:0%
technically goes against their 60
requirement

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:09.040 align:start position:0%
so when we look at
 
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.630 align:start position:0%
so when we look at
the

00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:10.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
cigar bars that were
 
00:49:14.069 --> 00:49:14.079 align:start position:0%
this license type was originally
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
designed for you're talking about um
 
00:49:19.430 --> 00:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
invoice amounts in inventory amounts of
 
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
tens of thousands of cigars
 
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:24.640 align:start position:0%
now we're seeing
 
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
on these some of these licenses that are
 
00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
struggling with their license types
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
we're seeing you know inventory amounts
 
00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.630 align:start position:0%
we're seeing you know inventory amounts
in

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
the less than 100 cigars there is no way
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
that you can make those requirements
 
00:49:40.549 --> 00:49:40.559 align:start position:0%
with with those numbers okay now now you
 
00:49:43.030 --> 00:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
you've you've hit us a point for me that
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
i'm a little worried about
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:48.800 --> 00:49:51.510 align:start position:0%
 
hookah

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's just regular tobacco
 
00:49:53.119 --> 00:49:55.270 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's just regular tobacco
right

00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
is it not always is it always flavored
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
tobacco is in there is
 
00:50:01.349 --> 00:50:01.359 align:start position:0%
it isn't like like i always think of
 
00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
the turkish you know hookah right you
 
00:50:07.119 --> 00:50:08.390 align:start position:0%
the turkish you know hookah right you
know

00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
shisha and flavored tobacco is what
 
00:50:11.430 --> 00:50:11.440 align:start position:0%
they're using and you're saying that's
 
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:13.760 align:start position:0%
working against them
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
that's not included as a as a tobacco
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
product it's not included a cigar or a
 
00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
cigar related item in the statutes and
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
our statute was specific well maybe you
 
00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:24.160 align:start position:0%
want to amend this a bill because i'm
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
not sure i'm opposed to that i mean
 
00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
if if and i and i've had this
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
conversation i don't know too much with
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
youtube but i know i had with the
 
00:50:36.790 --> 00:50:36.800 align:start position:0%
previous that that your your um
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
the hookah business is kind of a um
 
00:50:43.510 --> 00:50:43.520 align:start position:0%
but i i i think it's actually kind of uh
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
it's a social thing that people get
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
together and they got their hookah and
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
and and it is muslim
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
right so it's sort of
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i want to
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i want to be counting
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
against that i mean i i understand that
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
cigar and the word cigar
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
and i and you guys are very precise and
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
using the word cigar
 
00:51:08.549 --> 00:51:08.559 align:start position:0%
but i always thought when we had uh when
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
we passed that statute
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
i always thought that they would be
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
selling other tobacco products such as
 
00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:15.910 align:start position:0%
selling other tobacco products such as
cigarettes

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:15.920 align:start position:0%
cigarettes
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
such as you know whatever
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
and taking them out people are you know
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
obviously can't smoke them there they
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
can only smoke the cigar
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
but when i thought when we set that
 
00:51:28.870 --> 00:51:28.880 align:start position:0%
number at 60 i never never
 
00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:29.990 align:start position:0%
number at 60 i never never
considered

00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
that it had to be only cigar
 
00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
so i i i hear you that that's what the
 
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
bill the law says
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
but i kind of i'm i kind of leaned and
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe that's not right that's not
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
right and fair because
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
if they're in the cigar bar if they're
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
in the cigar business tobacco business
 
00:51:51.030 --> 00:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
there the whole point was that they're
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
selling tobacco products
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
all right and yeah i had the vision that
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
they might be selling blogs
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
and someone would say that's a that's a
 
00:52:02.950 --> 00:52:02.960 align:start position:0%
smoking device well no it's a illegal
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
smoking device and i think there's
 
00:52:06.069 --> 00:52:06.079 align:start position:0%
defined somewhere else the statute that
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
you know if it's for the intent to smoke
 
00:52:10.309 --> 00:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh marijuana or something like that but
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i don't know how other
 
00:52:13.510 --> 00:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
members of the committee feel about this
 
00:52:16.069 --> 00:52:16.079 align:start position:0%
but i i'm not sure that that's right
 
00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:17.200 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
not allowing them to um
 
00:52:23.109 --> 00:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
include other because like for instance
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
if they sell the cigar and the person
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
smoking the next car they bought there
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's considered
 
00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.630 align:start position:0%
that's considered
okay

00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:33.430 align:start position:0%
okay
so

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
so maybe rather than
 
00:52:37.829 --> 00:52:37.839 align:start position:0%
getting so bogged down on this
 
00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
50 60 whatever let's just look at what
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
should be considered because i i i have
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
to admit if you had asked me this
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
question i would have thought cigarettes
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
or any other tobacco type related
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
product they were selling
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
was considered part of their 60 percent
 
00:52:59.349 --> 00:52:59.359 align:start position:0%
and and mr chairman uh you're partially
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
right because if i have it correctly
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
before my time
 
00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.470 align:start position:0%
before my time
um

00:53:04.470 --> 00:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
i think chief wilson was part of a bill
 
00:53:10.870 --> 00:53:10.880 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh that was brought before you he was he
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
was the chief at the time but but didn't
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
go anywhere i don't know the outcome of
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
it but it didn't go anywhere at that
 
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:22.960 align:start position:0%
point include more tobacco products um
 
00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:23.750 align:start position:0%
point include more tobacco products um
more

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.109 align:start position:0%
more
uh

00:53:25.109 --> 00:53:25.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:26.549 --> 00:53:26.559 align:start position:0%
so he was around when we passed the
 
00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
legislation i think no
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
that's going to be under chief edwards
 
00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
done already okay yep
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
okay yeah representative bartlett
 
00:53:37.190 --> 00:53:37.200 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chair
 
00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.069 align:start position:0%
thanks mr chair
so

00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:39.990 --> 00:53:40.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go back to the bill
 
00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:41.589 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go back to the bill
um

00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:44.630 --> 00:53:44.640 align:start position:0%
are you looking to amend this bill yeah
 
00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:46.160 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking that we want to amend the
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
bill to include all tobacco products
 
00:53:51.750 --> 00:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
where the definition of cigar would be
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
all tobacco products yeah okay is that
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
going to meet the needs that
 
00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:58.079 align:start position:0%
this constituent
 
00:53:59.430 --> 00:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
is requesting
 
00:54:01.430 --> 00:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
well as far as i'm concerned this bill
 
00:54:03.030 --> 00:54:03.040 align:start position:0%
is dead okay
 
00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:03.910 align:start position:0%
is dead okay
okay

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:05.920 align:start position:0%
because that's it it defies the whole
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of the what the 60 percent the
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
16 wasn't supposed to be a negative to
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
them the 60 is to make sure that they
 
00:54:13.990 --> 00:54:14.000 align:start position:0%
didn't forget what they're supposed to
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
be in the business doing
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
which is selling
 
00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
tobacco products so
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
do the booze was supposed to be a you
 
00:54:21.839 --> 00:54:22.549 align:start position:0%
do the booze was supposed to be a you
know

00:54:22.549 --> 00:54:22.559 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
i got
 
00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot of time but let me
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
tell you a very quick story
 
00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
we had eddie edwards brought to me an
 
00:54:33.030 --> 00:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
issue was that
 
00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:34.640 align:start position:0%
uh bridal
 
00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:36.309 align:start position:0%
uh bridal
places

00:54:36.309 --> 00:54:36.319 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
are giving and and beauty shops are
 
00:54:40.870 --> 00:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
giving glasses of champagne to their
 
00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.950 align:start position:0%
giving glasses of champagne to their
customers

00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
customers
 
00:54:46.309 --> 00:54:46.319 align:start position:0%
and under our statute that's illegal
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
it says you cannot give
 
00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:51.440 align:start position:0%
this is this is this is one this is
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
roman numeral one you cannot give okay
 
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
and he says well should we try to
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
license these people
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
because they're giving it away free and
 
00:55:02.309 --> 00:55:02.319 align:start position:0%
i go oh my god no we can't do that's
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
what a nightmare and how are we going to
 
00:55:05.910 --> 00:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
enforce that it would be important it
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
was just a rate so
 
00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
the nuances in our statute
 
00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
at this point is that you know we have
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
we absolutely know we have a problem and
 
00:55:18.150 --> 00:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
i just put it on up on the web now
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
that we have a problem with our statue
 
00:55:22.470 --> 00:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
that we cannot fix we're not we're not
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
going to fix that problem
 
00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
and so in this case in my mind the 60
 
00:55:31.750 --> 00:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
was to say is don't take your eye off
 
00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
the ball
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
on what your purpose is
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
which is to sell
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
tobacco products i hear this said cigar
 
00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm i'm willing to revisit the
 
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:44.240 align:start position:0%
statue and just
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
add that cigar and cigar related would
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
be tobacco
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
okay so how do you feel about that
 
00:55:52.549 --> 00:55:52.559 align:start position:0%
i don't really have a problem with that
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
good so what i'm looking for is
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
are we amending
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
this bill as it is
 
00:56:00.630 --> 00:56:00.640 align:start position:0%
yeah replacing it
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
that's right that's what i would do yes
 
00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
i would um i mean if people want to buy
 
00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
tobacco products and cigars that's their
 
00:56:11.670 --> 00:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
business yeah okay
 
00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
representative i'll be quick thank you
 
00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
mr chair um
 
00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.309 align:start position:0%
mr chair um
it

00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
would you believe that it's customary
 
00:56:20.549 --> 00:56:20.559 align:start position:0%
that cigar establishments that do not
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
have a liquor license it's customary for
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
customers to bring in their own liquor
 
00:56:25.119 --> 00:56:26.069 align:start position:0%
customers to bring in their own liquor
bottles

00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
bottles
 
00:56:28.150 --> 00:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
and serve it you know
 
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
and there's then there's no there's no
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
one regulating the amount that people
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
are getting so the one benefit is you
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
have a bartender that is uh you know
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
keeping track of how many drinks you've
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
had and some other establishments you
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
know if you're there late at night you
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
could get out of control right so
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
one benefit of having oversight just
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
real quick um
 
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:49.280 align:start position:0%
the uh 60 includes
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
uh cigars humidors cigar cutters cigar
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
cases lighters and ashtrays that's it
 
00:56:55.829 --> 00:56:55.839 align:start position:0%
and then it says keno mail order
 
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:57.440 align:start position:0%
internet sales as well as revenue
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
generated from other tobacco sales in
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
store including cigarettes loose tobacco
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
shall not be used to determine
 
00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:05.040 align:start position:0%
whether it satisfies so right that would
 
00:57:06.950 --> 00:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
be the adjustment
 
00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:07.829 align:start position:0%
be the adjustment
okay

00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
you have any
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
good reason why we shouldn't maybe re
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
revisit those numbers revisit those
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
categories you bring up a good point mr
 
00:57:18.630 --> 00:57:18.640 align:start position:0%
chairman and and it's something that we
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
can all look at
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
collectively and and see the way the
 
00:57:24.470 --> 00:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
pros and the cons
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay like we do with everything so
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
uh in that way he just read to me are
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
they barred from selling cigarettes
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
you have to read the sentence again did
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
it say yes paragraph two section d says
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
does not allow cigarette smoking or
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
service of food on the premises right
 
00:57:47.829 --> 00:57:47.839 align:start position:0%
cigarette smoking right but in terms of
 
00:57:47.839 --> 00:57:48.710 align:start position:0%
cigarette smoking right but in terms of
this

00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
you can stay can sell cigarettes right
 
00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:52.720 align:start position:0%
tobacco products right yes curtis
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
they're selling tobacco products right
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.520 --> 00:58:02.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:06.400 align:start position:0%
all right so if you you think that might
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
be okay with you guys that we just
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
change what
 
00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:13.760 align:start position:0%
and that way it solves this problem i i
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
think big time would probably solve the
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
problem because i'm sure they're selling
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of cigarettes
 
00:58:19.990 --> 00:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
how about lottery tickets do they sell
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
lottery tickets i'm not tracking lottery
 
00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:24.470 align:start position:0%
lottery tickets i'm not tracking lottery
tickets

00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
tickets
 
00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.349 align:start position:0%
tickets
okay

00:58:25.349 --> 00:58:25.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
all right so we will take the revenue
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
from yes
 
00:58:30.470 --> 00:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know mr chair thank you i have a
 
00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
question why is it so important that
 
00:58:33.839 --> 00:58:34.950 align:start position:0%
question why is it so important that
um

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
again that these
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
assuming we kept the same law that they
 
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:41.440 align:start position:0%
keep to that sixty percent for cigars i
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
mean it seems to me that
 
00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.079 align:start position:0%
you know five ten years ago cigars were
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
very a very in thing
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
and that popularity has just dipped down
 
00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
so i think holding people to those
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
companies or businesses to those
 
00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
those uh standards of yesterday
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't seem to me to make sense
 
00:59:03.349 --> 00:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
in the first place good so it sounds
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
like you agree with us that we shouldn't
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
amend this law
 
00:59:08.309 --> 00:59:08.319 align:start position:0%
i agree yeah okay
 
00:59:08.319 --> 00:59:09.750 align:start position:0%
i agree yeah okay
okay

00:59:09.750 --> 00:59:09.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
all right so we will uh john yeah okay
 
00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:13.359 align:start position:0%
just in response to representative
 
00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
bartlett's question i'm not sure how my
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
constituent would feel about this
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
amendment and i wish he was here today
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
to respond but i understand if it's the
 
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
will of the committee because i
 
00:59:23.119 --> 00:59:24.069 align:start position:0%
will of the committee because i
understand

00:59:24.069 --> 00:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
you you may introduce a bill but it
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
actually becomes your bill and if you
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
want to do anything amend it to deal
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
not an expert on the issue so i'm also
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
learning so you can certainly tell him
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
he can watch it on the uh up on youtube
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
and hear how we got here where we are
 
00:59:48.549 --> 00:59:48.559 align:start position:0%
all right understand representative
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
right well yeah
 
00:59:51.109 --> 00:59:51.119 align:start position:0%
i don't think this bill should be
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
amended i think it should should just be
 
00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:53.829 align:start position:0%
amended i think it should should just be
killed

00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
killed
 
00:59:57.349 --> 00:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
and um i also uh believe that
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
as a business owner if they're not
 
01:00:01.190 --> 01:00:01.200 align:start position:0%
making ends meet if they're not you know
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
making any money then change the
 
01:00:04.150 --> 01:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
business model
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's what i suggest
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
not the law right no but the the what
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
we're finding here is is that they might
 
01:00:12.829 --> 01:00:12.839 align:start position:0%
actually be doing very
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
well other than selling some other other
 
01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
tobacco products
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
okay and there is a cost to to the one
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
right they have to they have to get a
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
liquor license when how much is their
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
liquor license
 
01:00:28.549 --> 01:00:28.559 align:start position:0%
it's 840 840. but they also have a
 
01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:30.480 align:start position:0%
retail tobacco license every cigar bar
 
01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
and they have to have their tobacco
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
license anyways right which is six
 
01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
dollars but and it's six dollars only
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
because they have the booze portion if
 
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
they didn't it would be
 
01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
hundred and forty dollars
 
01:00:47.349 --> 01:00:47.359 align:start position:0%
if i understand the new the new law
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
okay so we will schedule a subcommittee
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh on this yes representative um i just
 
01:00:53.589 --> 01:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
want to be clear that i am definitely
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill as it stands i am
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
too if you are amending it just to
 
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:00.400 align:start position:0%
change that other tobacco products can
 
01:01:03.750 --> 01:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
be included in the um 60 60 i don't
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
really have a problem with that
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
right i'm glad to hear we'll have a
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
bipartisan solution the bill itself i am
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
definitely opposing no i agree with you
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
yes okay i think we're i think we're
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
there okay
 
01:01:17.190 --> 01:01:17.200 align:start position:0%
yes mark just really quick mr chairman
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
and i
 
01:01:20.789 --> 01:01:20.799 align:start position:0%
representative i really appreciate the
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
the test quality of a sunset
 
01:01:27.030 --> 01:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
but i'd have to say that any time we
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
hear sunset in the regulatory world
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't come to fruition after the
 
01:01:32.079 --> 01:01:33.270 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't come to fruition after the
sunset

01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
sunset
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
it is for a lack of a better term a
 
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
horror show to get them back into
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
compliance so i just would like
 
01:01:41.190 --> 01:01:41.200 align:start position:0%
everybody to think about that when we
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
think sunsets that's all i i like the
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
idea though but it it does create some
 
01:01:46.559 --> 01:01:49.670 align:start position:0%
idea though but it it does create some
dynamics

01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay are we all set
 
01:01:54.309 --> 01:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
oh representative herbert's got a quick
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
question right yes
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
840 for a liquor license
 
01:02:03.029 --> 01:02:03.039 align:start position:0%
did i hear correctly 840 for the
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
cigar bar
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
a liquor license correct
 
01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.309 align:start position:0%
a liquor license correct
so

01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
there are selling booths is there any
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
restriction on
 
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:18.079 align:start position:0%
well right now it's this 60 of the
 
01:02:20.150 --> 01:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
quarterly gross revenue has to come from
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
the cigars or scar related products so
 
01:02:26.789 --> 01:02:26.799 align:start position:0%
so chris offline i'll explain to you
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
why why people would actually want to do
 
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:30.789 align:start position:0%
why why people would actually want to do
that

01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:30.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:30.799 --> 01:02:31.750 align:start position:0%
that
so

01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.430 align:start position:0%
so
okay

01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:35.029 --> 01:02:35.039 align:start position:0%
so the subcommittee the subcommittee
 
01:02:36.549 --> 01:02:36.559 align:start position:0%
will be at 10 30
 
01:02:39.829 --> 01:02:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we'll have an amendment
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
drawn up
 
01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:45.599 align:start position:0%
all right great
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
believe in me they will be involved in
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
drawing up the amendment
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.430 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
start working on it now aiden if you're
 
01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.950 align:start position:0%
start working on it now aiden if you're
online

01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.430 --> 01:03:11.440 align:start position:0%
so okay just to be clear so that will be
 
01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
in a minute but you'll take care of it
 
01:03:14.390 --> 01:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to yes we'll take care of
 
01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:15.589 align:start position:0%
we're going to yes we'll take care of
yes

01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
unlike some other committees when we own
 
01:03:19.829 --> 01:03:19.839 align:start position:0%
a bill we own the amendment too
 
01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
when we on the bill we own the amendment
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
right yeah and i understand we would
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
never rely on the sponsor to have to
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
produce that all right thank you very
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
much i'm not sure whether i can be here
 
01:03:29.589 --> 01:03:29.599 align:start position:0%
next week but i'll try to and i'll
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
certainly inform my constitution of what
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
went on what's going on that's right
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for your time
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
mr chairman members of the committee all
 
01:03:41.589 --> 01:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
of course eliminating the enforcement
 
01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:47.430 align:start position:0%
of course eliminating the enforcement
division

01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:48.710 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:51.510 --> 01:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
peter you want to come home
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:21.670 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:04:25.670 --> 01:04:25.680 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman i have
 
01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative griffin here also should
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
you need his expertise and i
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
someone was kind enough to forward to me
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
the minutes of the discussion last week
 
01:04:36.319 --> 01:04:37.109 align:start position:0%
the minutes of the discussion last week
and

01:04:37.109 --> 01:04:37.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
i've never seen such good minutes so i'm
 
01:04:41.109 --> 01:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
not sure
 
01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
he's the man yeah unbelievable it's uh
 
01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
precise but
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
i had to say that i guess to start out
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm here to i guess answer any
 
01:04:51.190 --> 01:04:51.200 align:start position:0%
further i would say finance would have
 
01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
very good minutes
 
01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
well i clerked for one of the divisions
 
01:04:59.170 --> 01:04:59.180 align:start position:0%
for three terms i've never seen um
 
01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:05.829 align:start position:0%
for three terms i've never seen um
[Laughter]

01:05:05.829 --> 01:05:05.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
nothing like that
 
01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
anyway at any rate
 
01:05:12.230 --> 01:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
so i certainly answer any questions well
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking we should just interim
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
study this bill are you how do you feel
 
01:05:18.150 --> 01:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
about that i'm good with that it there's
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of issues i think
 
01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.230 align:start position:0%
an awful lot of issues i think
um

01:05:22.230 --> 01:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:23.990 --> 01:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
probably more than we could
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
discuss today
 
01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
as i said in my testimony last week
 
01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
there are a number of us that feel that

03:11:28.469 --> 03:11:28.479 align:start position:0%
is going to be the big bear
 
03:11:28.479 --> 03:11:30.229 align:start position:0%
is going to be the big bear
um

03:11:30.229 --> 03:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:30.239 --> 03:11:30.950 align:start position:0%
um
the

03:11:30.950 --> 03:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:11:35.030 --> 03:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
status of it is right now um we have the
 
03:11:35.040 --> 03:11:37.110 align:start position:0%
status of it is right now um we have the
uniform

03:11:37.110 --> 03:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
uniform
 
03:11:37.120 --> 03:11:39.030 align:start position:0%
uniform
law

03:11:39.030 --> 03:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:11:40.469 --> 03:11:40.479 align:start position:0%
commissions that was
 
03:11:42.150 --> 03:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
with the ucl
 
03:11:45.830 --> 03:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
foundation the uniform law
 
03:11:48.469 --> 03:11:48.479 align:start position:0%
foundation council something like that
 
03:11:52.550 --> 03:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
they uh have their uh rendition um it
 
03:11:55.510 --> 03:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
isn't technically hasn't been
 
03:11:57.750 --> 03:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
the uh official
 
03:12:01.110 --> 03:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
uh put to bed sleep one uh version
 
03:12:02.950 --> 03:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
but that they have given us permission
 
03:12:05.750 --> 03:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
to go forward with it
 
03:12:08.150 --> 03:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
so this is uh so just to remind
 
03:12:10.950 --> 03:12:10.960 align:start position:0%
everybody what ucc is
 
03:12:13.750 --> 03:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
so most of us are somewhat aware of ucc
 
03:12:15.910 --> 03:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
when we uh
 
03:12:17.670 --> 03:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
with car loan
 
03:12:20.790 --> 03:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
documented you sign
 
03:12:23.590 --> 03:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
and uh but the ucc if you were to look
 
03:12:27.670 --> 03:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
over in our statutes is a big huge
 
03:12:29.990 --> 03:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
section of the law
 
03:12:32.870 --> 03:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
they are hundreds of pages long
 
03:12:35.510 --> 03:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
and the goal of it was that instead of
 
03:12:37.990 --> 03:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
having one federal law have a federal
 
03:12:38.000 --> 03:12:38.790 align:start position:0%
having one federal law have a federal
law

03:12:38.790 --> 03:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:12:41.030 --> 03:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
that each state would do the laying of
 
03:12:43.349 --> 03:12:43.359 align:start position:0%
the hands and pass
 
03:12:46.870 --> 03:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
a uniform law so that it's true uniform
 
03:12:49.269 --> 03:12:49.279 align:start position:0%
among all 50 states and they usually
 
03:12:51.190 --> 03:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
give you a couple year window
 
03:12:53.510 --> 03:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
to try to get them enacted
 
03:12:56.550 --> 03:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
and uh but that one of the goals of the
 
03:12:59.269 --> 03:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
uniform is that it's consistent
 
03:13:02.229 --> 03:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
from state to state
 
03:13:04.630 --> 03:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
in this case uh
 
03:13:07.349 --> 03:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
the it affects really two divisions we
 
03:13:09.429 --> 03:13:09.439 align:start position:0%
have banking and securities
 
03:13:13.429 --> 03:13:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of the effects
 
03:13:15.910 --> 03:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
so what we have done so far
 
03:13:17.990 --> 03:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of working on amendments
 
03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:20.469 align:start position:0%
in terms of working on amendments
um

03:13:20.469 --> 03:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:20.479 --> 03:13:21.750 align:start position:0%
 
we've

03:13:21.750 --> 03:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
we've
 
03:13:24.150 --> 03:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
the concept is that the
 
03:13:24.160 --> 03:13:25.269 align:start position:0%
the concept is that the
um

03:13:25.269 --> 03:13:25.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:28.309 --> 03:13:28.319 align:start position:0%
the language in
 
03:13:31.110 --> 03:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh which one had the banking language
 
03:13:34.150 --> 03:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
1502 right so so so we're just going to
 
03:13:36.630 --> 03:13:36.640 align:start position:0%
take out uh
 
03:13:38.870 --> 03:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
the entire 1502
 
03:13:40.550 --> 03:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
and replace it
 
03:13:43.110 --> 03:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
with this ucc statute
 
03:13:43.120 --> 03:13:43.910 align:start position:0%
with this ucc statute
um

03:13:43.910 --> 03:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:46.309 --> 03:13:46.319 align:start position:0%
legislative services is totally freaked
 
03:13:46.319 --> 03:13:47.110 align:start position:0%
legislative services is totally freaked
out

03:13:47.110 --> 03:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:13:47.120 --> 03:13:48.389 align:start position:0%
out
and

03:13:48.389 --> 03:13:48.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:13:50.469 --> 03:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
i just had a
 
03:13:52.630 --> 03:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh interesting conversation with him and
 
03:13:54.790 --> 03:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
i will i'm gonna go to the speaker and
 
03:13:56.870 --> 03:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
ask him to see if we least
 
03:13:59.349 --> 03:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
did not have this as an early bill if we
 
03:14:02.070 --> 03:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
can change the getting delayed this
 
03:14:04.070 --> 03:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
getting this bill out of the committee
 
03:14:06.469 --> 03:14:06.479 align:start position:0%
otherwise what we'll end up doing is we
 
03:14:09.750 --> 03:14:09.760 align:start position:0%
will stick in it any parts where
 
03:14:11.349 --> 03:14:11.359 align:start position:0%
they're a little unsure
 
03:14:13.030 --> 03:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to say
 
03:14:13.040 --> 03:14:13.750 align:start position:0%
we're going to say
the

03:14:13.750 --> 03:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:14:15.670 --> 03:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
expectation is the banking department
 
03:14:17.590 --> 03:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
and the securities divisions would come
 
03:14:19.910 --> 03:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
back for answers for those for next
 
03:14:21.750 --> 03:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
legislative session
 
03:14:23.590 --> 03:14:23.600 align:start position:0%
so which is awkward and not something
 
03:14:25.190 --> 03:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
i'm too crazy about yes representative
 
03:14:25.200 --> 03:14:26.229 align:start position:0%
i'm too crazy about yes representative
bartlett

03:14:26.229 --> 03:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
bartlett
 
03:14:30.950 --> 03:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry to be dense um so 1502
 
03:14:32.630 --> 03:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to put aside
 
03:14:34.870 --> 03:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
so well at this moment we can't we don't
 
03:14:37.510 --> 03:14:37.520 align:start position:0%
have the amendment drawn up but 1502 the
 
03:14:41.670 --> 03:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
initial intent of 1502 was to create a
 
03:14:43.349 --> 03:14:43.359 align:start position:0%
new division within the banking
 
03:14:43.359 --> 03:14:45.830 align:start position:0%
new division within the banking
department

03:14:45.830 --> 03:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:14:47.429 --> 03:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
and i think that was generally agreed by
 
03:14:49.830 --> 03:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
everybody a crazy uh you know excuse me
 
03:14:54.790 --> 03:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:56.389 --> 03:14:56.399 align:start position:0%
i could be wrong i don't mean to correct
 
03:14:58.150 --> 03:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
the chair i think 1504 would have
 
03:15:00.070 --> 03:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
definitely required a new banking uh
 
03:15:01.269 --> 03:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
department a new department in the
 
03:15:03.670 --> 03:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
banking that was that was a special
 
03:15:05.830 --> 03:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
but the 1502 had to do with existing
 
03:15:07.910 --> 03:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
banks and so forth right is that right
 
03:15:11.510 --> 03:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay okay still confused
 
03:15:15.190 --> 03:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
so 1502 we don't have an amendment for
 
03:15:17.110 --> 03:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
it yet is that correct correct we're
 
03:15:19.510 --> 03:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
expecting an amendment
 
03:15:22.630 --> 03:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
like i say is is um
 
03:15:24.550 --> 03:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
they're working on it
 
03:15:26.389 --> 03:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
but that to
 
03:15:28.550 --> 03:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
do an amendment uh you know they're
 
03:15:30.389 --> 03:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
they're freaking out because it's a
 
03:15:33.429 --> 03:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
hundred pages long it's 102 pages
 
03:15:34.790 --> 03:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
and there's a bunch of things in there
 
03:15:37.670 --> 03:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:41.830 --> 03:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
fitted in to conform to current statute
 
03:15:46.150 --> 03:15:46.160 align:start position:0%
so that that is somewhat problematic
 
03:15:48.070 --> 03:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
because they're not necessarily sure
 
03:15:49.429 --> 03:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
where it would fit and they would have
 
03:15:49.439 --> 03:15:50.309 align:start position:0%
where it would fit and they would have
to

03:15:50.309 --> 03:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:15:53.429 --> 03:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
work with banking and securities to make
 
03:15:56.229 --> 03:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
sure those things fit to whatever is in
 
03:15:58.229 --> 03:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
the current stack okay so that's 1502 so
 
03:15:59.190 --> 03:15:59.200 align:start position:0%
we're not going to deal with that right
 
03:16:00.790 --> 03:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
now so this at this moment i just want
 
03:16:03.990 --> 03:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
everybody to be be forewarned that a is
 
03:16:05.910 --> 03:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
that we do have a we're working on an
 
03:16:07.670 --> 03:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
amendment for it
 
03:16:11.429 --> 03:16:11.439 align:start position:0%
and it will uh affect the ucc section of
 
03:16:14.469 --> 03:16:14.479 align:start position:0%
the law it's a new chapter 12 i think is
 
03:16:17.910 --> 03:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
12 12 of the ucc statute
 
03:16:19.830 --> 03:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:16:22.550 --> 03:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
but that that we're i'm going to ask the
 
03:16:24.150 --> 03:16:24.160 align:start position:0%
speaker to wait
 
03:16:26.790 --> 03:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
have waived the fact that it needs to go
 
03:16:28.389 --> 03:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
to a second committee
 
03:16:31.190 --> 03:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
because we would be taking out of it of
 
03:16:32.550 --> 03:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
the reason that it was supposed to
 
03:16:35.110 --> 03:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
create a second committee which was to
 
03:16:35.120 --> 03:16:36.710 align:start position:0%
create a second committee which was to
um

03:16:36.710 --> 03:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:38.950 --> 03:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
well because i see the other one was uh
 
03:16:41.030 --> 03:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
relative to special purpose depository
 
03:16:41.040 --> 03:16:42.550 align:start position:0%
relative to special purpose depository
institutions

03:16:42.550 --> 03:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
03:16:44.550 --> 03:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
1504 was that the one that created a new
 
03:16:44.560 --> 03:16:46.310 align:start position:0%
1504 was that the one that created a new
division

03:16:46.310 --> 03:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
division
 
03:16:46.320 --> 03:16:47.910 align:start position:0%
division
[Music]

03:16:47.910 --> 03:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:16:49.510 --> 03:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's fine well you might
 
03:16:51.030 --> 03:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
want to go to the microphone because
 
03:16:53.510 --> 03:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay so people people at home can hear
 
03:16:54.870 --> 03:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
you so this is
 
03:16:59.429 --> 03:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:59.439 --> 03:17:00.150 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:17:00.150 --> 03:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:17:02.469 --> 03:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
um this you're asking the speaker to
 
03:17:04.550 --> 03:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
waive a second committee request
 
03:17:06.309 --> 03:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
because you're removing the need to what
 
03:17:08.469 --> 03:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
and out of 1500
 
03:17:10.830 --> 03:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
make sure i get it right so what was in
 
03:17:15.190 --> 03:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
1502 okay 1502 was amending the ucc
 
03:17:17.830 --> 03:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
50 it worked i believe i don't want to
 
03:17:19.429 --> 03:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
put words
 
03:17:21.429 --> 03:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
but i believe the intent was the 1502
 
03:17:23.349 --> 03:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
and 1504 were kind of
 
03:17:25.429 --> 03:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
to go together
 
03:17:28.150 --> 03:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
so we did one fiscal note
 
03:17:32.229 --> 03:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
that was identical for 1502 and 1504.
 
03:17:35.830 --> 03:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
and if you amend it to have the ucc it
 
03:17:35.840 --> 03:17:36.550 align:start position:0%
and if you amend it to have the ucc it
will

03:17:36.550 --> 03:17:36.560 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:17:38.870 --> 03:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
i think remove the fiscal note
 
03:17:42.150 --> 03:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
correct because it would be and and in
 
03:17:43.670 --> 03:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
let alone the fact that that the real
 
03:17:46.630 --> 03:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal politic the 1504
 
03:17:49.030 --> 03:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
but that we will we do want to kill that
 
03:17:50.309 --> 03:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
okay so we're going to keep working on
 
03:17:55.349 --> 03:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:56.790 --> 03:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
representative herbert
 
03:17:59.429 --> 03:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
um ucc
 
03:18:02.229 --> 03:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
uniform commercial code is is that a
 
03:18:03.910 --> 03:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
03:18:06.229 --> 03:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
no that's the whole point
 
03:18:10.309 --> 03:18:10.319 align:start position:0%
it's a ucc uh is uh it there's the
 
03:18:13.030 --> 03:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
uniform commercial foundation
 
03:18:14.870 --> 03:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
what's the uc
 
03:18:14.880 --> 03:18:16.469 align:start position:0%
what's the uc
fl

03:18:16.469 --> 03:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
fl
 
03:18:18.469 --> 03:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
law commission that's right uniform law
 
03:18:18.479 --> 03:18:20.469 align:start position:0%
law commission that's right uniform law
commission

03:18:20.469 --> 03:18:20.479 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:18:22.630 --> 03:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
which is uh in this case this document i
 
03:18:24.710 --> 03:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
see 25 lawyers and
 
03:18:26.150 --> 03:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
and we actually have one person in new
 
03:18:26.160 --> 03:18:28.070 align:start position:0%
and we actually have one person in new
hampshire

03:18:28.070 --> 03:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:18:30.389 --> 03:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
which i don't see him here
 
03:18:32.229 --> 03:18:32.239 align:start position:0%
again he's m.i.a
 
03:18:35.510 --> 03:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
and uh but anyway so if uh what this is
 
03:18:35.520 --> 03:18:36.469 align:start position:0%
and uh but anyway so if uh what this is
is

03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:18:39.510 --> 03:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
that they didn't fat pass any federal
 
03:18:41.429 --> 03:18:41.439 align:start position:0%
laws and this is uh so this is your
 
03:18:43.429 --> 03:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
in-state law right
 
03:18:45.910 --> 03:18:45.920 align:start position:0%
and if you were to go look at our rsas
 
03:18:48.229 --> 03:18:48.239 align:start position:0%
you'll see it says ucc on it
 
03:18:51.110 --> 03:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
and there's uh one through
 
03:18:53.590 --> 03:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
eight right now i guess there's
 
03:18:55.190 --> 03:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
something like
 
03:18:57.670 --> 03:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
nine was there wasn't a nine okay
 
03:18:59.910 --> 03:18:59.920 align:start position:0%
there is a nine and i would say over the
 
03:19:01.349 --> 03:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
years chris
 
03:19:03.590 --> 03:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
um it would randomly they they would
 
03:19:05.670 --> 03:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
they would rewrite this the code
 
03:19:08.309 --> 03:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes yeah so i would say in my in
 
03:19:10.950 --> 03:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
my 30 years i think i've seen it twice
 
03:19:12.550 --> 03:19:12.560 align:start position:0%
maybe three times where they kind of
 
03:19:14.550 --> 03:19:14.560 align:start position:0%
rewrote the statute
 
03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
and i would always back then tara
 
03:19:18.070 --> 03:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
reardon was on the committee and she was
 
03:19:19.750 --> 03:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
our only lawyer so i'd always make tara
 
03:19:22.070 --> 03:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
read it
 
03:19:25.110 --> 03:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
but the idea of it is that it's a it's
 
03:19:28.070 --> 03:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
truly a model legislation model and then
 
03:19:30.469 --> 03:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
each state passes this model
 
03:19:34.309 --> 03:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
so the ul law the uniform law commission
 
03:19:37.190 --> 03:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
law commission works on the ucc is that
 
03:19:41.750 --> 03:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:43.269 --> 03:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
yes represent west
 
03:19:43.279 --> 03:19:45.030 align:start position:0%
yes represent west
yeah

03:19:45.030 --> 03:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:19:46.630 --> 03:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
i thought i read somewhere that they
 
03:19:48.630 --> 03:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
were actually setting up a whole new
 
03:19:51.030 --> 03:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
article to deal with uh
 
03:19:53.030 --> 03:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
they are cryptocurrency so when will
 
03:19:55.110 --> 03:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
that be coming out we're we're going to
 
03:19:57.030 --> 03:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
be we're hoping to be the very first
 
03:19:59.030 --> 03:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
state to pass it so you don't know you
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
don't have a timeline on it we have a
 
03:20:04.710 --> 03:20:04.720 align:start position:0%
model they have what uh i guess it's
 
03:20:04.720 --> 03:20:05.670 align:start position:0%
model they have what uh i guess it's
their

03:20:05.670 --> 03:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:20:07.670 --> 03:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
i don't know it's not their final
 
03:20:10.389 --> 03:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
edition but it's their their uh
 
03:20:10.399 --> 03:20:12.150 align:start position:0%
edition but it's their their uh
preliminary

03:20:12.150 --> 03:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
preliminary
 
03:20:12.160 --> 03:20:12.950 align:start position:0%
preliminary
one

03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:20:14.870 --> 03:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's been out for over a year right
 
03:20:16.309 --> 03:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
it's it's actually been around almost
 
03:20:17.750 --> 03:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
close to two years it's been floating
 
03:20:17.760 --> 03:20:18.870 align:start position:0%
close to two years it's been floating
around

03:20:18.870 --> 03:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
around
 
03:20:20.229 --> 03:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
and they've been waiting getting
 
03:20:22.870 --> 03:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
comments from anybody who cares
 
03:20:25.349 --> 03:20:25.359 align:start position:0%
and uh but that they're they're they're
 
03:20:28.469 --> 03:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
very right to actually release it so you
 
03:20:30.710 --> 03:20:30.720 align:start position:0%
when we see this amendment this hundred
 
03:20:33.429 --> 03:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
page amendment is that going to be
 
03:20:35.910 --> 03:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
the new part of the ucc that will be the
 
03:20:38.150 --> 03:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
new part section 12 correct okay thank
 
03:20:38.160 --> 03:20:39.750 align:start position:0%
new part section 12 correct okay thank
you

03:20:39.750 --> 03:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:20:42.790 --> 03:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
yes representative yes um
 
03:20:46.469 --> 03:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
the three bills closely related if for
 
03:20:49.110 --> 03:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
some reason we're unable to address one
 
03:20:51.910 --> 03:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:54.950 --> 03:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
does that mean that the other two
 
03:20:56.870 --> 03:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
that they can each be they can each be
 
03:20:59.190 --> 03:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
handled separately well the key element
 
03:21:01.269 --> 03:21:01.279 align:start position:0%
was that the one that was problematic
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
was 1504
 
03:21:03.120 --> 03:21:04.630 align:start position:0%
was 1504
okay

03:21:04.630 --> 03:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:21:06.309 --> 03:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
okay because that one's create a new
 
03:21:07.910 --> 03:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
division in the banking department and
 
03:21:10.469 --> 03:21:10.479 align:start position:0%
that's the one that generated the awful
 
03:21:13.670 --> 03:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
you know fiscal note and
 
03:21:15.590 --> 03:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
so what for all intents and purposes we
 
03:21:17.750 --> 03:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
will at some point in time entertain a
 
03:21:20.389 --> 03:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
motion to kill 1504
 
03:21:24.790 --> 03:21:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:28.950 --> 03:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
1504 so 1504 is not what we want 1502
 
03:21:31.990 --> 03:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
um and 1503 is what we're working on and
 
03:21:34.710 --> 03:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
we have an amendment for 1503 in your
 
03:21:36.389 --> 03:21:36.399 align:start position:0%
pause right now
 
03:21:39.190 --> 03:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative herbert so if i'm my
 
03:21:40.870 --> 03:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is correct
 
03:21:40.880 --> 03:21:43.190 align:start position:0%
understanding is correct
ucc

03:21:43.190 --> 03:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
ucc
 
03:21:43.200 --> 03:21:46.389 align:start position:0%
ucc
um

03:21:46.389 --> 03:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:49.750 --> 03:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
is is is not a federal law but
 
03:21:50.710 --> 03:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
it is
 
03:21:55.190 --> 03:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
a law code that has been adopted
 
03:21:55.200 --> 03:21:56.950 align:start position:0%
a law code that has been adopted
uniformly

03:21:56.950 --> 03:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
uniformly
 
03:21:59.190 --> 03:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
by all 50 states by all 50 states
 
03:21:59.200 --> 03:22:00.070 align:start position:0%
by all 50 states by all 50 states
correct

03:22:00.070 --> 03:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:22:01.590 --> 03:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
so this
 
03:22:01.600 --> 03:22:03.429 align:start position:0%
so this
document

03:22:03.429 --> 03:22:03.439 align:start position:0%
document
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
your this amendment that you're
 
03:22:07.510 --> 03:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
talking about right now
 
03:22:11.429 --> 03:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
is uh an amendment to that ucc code that
 
03:22:14.070 --> 03:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
affects all 50 states
 
03:22:16.309 --> 03:22:16.319 align:start position:0%
it doesn't affect all 50 states and only
 
03:22:18.830 --> 03:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
affects new hampshire because we have no
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
control though
 
03:22:20.880 --> 03:22:21.510 align:start position:0%
control though
so

03:22:21.510 --> 03:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:22:23.830 --> 03:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
the language what we're adopting is the
 
03:22:25.590 --> 03:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
one that they are going to propose for
 
03:22:27.910 --> 03:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
all 50 states
 
03:22:30.229 --> 03:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
the uniform
 
03:22:30.239 --> 03:22:31.429 align:start position:0%
the uniform
law

03:22:31.429 --> 03:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:22:31.439 --> 03:22:32.550 align:start position:0%
law
commission

03:22:32.550 --> 03:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:22:35.269 --> 03:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
so is the uniform lock i'm sorry
 
03:22:35.279 --> 03:22:36.150 align:start position:0%
so is the uniform lock i'm sorry
further

03:22:36.150 --> 03:22:36.160 align:start position:0%
further
 
03:22:38.070 --> 03:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm just this is the subcommittee
 
03:22:39.349 --> 03:22:39.359 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't have all of our
 
03:22:40.950 --> 03:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
commission is
 
03:22:45.190 --> 03:22:45.200 align:start position:0%
an adjunct to the ucc
 
03:22:51.240 --> 03:22:51.250 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:51.250 --> 03:22:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

03:22:55.510 --> 03:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:57.990 --> 03:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
so the uniform law commission proposes
 
03:23:00.070 --> 03:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
articles of the ucc it kind of comes out
 
03:23:02.630 --> 03:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
in chapters right there's like one two
 
03:23:05.030 --> 03:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
three four to nine right now i believe
 
03:23:07.110 --> 03:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
right nine nine that is the right number
 
03:23:10.550 --> 03:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
um and um states get to adopt two can
 
03:23:12.309 --> 03:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
choose the legislature can choose to
 
03:23:14.950 --> 03:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
adopt them or not or not um and i
 
03:23:17.190 --> 03:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
believe all 50 states
 
03:23:19.670 --> 03:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
have adopted one through nine
 
03:23:19.680 --> 03:23:20.550 align:start position:0%
have adopted one through nine
yes

03:23:20.550 --> 03:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:23:20.560 --> 03:23:21.349 align:start position:0%
yes
um

03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:23:22.870 --> 03:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
and we're not sure what happened to
 
03:23:24.630 --> 03:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
articles 10 and 11. i don't i'm not a
 
03:23:27.750 --> 03:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
ucc expert so we don't know
 
03:23:32.070 --> 03:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:34.309 --> 03:23:34.319 align:start position:0%
and so then um now they're proposing
 
03:23:37.429 --> 03:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
article 12 to deal with um
 
03:23:39.030 --> 03:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
oh gosh and i'm going to forget the term
 
03:23:40.309 --> 03:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
for it but they have a technical term
 
03:23:42.830 --> 03:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
that basically blockchain
 
03:23:46.550 --> 03:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
yeah and how um you can
 
03:23:49.590 --> 03:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
treat it like a um commercial instrument
 
03:23:49.600 --> 03:23:50.710 align:start position:0%
treat it like a um commercial instrument
basically

03:23:50.710 --> 03:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
basically
 
03:23:52.710 --> 03:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
um and so they've now proposed they're
 
03:23:54.630 --> 03:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
drafting article 12 they've given us
 
03:23:54.640 --> 03:23:55.830 align:start position:0%
drafting article 12 they've given us
permission

03:23:55.830 --> 03:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
permission
 
03:23:57.190 --> 03:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
to to
 
03:23:58.790 --> 03:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire permission to
 
03:24:01.830 --> 03:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
adopt adopt it if you guys so choose
 
03:24:03.750 --> 03:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
so one further question just so i get
 
03:24:05.670 --> 03:24:05.680 align:start position:0%
this straight one through nine has
 
03:24:10.229 --> 03:24:10.239 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with uh crypto well so
 
03:24:11.349 --> 03:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:24:14.309 --> 03:24:14.319 align:start position:0%
article nine has i i'm really not the
 
03:24:15.910 --> 03:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
person to ask about this but parts of
 
03:24:17.429 --> 03:24:17.439 align:start position:0%
article 12
 
03:24:19.750 --> 03:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
parts of the proposal do affect the
 
03:24:21.190 --> 03:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
other articles a little bit because
 
03:24:23.030 --> 03:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
there is some overlap particularly i
 
03:24:24.630 --> 03:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
think with article nine
 
03:24:26.229 --> 03:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
um but that's kind of the end of my
 
03:24:28.150 --> 03:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
expertise on this right and that and
 
03:24:29.750 --> 03:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
that's actually the biggest difficulty
 
03:24:31.429 --> 03:24:31.439 align:start position:0%
we're having right at the moment is
 
03:24:33.429 --> 03:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
because there is some overlap
 
03:24:35.990 --> 03:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
interlapping between
 
03:24:39.429 --> 03:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
is this issue of uh
 
03:24:41.030 --> 03:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
a a
 
03:24:43.670 --> 03:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
proposal to amend
 
03:24:46.950 --> 03:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
a problem just in new hampshire or is it
 
03:24:48.229 --> 03:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
elsewhere as
 
03:24:49.510 --> 03:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
well well this is a problem for us
 
03:24:51.349 --> 03:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
because we have a bill in front of us
 
03:24:53.670 --> 03:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
so most all the other states are are
 
03:24:56.710 --> 03:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
sitting there on their hands waiting
 
03:24:59.670 --> 03:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
for the final approval
 
03:25:01.429 --> 03:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
of article 12.
 
03:25:03.190 --> 03:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
but we're not waiting we're moving full
 
03:25:05.990 --> 03:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:08.229 --> 03:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
now you really got me confused so we got
 
03:25:10.710 --> 03:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
we have 50 states of the other 49 states
 
03:25:13.670 --> 03:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
done on this already uh we texas didn't
 
03:25:16.309 --> 03:25:16.319 align:start position:0%
texas pass something didn't i hear texas
 
03:25:18.070 --> 03:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
pass something no no
 
03:25:19.830 --> 03:25:19.840 align:start position:0%
no okay so
 
03:25:21.910 --> 03:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
wait okay so i didn't get texas did pass
 
03:25:23.510 --> 03:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
something right they
 
03:25:25.510 --> 03:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
but they were they they would do 12
 
03:25:27.269 --> 03:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
light they didn't really
 
03:25:28.630 --> 03:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
they didn't really take the language of
 
03:25:35.429 --> 03:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:35.439 --> 03:25:36.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:25:36.630 --> 03:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:25:39.190 --> 03:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
yes from our understanding they they
 
03:25:41.429 --> 03:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
kind of whittled it down and kept it to
 
03:25:43.349 --> 03:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
not not emerging technologies but
 
03:25:45.670 --> 03:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
digital currency where i think what
 
03:25:47.670 --> 03:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're what you're doing bitcoin talking
 
03:25:50.469 --> 03:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
today about is the full adoption right
 
03:25:53.349 --> 03:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
the ucc and we do have uh we just
 
03:25:56.070 --> 03:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
received this from um our our national
 
03:25:58.710 --> 03:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
trade organization uh uh a powerpoint
 
03:25:58.720 --> 03:25:59.670 align:start position:0%
trade organization uh uh a powerpoint
about

03:25:59.670 --> 03:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:26:04.389 --> 03:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
the ucc and what the work of the ulc
 
03:26:06.229 --> 03:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
well the best thing to do is make sure
 
03:26:07.510 --> 03:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
that that's emailed to all the committee
 
03:26:09.510 --> 03:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
members i could do that for sure yeah
 
03:26:10.870 --> 03:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
that would that would probably work
 
03:26:10.880 --> 03:26:11.990 align:start position:0%
that would that would probably work
better

03:26:11.990 --> 03:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
better
 
03:26:13.830 --> 03:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
because that we don't want to or that
 
03:26:15.269 --> 03:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
color print that might you know the
 
03:26:16.830 --> 03:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
printer might
 
03:26:22.389 --> 03:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:22.399 --> 03:26:23.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:26:23.349 --> 03:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:26:24.630 --> 03:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know whose right hand it was at
 
03:26:26.229 --> 03:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
first um
 
03:26:26.239 --> 03:26:27.030 align:start position:0%
first um
just

03:26:27.030 --> 03:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:26:28.710 --> 03:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
one one thing rather than having that
 
03:26:28.720 --> 03:26:30.229 align:start position:0%
one one thing rather than having that
powerpoint

03:26:30.229 --> 03:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
powerpoint
 
03:26:32.229 --> 03:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
pointed to us or sent to us can we get
 
03:26:33.990 --> 03:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
it today so we can look at it and
 
03:26:36.630 --> 03:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
discuss it number one number two
 
03:26:39.469 --> 03:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
my understanding is we're getting rid of
 
03:26:42.710 --> 03:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
1504 and those attributes are going to
 
03:26:44.229 --> 03:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
go into
 
03:26:47.030 --> 03:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
1502 because those bills were very
 
03:26:50.389 --> 03:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
similar is that correct keith
 
03:26:54.630 --> 03:26:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:55.990 --> 03:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
there it goes
 
03:26:56.000 --> 03:26:57.030 align:start position:0%
there it goes
oh

03:26:57.030 --> 03:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:26:57.040 --> 03:26:59.030 align:start position:0%
oh
so

03:26:59.030 --> 03:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:27:00.389 --> 03:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
i think i understood your question or i
 
03:27:04.389 --> 03:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
think i retained it uh 1504 is going to
 
03:27:05.830 --> 03:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
basically go away for all intents and
 
03:27:09.110 --> 03:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
purposes that's a whole new uh charter
 
03:27:10.550 --> 03:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
concept for
 
03:27:11.830 --> 03:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
something called a special purpose
 
03:27:14.790 --> 03:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
depository institution
 
03:27:14.800 --> 03:27:16.469 align:start position:0%
depository institution
1502

03:27:16.469 --> 03:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
1502
 
03:27:18.150 --> 03:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
deals with our existing banking
 
03:27:18.160 --> 03:27:19.429 align:start position:0%
deals with our existing banking
structure

03:27:19.429 --> 03:27:19.439 align:start position:0%
structure
 
03:27:21.429 --> 03:27:21.439 align:start position:0%
so it's not something new the original
 
03:27:21.439 --> 03:27:22.630 align:start position:0%
so it's not something new the original
1502

03:27:22.630 --> 03:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
1502
 
03:27:23.910 --> 03:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about taking the
 
03:27:25.670 --> 03:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
original 1502
 
03:27:27.750 --> 03:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
getting ahead of the ucc changes that
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
are inevitably coming
 
03:27:32.150 --> 03:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
and being the first state to adopt it
 
03:27:34.070 --> 03:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
and i think everybody's on board with
 
03:27:35.670 --> 03:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
that concept
 
03:27:37.269 --> 03:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
so you know we're going to get out ahead
 
03:27:37.279 --> 03:27:39.030 align:start position:0%
so you know we're going to get out ahead
of

03:27:39.030 --> 03:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:27:40.870 --> 03:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
this change that is coming in the ucc
 
03:27:44.150 --> 03:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
code because the draft is pretty much
 
03:27:46.309 --> 03:27:46.319 align:start position:0%
finalized if there's any tweaks to be
 
03:27:47.990 --> 03:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
made that will happen when we adopt the
 
03:27:48.000 --> 03:27:49.349 align:start position:0%
made that will happen when we adopt the
whole

03:27:49.349 --> 03:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
whole
 
03:27:51.590 --> 03:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
new replacement of the ucc that will
 
03:27:53.750 --> 03:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
supersede this
 
03:27:55.429 --> 03:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding
 
03:27:57.990 --> 03:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
well i think my second thing was could
 
03:28:00.550 --> 03:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
we get that powerpoint now
 
03:28:02.070 --> 03:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
so that we could
 
03:28:03.830 --> 03:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
take a look at it and discuss it i mean
 
03:28:05.750 --> 03:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
you don't have to email it can they copy
 
03:28:05.760 --> 03:28:07.670 align:start position:0%
you don't have to email it can they copy
it

03:28:07.670 --> 03:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:28:10.870 --> 03:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:12.630 --> 03:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's feasible to get it
 
03:28:15.110 --> 03:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
right now all right
 
03:28:16.710 --> 03:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett
 
03:28:18.550 --> 03:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
um correct me if i'm wrong but
 
03:28:19.990 --> 03:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire for the most part doesn't
 
03:28:21.429 --> 03:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
like being first in the nation other
 
03:28:24.309 --> 03:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
than the primary in guns i mean why why
 
03:28:25.830 --> 03:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
do we want to be first in the nation on
 
03:28:25.840 --> 03:28:26.630 align:start position:0%
do we want to be first in the nation on
this

03:28:26.630 --> 03:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:28:28.550 --> 03:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
do we want to be last in the nation or
 
03:28:30.150 --> 03:28:30.160 align:start position:0%
well no i'm not saying i mean there's a
 
03:28:32.309 --> 03:28:32.319 align:start position:0%
difference between first out of 50
 
03:28:34.469 --> 03:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
states and and being last out of 50
 
03:28:34.479 --> 03:28:35.510 align:start position:0%
states and and being last out of 50
states

03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
states
 
03:28:35.520 --> 03:28:38.550 align:start position:0%
states
um

03:28:38.550 --> 03:28:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:40.229 --> 03:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
when it comes to innovation and in this
 
03:28:43.349 --> 03:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
case it's financial innovation the the
 
03:28:46.309 --> 03:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
the states that move first attract that
 
03:28:49.510 --> 03:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
industry that's the advantage if we're
 
03:28:52.070 --> 03:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
middle of the road or we're stragglers
 
03:28:53.990 --> 03:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
we will be picking up crumbs on this
 
03:28:56.710 --> 03:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
industry and it's it's a significant
 
03:28:58.870 --> 03:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh industry that's actually a global
 
03:29:00.790 --> 03:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
industry so that's the advantage it's
 
03:29:02.070 --> 03:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with innovation you
 
03:29:03.269 --> 03:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
want to be first
 
03:29:04.469 --> 03:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
you don't want to move fast and break
 
03:29:06.469 --> 03:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
things you want to be deliberate about
 
03:29:07.510 --> 03:29:07.520 align:start position:0%
it and i think
 
03:29:09.670 --> 03:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
this compromise with the ucc they've
 
03:29:12.150 --> 03:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
already deliberated on it um i've seen a
 
03:29:13.429 --> 03:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
draft that we could send that to the
 
03:29:16.150 --> 03:29:16.160 align:start position:0%
whole committee of the ucc
 
03:29:17.510 --> 03:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh proposal
 
03:29:20.309 --> 03:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
so they've deliberated on it for a year
 
03:29:22.469 --> 03:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
or two now um and so they've kind of
 
03:29:24.389 --> 03:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
done the work for us and we can we can
 
03:29:24.399 --> 03:29:25.269 align:start position:0%
done the work for us and we can we can
be

03:29:25.269 --> 03:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:29:27.670 --> 03:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
innovative by adopting that and attract
 
03:29:29.510 --> 03:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
that industry so this is completely
 
03:29:31.830 --> 03:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
different than the wyoming bill you were
 
03:29:34.950 --> 03:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
talking about last week is that correct
 
03:29:37.269 --> 03:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
i think the wyoming legislation most
 
03:29:40.070 --> 03:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
likely informed the ucc commission i can
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
i see there's there's a member at least
 
03:29:42.950 --> 03:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
one member from wyoming on the
 
03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
commission so
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say it's
 
03:29:46.080 --> 03:29:47.349 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't say it's
um

03:29:47.349 --> 03:29:47.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:48.870 --> 03:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
i think there's probably
 
03:29:50.630 --> 03:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
echoes of the wyoming bill that have
 
03:29:52.790 --> 03:29:52.800 align:start position:0%

the original bill we had concerns with
 
03:31:12.389 --> 03:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
um this is a replace hall the
 
03:31:13.910 --> 03:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative hunt and representative
 
03:31:16.309 --> 03:31:16.319 align:start position:0%
amman are talking about
 
03:31:16.319 --> 03:31:17.429 align:start position:0%
amman are talking about
um

03:31:17.429 --> 03:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:19.990 --> 03:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment so we are at this point we
 
03:31:21.910 --> 03:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
are okay with the changes are you going
 
03:31:23.349 --> 03:31:23.359 align:start position:0%
to send out a correcting one though
 
03:31:25.590 --> 03:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
because we've got this in our notes
 
03:31:28.229 --> 03:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
um if you could send out a correcting
 
03:31:30.070 --> 03:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh paper that would be helpful for us as
 
03:31:31.830 --> 03:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
we're reviewing all of this yeah we'd be
 
03:31:35.670 --> 03:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:35.680 --> 03:31:38.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:31:38.070 --> 03:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:41.590 --> 03:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
rich yeah go ahead yes thank you um
 
03:31:43.429 --> 03:31:43.439 align:start position:0%
since there are uh
 
03:31:46.469 --> 03:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes uh on the bills we're
 
03:31:46.479 --> 03:31:47.750 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes uh on the bills we're
considering

03:31:47.750 --> 03:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
considering
 
03:31:50.309 --> 03:31:50.319 align:start position:0%
do does our committee need to
 
03:31:52.550 --> 03:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
try to appropriate the money or would
 
03:31:55.190 --> 03:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
that go that would go when it goes on
 
03:31:56.150 --> 03:31:56.160 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why the bills are
 
03:31:58.870 --> 03:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
early yes some committees you know some
 
03:32:00.710 --> 03:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
they will they would put the you know
 
03:32:02.790 --> 03:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
the appropriation line item in that
 
03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
other ones they just wait till it gets
 
03:32:07.190 --> 03:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
to finance and let them do it
 
03:32:07.200 --> 03:32:08.550 align:start position:0%
to finance and let them do it
so

03:32:08.550 --> 03:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:32:09.590 --> 03:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be better at
 
03:32:12.790 --> 03:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
negotiating the price
 
03:32:15.510 --> 03:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
the compensation than we are but
 
03:32:17.590 --> 03:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
okay chris what do you got final uh
 
03:32:17.600 --> 03:32:20.550 align:start position:0%
okay chris what do you got final uh
request

03:32:20.550 --> 03:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:22.870 --> 03:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
first you were against it
 
03:32:24.790 --> 03:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
first you were against it now you're for
 
03:32:24.800 --> 03:32:25.510 align:start position:0%
first you were against it now you're for
it

03:32:25.510 --> 03:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:32:28.309 --> 03:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
i would like to at some point understand
 
03:32:30.950 --> 03:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
why you changed
 
03:32:32.950 --> 03:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
in some detail
 
03:32:35.349 --> 03:32:35.359 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
03:32:36.469 --> 03:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
actually you know what why don't you
 
03:32:38.469 --> 03:32:38.479 align:start position:0%
guys just take a seat over here
 
03:32:39.670 --> 03:32:39.680 align:start position:0%
and that way you don't have to move
 
03:32:39.680 --> 03:32:41.030 align:start position:0%
and that way you don't have to move
again

03:32:41.030 --> 03:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:32:41.040 --> 03:32:48.309 align:start position:0%
again
yeah

03:32:48.309 --> 03:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:50.389 --> 03:32:50.399 align:start position:0%
um so christy merrill new hampshire
 
03:32:52.630 --> 03:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
bankers association you are correct we
 
03:32:55.429 --> 03:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
originally opposed the legislation as it
 
03:32:56.469 --> 03:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
was written
 
03:32:58.630 --> 03:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
um this is really a very different
 
03:33:00.950 --> 03:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
approach i think is accomplishing what
 
03:33:02.950 --> 03:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
the sponsor is looking to do
 
03:33:05.590 --> 03:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
and so because of you know part of our
 
03:33:07.990 --> 03:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
opposition was because we supported the
 
03:33:10.550 --> 03:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
ucc framework and the and the
 
03:33:12.710 --> 03:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
the format of the uniform law commission
 
03:33:13.750 --> 03:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
which is
 
03:33:15.990 --> 03:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
to take a look and have it it's a vetted
 
03:33:19.190 --> 03:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
process that the states can adopt um
 
03:33:21.910 --> 03:33:21.920 align:start position:0%
article 12 that deals with these issues
 
03:33:23.590 --> 03:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
has gone through that
 
03:33:25.269 --> 03:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
and so for new hampshire to be an early
 
03:33:25.279 --> 03:33:26.469 align:start position:0%
and so for new hampshire to be an early
adopter

03:33:26.469 --> 03:33:26.479 align:start position:0%
adopter
 
03:33:28.389 --> 03:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
we feel like is a better approach than
 
03:33:30.229 --> 03:33:30.239 align:start position:0%
the underlying bill that was written so
 
03:33:31.830 --> 03:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
this is really a different
 
03:33:31.840 --> 03:33:32.950 align:start position:0%
this is really a different
approach

03:33:32.950 --> 03:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
approach
 
03:33:36.469 --> 03:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:38.630 --> 03:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you but we still haven't seen
 
03:33:39.910 --> 03:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment either
 
03:33:41.349 --> 03:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
you haven't told me why you changed your
 
03:33:41.359 --> 03:33:42.790 align:start position:0%
you haven't told me why you changed your
mind

03:33:42.790 --> 03:33:42.800 align:start position:0%
mind
 
03:33:44.550 --> 03:33:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's a better approach
 
03:33:46.389 --> 03:33:46.399 align:start position:0%
well and
 
03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
because it originally it was happening
 
03:33:51.590 --> 03:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
outside of the ucc and that was part of
 
03:33:53.830 --> 03:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
our concern is because
 
03:33:56.150 --> 03:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
the the laws that new hampshire has
 
03:33:58.550 --> 03:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
adopted is important to banks and how
 
03:34:00.630 --> 03:34:00.640 align:start position:0%
they do business across state lines so
 
03:34:02.550 --> 03:34:02.560 align:start position:0%
that's why we that's why we oppose the
 
03:34:02.560 --> 03:34:03.750 align:start position:0%
that's why we that's why we oppose the
bill

03:34:03.750 --> 03:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:34:07.190 --> 03:34:07.200 align:start position:0%
this is going through the ucc process
 
03:34:08.309 --> 03:34:08.319 align:start position:0%
to make
 
03:34:11.349 --> 03:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
changes so we believe that banks can
 
03:34:13.190 --> 03:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
continue to do business
 
03:34:15.030 --> 03:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
across state lines with those same
 
03:34:15.040 --> 03:34:16.389 align:start position:0%
across state lines with those same
certainties

03:34:16.389 --> 03:34:16.399 align:start position:0%
certainties
 
03:34:17.910 --> 03:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
that being said we have not seen the
 
03:34:20.309 --> 03:34:20.319 align:start position:0%
amendment but so far we are more
 
03:34:22.309 --> 03:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
comfortable with this approach
 
03:34:23.830 --> 03:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
further question
 
03:34:27.190 --> 03:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
further question the speedy uh
 
03:34:27.200 --> 03:34:28.710 align:start position:0%
further question the speedy uh
concept

03:34:28.710 --> 03:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
concept
 
03:34:30.309 --> 03:34:30.319 align:start position:0%
of a bank
 
03:34:33.269 --> 03:34:33.279 align:start position:0%
is relatively new from my understanding
 
03:34:35.590 --> 03:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
um that is house bill 1504 which is
 
03:34:37.190 --> 03:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
separate from this discussion they are
 
03:34:39.110 --> 03:34:39.120 align:start position:0%
related topics right but that is a
 
03:34:39.120 --> 03:34:40.070 align:start position:0%
related topics right but that is a
separate

03:34:40.070 --> 03:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
separate
 
03:34:43.429 --> 03:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
situation so is the speedy uh
 
03:34:45.110 --> 03:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
banking concept
 
03:34:47.429 --> 03:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
now enclosed in
 
03:34:49.429 --> 03:34:49.439 align:start position:0%
no we're going to kill speedy
 
03:34:51.830 --> 03:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
no after we kill speedy is it going to
 
03:34:55.590 --> 03:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
pop up could be 1702
 
03:34:57.030 --> 03:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative i don't know that i would
 
03:34:59.030 --> 03:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
characterize it as popping up i think
 
03:35:01.349 --> 03:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
some of the concepts that are addressed
 
03:35:04.630 --> 03:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
in article 12 are sort of foundational
 
03:35:06.790 --> 03:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
to working with crypto and bitcoin and
 
03:35:08.710 --> 03:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
working in this space and so i think
 
03:35:10.870 --> 03:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
some of those foundational topics are
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
addressed through
 
03:35:14.229 --> 03:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
article 12.
 
03:35:15.990 --> 03:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
as we said before we oppose a new
 
03:35:18.309 --> 03:35:18.319 align:start position:0%
creation of a new charter a new banking
 
03:35:21.269 --> 03:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
division we were opposed to that and so
 
03:35:23.349 --> 03:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
that conceivably if that legislation
 
03:35:25.190 --> 03:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
dies would go away
 
03:35:26.710 --> 03:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
but i think addresses some of the
 
03:35:28.950 --> 03:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
underlying fundamental issues
 
03:35:33.030 --> 03:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:36.710 --> 03:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to create a new division
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
we want every bank anybody who's you
 
03:35:42.710 --> 03:35:42.720 align:start position:0%

and that's had the outrageous fiscal
 
03:35:59.910 --> 03:35:59.920 align:start position:0%
note so that that's
 
03:36:03.670 --> 03:36:03.680 align:start position:0%

to
 
03:36:18.389 --> 03:36:18.399 align:start position:0%
to get through because it's um you know
 
03:36:19.670 --> 03:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
we're a bunch of volunteers you're the
 
03:36:23.110 --> 03:36:23.120 align:start position:0%
professionals so we need your guidance
 
03:36:25.510 --> 03:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
um and as well as the banking department
 
03:36:28.309 --> 03:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
certainly to help us with
 
03:36:30.150 --> 03:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know feeling comfortable
 
03:36:33.990 --> 03:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
um which is great thank you
 
03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:35.110 align:start position:0%
um which is great thank you
okay

03:36:35.110 --> 03:36:35.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:36:35.120 --> 03:36:36.790 align:start position:0%
okay
yes

03:36:36.790 --> 03:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:36:37.990 --> 03:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
i have a question about the amendment
 
03:36:40.229 --> 03:36:40.239 align:start position:0%
that's being drafted that's over 100 uh
 
03:36:41.830 --> 03:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
a 100 pages
 
03:36:44.710 --> 03:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
where is that information coming from
 
03:36:44.720 --> 03:36:45.990 align:start position:0%
where is that information coming from
and

03:36:45.990 --> 03:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:36:49.670 --> 03:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
do you know what is in the amendment
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
i have not read 112 pages of it um there
 
03:36:54.870 --> 03:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
have been some summaries provided that
 
03:36:56.070 --> 03:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
we've looked at including this
 
03:36:58.389 --> 03:36:58.399 align:start position:0%
powerpoint that then riot had you know
 
03:36:59.670 --> 03:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
sort of offered to share which i think
 
03:37:02.469 --> 03:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
would be helpful um the language is is a
 
03:37:05.110 --> 03:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
byproduct of the uniform law commission
 
03:37:06.790 --> 03:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
so that is where the language is coming
 
03:37:09.110 --> 03:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
from okay thanks we are not reinventing
 
03:37:11.429 --> 03:37:11.439 align:start position:0%
the wheel that's the whole point okay
 
03:37:13.510 --> 03:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
yeah amelia
 
03:37:15.590 --> 03:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
just everybody know this is our our bank
 
03:37:15.600 --> 03:37:17.429 align:start position:0%
just everybody know this is our our bank
commissioner

03:37:17.429 --> 03:37:17.439 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:37:19.920 --> 03:37:19.930 align:start position:0%
for the moment
 
03:37:19.930 --> 03:37:26.229 align:start position:0%
for the moment
[Laughter]

03:37:26.229 --> 03:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:28.229 --> 03:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
so i would also say just for the record
 
03:37:31.349 --> 03:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
that while the pdf that we gave to ols
 
03:37:34.150 --> 03:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
was 110 pages there was a lot of
 
03:37:36.870 --> 03:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
commentary in there um which will not
 
03:37:40.950 --> 03:37:40.960 align:start position:0%
become law and it's very explanatory and
 
03:37:43.830 --> 03:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
um you know to the extent you get an
 
03:37:45.110 --> 03:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that doesn't have that
 
03:37:46.870 --> 03:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
commentary and it may be helpful to go
 
03:37:48.469 --> 03:37:48.479 align:start position:0%
and look at the commentary because it
 
03:37:50.630 --> 03:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
may help answer some of the questions
 
03:37:52.710 --> 03:37:52.720 align:start position:0%
that that i'm hearing that's a good idea
 
03:37:55.510 --> 03:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
why why it's doing what it's doing um
 
03:37:57.030 --> 03:37:57.040 align:start position:0%
certainly better than me because i'm not
 
03:37:59.510 --> 03:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
the ucc expert um
 
03:38:01.910 --> 03:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
so i think that might that might help
 
03:38:03.510 --> 03:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
you answer some questions i'm happy to
 
03:38:05.830 --> 03:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
send that to whoever i think a number of
 
03:38:07.510 --> 03:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
you have it already but to the extent
 
03:38:08.950 --> 03:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
some that would help
 
03:38:10.309 --> 03:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that you know all of us
 
03:38:12.229 --> 03:38:12.239 align:start position:0%
would want to would want to see that and
 
03:38:12.239 --> 03:38:13.910 align:start position:0%
would want to would want to see that and
preferably

03:38:13.910 --> 03:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
preferably
 
03:38:15.510 --> 03:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
sent to us in hard copy so that we
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
aren't printing it off at home at 110
 
03:38:17.520 --> 03:38:19.269 align:start position:0%
aren't printing it off at home at 110
pages

03:38:19.269 --> 03:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
pages
 
03:38:24.830 --> 03:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:27.830 --> 03:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
um i i would think you would just read
 
03:38:30.389 --> 03:38:30.399 align:start position:0%
it online
 
03:38:32.469 --> 03:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
i mean do you really want to you really
 
03:38:33.990 --> 03:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
want to have
 
03:38:36.229 --> 03:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
staff here print all those pages and
 
03:38:37.189 --> 03:38:37.199 align:start position:0%
mail them out to everything
 
03:38:38.790 --> 03:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
old-fashioned when it comes to trying to
 
03:38:40.630 --> 03:38:40.640 align:start position:0%
read it all online
 
03:38:40.640 --> 03:38:41.750 align:start position:0%
read it all online
um

03:38:41.750 --> 03:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:44.389 --> 03:38:44.399 align:start position:0%
i i i i
 
03:38:46.309 --> 03:38:46.319 align:start position:0%
you you can ask i will give you
 
03:38:48.309 --> 03:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
permission to ask carrie to print print
 
03:38:49.830 --> 03:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
you want okay just individually that'd
 
03:38:50.790 --> 03:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
be fine
 
03:38:52.830 --> 03:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to send that out to
 
03:38:52.840 --> 03:38:54.469 align:start position:0%
but i don't want to send that out to
everybody

03:38:54.469 --> 03:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
03:38:56.150 --> 03:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
have you have you read the liquor the
 
03:39:00.469 --> 03:39:00.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:05.429 --> 03:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:09.269 --> 03:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
i am a fiscal conservative you know
 
03:39:10.630 --> 03:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
i used to say we didn't want to kill
 
03:39:12.790 --> 03:39:12.800 align:start position:0%
trees but but uh
 
03:39:14.469 --> 03:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
gene chandler used to tell me no we do
 
03:39:15.990 --> 03:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
want to kill trees that's our luck
 
03:39:18.070 --> 03:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's our beaver mill industry we do
 
03:39:22.150 --> 03:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:22.160 --> 03:39:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:24.960 --> 03:39:26.389 align:start position:0%
 
if

03:39:26.389 --> 03:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:39:30.229 --> 03:39:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:30.239 --> 03:39:31.830 align:start position:0%
 
have

03:39:31.830 --> 03:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:39:31.840 --> 03:39:33.349 align:start position:0%
have
1502

03:39:33.349 --> 03:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
1502
 
03:39:37.349 --> 03:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
if we were not discussing 1502 the ucc
 
03:39:39.590 --> 03:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
or the ulc will will release the
 
03:39:42.309 --> 03:39:42.319 align:start position:0%
language of the ucc chapter 12
 
03:39:44.150 --> 03:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
at some point in the future and we would
 
03:39:45.590 --> 03:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
have to have a discussion of whether or
 
03:39:49.429 --> 03:39:49.439 align:start position:0%
not to adopt that those that anyway
 
03:39:51.670 --> 03:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
would does the legislature
 
03:39:53.429 --> 03:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
adopt that length choose to adopt that
 
03:39:56.070 --> 03:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
language does the banking department say
 
03:39:57.830 --> 03:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to adopt that language who
 
03:39:59.349 --> 03:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
makes the determination that we're going
 
03:40:00.710 --> 03:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
to we do
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
it's a legislation okay so so at some
 
03:40:06.550 --> 03:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
point in time we have to deal with this
 
03:40:09.670 --> 03:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
new chapter 12. it's either now or it's
 
03:40:09.680 --> 03:40:11.510 align:start position:0%
new chapter 12. it's either now or it's
later

03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
later
 
03:40:13.429 --> 03:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
so what would happen is whatever
 
03:40:15.670 --> 03:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
differences that occurs when the final
 
03:40:17.750 --> 03:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
edition goes out
 
03:40:19.830 --> 03:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
we can then put in a separate bill at
 
03:40:21.030 --> 03:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
that time
 
03:40:24.070 --> 03:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
to bring it in line if we adopt the
 
03:40:26.229 --> 03:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
language as they presently have drafted
 
03:40:26.239 --> 03:40:27.269 align:start position:0%
language as they presently have drafted
correct

03:40:27.269 --> 03:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:40:29.030 --> 03:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
anything different between now and when
 
03:40:31.510 --> 03:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
they release the final final version you
 
03:40:33.349 --> 03:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
would have to come in as a separate bill
 
03:40:34.389 --> 03:40:34.399 align:start position:0%
you have to come in a separate
 
03:40:36.309 --> 03:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
legislation and we would have to vote on
 
03:40:40.229 --> 03:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
okay but if we adopt the language now
 
03:40:43.590 --> 03:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
going replacing whatever's in 1502 now
 
03:40:45.429 --> 03:40:45.439 align:start position:0%
with whatever that language is in draft
 
03:40:47.349 --> 03:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
form correct
 
03:40:49.110 --> 03:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
that at least
 
03:40:51.990 --> 03:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
puts us a step ahead to be able to begin
 
03:40:53.510 --> 03:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
to act on
 
03:40:55.189 --> 03:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
this new space i'm going to use new
 
03:40:57.590 --> 03:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
language now to begin working in that
 
03:41:00.150 --> 03:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
new space of crypto technology correct
 
03:41:01.510 --> 03:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
and we would be the first in the country
 
03:41:04.950 --> 03:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
to be doing that thus inviting
 
03:41:04.960 --> 03:41:06.070 align:start position:0%
to be doing that thus inviting
new

03:41:06.070 --> 03:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
new
 
03:41:08.469 --> 03:41:08.479 align:start position:0%
innovation into the state
 
03:41:10.950 --> 03:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
maybe expanding our tax base cutting
 
03:41:13.269 --> 03:41:13.279 align:start position:0%
down new trees to build new homes
 
03:41:15.269 --> 03:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
whatever that means maybe securities can
 
03:41:16.550 --> 03:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
get some uh
 
03:41:18.150 --> 03:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
collect yeah or something what do we how
 
03:41:19.670 --> 03:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
much do we charge for when people do
 
03:41:20.870 --> 03:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
those uh
 
03:41:23.349 --> 03:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
the statements and the uh
 
03:41:25.110 --> 03:41:25.120 align:start position:0%
those proxies that
 
03:41:27.670 --> 03:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
not proxies they're uh
 
03:41:32.309 --> 03:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:32.319 --> 03:41:34.469 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:41:34.469 --> 03:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:41:35.990 --> 03:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
just while everyone's at the table here
 
03:41:38.469 --> 03:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
um there was discussion about a separate
 
03:41:40.150 --> 03:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
issue a discussion about creating a
 
03:41:42.070 --> 03:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
study commission is there is there still
 
03:41:43.590 --> 03:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
an appetite for that
 
03:41:46.150 --> 03:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
or should we set that aside just
 
03:41:47.349 --> 03:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
there was a study commission i think
 
03:41:49.750 --> 03:41:49.760 align:start position:0%
from 2015 to 20
 
03:41:51.910 --> 03:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know 2019 maybe you know well
 
03:41:54.309 --> 03:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
you don't need no commission
 
03:41:57.269 --> 03:41:57.279 align:start position:0%
we don't need it so no no i mean we got
 
03:41:58.710 --> 03:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
us okay we don't need the commission
 
03:42:04.790 --> 03:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:06.550 --> 03:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
that was part of the discussion i'm just
 
03:42:08.229 --> 03:42:08.239 align:start position:0%
closing the loop
 
03:42:10.710 --> 03:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh would you believe
 
03:42:13.750 --> 03:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
back when i took business law at new
 
03:42:16.309 --> 03:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire college
 
03:42:17.990 --> 03:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
the ucc
 
03:42:21.110 --> 03:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
was required reading
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
for any business law
 
03:42:23.520 --> 03:42:24.870 align:start position:0%
for any business law
student

03:42:24.870 --> 03:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
student
 
03:42:26.630 --> 03:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
and it there's some things that are
 
03:42:26.640 --> 03:42:27.750 align:start position:0%
and it there's some things that are
interesting

03:42:27.750 --> 03:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
03:42:30.070 --> 03:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
and some things that will lull you to
 
03:42:30.080 --> 03:42:31.269 align:start position:0%
and some things that will lull you to
sleep

03:42:31.269 --> 03:42:31.279 align:start position:0%
sleep
 
03:42:34.630 --> 03:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:34.640 --> 03:42:37.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:42:37.750 --> 03:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:39.670 --> 03:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
yes chris
 
03:42:41.830 --> 03:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
one of the questions i want to answer
 
03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
is whose full faith and credit is behind
 
03:42:48.150 --> 03:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:00.630 --> 03:43:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:02.469 --> 03:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
this could be a you know an issue if
 
03:43:04.070 --> 03:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
we're going to be the first through the
 
03:43:04.080 --> 03:43:05.110 align:start position:0%
we're going to be the first through the
door

03:43:05.110 --> 03:43:05.120 align:start position:0%
door
 
03:43:06.790 --> 03:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
make sure somebody doesn't slam it
 
03:43:08.070 --> 03:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
behind us
 
03:43:09.269 --> 03:43:09.279 align:start position:0%
but the
 
03:43:11.990 --> 03:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
whos full faith and credit is
 
03:43:12.000 --> 03:43:13.269 align:start position:0%
whos full faith and credit is
responsible

03:43:13.269 --> 03:43:13.279 align:start position:0%
responsible
 
03:43:17.189 --> 03:43:17.199 align:start position:0%
for the consequences of this law
 
03:43:18.550 --> 03:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
that should be a question i think for
 
03:43:20.710 --> 03:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
the commissioner
 
03:43:21.830 --> 03:43:21.840 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
do you have an answer for that one
 
03:43:25.910 --> 03:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
difficulty identifying who's behind it i
 
03:43:27.670 --> 03:43:27.680 align:start position:0%
don't know if i can answer that question
 
03:43:29.349 --> 03:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
i think he's getting it he's always
 
03:43:31.189 --> 03:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
worried that
 
03:43:33.349 --> 03:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
this blockchain technology is used by
 
03:43:35.910 --> 03:43:35.920 align:start position:0%
criminal elements no it is used by
 
03:43:38.950 --> 03:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
criminal elements and so therefore who
 
03:43:41.189 --> 03:43:41.199 align:start position:0%
is it at any point in time that is the
 
03:43:42.469 --> 03:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
03:43:46.229 --> 03:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
because it has a statute or could we get
 
03:43:49.030 --> 03:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
dragged into this criminal activity
 
03:43:50.710 --> 03:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
is that your question chris well who's
 
03:43:53.349 --> 03:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
on the hook if if something untoward
 
03:43:55.670 --> 03:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
might happen i mean okay god knows it's
 
03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
never happened before
 
03:44:01.030 --> 03:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
so so the ucc governs how people like
 
03:44:03.590 --> 03:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
interact for business purposes
 
03:44:06.389 --> 03:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
microphone sorry sorry have a seat okay
 
03:44:07.750 --> 03:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
you get your seat now i just keep
 
03:44:09.269 --> 03:44:09.279 align:start position:0%
sliding forward so i might as well sit
 
03:44:10.469 --> 03:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
here um
 
03:44:14.150 --> 03:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
so the ucc governs how entities transact
 
03:44:14.160 --> 03:44:15.349 align:start position:0%
so the ucc governs how entities transact
business

03:44:15.349 --> 03:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:44:18.950 --> 03:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
um and this article 12 really just
 
03:44:18.960 --> 03:44:19.750 align:start position:0%
um and this article 12 really just
um

03:44:19.750 --> 03:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:22.630 --> 03:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
acknowledges the existence of
 
03:44:24.790 --> 03:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
bitcoin and cryptocurrency and those
 
03:44:26.469 --> 03:44:26.479 align:start position:0%
types of transactions and makes a
 
03:44:28.870 --> 03:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
uniform law that governs how
 
03:44:30.870 --> 03:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
businesses can basically interact how
 
03:44:33.030 --> 03:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
banks can interact with it how you how
 
03:44:35.429 --> 03:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
like how you can transact business sort
 
03:44:37.910 --> 03:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
of in a uniform way using it
 
03:44:39.510 --> 03:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
so i think it's not
 
03:44:41.990 --> 03:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
i mean you're asking more of a big scale
 
03:44:45.429 --> 03:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
policy question about cryptocurrency
 
03:44:47.750 --> 03:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
whereas i think this is just and and
 
03:44:49.590 --> 03:44:49.600 align:start position:0%
certainly the securities folks maybe
 
03:44:51.590 --> 03:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
could had would have a better because
 
03:44:54.469 --> 03:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
they're really the experts on the ucc
 
03:44:56.229 --> 03:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
they might have a better way to describe
 
03:44:58.710 --> 03:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
what the ucc does but it really governs
 
03:45:01.590 --> 03:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
how people enter how business entities
 
03:45:04.229 --> 03:45:04.239 align:start position:0%
interact with each other using certain
 
03:45:04.239 --> 03:45:05.110 align:start position:0%
interact with each other using certain
um

03:45:05.110 --> 03:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:45:07.189 --> 03:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
like negotiable instruments like checks
 
03:45:07.199 --> 03:45:07.830 align:start position:0%
like negotiable instruments like checks
and

03:45:07.830 --> 03:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
security interests and how they perfect
 
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
security interests and property um so
 
03:45:14.229 --> 03:45:14.239 align:start position:0%
it's really like almost like a technical
 
03:45:14.239 --> 03:45:15.269 align:start position:0%
it's really like almost like a technical
manual

03:45:15.269 --> 03:45:15.279 align:start position:0%
manual
 
03:45:17.590 --> 03:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
um whereas like i think you're asking
 
03:45:19.830 --> 03:45:19.840 align:start position:0%
more of a big picture policy question
 
03:45:22.150 --> 03:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
about cryptocurrency that
 
03:45:24.229 --> 03:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
is not i mean
 
03:45:25.750 --> 03:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
that that's kind of the extent of my
 
03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
knowledge but i don't know if that kind
 
03:45:29.510 --> 03:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
of helps understand what
 
03:45:31.750 --> 03:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
you're trying to accomplish with the ucc
 
03:45:33.990 --> 03:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's a very narrow kind of business
 
03:45:37.990 --> 03:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
transaction governing law
 
03:45:39.670 --> 03:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
okay i know who the full faith and
 
03:45:41.750 --> 03:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
credit is behind the dollar it's it's
 
03:45:43.830 --> 03:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
the federal reserve and the
 
03:45:45.910 --> 03:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh national economy
 
03:45:48.790 --> 03:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
and and the u.s congress
 
03:45:50.150 --> 03:45:50.160 align:start position:0%
i do not
 
03:45:52.469 --> 03:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
uh but what does that
 
03:45:54.550 --> 03:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
mean to you because what does that mean
 
03:45:56.710 --> 03:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
that's behind it in other words that
 
03:45:59.750 --> 03:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
that well if we bailed out wall street
 
03:46:01.030 --> 03:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
three times
 
03:46:03.750 --> 03:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
in my in my lifetime so
 
03:46:05.590 --> 03:46:05.600 align:start position:0%
that's what it means okay so those
 
03:46:08.870 --> 03:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
bailouts were not cryptocurrency is in
 
03:46:11.990 --> 03:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
my mind i could be mistaken right uh is
 
03:46:13.349 --> 03:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
in my mind
 
03:46:14.350 --> 03:46:14.360 align:start position:0%
uh going to
 
03:46:14.360 --> 03:46:15.590 align:start position:0%
uh going to
[Music]

03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:46:18.070 --> 03:46:18.080 align:start position:0%
is trying to establish itself as a
 
03:46:18.080 --> 03:46:19.510 align:start position:0%
is trying to establish itself as a
legitimate

03:46:19.510 --> 03:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
03:46:19.520 --> 03:46:21.189 align:start position:0%
legitimate
currency

03:46:21.189 --> 03:46:21.199 align:start position:0%
currency
 
03:46:22.870 --> 03:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
like the dollar
 
03:46:24.870 --> 03:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
like the eu
 
03:46:27.830 --> 03:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
and and it's having a tremendous amount
 
03:46:27.840 --> 03:46:28.469 align:start position:0%
and and it's having a tremendous amount
of

03:46:28.469 --> 03:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:46:31.030 --> 03:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
success apparently there is a it's not
 
03:46:31.040 --> 03:46:33.349 align:start position:0%
success apparently there is a it's not
currency

03:46:33.349 --> 03:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
currency
 
03:46:35.189 --> 03:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
i beg to differ
 
03:46:36.950 --> 03:46:36.960 align:start position:0%
if it looks like a duck
 
03:46:38.229 --> 03:46:38.239 align:start position:0%
it's a duck
 
03:46:39.830 --> 03:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:46:39.840 --> 03:46:41.349 align:start position:0%
so uh
um

03:46:41.349 --> 03:46:41.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:44.150 --> 03:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
this is what the currency is baby this
 
03:46:46.229 --> 03:46:46.239 align:start position:0%
currency was developed
 
03:46:48.150 --> 03:46:48.160 align:start position:0%
to launder money
 
03:46:51.510 --> 03:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
money oh my god no not not not rocks not
 
03:46:51.520 --> 03:46:52.389 align:start position:0%
money oh my god no not not not rocks not
wood

03:46:52.389 --> 03:46:52.399 align:start position:0%
wood
 
03:46:53.750 --> 03:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
all right not this
 
03:46:55.750 --> 03:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
i hear you i hear chris that's your
 
03:46:58.309 --> 03:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
personal opinion no that's the history
 
03:46:58.319 --> 03:46:59.429 align:start position:0%
personal opinion no that's the history
okay

03:46:59.429 --> 03:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:47:01.510 --> 03:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
so anyway yeah
 
03:47:03.990 --> 03:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
you really want to respond to that keys
 
03:47:06.070 --> 03:47:06.080 align:start position:0%
just briefly okay
 
03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
so so cash money is also used in a lot
 
03:47:11.429 --> 03:47:11.439 align:start position:0%
of illegal transactions it doesn't mean
 
03:47:13.510 --> 03:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
that we don't use cash right so just
 
03:47:16.710 --> 03:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
because criminals use cars and shoes and
 
03:47:18.150 --> 03:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
the internet doesn't mean that all those
 
03:47:20.710 --> 03:47:20.720 align:start position:0%
things are bad right so you
 
03:47:22.229 --> 03:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
don't fall into the trap of painting
 
03:47:24.469 --> 03:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
technology as evil just because
 
03:47:27.349 --> 03:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes people use it for bad deeds
 
03:47:29.590 --> 03:47:29.600 align:start position:0%
number one um
 
03:47:31.269 --> 03:47:31.279 align:start position:0%
so the full faith and credit you talked
 
03:47:34.229 --> 03:47:34.239 align:start position:0%
about the bailouts right so
 
03:47:36.790 --> 03:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's i can go into this all day and i
 
03:47:37.830 --> 03:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
won't but
 
03:47:40.710 --> 03:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
the the genesis of bitcoin was to to
 
03:47:42.790 --> 03:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
stop bailouts because if you remember
 
03:47:44.389 --> 03:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
the occupy wall street movement people
 
03:47:45.590 --> 03:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
were upset
 
03:47:48.389 --> 03:47:48.399 align:start position:0%
that the banks got bailouts and in this
 
03:47:50.550 --> 03:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
you know these digital assets which are
 
03:47:52.870 --> 03:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
really more property than than currency
 
03:47:54.309 --> 03:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
there is no bailout that's the whole
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
point like there's no central authority
 
03:47:58.389 --> 03:47:58.399 align:start position:0%
that can bail out their friends and
 
03:47:59.750 --> 03:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
leave behind the little people that's
 
03:48:00.950 --> 03:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
03:48:02.950 --> 03:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
you know the appeals of it but you have
 
03:48:05.349 --> 03:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
to think of it more like gold than the
 
03:48:07.750 --> 03:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
dollar because it's designed to be a
 
03:48:09.510 --> 03:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
digital form of gold
 
03:48:12.630 --> 03:48:12.640 align:start position:0%
in its properties and in its features
 
03:48:14.389 --> 03:48:14.399 align:start position:0%
what people how people value it in their
 
03:48:15.670 --> 03:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
minds is a whole different thing right
 
03:48:15.680 --> 03:48:16.630 align:start position:0%
minds is a whole different thing right
so

03:48:16.630 --> 03:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
um but you have to think of it more like
 
03:48:20.870 --> 03:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
gold than it's it's more of a an asset a
 
03:48:23.269 --> 03:48:23.279 align:start position:0%
piece of property than a currency yeah
 
03:48:25.030 --> 03:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
no i'm familiar with the gold so here's
 
03:48:27.349 --> 03:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
the new expression it's a consumable
 
03:48:27.359 --> 03:48:29.510 align:start position:0%
the new expression it's a consumable
token

03:48:29.510 --> 03:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
token
 
03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
that sounds pretty and shiny and i'm
 
03:48:33.590 --> 03:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
sure people are really excited well
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
maybe it's like the quarter before they
 
03:48:37.429 --> 03:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
stop putting the car copper inside it
 
03:48:40.830 --> 03:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
back when it was actual gold
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
okay any more questions all right
 
03:48:44.399 --> 03:48:45.429 align:start position:0%
okay any more questions all right
so

03:48:45.429 --> 03:48:45.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:48:47.030 --> 03:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't move you guys stay right where you
 
03:48:47.040 --> 03:48:48.469 align:start position:0%
don't move you guys stay right where you
are

03:48:48.469 --> 03:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:48:51.349 --> 03:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
so we know where we are and and uh so
 
03:48:53.429 --> 03:48:53.439 align:start position:0%
now securities you want to come up here
 
03:48:53.439 --> 03:48:59.750 align:start position:0%
now securities you want to come up here
take

03:48:59.750 --> 03:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
theoretically there's this is kind of a
 
03:49:01.760 --> 03:49:02.870 align:start position:0%
theoretically there's this is kind of a
moving

03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
moving
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
thing because we're not going to pass
 
03:49:05.590 --> 03:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
anything today
 
03:49:07.269 --> 03:49:07.279 align:start position:0%
okay we're just getting warmed up to
 
03:49:07.279 --> 03:49:09.990 align:start position:0%
okay we're just getting warmed up to
everything

03:49:09.990 --> 03:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
everything
 
03:49:12.389 --> 03:49:12.399 align:start position:0%
and you will absolutely by the time
 
03:49:15.750 --> 03:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
you're done you'll be able to explain
 
03:49:16.790 --> 03:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
all of this
 
03:49:18.790 --> 03:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
so that when members of your caucus says
 
03:49:20.630 --> 03:49:20.640 align:start position:0%
what the hell did you guys do
 
03:49:22.950 --> 03:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
you should be able to you should be able
 
03:49:25.510 --> 03:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
to explain it
 
03:49:28.150 --> 03:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
and understand what we're doing here
 
03:49:28.160 --> 03:49:28.950 align:start position:0%
and understand what we're doing here
okay

03:49:28.950 --> 03:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:49:31.429 --> 03:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
so we started out with that the key
 
03:49:34.950 --> 03:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
element that 1504
 
03:49:37.910 --> 03:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
was the one that says okay you you have
 
03:49:40.150 --> 03:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
these different divisions in banking and
 
03:49:41.990 --> 03:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
they had that you know five million
 
03:49:44.389 --> 03:49:44.399 align:start position:0%
dollar you know fiscal note whatever so
 
03:49:46.150 --> 03:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
that is we're not going to pass that
 
03:49:47.910 --> 03:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's not going to happen
 
03:49:50.630 --> 03:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
instead we're taking
 
03:49:53.590 --> 03:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
what's the structure in our statutes
 
03:49:55.830 --> 03:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
that regulate
 
03:49:58.710 --> 03:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
um business transactions
 
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
and that's what the ucc is it's really
 
03:50:02.229 --> 03:50:02.239 align:start position:0%
business transaction that's what the
 
03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
statute is about okay and how it's
 
03:50:06.389 --> 03:50:06.399 align:start position:0%
handled so
 
03:50:09.110 --> 03:50:09.120 align:start position:0%
obviously for us in new hampshire we
 
03:50:12.150 --> 03:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
have two regulatory authorities that are
 
03:50:15.429 --> 03:50:15.439 align:start position:0%
affected by the ucc statute and that's
 
03:50:15.439 --> 03:50:16.710 align:start position:0%
affected by the ucc statute and that's
banking

03:50:16.710 --> 03:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
banking
 
03:50:18.710 --> 03:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
and securities
 
03:50:24.309 --> 03:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:25.750 --> 03:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay gentlemen
 
03:50:28.150 --> 03:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
good afternoon mr chair uh barry glennon
 
03:50:30.309 --> 03:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh and kevin moakman with the bureau of
 
03:50:34.229 --> 03:50:34.239 align:start position:0%
securities regulation um
 
03:50:36.229 --> 03:50:36.239 align:start position:0%
mr chair we we've had the opportunity to
 
03:50:39.910 --> 03:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
review um the uh proposed language and
 
03:50:43.429 --> 03:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh we did a bit of a reorganization of
 
03:50:45.830 --> 03:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
some of the language and communicated
 
03:50:48.950 --> 03:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
that uh to representative ammon
 
03:50:51.990 --> 03:50:52.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe that we have a
 
03:50:53.990 --> 03:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
workable amendment i believe i can't
 
03:50:55.429 --> 03:50:55.439 align:start position:0%
speak for representative ammon but i
 
03:50:57.269 --> 03:50:57.279 align:start position:0%
believe he
 
03:50:59.269 --> 03:50:59.279 align:start position:0%
considered this considers this to be
 
03:50:59.279 --> 03:51:01.189 align:start position:0%
considered this considers this to be
acceptable

03:51:01.189 --> 03:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
acceptable
 
03:51:02.630 --> 03:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
attorney mulkan will speak to some of
 
03:51:04.950 --> 03:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
the specifics of of the changes and
 
03:51:08.070 --> 03:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
there may be one minor change to the
 
03:51:09.910 --> 03:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
actual amendment just looking at the
 
03:51:11.910 --> 03:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
amendment uh yes i realized the first
 
03:51:13.590 --> 03:51:13.600 align:start position:0%
edition maybe just this there may be
 
03:51:18.229 --> 03:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:19.429 --> 03:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:51:20.950 --> 03:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
essentially what we've done is we have
 
03:51:27.510 --> 03:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh tried to fit this into the the format
 
03:51:30.309 --> 03:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
of our law 421b
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
um one of the issues that that we saw
 
03:51:35.030 --> 03:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
was that
 
03:51:35.040 --> 03:51:36.229 align:start position:0%
was that
by

03:51:36.229 --> 03:51:36.239 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:51:38.550 --> 03:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
accepting uh
 
03:51:41.349 --> 03:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
the tokens from the definition
 
03:51:43.590 --> 03:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
of a security it kind of raised the
 
03:51:46.309 --> 03:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
question well we would then really kind
 
03:51:49.429 --> 03:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
of have no enforcement power at all uh
 
03:51:51.750 --> 03:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
and it called for fraud authority
 
03:51:53.110 --> 03:51:53.120 align:start position:0%
because we're not dealing with the
 
03:51:55.510 --> 03:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
security so what we proposed then was to
 
03:51:57.189 --> 03:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
change us around
 
03:51:59.429 --> 03:51:59.439 align:start position:0%
so that instead of saying it's not a
 
03:52:01.670 --> 03:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
security saying that transactions and
 
03:52:03.990 --> 03:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
these securities are exempt
 
03:52:06.710 --> 03:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
from the registration requirements
 
03:52:09.349 --> 03:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh and also that uh people who
 
03:52:11.910 --> 03:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
participate in this are exempt from
 
03:52:15.429 --> 03:52:15.439 align:start position:0%
being registered as broker dealers
 
03:52:19.110 --> 03:52:19.120 align:start position:0%
so essentially that's what we've done
 
03:52:21.830 --> 03:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
now the one thing i think
 
03:52:25.189 --> 03:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
barry was referring to this
 
03:52:27.189 --> 03:52:27.199 align:start position:0%
in section one of the amendment i'm
 
03:52:28.550 --> 03:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
looking at it
 
03:52:28.560 --> 03:52:29.830 align:start position:0%
looking at it
um

03:52:29.830 --> 03:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:30.950 --> 03:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
and i think i might have
 
03:52:30.960 --> 03:52:32.950 align:start position:0%
and i think i might have
misunderstanding

03:52:32.950 --> 03:52:32.960 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding
 
03:52:35.429 --> 03:52:35.439 align:start position:0%
because the language in the original
 
03:52:37.750 --> 03:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
bill came from the solicitor's
 
03:52:40.229 --> 03:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
definition in our statute my
 
03:52:42.550 --> 03:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the uh
 
03:52:44.229 --> 03:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
what they were trying to do at that time
 
03:52:46.550 --> 03:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
was to create an exception
 
03:52:49.269 --> 03:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
for the blockchain tokens
 
03:52:53.510 --> 03:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
from uh this definition of securities
 
03:52:56.469 --> 03:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
um i believe what we want to do is
 
03:52:58.550 --> 03:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
in a future amendment is take out that
 
03:53:00.150 --> 03:53:00.160 align:start position:0%
whole section one because it doesn't
 
03:53:00.160 --> 03:53:01.590 align:start position:0%
whole section one because it doesn't
apply

03:53:01.590 --> 03:53:01.600 align:start position:0%
apply
 
03:53:04.630 --> 03:53:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh and again we would not
 
03:53:06.790 --> 03:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
define securities in such a way to
 
03:53:06.800 --> 03:53:09.670 align:start position:0%
define securities in such a way to
exclude

03:53:09.670 --> 03:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
exclude
 
03:53:12.309 --> 03:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
blockchain tokens we would instead
 
03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
create a
 
03:53:16.309 --> 03:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
transactional exemption
 
03:53:18.469 --> 03:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
which means they don't have to register
 
03:53:20.870 --> 03:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
the securities
 
03:53:23.429 --> 03:53:23.439 align:start position:0%
another issue was defining an issue
 
03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
where to exclude
 
03:53:28.630 --> 03:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
people who deal in these tokens
 
03:53:28.640 --> 03:53:30.229 align:start position:0%
people who deal in these tokens
again

03:53:30.229 --> 03:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:53:32.550 --> 03:53:32.560 align:start position:0%
to exclude them from broker-dealer
 
03:53:35.269 --> 03:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
requirements that sort of thing
 
03:53:37.830 --> 03:53:37.840 align:start position:0%
there already is an exclusion from the
 
03:53:39.670 --> 03:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
definition of brokered dealer for
 
03:53:41.510 --> 03:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
issuers so
 
03:53:41.520 --> 03:53:42.309 align:start position:0%
issuers so
uh

03:53:42.309 --> 03:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:53:44.710 --> 03:53:44.720 align:start position:0%
it in essence it doesn't serve any
 
03:53:46.550 --> 03:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
purpose and it could actually raise
 
03:53:48.950 --> 03:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
questions about our authority if there
 
03:53:51.349 --> 03:53:51.359 align:start position:0%
is fraud which again is kind of carved
 
03:53:51.359 --> 03:53:52.150 align:start position:0%
is fraud which again is kind of carved
out

03:53:52.150 --> 03:53:52.160 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:53:54.229 --> 03:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
 
03:53:54.239 --> 03:53:57.110 align:start position:0%
in the original bill
um

03:53:57.110 --> 03:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:59.510 --> 03:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
see and when we say are carved out we're
 
03:54:01.910 --> 03:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
actually that we retain authority in the
 
03:54:03.830 --> 03:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
event of any kind of fraudulent conduct
 
03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
right as opposed to eliminating it
 
03:54:06.720 --> 03:54:07.590 align:start position:0%
right as opposed to eliminating it
right

03:54:07.590 --> 03:54:07.600 align:start position:0%
right
 
03:54:07.600 --> 03:54:09.670 align:start position:0%
right
um

03:54:09.670 --> 03:54:09.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:12.710 --> 03:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we we did add and
 
03:54:15.670 --> 03:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh again we don't want
 
03:54:18.309 --> 03:54:18.319 align:start position:0%
uh consumers of these tokens to be under
 
03:54:20.870 --> 03:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
the impression that because a notice
 
03:54:23.830 --> 03:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
filing is made for uh with us that in
 
03:54:25.910 --> 03:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
some way these are registered
 
03:54:28.229 --> 03:54:28.239 align:start position:0%
because really it's just a notice filing
 
03:54:29.910 --> 03:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
to say this is what we're doing here's
 
03:54:31.590 --> 03:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
information about us
 
03:54:33.510 --> 03:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have to go through any approval
 
03:54:35.510 --> 03:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
process or anything like that so we
 
03:54:37.030 --> 03:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure
 
03:54:39.830 --> 03:54:39.840 align:start position:0%
that when um
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
that notice is filed that that notice
 
03:54:44.830 --> 03:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
will include a statement that in any
 
03:54:47.510 --> 03:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
advertising on the internet and so forth
 
03:54:49.269 --> 03:54:49.279 align:start position:0%
that it be made clear that they're not
 
03:54:49.279 --> 03:54:50.630 align:start position:0%
that it be made clear that they're not
registered

03:54:50.630 --> 03:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
registered
 
03:54:53.590 --> 03:54:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh secure as securities with the state
 
03:54:55.269 --> 03:54:55.279 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
03:54:57.030 --> 03:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
and uh then
 
03:54:58.790 --> 03:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
the other uh
 
03:55:00.790 --> 03:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
major change not a major change there
 
03:55:02.950 --> 03:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
really wasn't any major changes
 
03:55:06.150 --> 03:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
was uh to take out the requirement for
 
03:55:08.389 --> 03:55:08.399 align:start position:0%
electronic filings
 
03:55:11.110 --> 03:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh we wanted that to be clear because we
 
03:55:14.229 --> 03:55:14.239 align:start position:0%
don't currently have a process for
 
03:55:17.269 --> 03:55:17.279 align:start position:0%
receiving those types of filings
 
03:55:19.269 --> 03:55:19.279 align:start position:0%
so we just took that out so we can
 
03:55:22.070 --> 03:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
receive by email we can receive hard
 
03:55:22.080 --> 03:55:23.110 align:start position:0%
receive by email we can receive hard
copies

03:55:23.110 --> 03:55:23.120 align:start position:0%
copies
 
03:55:24.950 --> 03:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that's probably not going to be
 
03:55:27.710 --> 03:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
a favorite way of doing it with
 
03:55:30.389 --> 03:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
cryptocurrency and uh
 
03:55:33.189 --> 03:55:33.199 align:start position:0%
blockchain token people but um but we
 
03:55:35.910 --> 03:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
can take them by email and then get them
 
03:55:37.030 --> 03:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
into our
 
03:55:41.429 --> 03:55:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:42.389 --> 03:55:42.399 align:start position:0%
so i
 
03:55:44.070 --> 03:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
think essentially that's it i don't know
 
03:55:45.910 --> 03:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
if you wanted me to go through step by
 
03:55:48.150 --> 03:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
step in the amendment but
 
03:55:48.160 --> 03:55:49.110 align:start position:0%
step in the amendment but
um

03:55:49.110 --> 03:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:51.030 --> 03:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
i think i can point out
 
03:55:51.040 --> 03:55:51.990 align:start position:0%
i think i can point out
um

03:55:51.990 --> 03:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:54.070 --> 03:55:54.080 align:start position:0%
that we have defined
 
03:55:57.349 --> 03:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
open blockchain token we've taken it out
 
03:55:59.670 --> 03:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
of the proposed news section the first
 
03:56:02.150 --> 03:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
bill and put it into our definitional
 
03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
section so it's defined there
 
03:56:06.550 --> 03:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
language is taken direct from the
 
03:56:08.550 --> 03:56:08.560 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
03:56:11.110 --> 03:56:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh so that's section
 
03:56:11.120 --> 03:56:12.630 align:start position:0%
uh so that's section
two

03:56:12.630 --> 03:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:56:14.550 --> 03:56:14.560 align:start position:0%
section three again is the exempt
 
03:56:14.560 --> 03:56:16.070 align:start position:0%
section three again is the exempt
transaction

03:56:16.070 --> 03:56:16.080 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
03:56:18.469 --> 03:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh the exemption for uh exempt
 
03:56:21.510 --> 03:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
transactions where that was added
 
03:56:23.269 --> 03:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh so again
 
03:56:25.429 --> 03:56:25.439 align:start position:0%
uh the transactions
 
03:56:28.229 --> 03:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh are not going to be required to be
 
03:56:30.710 --> 03:56:30.720 align:start position:0%
registered as securities
 
03:56:34.550 --> 03:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
which um was the intent to begin with
 
03:56:34.560 --> 03:56:36.309 align:start position:0%
which um was the intent to begin with
um

03:56:36.309 --> 03:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:39.110 --> 03:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
section three i'm sorry yeah section
 
03:56:42.070 --> 03:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
three well i just did that uh excuse me
 
03:56:43.990 --> 03:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
section four
 
03:56:44.000 --> 03:56:45.590 align:start position:0%
section four
um

03:56:45.590 --> 03:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:48.790 --> 03:56:48.800 align:start position:0%
is the broker dealer exemption and again
 
03:56:51.110 --> 03:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
took the language that was in the
 
03:56:52.630 --> 03:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
03:56:53.830 --> 03:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
and put it
 
03:56:55.750 --> 03:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
where it seemed most appropriate in the
 
03:56:58.710 --> 03:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
brokered dealer section to
 
03:57:01.830 --> 03:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
explicitly create an exception from the
 
03:57:04.309 --> 03:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
registration requirement
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
so again it it uh it was more matter of
 
03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:09.110 align:start position:0%
so again it it uh it was more matter of
reorganization

03:57:09.110 --> 03:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
reorganization
 
03:57:12.309 --> 03:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
than anything uh to make sure
 
03:57:15.269 --> 03:57:15.279 align:start position:0%
that if there is fraudulent securities
 
03:57:15.279 --> 03:57:16.469 align:start position:0%
that if there is fraudulent securities
conduct

03:57:16.469 --> 03:57:16.479 align:start position:0%
conduct
 
03:57:18.309 --> 03:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
that we still have the authority to go
 
03:57:19.510 --> 03:57:19.520 align:start position:0%
after that but we would have no
 
03:57:19.520 --> 03:57:20.710 align:start position:0%
after that but we would have no
authority

03:57:20.710 --> 03:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
authority
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
in terms of registering
 
03:57:25.910 --> 03:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
registering the tokens as securities or
 
03:57:28.550 --> 03:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
registering uh people who do the
 
03:57:32.070 --> 03:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
transactions or facilitators as broker
 
03:57:32.080 --> 03:57:37.990 align:start position:0%
transactions or facilitators as broker
dealers

03:57:37.990 --> 03:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:38.000 --> 03:57:38.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:57:38.790 --> 03:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:57:42.870 --> 03:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:45.750 --> 03:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
the key element here is
 
03:57:48.070 --> 03:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
secure we under our consumer protection
 
03:57:51.030 --> 03:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
statutes 358a we have exemptions
 
03:57:54.870 --> 03:57:54.880 align:start position:0%
and our exemptions is securities
 
03:57:54.880 --> 03:57:56.070 align:start position:0%
and our exemptions is securities
by

03:57:56.070 --> 03:57:56.080 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:57:58.150 --> 03:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation with that
 
03:58:00.870 --> 03:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
saying is that they're unregulated by
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
securities that means
 
03:58:06.150 --> 03:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
their regulator is the attorney
 
03:58:07.990 --> 03:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
03:58:10.150 --> 03:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay and you
 
03:58:11.750 --> 03:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
can sue them
 
03:58:13.590 --> 03:58:13.600 align:start position:0%
for triple damages
 
03:58:15.750 --> 03:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
if you were harmed
 
03:58:17.990 --> 03:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
but that you wouldn't call them
 
03:58:19.750 --> 03:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
you would call your favorite trial
 
03:58:19.760 --> 03:58:23.429 align:start position:0%
you would call your favorite trial
lawyer

03:58:23.429 --> 03:58:23.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:25.910 --> 03:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
did i not answer your question well what
 
03:58:27.830 --> 03:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
is the purpose of registration of a
 
03:58:30.870 --> 03:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
search security of all our securities um
 
03:58:33.030 --> 03:58:33.040 align:start position:0%
what is the purpose of registration
 
03:58:33.040 --> 03:58:36.309 align:start position:0%
what is the purpose of registration
registration

03:58:36.309 --> 03:58:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:38.469 --> 03:58:38.479 align:start position:0%
so uh well that's just a good that's not
 
03:58:41.120 --> 03:58:41.130 align:start position:0%
why why do we have a securities division
 
03:58:41.130 --> 03:58:43.429 align:start position:0%
why why do we have a securities division
[Laughter]

03:58:43.429 --> 03:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:58:46.389 --> 03:58:46.399 align:start position:0%
well it does go back to 1933 with the
 
03:58:47.750 --> 03:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
well actually it goes back further than
 
03:58:51.030 --> 03:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
that uh but it it's basically a process
 
03:58:52.790 --> 03:58:52.800 align:start position:0%
of initial review
 
03:58:54.469 --> 03:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
where we get to look
 
03:58:57.990 --> 03:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
at an offering and say
 
03:58:59.990 --> 03:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
you know does it have particular
 
03:59:01.349 --> 03:59:01.359 align:start position:0%
information because it's really all
 
03:59:04.070 --> 03:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
about disclosure and so
 
03:59:06.309 --> 03:59:06.319 align:start position:0%
we go through to make sure
 
03:59:08.950 --> 03:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
that they are making proper disclosures
 
03:59:11.349 --> 03:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
of information that an investor would
 
03:59:12.870 --> 03:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
want to know
 
03:59:12.880 --> 03:59:13.990 align:start position:0%
want to know
um

03:59:13.990 --> 03:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:16.469 --> 03:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
in making a decision about investing
 
03:59:17.510 --> 03:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
because these are these aren't
 
03:59:19.990 --> 03:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
registered right so these would be
 
03:59:22.229 --> 03:59:22.239 align:start position:0%
outside of that
 
03:59:22.239 --> 03:59:23.030 align:start position:0%
outside of that
view

03:59:23.030 --> 03:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
view
 
03:59:25.510 --> 03:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
yeah only in the case of fraud if there
 
03:59:27.990 --> 03:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
was fraud and if it was determined to be
 
03:59:29.830 --> 03:59:29.840 align:start position:0%
a security
 
03:59:33.110 --> 03:59:33.120 align:start position:0%
then we could take action as as
 
03:59:34.950 --> 03:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative hunt said
 
03:59:34.960 --> 03:59:36.309 align:start position:0%
representative hunt said
um

03:59:36.309 --> 03:59:36.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:59:38.070 --> 03:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise basically you're dealing with
 
03:59:39.750 --> 03:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office under the
 
03:59:39.760 --> 03:59:40.790 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office under the
consumer

03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
consumer
 
03:59:43.189 --> 03:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
protection division
 
03:59:44.469 --> 03:59:44.479 align:start position:0%
so that the law
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
so the current law in new hampshire now
 
03:59:49.590 --> 03:59:49.600 align:start position:0%
if you felt you were
 
03:59:51.750 --> 03:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
hurt or fraud by
 
03:59:54.309 --> 03:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
some blockchain transaction
 
03:59:56.790 --> 03:59:56.800 align:start position:0%
you do not call the banking department
 
03:59:59.429 --> 03:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
you do not call securities
 
04:00:01.030 --> 04:00:01.040 align:start position:0%
all you can do is call the attorney
 
04:00:05.110 --> 04:00:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:07.189 --> 04:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
yeah i have so many questions we'll be
 
04:00:08.710 --> 04:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
here all day so
 
04:00:10.790 --> 04:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
i'm just okay we'll move along then very
 
04:00:10.800 --> 04:00:11.990 align:start position:0%
i'm just okay we'll move along then very
fishy

04:00:11.990 --> 04:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
fishy
 
04:00:14.229 --> 04:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
revenant bartlett thank you mr sheriff
 
04:00:16.150 --> 04:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
so um i've just got a question just in
 
04:00:18.150 --> 04:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
the beginning of your testimony you said
 
04:00:19.269 --> 04:00:19.279 align:start position:0%
that there were a couple of things that
 
04:00:21.910 --> 04:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
had to be corrected in this amendment
 
04:00:23.830 --> 04:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
and i missed them yeah one thing which
 
04:00:25.670 --> 04:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
was section one
 
04:00:25.680 --> 04:00:26.790 align:start position:0%
was section one
um

04:00:26.790 --> 04:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:28.790 --> 04:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
which was a misinterpretation of what
 
04:00:31.349 --> 04:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
was trying to be accomplished uh section
 
04:00:33.269 --> 04:00:33.279 align:start position:0%
one deals with solicitors which really
 
04:00:35.429 --> 04:00:35.439 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with uh
 
04:00:37.110 --> 04:00:37.120 align:start position:0%
blockchain tokens
 
04:00:39.990 --> 04:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
um so will this be deleted that can be
 
04:00:42.150 --> 04:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
deleted so all of section one can be
 
04:00:45.670 --> 04:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
deleted yes okay yeah
 
04:00:47.590 --> 04:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
so we'll get a new we'll get a new
 
04:00:49.269 --> 04:00:49.279 align:start position:0%
amendment all right we'll have a new one
 
04:00:53.030 --> 04:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
drawn up momentarily thank you sorry
 
04:00:54.550 --> 04:00:54.560 align:start position:0%
but i don't explain we're not going to
 
04:00:55.910 --> 04:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
execute anything today so you don't have
 
04:00:57.349 --> 04:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
to we're not going to exactly anything
 
04:00:57.359 --> 04:00:58.309 align:start position:0%
to we're not going to exactly anything
today

04:00:58.309 --> 04:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:00:58.319 --> 04:00:59.110 align:start position:0%
today
okay

04:00:59.110 --> 04:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:01:01.830 --> 04:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
yes chris oh thank you uh chairman i
 
04:01:03.750 --> 04:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
assume and please correct me if i'm
 
04:01:03.760 --> 04:01:04.790 align:start position:0%
assume and please correct me if i'm
wrong

04:01:04.790 --> 04:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
04:01:07.269 --> 04:01:07.279 align:start position:0%
that the broker-dealer community
 
04:01:09.030 --> 04:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
likes the fact that this is not a
 
04:01:09.040 --> 04:01:11.510 align:start position:0%
likes the fact that this is not a
security

04:01:11.510 --> 04:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
security
 
04:01:12.950 --> 04:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
no one's asked them
 
04:01:15.030 --> 04:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
there's been some real hesitation on on
 
04:01:16.469 --> 04:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
the part of the broker-dealer community
 
04:01:18.309 --> 04:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
to engage in this because they have
 
04:01:20.389 --> 04:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
concerns perhaps you know issues that
 
04:01:22.469 --> 04:01:22.479 align:start position:0%
representative herbert has raised you
 
04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
know face if a broker dealer is engaged
 
04:01:26.870 --> 04:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
in a certain type of activity then
 
04:01:28.550 --> 04:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
they're liable if they offer a certain
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
product on their platform they're
 
04:01:32.469 --> 04:01:32.479 align:start position:0%
responsible even though they may be just
 
04:01:35.349 --> 04:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
the trading entity for the transaction
 
04:01:37.429 --> 04:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
uh they may carry some liability a
 
04:01:39.349 --> 04:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
customer could come to them and say well
 
04:01:42.070 --> 04:01:42.080 align:start position:0%
your representative sold this to me
 
04:01:44.070 --> 04:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh therefore you're responsible so
 
04:01:45.670 --> 04:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
there's been some hesitation there but
 
04:01:46.790 --> 04:01:46.800 align:start position:0%
there are also some that are very
 
04:01:49.110 --> 04:01:49.120 align:start position:0%
progressive uh from our standpoint where
 
04:01:51.510 --> 04:01:51.520 align:start position:0%
they want to engage in this but uh it's
 
04:01:53.910 --> 04:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
not exclusively offered through or nor
 
04:01:55.510 --> 04:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
is it required to be offered through a
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
broken dealer well i just uh present
 
04:02:00.950 --> 04:02:00.960 align:start position:0%
questions two quick follow-ups uh years
 
04:02:03.189 --> 04:02:03.199 align:start position:0%
ago uh index annuities the
 
04:02:05.269 --> 04:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
broker-dealers did not want this to be
 
04:02:07.590 --> 04:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
security and finally the sec went along
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
with that right and so i'm looking at
 
04:02:11.030 --> 04:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
that similar but
 
04:02:14.710 --> 04:02:14.720 align:start position:0%
i read recently that the federal uh sec
 
04:02:17.189 --> 04:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
is still looking to try to find a way to
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
make this a security is that correct
 
04:02:21.670 --> 04:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
that is correct they're they're looking
 
04:02:24.070 --> 04:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
at it uh and it's been a long time that
 
04:02:26.150 --> 04:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
that they've been looking at it but uh
 
04:02:27.910 --> 04:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know we're essentially uh
 
04:02:29.189 --> 04:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
representative dealing with the
 
04:02:31.349 --> 04:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
legislation that's being proposed so and
 
04:02:32.950 --> 04:02:32.960 align:start position:0%
trying to make it you know fit with the
 
04:02:35.110 --> 04:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
statute thank you very much go ahead
 
04:02:35.120 --> 04:02:36.630 align:start position:0%
statute thank you very much go ahead
keith

04:02:36.630 --> 04:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
keith
 
04:02:40.070 --> 04:02:40.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so to speak to the sec issue um
 
04:02:42.790 --> 04:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
so digital tokens can be
 
04:02:45.189 --> 04:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
they can come in lots of different forms
 
04:02:46.870 --> 04:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh some of them can be issued by a
 
04:02:48.630 --> 04:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
central company
 
04:02:50.469 --> 04:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
as part of like an equity offering and
 
04:02:52.150 --> 04:02:52.160 align:start position:0%
that would that would be classified as a
 
04:02:53.590 --> 04:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
security i think everybody would agree
 
04:02:54.950 --> 04:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
on that
 
04:02:57.349 --> 04:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
but the sec is reluctant
 
04:02:59.750 --> 04:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
has been reluctant to classify
 
04:03:01.510 --> 04:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
something like bitcoin
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
as a security because there's no central
 
04:03:05.750 --> 04:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
company behind it there wasn't it like
 
04:03:07.910 --> 04:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
there wasn't an initial offering it just
 
04:03:10.229 --> 04:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
grew organically on the internet so
 
04:03:12.150 --> 04:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
things come in different forms when
 
04:03:14.150 --> 04:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about digital tokens
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
think of like a chuck e cheese token
 
04:03:17.670 --> 04:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
where you put it into the machine and it
 
04:03:19.189 --> 04:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
only works at chuck e cheese right
 
04:03:21.670 --> 04:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
that's a token this is this can be like
 
04:03:23.990 --> 04:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
a digital form of a token there's like
 
04:03:26.630 --> 04:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
there's a concept in the bill it talks
 
04:03:28.710 --> 04:03:28.720 align:start position:0%
about a consumptive
 
04:03:30.950 --> 04:03:30.960 align:start position:0%
purpose to the token so consumptive
 
04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
would mean that you use the token to
 
04:03:36.630 --> 04:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
facilitate some kind of computer
 
04:03:38.389 --> 04:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
network some kind of activity on the
 
04:03:41.349 --> 04:03:41.359 align:start position:0%
computer network and an example would be
 
04:03:44.790 --> 04:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
if youtube had uh a consumptive token
 
04:03:46.550 --> 04:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
attached to its offering you would put
 
04:03:49.030 --> 04:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
the token in on your computer to watch a
 
04:03:51.429 --> 04:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
video and you'd consume that that token
 
04:03:53.110 --> 04:03:53.120 align:start position:0%
so the consumptive
 
04:03:55.910 --> 04:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
purpose is a key portion of this bill
 
04:03:57.830 --> 04:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
and if it's consumptive then it's not a
 
04:03:59.030 --> 04:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's not wouldn't be considered a
 
04:04:02.710 --> 04:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:03.830 --> 04:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
go ahead rich
 
04:04:06.710 --> 04:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
yes i'd like to ask if there's a
 
04:04:09.030 --> 04:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
possibility that
 
04:04:10.630 --> 04:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
something that the federal government
 
04:04:12.070 --> 04:04:12.080 align:start position:0%
might do
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:19.990 --> 04:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
over could possibly override this if
 
04:04:22.550 --> 04:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
they decided that there that this should
 
04:04:23.990 --> 04:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
be considered
 
04:04:24.000 --> 04:04:25.189 align:start position:0%
be considered
uh

04:04:25.189 --> 04:04:25.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:27.670 --> 04:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
uh a security because people might
 
04:04:30.229 --> 04:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
invest in it and hold it until it's
 
04:04:32.950 --> 04:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
worth more and then sell it uh that it
 
04:04:35.110 --> 04:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
uh i mean could that happen down the
 
04:04:36.710 --> 04:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
line and if it did
 
04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
what would that do to our law
 
04:04:40.710 --> 04:04:40.720 align:start position:0%
it's already happening well
 
04:04:42.469 --> 04:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
representative there is always the issue
 
04:04:43.910 --> 04:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
of preemption
 
04:04:46.630 --> 04:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
and uh that they could uh
 
04:04:48.630 --> 04:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
decide that they want to occupy you know
 
04:04:50.309 --> 04:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
this space as they may say
 
04:04:54.229 --> 04:04:54.239 align:start position:0%
uh where this the sec is not there yet
 
04:04:56.550 --> 04:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
um you know new hampshire is is pretty
 
04:04:59.590 --> 04:04:59.600 align:start position:0%
much out front here um you know with
 
04:05:02.150 --> 04:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
this carve out um but anything's
 
04:05:06.309 --> 04:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:09.510 --> 04:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
and i suspect it could be something that
 
04:05:13.510 --> 04:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:15.510 --> 04:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
but the key thing is is that
 
04:05:17.030 --> 04:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
nothing's really changed in the sense
 
04:05:19.750 --> 04:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
that we already in new hampshire have
 
04:05:21.349 --> 04:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
made the decision that we weren't going
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
to regulate this that that
 
04:05:25.030 --> 04:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know that you're staying out of it
 
04:05:26.950 --> 04:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
and all we're doing is repeating that in
 
04:05:28.309 --> 04:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
the statute with these with this
 
04:05:28.319 --> 04:05:30.710 align:start position:0%
the statute with these with this
paragraphs

04:05:30.710 --> 04:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
paragraphs
 
04:05:36.630 --> 04:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:39.429 --> 04:05:39.439 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:05:39.439 --> 04:05:40.550 align:start position:0%
so um
basically

04:05:40.550 --> 04:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:05:43.510 --> 04:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
you you're not handling that i mean
 
04:05:45.269 --> 04:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
you're out of this the securities you
 
04:05:46.389 --> 04:05:46.399 align:start position:0%
don't want it to be you don't want to
 
04:05:48.309 --> 04:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
have anything to do with it except when
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
you're notified of something well there
 
04:05:53.269 --> 04:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
would be a notice filing uh
 
04:05:55.510 --> 04:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
with the state and the expectation is
 
04:05:57.189 --> 04:05:57.199 align:start position:0%
attorney mokokun mentioned that to be
 
04:05:59.429 --> 04:05:59.439 align:start position:0%
some form of disclosure that it's not
 
04:06:02.070 --> 04:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
regulated or approved by the state
 
04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
however in the event in the course of
 
04:06:05.670 --> 04:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
04:06:08.469 --> 04:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
the distribution of these tokens that
 
04:06:11.030 --> 04:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
somehow it turns into somebody starts to
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
promote it as an investment for example
 
04:06:15.429 --> 04:06:15.439 align:start position:0%
that you know because a lot of people do
 
04:06:17.349 --> 04:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
buy frankly they do buy you on
 
04:06:18.950 --> 04:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
speculation that the cost is going to
 
04:06:18.960 --> 04:06:19.910 align:start position:0%
speculation that the cost is going to
increase

04:06:19.910 --> 04:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
increase
 
04:06:21.670 --> 04:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
but if somebody was out there promoting
 
04:06:24.790 --> 04:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
this as an investment you know then
 
04:06:26.710 --> 04:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh and they they did so and it was
 
04:06:28.469 --> 04:06:28.479 align:start position:0%
fraudulent then uh the bureau would be
 
04:06:32.550 --> 04:06:32.560 align:start position:0%
able to step in and so um
 
04:06:35.110 --> 04:06:35.120 align:start position:0%
whenever um there's uh bitcoin
 
04:06:37.110 --> 04:06:37.120 align:start position:0%
transactions tokens
 
04:06:37.120 --> 04:06:37.990 align:start position:0%
transactions tokens
um

04:06:37.990 --> 04:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:40.790 --> 04:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
you get notified no you do not not at
 
04:06:43.189 --> 04:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
this point no this would only be if
 
04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
there was somebody actively
 
04:06:47.590 --> 04:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
marketing it as an investment
 
04:06:50.469 --> 04:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity how would they know that
 
04:06:53.830 --> 04:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh we would not uh out at the front end
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
uh know that it was being marketed
 
04:06:58.229 --> 04:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
somebody dropped a dime on them
 
04:06:59.750 --> 04:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
somebody what dropped a dime someone
 
04:07:02.389 --> 04:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
said hey did you know these people are
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
doing this then they they would step in
 
04:07:05.830 --> 04:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to be regulated but it's
 
04:07:07.590 --> 04:07:07.600 align:start position:0%
really not going to be regulated
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
only if there's fraudulent conduct that
 
04:07:11.590 --> 04:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
we determined that they were offering it
 
04:07:13.910 --> 04:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
as an investment and that it was that
 
04:07:15.990 --> 04:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
the offering was fraudulent
 
04:07:16.000 --> 04:07:17.269 align:start position:0%
the offering was fraudulent
otherwise

04:07:17.269 --> 04:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
04:07:19.590 --> 04:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
it is not subject to
 
04:07:22.389 --> 04:07:22.399 align:start position:0%
any registration excuse me registration
 
04:07:26.070 --> 04:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:28.070 --> 04:07:28.080 align:start position:0%
goes back to even actually when you use
 
04:07:30.469 --> 04:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
frm is an example
 
04:07:32.469 --> 04:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
okay and that is
 
04:07:32.479 --> 04:07:33.510 align:start position:0%
okay and that is
that

04:07:33.510 --> 04:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:07:36.630 --> 04:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
they were you know was that when the
 
04:07:38.790 --> 04:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
accusations security should have done
 
04:07:41.590 --> 04:07:41.600 align:start position:0%
something about it okay would been is
 
04:07:45.110 --> 04:07:45.120 align:start position:0%
how was it promoted how was it marketed
 
04:07:48.790 --> 04:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know as an investment opportunity
 
04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
then they would be it was you know
 
04:07:51.199 --> 04:07:52.229 align:start position:0%
then they would be it was you know
obviously

04:07:52.229 --> 04:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
04:07:53.670 --> 04:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
then the securities would have had to
 
04:07:56.870 --> 04:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
step in and just you know review
 
04:07:58.710 --> 04:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
what they had the filings and there
 
04:08:00.630 --> 04:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
there was no filings right they wouldn't
 
04:08:02.550 --> 04:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
they never filed anything
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
so but that yes they are our watchdog
 
04:08:07.910 --> 04:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
if you
 
04:08:10.229 --> 04:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
um feel like somebody is trying to sell
 
04:08:12.790 --> 04:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
you you know
 
04:08:14.550 --> 04:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
telling you something as though they
 
04:08:16.630 --> 04:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
were a broker and they're saying oh i
 
04:08:17.990 --> 04:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
got this great company you need to
 
04:08:20.550 --> 04:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
invest in
 
04:08:21.910 --> 04:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
these are the people you would call
 
04:08:24.389 --> 04:08:24.399 align:start position:0%
right and for the banking industry same
 
04:08:26.950 --> 04:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
thing it's being regulated but it's not
 
04:08:29.269 --> 04:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
or it's not being regulated or
 
04:08:31.110 --> 04:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh will you with the banking industry
 
04:08:32.550 --> 04:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
well your
 
04:08:33.910 --> 04:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
bank commissioner is right there to your
 
04:08:33.920 --> 04:08:35.349 align:start position:0%
bank commissioner is right there to your
right

04:08:35.349 --> 04:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:08:37.510 --> 04:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah so okay
 
04:08:37.520 --> 04:08:38.950 align:start position:0%
oh yeah yeah so okay
sorry

04:08:38.950 --> 04:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:08:38.960 --> 04:08:39.910 align:start position:0%
sorry
um

04:08:39.910 --> 04:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:39.920 --> 04:08:42.389 align:start position:0%
um
so

04:08:42.389 --> 04:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:45.750 --> 04:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
you will be regulating it or not
 
04:08:45.760 --> 04:08:46.950 align:start position:0%
you will be regulating it or not
no

04:08:46.950 --> 04:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:08:46.960 --> 04:08:48.070 align:start position:0%
no
okay

04:08:48.070 --> 04:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:08:49.830 --> 04:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
sorry so the bill is about regulation
 
04:08:51.349 --> 04:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like there's not going to
 
04:08:52.710 --> 04:08:52.720 align:start position:0%
be right now we have to remember what's
 
04:08:54.790 --> 04:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
the law in new hampshire there is no
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
regulation whatsoever and the banking
 
04:08:59.349 --> 04:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
department has if you were to go on to
 
04:09:01.030 --> 04:09:01.040 align:start position:0%
their web page they will make it clear
 
04:09:03.910 --> 04:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
to you that they are not regulating
 
04:09:06.790 --> 04:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
these transactions whatsoever right well
 
04:09:06.800 --> 04:09:08.630 align:start position:0%
these transactions whatsoever right well
so

04:09:08.630 --> 04:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:11.349 --> 04:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
the only time we at banking get involved
 
04:09:13.750 --> 04:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
is if you have a money transmitter like
 
04:09:15.510 --> 04:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
wes think western union although i don't
 
04:09:17.590 --> 04:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
think they do any of this but an entity
 
04:09:21.030 --> 04:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
like western union that takes
 
04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
takes your cryptocurrency and
 
04:09:27.110 --> 04:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
gives somebody else cash
 
04:09:28.469 --> 04:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
fiat currency
 
04:09:31.110 --> 04:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
that's the only time we regulate
 
04:09:33.030 --> 04:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
an entity that
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
does the serve transactional work now
 
04:09:36.790 --> 04:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
theoretically one of our trust companies
 
04:09:38.950 --> 04:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
under current law could custody
 
04:09:42.389 --> 04:09:42.399 align:start position:0%
could hold crypto in custody
 
04:09:44.389 --> 04:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
um so there are some limited
 
04:09:45.990 --> 04:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances but
 
04:09:47.670 --> 04:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of like
 
04:09:50.070 --> 04:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
i want to go pay some i i
 
04:09:51.990 --> 04:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
have some cryptocurrency that i own and
 
04:09:53.189 --> 04:09:53.199 align:start position:0%
i want to go
 
04:09:54.950 --> 04:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
buy a beer down the street you know at
 
04:09:56.309 --> 04:09:56.319 align:start position:0%
the bar or what you know whatever you
 
04:09:58.309 --> 04:09:58.319 align:start position:0%
want to do with your cryptocurrency that
 
04:09:59.910 --> 04:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
transaction would not be regulated with
 
04:10:02.389 --> 04:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
us and i think that's analogous to what
 
04:10:03.750 --> 04:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
these folks are saying but i don't want
 
04:10:08.469 --> 04:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:11.590 --> 04:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
you okay all right
 
04:10:15.110 --> 04:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative herbert so
 
04:10:18.309 --> 04:10:18.319 align:start position:0%

i'm nervous about it because it just
went

04:10:32.950 --> 04:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
went
 
04:10:34.710 --> 04:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
you know it looks like it could be kind
 
04:10:36.550 --> 04:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
of sketchy so
 
04:10:38.950 --> 04:10:38.960 align:start position:0%

i guess maybe why don't you come up take
 
04:11:18.870 --> 04:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:23.750 --> 04:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:26.710 --> 04:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
no you won't get the cash
 
04:11:26.720 --> 04:11:28.550 align:start position:0%
no you won't get the cash
okay

04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:11:30.149 --> 04:11:30.159 align:start position:0%
so you're saying
 
04:11:31.349 --> 04:11:31.359 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure i understand
 
04:11:33.349 --> 04:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
you you're saying somebody walk you buy
 
04:11:34.870 --> 04:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
a bit you have a bitcoin in your
 
04:11:36.950 --> 04:11:36.960 align:start position:0%
possession or a fraction of wine and i
 
04:11:38.389 --> 04:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
paid dollars for it that you paid
 
04:11:39.990 --> 04:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
dollars for and you want to go and do
 
04:11:42.710 --> 04:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
like a currency exchange at a bank you
 
04:11:44.710 --> 04:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
want to turn it back to dollars
 
04:11:46.229 --> 04:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't think there's any banks
 
04:11:49.189 --> 04:11:49.199 align:start position:0%
that do that to my knowledge so i'm not
 
04:11:49.199 --> 04:11:49.990 align:start position:0%
that do that to my knowledge so i'm not
sure

04:11:49.990 --> 04:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:11:51.429 --> 04:11:51.439 align:start position:0%
because they would
 
04:11:51.439 --> 04:11:52.389 align:start position:0%
because they would
paypal

04:11:52.389 --> 04:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
paypal
 
04:11:53.830 --> 04:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
paypal does it
 
04:11:56.870 --> 04:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
paypal paypal paypal will do it for you
 
04:11:59.590 --> 04:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what mr ma went to jail for
 
04:12:00.830 --> 04:12:00.840 align:start position:0%
in china
 
04:12:03.590 --> 04:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
right who yeah there's a guy in china
 
04:12:05.830 --> 04:12:05.840 align:start position:0%
that was super billionaire
 
04:12:08.229 --> 04:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
he's he wanted to start a paypal and
 
04:12:10.229 --> 04:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
china didn't like it anyway
 
04:12:11.910 --> 04:12:11.920 align:start position:0%
the point is
 
04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
i can't give him that doesn't do that
 
04:12:15.990 --> 04:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to doesn't do i'm trying to
 
04:12:17.910 --> 04:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
figure out how the transactions happen
 
04:12:20.229 --> 04:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
we don't we don't regulate ex people
 
04:12:22.070 --> 04:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
that just exchange it
 
04:12:24.550 --> 04:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
so you wanna you have crypto you wanna
 
04:12:27.030 --> 04:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
trade it in for dollars we don't touch
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
that transaction that's like that's a
 
04:12:30.870 --> 04:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
pure exchange
 
04:12:32.870 --> 04:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to transmit that to
 
04:12:35.110 --> 04:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
somebody else
 
04:12:37.030 --> 04:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
and there was cash involved so you
 
04:12:39.269 --> 04:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to you want to
 
04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
you wanted to get rid of your get rid of
 
04:12:44.389 --> 04:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
your crypt i can't even think of i'm
 
04:12:44.399 --> 04:12:45.510 align:start position:0%
your crypt i can't even think of i'm
sorry

04:12:45.510 --> 04:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:12:47.110 --> 04:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i'm following all the token
 
04:12:49.030 --> 04:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
your token yeah you want you want to
 
04:12:52.309 --> 04:12:52.319 align:start position:0%
come in with your say you want to pay
 
04:12:54.630 --> 04:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt
 
04:12:56.070 --> 04:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
for something
 
04:12:56.080 --> 04:12:57.429 align:start position:0%
for something
or

04:12:57.429 --> 04:12:57.439 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:12:59.429 --> 04:12:59.439 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to provide an example that
 
04:13:01.990 --> 04:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
would be regulated so you have crypto
 
04:13:03.990 --> 04:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
you want to pay somebody for something
 
04:13:05.830 --> 04:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
using like for example like an entity
 
04:13:07.910 --> 04:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
like paypal but chairman hunt says i
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
only want cash
 
04:13:13.110 --> 04:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
the the end paypal in that i'm not even
 
04:13:15.110 --> 04:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
sure they do this but they actually they
 
04:13:16.950 --> 04:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
do they do this okay i don't know each
 
04:13:18.790 --> 04:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
one's business model we regulate paypal
 
04:13:20.550 --> 04:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
they're licensed with us
 
04:13:22.710 --> 04:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
so we would examine them to make sure
 
04:13:25.030 --> 04:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
that transaction was conducted securely
 
04:13:27.030 --> 04:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
and appropriately exactly so the only
 
04:13:28.550 --> 04:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
time they would get involved is if they
 
04:13:29.750 --> 04:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
say there was something wrong with the
 
04:13:29.760 --> 04:13:31.429 align:start position:0%
say there was something wrong with the
transaction

04:13:31.429 --> 04:13:31.439 align:start position:0%
transaction
 
04:13:33.189 --> 04:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
and you thought it was paypal who
 
04:13:34.950 --> 04:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
screwed up and you filed a complaint
 
04:13:36.389 --> 04:13:36.399 align:start position:0%
with you would file a complaint with
 
04:13:39.189 --> 04:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
them we also examined them and you
 
04:13:40.950 --> 04:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
they would examine it so
 
04:13:40.960 --> 04:13:41.750 align:start position:0%
they would examine it so
but

04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:13:43.830 --> 04:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
paypal is not a bank
 
04:13:46.070 --> 04:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
right that is correct
 
04:13:46.080 --> 04:13:46.870 align:start position:0%
right that is correct
so

04:13:46.870 --> 04:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:48.790 --> 04:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
they're just a money transfer full faith
 
04:13:50.550 --> 04:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
and credit behind this transaction is
 
04:13:50.560 --> 04:13:53.189 align:start position:0%
and credit behind this transaction is
paypal

04:13:53.189 --> 04:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:53.199 --> 04:13:55.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:13:55.429 --> 04:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:13:56.950 --> 04:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
you're looking for full faith but there
 
04:13:59.030 --> 04:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
is no foreign did you understand the
 
04:14:01.670 --> 04:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
expression the full faith is is that you
 
04:14:04.710 --> 04:14:04.720 align:start position:0%
that that piece of paper that tender
 
04:14:06.710 --> 04:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
you the faith is that you that the
 
04:14:08.389 --> 04:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
united states stands behind that it
 
04:14:11.349 --> 04:14:11.359 align:start position:0%
really is worth a dollar
 
04:14:12.950 --> 04:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
right okay even though the federal
 
04:14:14.550 --> 04:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
reserve stands behind the dollar right
 
04:14:17.189 --> 04:14:17.199 align:start position:0%
but the federal reserve the full faith
 
04:14:18.389 --> 04:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
is that
 
04:14:19.830 --> 04:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
the federal reserve was created by the
 
04:14:24.070 --> 04:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:24.080 --> 04:14:27.910 align:start position:0%
 
chris

04:14:27.910 --> 04:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:29.910 --> 04:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
oh sorry
 
04:14:31.990 --> 04:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i've got a
 
04:14:33.670 --> 04:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
question for the commissioner and by the
 
04:14:36.309 --> 04:14:36.319 align:start position:0%
way congratulations
 
04:14:37.990 --> 04:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
i know you've been sworn in as the new
 
04:14:39.750 --> 04:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
banking commissioner which is wonderful
 
04:14:42.950 --> 04:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
because we spent a lot of time together
 
04:14:44.950 --> 04:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
i've got a question because bitcoin can
 
04:14:47.110 --> 04:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
also be property
 
04:14:49.750 --> 04:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
can it be real estate
 
04:14:53.990 --> 04:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:55.429 --> 04:14:55.439 align:start position:0%
and that might be for representative
 
04:14:58.070 --> 04:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
amman yeah i so i do know that what i
 
04:14:59.510 --> 04:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
would say is that i know blockchain
 
04:15:01.349 --> 04:15:01.359 align:start position:0%
technology itself can be used for a lot
 
04:15:02.950 --> 04:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
of different purposes that are somewhat
 
04:15:04.710 --> 04:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
outside the scope of this discussion and
 
04:15:06.630 --> 04:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
outside of our regulatory jurisdiction
 
04:15:08.469 --> 04:15:08.479 align:start position:0%
okay people use the the ledger
 
04:15:10.630 --> 04:15:10.640 align:start position:0%
technology to do
 
04:15:10.640 --> 04:15:11.590 align:start position:0%
technology to do
tons

04:15:11.590 --> 04:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
tons
 
04:15:12.950 --> 04:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
potentially do lots and lots of
 
04:15:14.229 --> 04:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
different things and that's very
 
04:15:15.590 --> 04:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
different than like
 
04:15:18.870 --> 04:15:18.880 align:start position:0%
kind of this exchange of funds concept
 
04:15:22.149 --> 04:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about um but perhaps
 
04:15:23.670 --> 04:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
representative amendment yeah go ahead
 
04:15:23.680 --> 04:15:24.550 align:start position:0%
representative amendment yeah go ahead
keith

04:15:24.550 --> 04:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
keith
 
04:15:26.550 --> 04:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
yeah that was a good explanation yeah so
 
04:15:26.560 --> 04:15:28.070 align:start position:0%
yeah that was a good explanation yeah so
um

04:15:28.070 --> 04:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:29.590 --> 04:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
i think mostly we're talking about
 
04:15:31.349 --> 04:15:31.359 align:start position:0%
things that are happening in the virtual
 
04:15:34.550 --> 04:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
space right so these tokens you
 
04:15:35.830 --> 04:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
i think i mentioned in my earlier
 
04:15:38.149 --> 04:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
testimony that it has to do with proving
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
ownership that's really like this one of
 
04:15:41.830 --> 04:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
the core concepts of this and we're
 
04:15:44.630 --> 04:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
proving ownership about digital tokens
 
04:15:47.349 --> 04:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's bitcoin or some other
 
04:15:48.870 --> 04:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
token that's used for some specific
 
04:15:48.880 --> 04:15:49.830 align:start position:0%
token that's used for some specific
purpose

04:15:49.830 --> 04:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
04:15:52.550 --> 04:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
but the idea of tying the proof of
 
04:15:54.950 --> 04:15:54.960 align:start position:0%
ownership to the physical world
 
04:15:56.950 --> 04:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
maybe a piece of property or a car or
 
04:15:56.960 --> 04:15:58.550 align:start position:0%
maybe a piece of property or a car or
something

04:15:58.550 --> 04:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
something
 
04:16:00.630 --> 04:16:00.640 align:start position:0%
i think that's coming in in the not too
 
04:16:02.309 --> 04:16:02.319 align:start position:0%
distant future but we're not quite there
 
04:16:04.469 --> 04:16:04.479 align:start position:0%
yet but you could imagine instead of
 
04:16:06.469 --> 04:16:06.479 align:start position:0%
registering your deed with
 
04:16:08.229 --> 04:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh you know your town clerk that you
 
04:16:11.110 --> 04:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
register it on a state-approved ledger
 
04:16:13.830 --> 04:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
system and that proves your ownership
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
and maybe as part of that there's a
 
04:16:17.110 --> 04:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
smart contract where there's a transfer
 
04:16:18.870 --> 04:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
tax of you know one percent or whatever
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
it is and every time a piece of property
 
04:16:22.550 --> 04:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
changes hand the states the state gets
 
04:16:24.550 --> 04:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
that one percent i mean you could you
 
04:16:26.950 --> 04:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
could definitely do that in uh
 
04:16:29.429 --> 04:16:29.439 align:start position:0%
you know in the blockchain ledger space
 
04:16:30.950 --> 04:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
but i think right now we're just talking
 
04:16:32.710 --> 04:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
about the virtual world and not
 
04:16:34.469 --> 04:16:34.479 align:start position:0%
necessarily the physical world now
 
04:16:37.110 --> 04:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
another question i got is um one of the
 
04:16:37.120 --> 04:16:38.229 align:start position:0%
another question i got is um one of the
um

04:16:38.229 --> 04:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
people that that testified before our
 
04:16:42.309 --> 04:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
committee last week was lisa tripp and
 
04:16:44.309 --> 04:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
she's a nurse practitioner in portsmouth
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
and she gave me a call at home
 
04:16:48.389 --> 04:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
and told me how terribly important it
 
04:16:50.070 --> 04:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
was to pass
 
04:16:53.510 --> 04:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
some of this legislation so that her
 
04:16:53.520 --> 04:16:54.790 align:start position:0%
some of this legislation so that her
patients

04:16:54.790 --> 04:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
patients
 
04:16:57.590 --> 04:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
can pay in bitcoin
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:01.680 --> 04:17:03.030 align:start position:0%
 
affecting

04:17:03.030 --> 04:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
affecting
 
04:17:04.550 --> 04:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
any of the banking department or is that
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
strictly a private transaction
 
04:17:09.750 --> 04:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
so if i remember her testimony correctly
 
04:17:12.229 --> 04:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
she referenced using coinbase coinbase
 
04:17:13.990 --> 04:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
is regulated by us they have a license
 
04:17:16.389 --> 04:17:16.399 align:start position:0%
to conduct money transmission um and
 
04:17:17.349 --> 04:17:17.359 align:start position:0%
they do
 
04:17:19.189 --> 04:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
interact with cryptocurrency as well as
 
04:17:20.790 --> 04:17:20.800 align:start position:0%
fiat currency
 
04:17:22.469 --> 04:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
so they're already licensed by us to do
 
04:17:24.790 --> 04:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
exactly what she described okay so the
 
04:17:24.800 --> 04:17:25.990 align:start position:0%
exactly what she described okay so the
advantage

04:17:25.990 --> 04:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
advantage
 
04:17:27.110 --> 04:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
for her
 
04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
clients would be because they don't use
 
04:17:31.189 --> 04:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
a bank
 
04:17:33.110 --> 04:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
but they are still protected by the
 
04:17:35.750 --> 04:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
banking department is that correct i i
 
04:17:38.070 --> 04:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
don't remember her testimony in that
 
04:17:40.149 --> 04:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
level of detail i i
 
04:17:42.309 --> 04:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
i apologize i don't want to speak to it
 
04:17:44.550 --> 04:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
but to the extent she was discussing
 
04:17:46.790 --> 04:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
interacting with coinbase coinbase is
 
04:17:54.309 --> 04:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:56.950 --> 04:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
everybody comfortable
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:02.790 --> 04:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
bitcoin i mean this bill you want this
 
04:18:05.590 --> 04:18:05.600 align:start position:0%
to be regulated but yet it doesn't seem
 
04:18:05.600 --> 04:18:06.950 align:start position:0%
to be regulated but yet it doesn't seem
like

04:18:06.950 --> 04:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
like
 
04:18:09.830 --> 04:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to be regulated but
 
04:18:11.590 --> 04:18:11.600 align:start position:0%
they'll be
 
04:18:13.349 --> 04:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
everybody in this room will be notified
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
the word regulation is maybe where you
 
04:18:17.590 --> 04:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
have to understand what we're trying to
 
04:18:19.990 --> 04:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
where we're going with it
 
04:18:22.149 --> 04:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
because it's really an industry that's
 
04:18:24.790 --> 04:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
just growing and changing right okay
 
04:18:27.750 --> 04:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
and so in terms of regulating like we
 
04:18:31.510 --> 04:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
regulate securities or banking
 
04:18:34.790 --> 04:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
no we we really don't want that we
 
04:18:37.030 --> 04:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
we want it to be on its own but so what
 
04:18:39.670 --> 04:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do with the ucc statute
 
04:18:43.830 --> 04:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
is that it recognizes its existence
 
04:18:46.229 --> 04:18:46.239 align:start position:0%
and that it is a business transaction
 
04:18:47.670 --> 04:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
that occurs
 
04:18:47.680 --> 04:18:48.630 align:start position:0%
that occurs
between

04:18:48.630 --> 04:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:18:50.950 --> 04:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
individuals it's a business transaction
 
04:18:53.189 --> 04:18:53.199 align:start position:0%
and this sets up the framework to allow
 
04:18:55.349 --> 04:18:55.359 align:start position:0%
those transactions to occur
 
04:18:59.030 --> 04:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
for all kinds of purposes the regulator
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
is the attorney general's office
 
04:19:04.309 --> 04:19:04.319 align:start position:0%
or your favorite trial lawyer
 
04:19:05.750 --> 04:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay the triple damages under the
 
04:19:07.910 --> 04:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act because at the
 
04:19:09.429 --> 04:19:09.439 align:start position:0%
end of the day
 
04:19:12.149 --> 04:19:12.159 align:start position:0%
these departments are not regulating
 
04:19:14.229 --> 04:19:14.239 align:start position:0%
them like we regulate
 
04:19:21.990 --> 04:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:23.030 --> 04:19:23.040 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:19:23.040 --> 04:19:24.229 align:start position:0%
all right
and

04:19:24.229 --> 04:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:25.910 --> 04:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
much that i'm dare to say it is there
 
04:19:27.910 --> 04:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
anybody in the audience who has anything
 
04:19:30.710 --> 04:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
else they would like to add or share or
 
04:19:32.710 --> 04:19:32.720 align:start position:0%
become aware of otherwise
 
04:19:35.670 --> 04:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
we'll take this up again next wednesday
 
04:19:45.269 --> 04:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:45.279 --> 04:19:46.469 align:start position:0%
 
yep

04:19:46.469 --> 04:19:46.479 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:19:49.189 --> 04:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
next wednesday is going to be
 
04:19:49.199 --> 04:19:50.469 align:start position:0%
next wednesday is going to be
uh

04:19:50.469 --> 04:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:19:50.479 --> 04:19:51.349 align:start position:0%
uh
just

04:19:51.349 --> 04:19:51.359 align:start position:0%

in the morning we have we're not gonna
 
04:19:56.469 --> 04:19:56.479 align:start position:0%

04:20:48.870 --> 04:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:48.880 --> 04:20:50.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:20:50.070 --> 04:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:20:54.630 --> 04:20:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:58.149 --> 04:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
all right moving right along
 
04:20:59.670 --> 04:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
prohibiting the sale of products
 
04:21:01.910 --> 04:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
containing intentionally added pfes do
 
04:21:05.510 --> 04:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:07.269 --> 04:21:07.279 align:start position:0%
mr chair he's not here but i've been
 
04:21:08.550 --> 04:21:08.560 align:start position:0%
talking to him because i'm very
 
04:21:10.710 --> 04:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
interested in this bill he's working so
 
04:21:13.590 --> 04:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
he wasn't able to come today okay um and
 
04:21:15.910 --> 04:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
he didn't get information from maine
 
04:21:18.149 --> 04:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
either you know i've been asking for you
 
04:21:19.910 --> 04:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
know documentation about the bill that
 
04:21:22.070 --> 04:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
was passed in maine and he didn't he
 
04:21:24.389 --> 04:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
didn't forward it to me so
 
04:21:26.229 --> 04:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know
 
04:21:28.710 --> 04:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
is there someone from the department of
 
04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
environmental services here he's sitting
 
04:21:32.469 --> 04:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
right behind you
 
04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
so at any rate uh at this
 
04:21:38.630 --> 04:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
oh he's yours he's one of yours okay
 
04:21:40.550 --> 04:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
these masks you know i never know who
 
04:21:41.990 --> 04:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
everybody is
 
04:21:43.910 --> 04:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
so they were here before and they
 
04:21:46.149 --> 04:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
basically said that this you know this
 
04:21:47.269 --> 04:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
is a bear
 
04:21:49.990 --> 04:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
and and it's a nightmare because really
 
04:21:51.910 --> 04:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
the problem is not you know in terms of
 
04:21:52.870 --> 04:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
originally we were thinking about
 
04:21:54.389 --> 04:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
drinking water but we solved that
 
04:21:56.870 --> 04:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
problem in this committee last year but
 
04:21:58.950 --> 04:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
this is the issue of whatever is made
 
04:22:02.469 --> 04:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
with pfas and then ends up in the uh in
 
04:22:05.030 --> 04:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
in the dump and therefore poisons the
 
04:22:07.830 --> 04:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
water so i i think at this point the
 
04:22:09.269 --> 04:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
best thing for us to do with this bill
 
04:22:11.590 --> 04:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
is just to interim study this bill yeah
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
i i i thought um
 
04:22:15.990 --> 04:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
i was involved with the gmo
 
04:22:19.030 --> 04:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
labeling and i i thought perhaps we
 
04:22:19.040 --> 04:22:19.830 align:start position:0%
labeling and i i thought perhaps we
could

04:22:19.830 --> 04:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
could
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
address some of these issues through
 
04:22:25.590 --> 04:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
labeling the products that have pfas and
 
04:22:25.600 --> 04:22:27.750 align:start position:0%
labeling the products that have pfas and
pfoas

04:22:27.750 --> 04:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
pfoas
 
04:22:31.510 --> 04:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
similar to you know how we now label uh
 
04:22:31.520 --> 04:22:32.710 align:start position:0%
similar to you know how we now label uh
gmos

04:22:32.710 --> 04:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
gmos
 
04:22:34.710 --> 04:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
oh glad you brought that up um actually
 
04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
that legislation never did pass okay and
 
04:22:40.710 --> 04:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
but that um it was a federal
 
04:22:42.229 --> 04:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
federal issue
 
04:22:44.229 --> 04:22:44.239 align:start position:0%
okay so it's it's really a federal issue
 
04:22:47.030 --> 04:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
i mean if we wanted these products to be
 
04:22:48.309 --> 04:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
labeled pf
 
04:22:50.149 --> 04:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
but i think that i think the one thing
 
04:22:52.389 --> 04:22:52.399 align:start position:0%
that that amazed me because i kept
 
04:22:54.389 --> 04:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
wondering why where this all coming from
 
04:22:56.630 --> 04:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
was that the all of a sudden
 
04:22:58.870 --> 04:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
it seems like everything is made with
 
04:22:58.880 --> 04:23:02.149 align:start position:0%
it seems like everything is made with
pfas

04:23:02.149 --> 04:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:03.590 --> 04:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
so i don't know how mane is going to
 
04:23:05.670 --> 04:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
solve that problem but uh they probably
 
04:23:07.910 --> 04:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
ended up with just with disclosure but
 
04:23:07.920 --> 04:23:08.950 align:start position:0%
ended up with just with disclosure but
again

04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:23:10.950 --> 04:23:10.960 align:start position:0%
you know it seemed what it sounds like
 
04:23:13.269 --> 04:23:13.279 align:start position:0%
the upshot is is that if a you have to
 
04:23:15.670 --> 04:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
know that it has pfas and b is you got
 
04:23:17.429 --> 04:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
to treat it like mercury
 
04:23:19.269 --> 04:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
you know you got to you know bring it to
 
04:23:21.750 --> 04:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
the special special facilities to have
 
04:23:24.309 --> 04:23:24.319 align:start position:0%
it done taking care of
 
04:23:26.389 --> 04:23:26.399 align:start position:0%
yes chris
 
04:23:29.189 --> 04:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
um so if we wanted to
 
04:23:31.189 --> 04:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
close to the mic
 
04:23:33.750 --> 04:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to uh
 
04:23:38.389 --> 04:23:38.399 align:start position:0%
prohibit uh dumping pfas uh
 
04:23:41.030 --> 04:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
material into our landfills
 
04:23:44.630 --> 04:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
if that was a goal of the legislation
 
04:23:46.950 --> 04:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
would that come in under the interim
 
04:23:48.630 --> 04:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
study uh
 
04:23:50.630 --> 04:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
the interim study is to aid i think most
 
04:23:52.149 --> 04:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
importantly is to follow what happened
 
04:23:53.990 --> 04:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
happening in maine and how they're how
 
04:23:55.910 --> 04:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
they're handling their statute
 
04:23:57.910 --> 04:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day yeah you're
 
04:23:59.429 --> 04:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
you've got to treat the stuff like
 
04:24:01.910 --> 04:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
asbestos or mercury
 
04:24:04.149 --> 04:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
and how do we you know how do we deal
 
04:24:05.990 --> 04:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
you know deal with i mean i
 
04:24:07.990 --> 04:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
i know i always hear about these sites
 
04:24:09.349 --> 04:24:09.359 align:start position:0%
to where people are going in and
 
04:24:11.189 --> 04:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
removing the asbestos but where are they
 
04:24:13.590 --> 04:24:13.600 align:start position:0%
taking that asbestos uh what is the
 
04:24:15.110 --> 04:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
proper handling i
 
04:24:16.389 --> 04:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
i'm that's
 
04:24:17.510 --> 04:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
not in my
 
04:24:17.520 --> 04:24:19.349 align:start position:0%
not in my
prayer

04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
prayer
 
04:24:21.189 --> 04:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
that's not my committee our committee
 
04:24:23.030 --> 04:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
and another problem with this
 
04:24:24.950 --> 04:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
bill is there's a there's a lot of pfas
 
04:24:27.670 --> 04:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
coming in from other states because uh
 
04:24:30.550 --> 04:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
companies waste management companies are
 
04:24:33.590 --> 04:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know filling up our landfills uh 50
 
04:24:35.189 --> 04:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
or 60 percent of our landfills is now
 
04:24:37.030 --> 04:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
coming from out of state and
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
if they don't have any regulation then
 
04:24:42.070 --> 04:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
we will still be getting pfoas in our
 
04:24:45.110 --> 04:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
landfills because of you know the
 
04:24:46.630 --> 04:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
industry those agreements that allow
 
04:24:50.830 --> 04:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
them to deliver their garbage to us
 
04:24:53.830 --> 04:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
so okay is it everybody comfortable with
 
04:24:56.149 --> 04:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
interim studying with
 
04:24:57.910 --> 04:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
be fast so at least we can keep an eye
 
04:25:00.790 --> 04:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
on it and see what's happening there
 
04:25:04.149 --> 04:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
okay great now we're on schedule
 
04:25:05.990 --> 04:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay prohibiting banks or businesses
 
04:25:08.630 --> 04:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
from using social credit scores so uh we
 
04:25:10.950 --> 04:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
have an amendment as is people got
 
04:25:13.030 --> 04:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
copies of the amendment
 
04:25:14.950 --> 04:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
um the one thing i would say i would
 
04:25:16.950 --> 04:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
change in the amendment
 
04:25:18.870 --> 04:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
is um it left the
 
04:25:21.110 --> 04:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
section one the preamble
 
04:25:21.120 --> 04:25:21.910 align:start position:0%
section one the preamble
and

04:25:21.910 --> 04:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:22.790 --> 04:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
i would
 
04:25:24.070 --> 04:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have the amendment drawn up
 
04:25:26.630 --> 04:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
to remove that
 
04:25:28.710 --> 04:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
from the bill
 
04:25:30.950 --> 04:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
and the other question that many people
 
04:25:34.389 --> 04:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
are asking is why did i remove the
 
04:25:37.269 --> 04:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
penalties that were in the original bill
 
04:25:39.590 --> 04:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
and the reason being is that both these
 
04:25:42.550 --> 04:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
statutes actually have penalties already
 
04:25:44.550 --> 04:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
in them so the banking department
 
04:25:47.429 --> 04:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
already has the power of restitution
 
04:25:47.439 --> 04:25:48.389 align:start position:0%
already has the power of restitution
and

04:25:48.389 --> 04:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:25:50.630 --> 04:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
ability to pull the license of a
 
04:25:50.640 --> 04:25:52.710 align:start position:0%
ability to pull the license of a
facility

04:25:52.710 --> 04:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
facility
 
04:25:52.720 --> 04:25:55.670 align:start position:0%
facility
and

04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:59.110 --> 04:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
and the um the second section which
 
04:26:00.710 --> 04:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
which is actually third section in here
 
04:26:03.750 --> 04:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
the second with in when we printed is
 
04:26:06.229 --> 04:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection act and in the
 
04:26:08.710 --> 04:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act um there is
 
04:26:11.349 --> 04:26:11.359 align:start position:0%
penalties and as i stated earlier the
 
04:26:13.110 --> 04:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
penalties are
 
04:26:15.030 --> 04:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
triple damages
 
04:26:17.830 --> 04:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
and or if you you know and
 
04:26:19.590 --> 04:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
you have the right a private action so
 
04:26:21.590 --> 04:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
you don't necessarily have the attorney
 
04:26:23.990 --> 04:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
general will take on the case but
 
04:26:26.710 --> 04:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
um you can certainly hire a lawyer and
 
04:26:29.030 --> 04:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
sue sue whoever
 
04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
committed that crime
 
04:26:33.030 --> 04:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
yes representative bartlett thank you mr
 
04:26:34.790 --> 04:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
chair so just to be clear the
 
04:26:37.030 --> 04:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
declaration of purpose would be deleted
 
04:26:39.590 --> 04:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
is that correct correct um and that it
 
04:26:41.510 --> 04:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
never is part of the law anyway
 
04:26:42.870 --> 04:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's the that's one of the reasons i
 
04:26:45.189 --> 04:26:45.199 align:start position:0%
delete that okay yeah and then um so
 
04:26:47.510 --> 04:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
then the new sub paragraph two
 
04:26:49.269 --> 04:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
is where this amendment starts up but
 
04:26:50.550 --> 04:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
this amendment is still going to be
 
04:26:52.550 --> 04:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
amended again is that correct it'll say
 
04:26:53.910 --> 04:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
instead of saying amend the bill by
 
04:26:55.510 --> 04:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
replacing after section one they'll say
 
04:26:57.030 --> 04:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
amend the bill
 
04:26:59.110 --> 04:26:59.120 align:start position:0%
uh by re uh
 
04:27:01.750 --> 04:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
after the title
 
04:27:03.110 --> 04:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
i believe that's the way they say it
 
04:27:03.120 --> 04:27:05.830 align:start position:0%
i believe that's the way they say it
okay

04:27:05.830 --> 04:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:07.830 --> 04:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
have we got the amendment in front of me
 
04:27:09.269 --> 04:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
do i have it did you have it yes it was
 
04:27:10.550 --> 04:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
distributed last night you should have
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
printed it off
 
04:27:14.950 --> 04:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a pile here if you like one
 
04:27:22.790 --> 04:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:24.149 --> 04:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
careful don't trip
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
yeah oh it is okay i know i'm that's a
 
04:27:32.229 --> 04:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:35.670 --> 04:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
well every time i see somebody go near
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:03.269 --> 04:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:06.630 --> 04:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
so mr chair yep so this um
 
04:28:08.469 --> 04:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
really is just saying that i i have this
 
04:28:10.630 --> 04:28:10.640 align:start position:0%
i have was
 
04:28:10.640 --> 04:28:11.670 align:start position:0%
i have was
um

04:28:11.670 --> 04:28:11.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:13.110 --> 04:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
so this is just saying that it's
 
04:28:16.950 --> 04:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:19.590 --> 04:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
yeah discrimination correct okay i don't
 
04:28:23.990 --> 04:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:24.000 --> 04:29:01.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:29:01.110 --> 04:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:01.120 --> 04:29:14.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:29:14.790 --> 04:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:19.349 --> 04:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:21.910 --> 04:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um just thinking
 
04:29:24.389 --> 04:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
through the amendment um
 
04:29:27.429 --> 04:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
page two line one
 
04:29:29.269 --> 04:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
uh just talks about property or
 
04:29:30.950 --> 04:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
investments already owned wouldn't would
 
04:29:32.389 --> 04:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
that go towards
 
04:29:34.389 --> 04:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
someone's credit worthiness and would
 
04:29:34.399 --> 04:29:36.790 align:start position:0%
someone's credit worthiness and would
that

04:29:36.790 --> 04:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:39.110 --> 04:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
like excluding that from consideration
 
04:29:41.590 --> 04:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
would that be uh an issue just
 
04:29:45.269 --> 04:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:46.010 --> 04:29:46.020 align:start position:0%
which uh
 
04:29:46.020 --> 04:29:47.830 align:start position:0%
which uh
[Music]

04:29:47.830 --> 04:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:29:49.990 --> 04:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'll ask again so page two line one it
 
04:29:52.950 --> 04:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
says it's uh
 
04:29:55.510 --> 04:29:55.520 align:start position:0%
a bank can't discriminate against or
 
04:29:57.910 --> 04:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
pose a precondition based on and then
 
04:29:59.910 --> 04:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
line one page two property investments
 
04:30:01.429 --> 04:30:01.439 align:start position:0%
already owned and i think that might
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
speak to credit worthiness and maybe i'm
 
04:30:04.469 --> 04:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
just misunderstanding it crit in order
 
04:30:06.309 --> 04:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
to if you already have a
 
04:30:08.710 --> 04:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
banking relationship
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
you already have a loan
 
04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
they can't cancel the loan
 
04:30:15.110 --> 04:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
based on these
 
04:30:15.120 --> 04:30:17.349 align:start position:0%
based on these
criteria

04:30:17.349 --> 04:30:17.359 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
04:30:17.359 --> 04:30:25.189 align:start position:0%
criteria
okay

04:30:25.189 --> 04:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:29.830 --> 04:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:32.950 --> 04:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
uh that's true it wouldn't we've just by
 
04:30:34.710 --> 04:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
taking out the penalties we would remove
 
04:30:38.389 --> 04:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:40.790 --> 04:30:40.800 align:start position:0%
but i'm treating us with full steam
 
04:30:44.710 --> 04:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:47.670 --> 04:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:47.680 --> 04:30:48.550 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:30:48.550 --> 04:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:30:50.710 --> 04:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
04:30:53.990 --> 04:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
so if an individual
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
believed that he or she
 
04:30:58.870 --> 04:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
were a victim of this kind of
 
04:30:58.880 --> 04:31:00.389 align:start position:0%
were a victim of this kind of
discrimination

04:31:00.389 --> 04:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
04:31:00.399 --> 04:31:02.790 align:start position:0%
discrimination
uh

04:31:02.790 --> 04:31:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:05.429 --> 04:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
they would go to court and
 
04:31:07.670 --> 04:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
i mean what what would be what would be
 
04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
the uh and then have to prove right so
 
04:31:15.510 --> 04:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
if if they're if it was uh a bank
 
04:31:17.429 --> 04:31:17.439 align:start position:0%
then they would uh bring the complaint
 
04:31:19.990 --> 04:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
to the banking department
 
04:31:22.309 --> 04:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
and the banking department will
 
04:31:23.590 --> 04:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
they don't really have a hearing's
 
04:31:25.189 --> 04:31:25.199 align:start position:0%
officer i'm not sure how they would
 
04:31:25.199 --> 04:31:26.149 align:start position:0%
officer i'm not sure how they would
handle

04:31:26.149 --> 04:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
handle
 
04:31:28.070 --> 04:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
how to handle it but they would you know
 
04:31:30.710 --> 04:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
investigate to you know talk to the bank
 
04:31:32.389 --> 04:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
and get the bank to
 
04:31:34.630 --> 04:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
tell us you know would make come clean i
 
04:31:36.469 --> 04:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
would be very surprised that any bank
 
04:31:39.189 --> 04:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
would be foolish enough to
 
04:31:41.030 --> 04:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
cancel somebody over any of these things
 
04:31:41.040 --> 04:31:42.229 align:start position:0%
cancel somebody over any of these things
anyways

04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
04:31:44.790 --> 04:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
but you know the person had make the in
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
assuming that person if let's say the
 
04:31:49.269 --> 04:31:49.279 align:start position:0%
second section which would be a business
 
04:31:51.750 --> 04:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
if a business was discriminating
 
04:31:54.229 --> 04:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
the case on this and
 
04:31:56.229 --> 04:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
that you would have to have some you
 
04:31:57.510 --> 04:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
know you would go
 
04:31:58.870 --> 04:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
this is that would you would take to
 
04:32:00.630 --> 04:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
court or call up the attorney general's
 
04:32:00.640 --> 04:32:05.269 align:start position:0%
court or call up the attorney general's
office

04:32:05.269 --> 04:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:07.189 --> 04:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
represent below
 
04:32:10.790 --> 04:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
yeah um we had testimony uh last week by
 
04:32:13.830 --> 04:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
someone from the heartland institute
 
04:32:17.429 --> 04:32:17.439 align:start position:0%
and um i believe the legislation is
 
04:32:19.189 --> 04:32:19.199 align:start position:0%
pretty much coming from the heartland
 
04:32:19.199 --> 04:32:20.469 align:start position:0%
pretty much coming from the heartland
institute

04:32:20.469 --> 04:32:20.479 align:start position:0%
institute
 
04:32:20.479 --> 04:32:21.830 align:start position:0%
institute
and

04:32:21.830 --> 04:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:32:26.469 --> 04:32:26.479 align:start position:0%
i have a problem because it seems like
 
04:32:27.910 --> 04:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
this is
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
censorship i mean heartland has always
 
04:32:31.750 --> 04:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
been public about its ultimate goals to
 
04:32:34.070 --> 04:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
keep global warming alarmists from
 
04:32:36.229 --> 04:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
winning the public debate
 
04:32:38.389 --> 04:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like
 
04:32:40.389 --> 04:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
this is targeting
 
04:32:43.030 --> 04:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
um and the funders of heartland are also
 
04:32:45.910 --> 04:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
the big you know companies that ag big
 
04:32:49.189 --> 04:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
ag companies that monsantos and
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
i read up all about
 
04:32:53.429 --> 04:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
heartland institute so it sounds like
 
04:32:55.590 --> 04:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
they're really pushing their agenda and
 
04:32:57.510 --> 04:32:57.520 align:start position:0%
it seems like they're going to be
 
04:32:57.520 --> 04:32:58.710 align:start position:0%
it seems like they're going to be
censoring

04:32:58.710 --> 04:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
censoring
 
04:33:00.149 --> 04:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
um where
 
04:33:01.510 --> 04:33:01.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:33:03.750 --> 04:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
in their favor so that
 
04:33:05.750 --> 04:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
really they don't want people thinking
 
04:33:10.390 --> 04:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
that you know global warming is real
 
04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
so i i would hope and and i know jeff
 
04:33:14.709 --> 04:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
would like to add in but i would hope
 
04:33:14.719 --> 04:33:16.869 align:start position:0%
would like to add in but i would hope
that

04:33:16.869 --> 04:33:16.879 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:33:19.109 --> 04:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
the way that you know my name is at the
 
04:33:21.109 --> 04:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
top of this page here you know this
 
04:33:22.390 --> 04:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that i've you know been
 
04:33:25.910 --> 04:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
working on is that i have taken away
 
04:33:29.029 --> 04:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
anybody else's ownership of why this
 
04:33:31.750 --> 04:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
bill is in front of us other than i want
 
04:33:33.269 --> 04:33:33.279 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we don't have
 
04:33:33.279 --> 04:33:34.949 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we don't have
discrimination

04:33:34.949 --> 04:33:34.959 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
04:33:36.789 --> 04:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
and and that
 
04:33:38.551 --> 04:33:38.561 align:start position:0%
whether it's true or not and
 
04:33:41.109 --> 04:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
discriminating someone because of their
 
04:33:43.510 --> 04:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
behavior and turn and
 
04:33:45.590 --> 04:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
particularly their politics
 
04:33:47.109 --> 04:33:47.119 align:start position:0%
and saying no i'm not going to do
 
04:33:49.189 --> 04:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
business with you because you are a
 
04:33:51.510 --> 04:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
climate denialist
 
04:33:53.830 --> 04:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
um i think is just wrong that you know
 
04:33:53.840 --> 04:33:55.429 align:start position:0%
um i think is just wrong that you know
that's

04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
that's
 
04:33:58.869 --> 04:33:58.879 align:start position:0%
uh i don't think they any any business
 
04:34:01.910 --> 04:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
or financial institution or in business
 
04:34:03.830 --> 04:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
either one should not be telling someone
 
04:34:05.029 --> 04:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to do business with you
 
04:34:06.789 --> 04:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
because you're a climate denialist no
 
04:34:09.429 --> 04:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
but the the the opposite end people that
 
04:34:10.709 --> 04:34:10.719 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:34:12.150 --> 04:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
understand that you know there is
 
04:34:13.750 --> 04:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
climate change and there is global
 
04:34:15.990 --> 04:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
warming i mean are you protecting
 
04:34:19.029 --> 04:34:19.039 align:start position:0%
those that side as well sure
 
04:34:20.470 --> 04:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh well
 
04:34:23.510 --> 04:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of if those people are going to
 
04:34:27.750 --> 04:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh assert their position
 
04:34:30.470 --> 04:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
by taking it out on someone else's
 
04:34:32.390 --> 04:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
business livelihood
 
04:34:34.709 --> 04:34:34.719 align:start position:0%
and i would say no i don't agree with
 
04:34:34.719 --> 04:34:40.949 align:start position:0%
and i would say no i don't agree with
them

04:34:40.949 --> 04:34:40.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:43.590 --> 04:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
you want to add to that jeff all i was
 
04:34:44.789 --> 04:34:44.799 align:start position:0%
going to say is
 
04:34:46.070 --> 04:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
i wrote this
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
not the heartland institute
 
04:34:50.789 --> 04:34:50.799 align:start position:0%
just so i i don't i don't know what
 
04:34:52.390 --> 04:34:52.400 align:start position:0%
their agenda is and i don't really care
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
what their agenda is the point is
 
04:34:55.439 --> 04:34:56.310 align:start position:0%
what their agenda is the point is
that

04:34:56.310 --> 04:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:34:59.109 --> 04:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
discrimination on either side
 
04:34:59.119 --> 04:34:59.910 align:start position:0%
discrimination on either side
so

04:34:59.910 --> 04:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
your employer
 
04:35:03.830 --> 04:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
pays your paycheck and let's say it's
 
04:35:06.070 --> 04:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
directly deposited to a bank
 
04:35:07.349 --> 04:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:35:09.910 --> 04:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
suddenly this bank says
 
04:35:12.070 --> 04:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
we don't like your politics
 
04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
so we are not going to accept
 
04:35:16.709 --> 04:35:16.719 align:start position:0%
not only your businesses
 
04:35:18.230 --> 04:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
transactions we're not going to process
 
04:35:19.349 --> 04:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
your credit cards we're not going to
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
honor your checks we're not going to
 
04:35:23.029 --> 04:35:23.039 align:start position:0%
receive your deposits and all of your
 
04:35:26.230 --> 04:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
employees whose paychecks are deposited
 
04:35:27.990 --> 04:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
at that bank we're not going to accept
 
04:35:29.990 --> 04:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
those anymore either because we don't
 
04:35:31.590 --> 04:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
like your politics we don't i don't know
 
04:35:33.590 --> 04:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
who's that is whatever side that is you
 
04:35:36.869 --> 04:35:36.879 align:start position:0%
can say hey but i i believe in climate
 
04:35:36.879 --> 04:35:37.990 align:start position:0%
can say hey but i i believe in climate
change

04:35:37.990 --> 04:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
change
 
04:35:40.310 --> 04:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
and they the bank says well we don't
 
04:35:41.670 --> 04:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe in climate change
 
04:35:43.590 --> 04:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
the bank says well we do it's both sides
 
04:35:45.269 --> 04:35:45.279 align:start position:0%
you're covered either way
 
04:35:47.510 --> 04:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
your political party your affiliation it
 
04:35:50.230 --> 04:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter you and i are both we're
 
04:35:53.109 --> 04:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
on opposite sides on most issues but on
 
04:36:01.189 --> 04:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:06.390 --> 04:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:09.510 --> 04:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you uh mr chairman but
 
04:36:11.429 --> 04:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
if we if i look at the
 
04:36:13.910 --> 04:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh testimony from uh from last week
 
04:36:16.789 --> 04:36:16.799 align:start position:0%
michael vose uh he presents a totally
 
04:36:19.670 --> 04:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
different uh perspective
 
04:36:22.629 --> 04:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
he's saying that this uh
 
04:36:25.349 --> 04:36:25.359 align:start position:0%
this discrimination is clearly to
 
04:36:25.359 --> 04:36:27.269 align:start position:0%
this discrimination is clearly to
prevent

04:36:27.269 --> 04:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
04:36:29.670 --> 04:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
the proliferation of fossil fuels this
 
04:36:31.510 --> 04:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
is part of a
 
04:36:33.590 --> 04:36:33.600 align:start position:0%
marx marxist plot
 
04:36:36.709 --> 04:36:36.719 align:start position:0%
of resetting the global economy and all
 
04:36:39.590 --> 04:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
that so are you telling me that this is
 
04:36:41.990 --> 04:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
not what this particular
 
04:36:42.000 --> 04:36:43.670 align:start position:0%
not what this particular
thing

04:36:43.670 --> 04:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:36:46.551 --> 04:36:46.561 align:start position:0%
amendment says is that correct
 
04:36:49.029 --> 04:36:49.039 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:36:51.510 --> 04:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
would prevent
 
04:36:55.189 --> 04:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
a bank or an investment firm a financial
 
04:36:55.199 --> 04:36:56.949 align:start position:0%
a bank or an investment firm a financial
institution

04:36:56.949 --> 04:36:56.959 align:start position:0%
institution
 
04:37:00.150 --> 04:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
from targeting
 
04:37:02.310 --> 04:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
a fossil fuel industry
 
04:37:04.470 --> 04:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
and saying we are cutting you off
 
04:37:04.480 --> 04:37:06.230 align:start position:0%
and saying we are cutting you off
because

04:37:06.230 --> 04:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:37:09.029 --> 04:37:09.039 align:start position:0%
we disagree with your
 
04:37:11.029 --> 04:37:11.039 align:start position:0%
we've had a long-standing relationship
 
04:37:13.189 --> 04:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
with you now we're just cutting you off
 
04:37:16.070 --> 04:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
because we disagree with your politics
 
04:37:18.949 --> 04:37:18.959 align:start position:0%
well that's not what esg says but this
 
04:37:20.709 --> 04:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
is not esg
 
04:37:22.949 --> 04:37:22.959 align:start position:0%
all right so that's the way it was
 
04:37:25.429 --> 04:37:25.439 align:start position:0%
presented last week secondly that's why
 
04:37:27.830 --> 04:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
we changed the wording
 
04:37:30.470 --> 04:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
if you look at uh
 
04:37:33.910 --> 04:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
under amendment under two line
 
04:37:33.920 --> 04:37:35.189 align:start position:0%
under amendment under two line
seven

04:37:35.189 --> 04:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
seven
 
04:37:37.269 --> 04:37:37.279 align:start position:0%
or actually line six
 
04:37:39.670 --> 04:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh a bank whatever shall not
 
04:37:41.670 --> 04:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
discriminate against pose as a
 
04:37:44.551 --> 04:37:44.561 align:start position:0%
precondition advocate for causes adverse
 
04:37:46.390 --> 04:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
treatment of any person business
 
04:37:48.390 --> 04:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
organization etc
 
04:37:50.709 --> 04:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
and then if you go down to
 
04:37:53.910 --> 04:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
to line 18 notwithstanding
 
04:37:56.551 --> 04:37:56.561 align:start position:0%
paragraph g1 banks and other financial
 
04:37:58.551 --> 04:37:58.561 align:start position:0%
institutions may offer customers
 
04:38:00.390 --> 04:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
investments productive services that
 
04:38:03.429 --> 04:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
include subjective criteria as long as
 
04:38:06.390 --> 04:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
they disclose it so that to me just sort
 
04:38:07.750 --> 04:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
of pulls the rug out from under the
 
04:38:10.869 --> 04:38:10.879 align:start position:0%
whole no no because
 
04:38:15.510 --> 04:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
if you as a consumer say i only want
 
04:38:15.520 --> 04:38:16.470 align:start position:0%
if you as a consumer say i only want
my

04:38:16.470 --> 04:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
my
 
04:38:18.629 --> 04:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
investments i'm going to take my
 
04:38:20.869 --> 04:38:20.879 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars in bitcoin and
 
04:38:22.230 --> 04:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
now now that we're going to pass the
 
04:38:23.590 --> 04:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
bitcoin law
 
04:38:26.310 --> 04:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm gonna invest my fifty thousand
 
04:38:29.510 --> 04:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
dollars and i only want it to go
 
04:38:32.150 --> 04:38:32.160 align:start position:0%
into gun manufacturers fossil fuel
 
04:38:34.789 --> 04:38:34.799 align:start position:0%
industries and uh whatever else
 
04:38:34.799 --> 04:38:36.709 align:start position:0%
industries and uh whatever else
businesses

04:38:36.709 --> 04:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
they can offer that as a product for you
 
04:38:41.990 --> 04:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
because that's your investment strategy
 
04:38:43.750 --> 04:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
that's your investment strategy they
 
04:38:45.590 --> 04:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
offer the product they can do that there
 
04:38:47.670 --> 04:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
are there are any number
 
04:38:49.590 --> 04:38:49.600 align:start position:0%
you mentioned esg scores those are real
 
04:38:51.429 --> 04:38:51.439 align:start position:0%
they exist companies have them there's
 
04:38:53.429 --> 04:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
rate incomes you can go in and say i
 
04:38:56.470 --> 04:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
only want companies with esg scores of
 
04:38:58.869 --> 04:38:58.879 align:start position:0%
eight and above or however they're rated
 
04:39:01.109 --> 04:39:01.119 align:start position:0%
uh you can they can offer that they can
 
04:39:02.869 --> 04:39:02.879 align:start position:0%
do that just like i only want mutual
 
04:39:06.310 --> 04:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
funds with a morning star rating of five
 
04:39:09.510 --> 04:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
whoever right yep so you can do that
 
04:39:11.349 --> 04:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
they can offer the product
 
04:39:12.629 --> 04:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
you know what you're getting into
 
04:39:14.150 --> 04:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
there's an agreement between the two of
 
04:39:16.629 --> 04:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
you i only want companies that that do
 
04:39:16.639 --> 04:39:17.750 align:start position:0%
you i only want companies that that do
this

04:39:17.750 --> 04:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:39:19.670 --> 04:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
but what they cannot do
 
04:39:21.029 --> 04:39:21.039 align:start position:0%
is say
 
04:39:21.039 --> 04:39:21.990 align:start position:0%
is say
well

04:39:21.990 --> 04:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:39:23.349 --> 04:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
you drive
 
04:39:25.029 --> 04:39:25.039 align:start position:0%
a car we think doesn't get good enough
 
04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
gas mileage so
 
04:39:28.470 --> 04:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to call your note we're
 
04:39:30.551 --> 04:39:30.561 align:start position:0%
going to cut you off whatever else the
 
04:39:32.070 --> 04:39:32.080 align:start position:0%
case may be
 
04:39:32.080 --> 04:39:33.029 align:start position:0%
case may be
so

04:39:33.029 --> 04:39:33.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of discrimination we
 
04:39:37.029 --> 04:39:37.039 align:start position:0%
disagree with your politics we disagree
 
04:39:39.830 --> 04:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
with you you own something that we don't
 
04:39:41.910 --> 04:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
think you should own or you're investing
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
your money where we don't think you
 
04:39:45.910 --> 04:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
should be investing it
 
04:39:48.948 --> 04:39:48.958 align:start position:0%
we're trying to prevent that kind of of
 
04:39:48.958 --> 04:39:50.868 align:start position:0%
we're trying to prevent that kind of of
discrimination

04:39:50.868 --> 04:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
discrimination
 
04:39:55.030 --> 04:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:59.510 --> 04:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:02.310 --> 04:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
so if a pri if i'm in a private business
 
04:40:04.470 --> 04:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
or i work for a private business
 
04:40:07.590 --> 04:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
say a a tv station
 
04:40:09.910 --> 04:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
and and i'm a newspaper reporter i've
 
04:40:12.708 --> 04:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
been a a journalist and then i i come
 
04:40:15.590 --> 04:40:15.600 align:start position:0%
out and and say something
 
04:40:16.868 --> 04:40:16.878 align:start position:0%
that is
 
04:40:19.270 --> 04:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
different from the ownership's point of
 
04:40:19.280 --> 04:40:21.190 align:start position:0%
different from the ownership's point of
view

04:40:21.190 --> 04:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
view
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh say politics
 
04:40:24.000 --> 04:40:25.190 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh say politics
right

04:40:25.190 --> 04:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:40:25.200 --> 04:40:25.910 align:start position:0%
right
uh

04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:40:28.230 --> 04:40:28.240 align:start position:0%
i come out and say i hate bitcoin it
 
04:40:30.470 --> 04:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
sucks and and the guy owns a bunch of
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
bitcoin and he says her you're fired
 
04:40:33.600 --> 04:40:35.030 align:start position:0%
bitcoin and he says her you're fired
okay

04:40:35.030 --> 04:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:40:37.590 --> 04:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
i get that i know i get that i mean i've
 
04:40:39.910 --> 04:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
been fired it's a private business
 
04:40:42.070 --> 04:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
now you've narrowed the
 
04:40:45.590 --> 04:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
target down to banking
 
04:40:46.868 --> 04:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
am i correct
 
04:40:48.230 --> 04:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
financial yeah
 
04:40:50.070 --> 04:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
in business in business consumer
 
04:40:51.670 --> 04:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
protection all business
 
04:40:53.510 --> 04:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
all businesses who are not regulated by
 
04:40:55.510 --> 04:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
this department so yeah so
 
04:40:57.430 --> 04:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
all businesses
 
04:40:59.270 --> 04:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:41:01.510 --> 04:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
now we got a freedom of speech issue i
 
04:41:03.350 --> 04:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
think it goes beyond what you're talking
 
04:41:03.360 --> 04:41:04.230 align:start position:0%
think it goes beyond what you're talking
about

04:41:04.230 --> 04:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:41:05.590 --> 04:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
i could see
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
i mean we we
 
04:41:10.150 --> 04:41:10.160 align:start position:0%
banks used to redline right
 
04:41:11.990 --> 04:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
and so we got rid of that well
 
04:41:14.390 --> 04:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
supposedly we got rid of it yep but this
 
04:41:16.708 --> 04:41:16.718 align:start position:0%
would be this is this is redlining for
 
04:41:18.390 --> 04:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
the 21st century
 
04:41:20.310 --> 04:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
we are trying to prevent redlining in
 
04:41:21.990 --> 04:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
the 21st century
 
04:41:23.430 --> 04:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
just like we're trying to introduce
 
04:41:27.030 --> 04:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
bitcoin it's not a greenback
 
04:41:28.470 --> 04:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
it's new
 
04:41:30.390 --> 04:41:30.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's something that we have to get
 
04:41:32.868 --> 04:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
out in front of or there will be people
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
who will find themselves with no access
 
04:41:37.270 --> 04:41:37.280 align:start position:0%
to the marketplace well my problem with
 
04:41:39.270 --> 04:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
that is that uh
 
04:41:42.230 --> 04:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
all the citations i'm given the examples
 
04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
i'm given
 
04:41:44.868 --> 04:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
04:41:47.590 --> 04:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
suppression of somebody's voice
 
04:41:50.070 --> 04:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
seem to be on the conservative side and
 
04:41:54.230 --> 04:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
and and i and i'm and i'm thinking
 
04:41:55.750 --> 04:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:41:57.910 --> 04:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
last time i looked uh you know we have a
 
04:41:59.430 --> 04:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
republican legislature here in new
 
04:42:02.230 --> 04:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire this is 19 states this is no
 
04:42:04.708 --> 04:42:04.718 align:start position:0%
this is not republican versus democrat
 
04:42:06.310 --> 04:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
well actually because you're protected
 
04:42:09.750 --> 04:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
every bit as much as i am
 
04:42:14.470 --> 04:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
because who who the the policies
 
04:42:16.550 --> 04:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
can become subjective
 
04:42:19.270 --> 04:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
so whoever is up here at the top that's
 
04:42:21.350 --> 04:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
making the rules all of a sudden changes
 
04:42:24.788 --> 04:42:24.798 align:start position:0%
somehow now now where you were okay and
 
04:42:27.430 --> 04:42:27.440 align:start position:0%
i was not it switches you don't want my
 
04:42:29.350 --> 04:42:29.360 align:start position:0%
guy discriminating against you just as
 
04:42:30.470 --> 04:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
much as i don't want your guy
 
04:42:32.390 --> 04:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
discriminating against me so let's tell
 
04:42:33.910 --> 04:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
them both to go pound saying you can't
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
discriminate against either one of us
 
04:42:38.788 --> 04:42:38.798 align:start position:0%
well okay i get it i get i get that but
 
04:42:41.430 --> 04:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
but the fact of the matter is
 
04:42:43.830 --> 04:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination cuts both ways
 
04:42:46.230 --> 04:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
so for example today i listened to a
 
04:42:48.788 --> 04:42:48.798 align:start position:0%
banking commission who has done 180
 
04:42:53.430 --> 04:42:53.440 align:start position:0%
degrees on crypto and i'm going no no no
 
04:42:55.590 --> 04:42:55.600 align:start position:0%
not the banking commission
 
04:42:58.470 --> 04:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
the bankers association
 
04:43:00.708 --> 04:43:00.718 align:start position:0%
bankers association don't confuse the
 
04:43:03.510 --> 04:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
two did a very and and i'm not saying
 
04:43:05.430 --> 04:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
they're not being thoughtful
 
04:43:07.590 --> 04:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying i was a little surprised
 
04:43:09.430 --> 04:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
they've been amenable to this
 
04:43:11.110 --> 04:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
conversation since the beginning so i
 
04:43:12.470 --> 04:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't characterize the banking
 
04:43:14.948 --> 04:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
association as being anti they had
 
04:43:17.350 --> 04:43:17.360 align:start position:0%
concerns in the way the bill was written
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
because they were going to be on the
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
hook for the 5 million dollars so they
 
04:43:23.110 --> 04:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
really weren't too crazy about that and
 
04:43:25.990 --> 04:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
it wasn't 180 degrees they recognized
 
04:43:27.990 --> 04:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
where they're already governed by the
 
04:43:30.390 --> 04:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
ucc and they're going to be governed by
 
04:43:32.310 --> 04:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
it in the future the difference is that
 
04:43:33.910 --> 04:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to provide an hour later the
 
04:43:37.350 --> 04:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
ucc and bitcoin is very recent
 
04:43:37.360 --> 04:43:38.070 align:start position:0%
ucc and bitcoin is very recent
so

04:43:38.070 --> 04:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:39.750 --> 04:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
i you know we can have a discussion
 
04:43:42.470 --> 04:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
about whether or not that was a change
 
04:43:42.480 --> 04:43:43.430 align:start position:0%
about whether or not that was a change
but

04:43:43.430 --> 04:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:43:45.350 --> 04:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to do do we want anybody
 
04:43:47.110 --> 04:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
discriminating against anybody for any
 
04:43:47.120 --> 04:43:48.868 align:start position:0%
discriminating against anybody for any
reason

04:43:48.868 --> 04:43:48.878 align:start position:0%
reason
 
04:43:50.070 --> 04:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
of course
 
04:43:51.830 --> 04:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
we want people to discriminate
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
i have differences of opinion if you
 
04:43:55.670 --> 04:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
want to but do you want to be penalized
 
04:43:57.670 --> 04:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
for your difference of opinion
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
of course that happens all the time i'm
 
04:44:01.590 --> 04:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
a democrat for christ's sake i hardly
 
04:44:04.628 --> 04:44:04.638 align:start position:0%
ever win so i mean
 
04:44:05.990 --> 04:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
somehow i feel like you guys were in the
 
04:44:07.910 --> 04:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
majority a couple of times that i wasn't
 
04:44:09.670 --> 04:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
sitting here
 
04:44:09.680 --> 04:44:11.750 align:start position:0%
sitting here
so

04:44:11.750 --> 04:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:44:14.788 --> 04:44:14.798 align:start position:0%
party politics just take you
 
04:44:17.990 --> 04:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
whatever you are whatever you believe if
 
04:44:20.070 --> 04:44:20.080 align:start position:0%
somebody says i'm not going to give you
 
04:44:21.990 --> 04:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
access to the market because you
 
04:44:23.670 --> 04:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
disagree with me
 
04:44:26.230 --> 04:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
i'm cutting off your your your financial
 
04:44:28.628 --> 04:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
your ability to purchase things i'm
 
04:44:30.550 --> 04:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
going to cut off your ability to
 
04:44:30.560 --> 04:44:32.708 align:start position:0%
going to cut off your ability to
grow

04:44:32.708 --> 04:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
grow
 
04:44:35.190 --> 04:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
whatever i have never heard of anything
 
04:44:37.670 --> 04:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
that you just mentioned the entire coal
 
04:44:39.590 --> 04:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
and natural gas and petroleum industry
 
04:44:41.110 --> 04:44:41.120 align:start position:0%
in this country is under attack right
 
04:44:43.350 --> 04:44:43.360 align:start position:0%
now for this very reason it's all
 
04:44:43.360 --> 04:44:46.550 align:start position:0%
now for this very reason it's all
politics

04:44:46.550 --> 04:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:49.190 --> 04:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
there's some serious disagreements there
 
04:44:52.550 --> 04:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
you go in terms of uh what what the best
 
04:44:55.030 --> 04:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
course of action is that's politics it's
 
04:44:58.230 --> 04:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
democracy so i i we you and i might have
 
04:45:00.310 --> 04:45:00.320 align:start position:0%
different opinions but do you want
 
04:45:02.390 --> 04:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
anyone discriminating against anyone
 
04:45:03.670 --> 04:45:03.680 align:start position:0%
because they have a different political
 
04:45:03.680 --> 04:45:06.708 align:start position:0%
because they have a different political
opinion

04:45:06.708 --> 04:45:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:08.390 --> 04:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
do you want anyone discriminating
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:13.270 --> 04:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
how about your religion
 
04:45:14.470 --> 04:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
should you be discriminated against
 
04:45:16.230 --> 04:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
because of your religious rhetorical
 
04:45:18.550 --> 04:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
questions it's not rhetorical we have it
 
04:45:20.150 --> 04:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
codified in law because people were
 
04:45:21.510 --> 04:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
discriminated against because of their
 
04:45:23.510 --> 04:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
religion it's in the cause we also had
 
04:45:24.628 --> 04:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
people discriminating against because of
 
04:45:26.310 --> 04:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
their race and we also become
 
04:45:27.510 --> 04:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
discriminated against because of their
 
04:45:27.520 --> 04:45:28.390 align:start position:0%
discriminated against because of their
gender

04:45:28.390 --> 04:45:28.400 align:start position:0%
gender
 
04:45:30.390 --> 04:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
04:45:31.750 --> 04:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
discrimination we're trying to prevent
 
04:45:34.470 --> 04:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
come on guys okay so you have you
 
04:45:34.480 --> 04:45:35.990 align:start position:0%
come on guys okay so you have you
respectively

04:45:35.990 --> 04:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
respectively
 
04:45:36.000 --> 04:45:37.350 align:start position:0%
respectively
disagree

04:45:37.350 --> 04:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
disagree
 
04:45:40.230 --> 04:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
yeah for sure
 
04:45:40.240 --> 04:45:41.830 align:start position:0%
yeah for sure
okay

04:45:41.830 --> 04:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:45:41.840 --> 04:45:43.350 align:start position:0%
okay
keith

04:45:43.350 --> 04:45:43.360 align:start position:0%
keith
 
04:45:44.550 --> 04:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
yeah just i don't know if this is a
 
04:45:46.628 --> 04:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
rhetorical question or not but if i look
 
04:45:49.270 --> 04:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
at that list it's uh on page 1 line 10
 
04:45:50.948 --> 04:45:50.958 align:start position:0%
through 16
 
04:45:53.990 --> 04:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
and again it's repeated on line 29 and
 
04:45:56.948 --> 04:45:56.958 align:start position:0%
over to page two if i look at that list
 
04:45:59.110 --> 04:45:59.120 align:start position:0%
what items are
 
04:46:00.070 --> 04:46:00.080 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:46:03.030 --> 04:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
what items ideologically benefit one
 
04:46:07.270 --> 04:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
side over the other and uh do they seem
 
04:46:08.628 --> 04:46:08.638 align:start position:0%
fair and balanced because let's actually
 
04:46:10.708 --> 04:46:10.718 align:start position:0%
talk about the text of the bill
 
04:46:12.390 --> 04:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
so you know if you look at give me a
 
04:46:12.400 --> 04:46:13.430 align:start position:0%
so you know if you look at give me a
question

04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:46:14.708 --> 04:46:14.718 align:start position:0%
it's rhetorical you can answer if you
 
04:46:17.110 --> 04:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
want but you know i don't see anything
 
04:46:19.670 --> 04:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
here that but i was thinking in terms of
 
04:46:19.680 --> 04:46:20.948 align:start position:0%
here that but i was thinking in terms of
banking

04:46:20.948 --> 04:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
banking
 
04:46:22.230 --> 04:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
so when i read what if we just look at
 
04:46:24.868 --> 04:46:24.878 align:start position:0%
the bill very narrowly thinking about
 
04:46:24.878 --> 04:46:26.390 align:start position:0%
the bill very narrowly thinking about
banking

04:46:26.390 --> 04:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
banking
 
04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
so if that list there does it favor one
 
04:46:31.350 --> 04:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
ideological side over the other or is it
 
04:46:32.708 --> 04:46:32.718 align:start position:0%
does it seem balanced i think that's
 
04:46:33.910 --> 04:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
really the question that we should be
 
04:46:34.948 --> 04:46:34.958 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
04:46:37.430 --> 04:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
well i think i think we have i think we
 
04:46:38.550 --> 04:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:46:41.430 --> 04:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
a long tradition of how we settle those
 
04:46:41.440 --> 04:46:43.510 align:start position:0%
a long tradition of how we settle those
arguments

04:46:43.510 --> 04:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
arguments
 
04:46:47.110 --> 04:46:47.120 align:start position:0%
and it's the ballot box and
 
04:46:50.470 --> 04:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
and there has been discrimination uh
 
04:46:52.788 --> 04:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
in our history for sure
 
04:46:56.230 --> 04:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm not i'm not uh arguing against it
 
04:46:57.910 --> 04:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
i'm just saying that
 
04:47:00.868 --> 04:47:00.878 align:start position:0%
um we have to be very careful
 
04:47:03.430 --> 04:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh that uh we make accusations about
 
04:47:05.270 --> 04:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
what people do like take your car away i
 
04:47:07.510 --> 04:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
think he made that accusation
 
04:47:10.150 --> 04:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh because of uh somebody you know likes
 
04:47:11.750 --> 04:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
guns i mean
 
04:47:14.470 --> 04:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
i i don't i think you've just gone over
 
04:47:17.350 --> 04:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
the bridge from my perspective
 
04:47:19.670 --> 04:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
the law is not necessary
 
04:47:21.990 --> 04:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
fair enough okay i can get it i get what
 
04:47:24.150 --> 04:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
is upset about but can we hear from the
 
04:47:25.670 --> 04:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
banking industry
 
04:47:27.350 --> 04:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
do they have any comments about this
 
04:47:33.910 --> 04:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:37.270 --> 04:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:40.310 --> 04:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
even i didn't bring you up for this
 
04:47:41.990 --> 04:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay chris turn off your mic so we can
 
04:47:56.628 --> 04:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:56.638 --> 04:47:59.990 align:start position:0%
 
like

04:47:59.990 --> 04:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:01.270 --> 04:48:01.280 align:start position:0%
do you know of any case of
 
04:48:03.430 --> 04:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
discrimination that would fit into one
 
04:48:04.868 --> 04:48:04.878 align:start position:0%
of these categories that actually
 
04:48:06.628 --> 04:48:06.638 align:start position:0%
occurred in new hampshire off the top of
 
04:48:08.550 --> 04:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
my head i don't recall seeing any
 
04:48:10.830 --> 04:48:10.840 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints regarding this
 
04:48:13.590 --> 04:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
topic thank you
 
04:48:15.750 --> 04:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you emily
 
04:48:16.708 --> 04:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
yes chris
 
04:48:16.718 --> 04:48:17.510 align:start position:0%
yes chris
um

04:48:17.510 --> 04:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:48:18.628 --> 04:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
thank you but
 
04:48:20.550 --> 04:48:20.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i noticed in the
 
04:48:22.070 --> 04:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
04:48:23.910 --> 04:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
um it didn't mention
 
04:48:26.390 --> 04:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
things like people of color or
 
04:48:28.948 --> 04:48:28.958 align:start position:0%
transgender people and there was a big
 
04:48:30.628 --> 04:48:30.638 align:start position:0%
difference there because there was
 
04:48:30.638 --> 04:48:32.788 align:start position:0%
difference there because there was
monetary

04:48:32.788 --> 04:48:32.798 align:start position:0%
monetary
 
04:48:35.510 --> 04:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
damages involved now that there's not
 
04:48:37.750 --> 04:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
that's not such a big deal but why
 
04:48:40.310 --> 04:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
weren't things like that put in because
 
04:48:42.948 --> 04:48:42.958 align:start position:0%
we already have anti-discrimination but
 
04:48:44.910 --> 04:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
understand that you may have those
 
04:48:47.510 --> 04:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
anti-discrimination things but they
 
04:48:49.990 --> 04:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have gotten the money
 
04:48:51.670 --> 04:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh because they weren't listed in this
 
04:48:51.680 --> 04:48:52.470 align:start position:0%
uh because they weren't listed in this
bill

04:48:52.470 --> 04:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:48:53.910 --> 04:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
and that's why i think this bill is
 
04:48:55.990 --> 04:48:56.000 align:start position:0%
really not up to par that's why the
 
04:48:58.708 --> 04:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
money's gone i'm sorry the money's gone
 
04:49:01.430 --> 04:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
there's no money the money is on what's
 
04:49:04.390 --> 04:49:04.400 align:start position:0%
in the current penalties under these two
 
04:49:04.400 --> 04:49:05.990 align:start position:0%
in the current penalties under these two
statutes

04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
that's the penalties again you you
 
04:49:09.750 --> 04:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
but i think that was they uh
 
04:49:14.390 --> 04:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
they should have been placed in there
 
04:49:16.310 --> 04:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
basically under the the current law
 
04:49:18.550 --> 04:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
those kind of discrimination as well
 
04:49:21.750 --> 04:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
uh they're pointedly not there and to me
 
04:49:24.550 --> 04:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
that stuck out like a sore thumb
 
04:49:27.510 --> 04:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
but now this is being added to that i
 
04:49:29.510 --> 04:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
understand that but the original way it
 
04:49:32.150 --> 04:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
was your point is somewhat well taken in
 
04:49:34.550 --> 04:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
the sense that those anti-discrimination
 
04:49:34.560 --> 04:49:36.070 align:start position:0%
the sense that those anti-discrimination
statutes

04:49:36.070 --> 04:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
04:49:38.470 --> 04:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
are on somewhere else
 
04:49:40.470 --> 04:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
so um we
 
04:49:42.230 --> 04:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
i guess we could theoretically because i
 
04:49:43.910 --> 04:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
know like for instance the the big
 
04:49:46.230 --> 04:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
anti-description is um
 
04:49:48.310 --> 04:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
is housing
 
04:49:51.030 --> 04:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's uh um
 
04:49:53.510 --> 04:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
the housing is a hell it's a housing or
 
04:49:55.910 --> 04:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
pla actually it's a place of employment
 
04:49:57.830 --> 04:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
but you can't discriminate
 
04:50:00.788 --> 04:50:00.798 align:start position:0%
so we we could add to the list
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
we could add those to the list
 
04:50:06.310 --> 04:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
i i think if you're going to
 
04:50:08.150 --> 04:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
continue with this bill you ought to add
 
04:50:10.150 --> 04:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
those things in
 
04:50:11.270 --> 04:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
those type of descriptions more
 
04:50:13.270 --> 04:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
discrimination categories okay
 
04:50:15.910 --> 04:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:21.190 --> 04:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:23.430 --> 04:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
represent him yes um
 
04:50:24.390 --> 04:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:50:27.110 --> 04:50:27.120 align:start position:0%
um i agree there seems to be a lot of
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
categories not on this list
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
that could be causes for discrimination
 
04:50:35.270 --> 04:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
so i think i would agree
 
04:50:36.948 --> 04:50:36.958 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:50:39.670 --> 04:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
that the list should include
 
04:50:41.430 --> 04:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
all of those other types of
 
04:50:43.990 --> 04:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
discrimination that appear elsewhere
 
04:50:45.670 --> 04:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
like race or
 
04:50:50.150 --> 04:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
or um uh ethnic or age yeah i think
 
04:50:51.670 --> 04:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
they're the reality the reason why they
 
04:50:53.590 --> 04:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
didn't because they're already
 
04:50:56.470 --> 04:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
right uh you know and and they're and
 
04:50:57.750 --> 04:50:57.760 align:start position:0%
most of them are federal law right
 
04:50:59.030 --> 04:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
they're they're gonna be they're all
 
04:51:01.430 --> 04:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
covered under the federal law so and i
 
04:51:03.590 --> 04:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
believe it is uh sexual orientation has
 
04:51:06.230 --> 04:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
been added to that list
 
04:51:08.390 --> 04:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
and and so theoretically the reason we
 
04:51:09.910 --> 04:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
did that is because they they were
 
04:51:09.920 --> 04:51:11.030 align:start position:0%
did that is because they they were
already

04:51:11.030 --> 04:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:51:14.390 --> 04:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
in the federal federal uh fair
 
04:51:17.990 --> 04:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
loan fair credit act anyways but
 
04:51:21.590 --> 04:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
um and and further are there any other
 
04:51:23.670 --> 04:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
types of discrimination
 
04:51:26.470 --> 04:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know that we missed other other
 
04:51:26.480 --> 04:51:27.270 align:start position:0%
you know that we missed other other
uh

04:51:27.270 --> 04:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:51:29.510 --> 04:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
feel free to add
 
04:51:31.910 --> 04:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know off the top of my head but
 
04:51:34.628 --> 04:51:34.638 align:start position:0%
um i you know seeing the gun ownership
 
04:51:37.830 --> 04:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
there may be ownership of some other
 
04:51:37.840 --> 04:51:39.030 align:start position:0%
there may be ownership of some other
things

04:51:39.030 --> 04:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:51:41.110 --> 04:51:41.120 align:start position:0%
that might um
 
04:51:43.990 --> 04:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
cause a bank um
 
04:51:47.030 --> 04:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
to maybe look at the loan differently
 
04:51:49.670 --> 04:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
um so i i just hope
 
04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
that that this list is fairly complete
 
04:51:54.150 --> 04:51:54.160 align:start position:0%
for all those other
 
04:51:56.948 --> 04:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
types of discrimination um
 
04:51:58.230 --> 04:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
that are not
 
04:52:01.270 --> 04:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
listed elsewhere in the law
 
04:52:01.280 --> 04:52:02.868 align:start position:0%
listed elsewhere in the law
okay

04:52:02.868 --> 04:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:52:05.350 --> 04:52:05.360 align:start position:0%
any other comment jd how what do you
 
04:52:05.360 --> 04:52:08.628 align:start position:0%
any other comment jd how what do you
think

04:52:08.628 --> 04:52:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:11.350 --> 04:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
once you come up to a mic so that so
 
04:52:19.510 --> 04:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:20.550 --> 04:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
until they
 
04:52:27.030 --> 04:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:29.990 --> 04:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
yes i think you've done a reasonable job
 
04:52:31.590 --> 04:52:31.600 align:start position:0%
at putting together areas of
 
04:52:34.310 --> 04:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination that are not covered
 
04:52:37.190 --> 04:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
under current uh law
 
04:52:41.270 --> 04:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
um i want to give an uh a a
 
04:52:45.270 --> 04:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
an answer to the question of uh to mr uh
 
04:52:47.430 --> 04:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
04:52:47.440 --> 04:52:48.708 align:start position:0%
uh representative
bello

04:52:48.708 --> 04:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
bello
 
04:52:48.718 --> 04:52:49.590 align:start position:0%
bello
okay

04:52:49.590 --> 04:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:52:52.948 --> 04:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry with my french i don't do it
 
04:52:56.948 --> 04:52:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:56.958 --> 04:52:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:52:58.550 --> 04:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:53:01.910 --> 04:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
the comment was that all all the
 
04:53:03.830 --> 04:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
the discrimination
 
04:53:05.910 --> 04:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
appears to be coming from a conservative
 
04:53:08.310 --> 04:53:08.320 align:start position:0%
point of view but one could take the
 
04:53:11.430 --> 04:53:11.440 align:start position:0%
abortion issue and and a bank that says
 
04:53:13.270 --> 04:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to give you a loan because
 
04:53:15.110 --> 04:53:15.120 align:start position:0%
you support abortion
 
04:53:16.470 --> 04:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
is is
 
04:53:19.510 --> 04:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
is an equal
 
04:53:21.350 --> 04:53:21.360 align:start position:0%
discriminatory point of view that i
 
04:53:24.070 --> 04:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
don't think you would be in favor of um
 
04:53:25.110 --> 04:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
and and
 
04:53:26.550 --> 04:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
and so
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
as the chairman has pointed out and and
 
04:53:31.670 --> 04:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
other representatives here is is the
 
04:53:35.750 --> 04:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
list is designed to to go both ways
 
04:53:38.470 --> 04:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
irrespective of your political point of
 
04:53:38.480 --> 04:53:39.350 align:start position:0%
irrespective of your political point of
view

04:53:39.350 --> 04:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
view
 
04:53:42.868 --> 04:53:42.878 align:start position:0%
you are not to be discriminated against
 
04:53:47.750 --> 04:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:49.590 --> 04:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
did you want to comment yeah i wanted to
 
04:53:51.750 --> 04:53:51.760 align:start position:0%
comment um the way it was presented was
 
04:53:55.190 --> 04:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
one-sided and uh so you know kudos to
 
04:53:57.110 --> 04:53:57.120 align:start position:0%
the chair for
 
04:53:59.190 --> 04:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
you know putting together an amendment
 
04:54:00.470 --> 04:54:00.480 align:start position:0%
that makes it a little bit more
 
04:54:02.470 --> 04:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable but just heard from the
 
04:54:04.948 --> 04:54:04.958 align:start position:0%
banking industry and um
 
04:54:06.470 --> 04:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
they have no issues they they haven't
 
04:54:08.788 --> 04:54:08.798 align:start position:0%
had any any issues in new hampshire
 
04:54:08.798 --> 04:54:09.990 align:start position:0%
had any any issues in new hampshire
regarding

04:54:09.990 --> 04:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
04:54:11.990 --> 04:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
this situation
 
04:54:14.830 --> 04:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
so discrimination i'm i'm aware of two
 
04:54:17.190 --> 04:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
individuals who have gone to a local
 
04:54:20.628 --> 04:54:20.638 align:start position:0%
bank one is the hampstead kingston
 
04:54:22.948 --> 04:54:22.958 align:start position:0%
republican town committee
 
04:54:26.310 --> 04:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to find a place to to
 
04:54:28.390 --> 04:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
place their
 
04:54:30.550 --> 04:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
town committee funds
 
04:54:33.510 --> 04:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
and they went to the local td bank and
 
04:54:36.230 --> 04:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
the td bank folks said we're not dealing
 
04:54:38.628 --> 04:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
with you because you republicans have
 
04:54:41.910 --> 04:54:41.920 align:start position:0%
the wrong opinion on gun control
 
04:54:45.270 --> 04:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
another individual went to the bank and
 
04:54:49.270 --> 04:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
got a similar kind of reproach
 
04:54:51.750 --> 04:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
now did they bring that to the banking
 
04:54:54.708 --> 04:54:54.718 align:start position:0%
commission and advise them of that no
 
04:54:57.430 --> 04:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
they just went to another bank and moved
 
04:54:59.590 --> 04:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
on but that's the kind of thing that
 
04:55:01.990 --> 04:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
should not be happening irrespective of
 
04:55:07.430 --> 04:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:07.440 --> 04:55:12.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:55:12.310 --> 04:55:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:14.470 --> 04:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh since i still need to have a new
 
04:55:16.230 --> 04:55:16.240 align:start position:0%
amendment we can't really vote on this
 
04:55:21.670 --> 04:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:23.510 --> 04:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
on tuesday
 
04:55:25.110 --> 04:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
it's wednesday it's gonna be february
 
04:55:25.120 --> 04:55:27.190 align:start position:0%
