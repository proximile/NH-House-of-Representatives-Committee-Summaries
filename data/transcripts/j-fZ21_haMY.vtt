chairman
 
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
um while i was preparing the majority of
 
00:07:21.909 --> 00:07:21.919 align:start position:0%
work for
 
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
health before a week there were some
 
00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 align:start position:0%
concerns that i found that i
 
00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 align:start position:0%
did not i guess just looking at the
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
particles the things i didn't see
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
that that i saw when i was reading the
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
work and
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
some of these things that i think we can
 
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
fix to make this still still impassable
 
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
yes i'm just curious why
 
00:07:57.430 --> 00:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.469 --> 00:08:00.479 align:start position:0%
i believe that there's some potential
 
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
for some amendments to the bill
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
what i've heard at least would have been
 
00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039 align:start position:0%
expressed to me
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
one of the concerns was that the
 
00:08:10.869 --> 00:08:10.879 align:start position:0%
language involving
 
00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:19.189 align:start position:0%
language involving
reasonable

00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
i think it would the term repeat
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
interaction with the minor
 
00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
there was some some
 
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
some concerns over how that would apply
 
00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:37.599 align:start position:0%
we did hear some testimony on that and
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion during
 
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
the public hearings that apply to the
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
clerk of the convenience stores
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
i think it would make sense for us to
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
maybe look into putting
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
some clarification of what that term
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
thank the other you was
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
for an employer and it says that they
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
can be notified poorly or in writing
 
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
it is probably best practice to make
 
00:09:04.389 --> 00:09:04.399 align:start position:0%
that done in writing
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
i would recommend all going to do it in
 
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:27.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:35.190 align:start position:0%

00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
were just talking about that's

thank you you're welcome representative
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%

00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:13.990 align:start position:0%
you're recognized thank you mr chairman
uh

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna vote against the motion
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
you know i think you know
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
you know i'm not seeing any major issues
 
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
um that a small amendment on the house
 
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.310 align:start position:0%
um that a small amendment on the house
floor

00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
would take care of so i just thought
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
that this bill should go forward because
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
in my eyes um which i think
 
00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
with a 15 to 16 vote i think the
 
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:41.269 align:start position:0%
with a 15 to 16 vote i think the
committee

00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.069 --> 00:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
yes mr chairman uh could you refresh my
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
memory on why the uh
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
sergeant of state police objected to
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:07.269 --> 00:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
i'm unable to specify the depression
 
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
on their specific objection of why they
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
opposed it
 
00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
i might just i don't remember who said
 
00:11:14.389 --> 00:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
this but
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
the rest of the opposition wasn't really
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
the policy
 
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959 align:start position:0%
that this bill i think the policy was
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
really accepted by um most
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
most individuals i just think that the
 
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
application of that
 
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.590 align:start position:0%
application of that
term

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh and it says repeat the interaction is
 
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.350 align:start position:0%
uh and it says repeat the interaction is
combined

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
combined
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
and i think i think we all agree that
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
if you're a teacher for example in a
 
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.389 align:start position:0%
if you're a teacher for example in a
school

00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
that would apply to that so would it
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
apply to someone working in a grocery
 
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.389 align:start position:0%
apply to someone working in a grocery
store

00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
store
 
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:51.680 align:start position:0%
at checkout and it i'm not saying that
 
00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
it does or doesn't
 
00:11:55.269 --> 00:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
i think it would make sense to clarify
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
what is a repeated interaction
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
with the with the child it does have
 
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
you know the prior internet sentences
 
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.550 align:start position:0%
you know the prior internet sentences
which

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
purposes involves the direct care
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
instruction or guidance or repeating
 
00:12:14.949 --> 00:12:14.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
i think it's important from a legal
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
perspective because the employers may
 
00:12:20.629 --> 00:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
violate that provision of realizing
 
00:12:22.389 --> 00:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
their violence
 
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
i think they would be liable i think
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.839 --> 00:12:40.069 align:start position:0%
 
important

00:12:40.069 --> 00:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:42.629 --> 00:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
seeing no further representative hopper
 
00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
are you recognized
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair i'm gonna vote for
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
reconsideration because i
 
00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
i was uh during the hearing i was
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
bothered by the idea that
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
that repeated interact with children
 
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
is pretty vague so
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
if i was an employer because when we
 
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:03.350 align:start position:0%
if i was an employer because when we
talk

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
talk
 
00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:05.839 align:start position:0%
when we send somebody to prison for
 
00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:07.839 align:start position:0%
something and they get out
 
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:10.720 align:start position:0%
they should have a reasonable
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
possibility of rehabilitating themselves
 
00:13:16.389 --> 00:13:16.399 align:start position:0%
that possibility is limited if they
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
can't find a job
 
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:20.720 align:start position:0%
if i was a an employer and i looked at
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
this law
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
i would be very hesitant to hire
 
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
somebody who's working even in a
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
convenience store
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
because under this it would be repeated
 
00:13:34.710 --> 00:13:34.720 align:start position:0%
interaction with a minor although it was
 
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.030 align:start position:0%
interaction with a minor although it was
not

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
an uh close interaction that could that
 
00:13:42.069 --> 00:13:42.079 align:start position:0%
would likely lead to any kind of abuse
 
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
still be a liability issue if something
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
did happen
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
so i i think we do have to uh
 
00:13:52.629 --> 00:13:52.639 align:start position:0%
narrow that that deal down to make this
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh better so i i'm gonna vote for
 
00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:56.710 align:start position:0%
uh better so i i'm gonna vote for
reconsideration

00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
reconsideration
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank goodness you expand on that an
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
employer can hire someone
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
and then they can be in compliance but
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
if a customer
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
or a minor comes into the store a
 
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
certain amount of times all of a sudden
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
the employer is no longer complying and
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
having some specifics when that would
 
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.310 align:start position:0%
having some specifics when that would
apply

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
at least to look into how we can maybe
 
00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:19.680 align:start position:0%
tailor definitions
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
and for the members who are
 
00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
participating remotely once the ques
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
once the question is put the camera
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
i'm trying hold on there i am
 
00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
seeing no further humans race the matter
 
00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
will now be put to question
 
00:15:20.629 --> 00:15:20.639 align:start position:0%

00:15:22.629 --> 00:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
say yay if you are opposed

against the bill

uh originally uh because i
 
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:12.720 align:start position:0%
found uh so many problems with the way
 
00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
that the employer would have to make
 
00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
sure it was followed
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
even though the law says the employee
 
00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
has to do it
 
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
that there's i had problems with
 
00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
the the person who has already
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
been sentenced and served his punishment
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
was still being punished uh years later
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
because of his previous crime
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
so now i guess the motion what we're
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
faced with here is to go ahead and
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
rewrite the entire bill
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
um we can do that we can do that with
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
every bill
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
we change everything and rewrite every
 
00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
bill we don't have the time to do that
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
we have a law on the books
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
concerning this i don't
 
00:19:18.710 --> 00:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
i don't see what the purpose of
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
retaining will be other than to
 
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
sit down invite an entirely new girl
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
so i can't support uh i can't support
 
00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:37.350 align:start position:0%
so i can't support uh i can't support
behavior

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative knight thank you cara i
 
00:19:45.669 --> 00:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
um agree with uh representative true
 
00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
that i i don't find this necessary and
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
i find that if it were to pass
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
as as it is right now that
 
00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
um unforeseen people would be losing
 
00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
their jobs that are in rehabilitation
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
that was discussed because we weren't
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
clearly defining things
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh repeat
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
of repeat people working at a
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
convenience store
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
or what does that even mean so there's a
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
lot of language that was unclear
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
that was open-ended that could turn into
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
um a lot of gray areas
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
so i think this needs a lot of work and
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
i think it needs to be a whole new bill
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
i mean chairman abbas um i just got a
 
00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
message from the house clerk
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
he just wants to um inform you about a
 
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.870 align:start position:0%
he just wants to um inform you about a
procedural

00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
procedural
 
00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
matter if you would like to have him
 
00:20:53.360 --> 00:21:00.830 align:start position:0%
matter if you would like to have him
speak

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:21:04.870 --> 00:21:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh good morning mr chairman members of
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
the committee uh i just wanted to inform
 
00:21:10.789 --> 00:21:10.799 align:start position:0%
you uh just very briefly of the the
 
00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:11.510 align:start position:0%
you uh just very briefly of the the
situation

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
so uh you you voted for reconsideration
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
the issue now is that the motion before
 
00:21:17.919 --> 00:21:18.470 align:start position:0%
the issue now is that the motion before
you

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:21:20.549 --> 00:21:20.559 align:start position:0%
is back to what the motion that was
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
adopted previously is
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
so you can't substitute a new motion
 
00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
until you dispose of the original motion
 
00:21:29.669 --> 00:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
so the motion before you is the original
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
ought to pass as you passed it
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
okay so i just wanted to to point that
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
out in order to
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
entertain a retained motion you have to
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:43.440 align:start position:0%
because these could the author pass be
 
00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:46.230 align:start position:0%
because these could the author pass be
withdrawn

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
if if both the mover and the original
 
00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.190 align:start position:0%
if if both the mover and the original
seconder

00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
seconder
 
00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
anyway i just wanted to to to bring that
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
to your attention thanks very much folks
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.870 --> 00:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
the second directive so my understanding
 
00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:24.470 align:start position:0%
the second directive so my understanding
is

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
that the emotion about the task was made
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
initially by representative rhodes and
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
then that was seconded
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
by representative welsh i guess
 
00:22:37.310 --> 00:22:37.320 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes he wished
 
00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:43.860 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes he wished
withdrawals

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:43.870 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:50.630 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
either way the so the two the two
 
00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
members who made the most about the past
 
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
and seconded
 
00:22:59.190 --> 00:22:59.200 align:start position:0%
both in toronto i think for the sake of
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
vote where
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
for procedure lists make the motion
 
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
it could be done if it was the it was
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
defeated then
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
consideration you might understand the
 
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.230 align:start position:0%
consideration you might understand the
clerk

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
clerk
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
suggested that if it could be withdrawn
 
00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
provided both
 
00:23:34.549 --> 00:23:34.559 align:start position:0%
the members who made the initial motion
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes to make a motion
 
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'd like to make a
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
motion to continue for a week
 
00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
representative you were recognized uh
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:10.640 align:start position:0%
um before
 
00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
the to remove the op to pass i was just
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
the question i had was where's the
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
committee filed so we could confirm
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
that's what was happening what happened
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
who made the motions
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
because it sounded like there was some
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
you know while we think it was me
 
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
but i just want to
 
00:24:33.269 --> 00:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
see the file and make sure that that's
 
00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:35.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
because i don't remember who made the
 
00:24:37.679 --> 00:24:39.669 align:start position:0%
because i don't remember who made the
motions

00:24:39.669 --> 00:24:39.679 align:start position:0%
motions
 
00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:44.080 align:start position:0%
oh you did okay that is the way it is
 
00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
mr chairman you know yeah you rolled it
 
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
i'm certain that i made the notion of
 
00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.120 align:start position:0%
what's passed because i have down
 
00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.350 align:start position:0%
what's passed because i have down
syndrome

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
syndrome
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
okay sounded like there was some
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
confusion that's all i want to make sure
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
you say that it is thank you
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
i'm a little bit confused but when we
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
first had this motion about to pass
 
00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:16.480 align:start position:0%
did we not take it yes
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
we did on february 20th what was the
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
result of that roll call
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh the result of the that
 
00:25:26.070 --> 00:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
the vote for the phone call was not the
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
past 15
 
00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
and and then what we we we changed
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
and we we did it there was this morning
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
we did a motion for reconsideration
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
and that that that passes between two by
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
in any event the motion reconsideration
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
has passed
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
once you reconsider the motion about the
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
gas is still on the table or not
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
open we need to dispose of this right
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
which we could have disposed of it by
 
00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:09.990 align:start position:0%
which we could have disposed of it by
defeating

00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
defeating
 
00:26:12.230 --> 00:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
it or the members who offered it to the
 
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:13.269 align:start position:0%
it or the members who offered it to the
cross

00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
cross
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
the members who offered it was offered
 
00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
by representative rhodes
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
and the second better welsh they both
 
00:26:20.559 --> 00:26:21.669 align:start position:0%
and the second better welsh they both
withdrew

00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
withdrew
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
the initial a second
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
so now representative rose has been
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
recognized during the motion transition
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
that was seconded by representative
 
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.110 align:start position:0%
that was seconded by representative
gathering

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
gathering
 
00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
i just have a question i again i
 
00:26:48.310 --> 00:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
understand the clerk
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
hello it's better hello
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
okay well i'll try this um
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
can you hear me in the room
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
okay well i just wanted to say that i
 
00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
the clerk jumped in but uh i just have a
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
problem with the
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
vote being done before and now we're
 
00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
withdrawing it with no vote i don't know
 
00:27:36.870 --> 00:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
how that's going to look
 
00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
so motions have been withdrawn on
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:54.160 align:start position:0%
in this this year an example was
 
00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.750 align:start position:0%
in this this year an example was
[Music]

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
i'll use representative preston's bill
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
as an example the one involving
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
the summonses on good behavior he
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
initially made a motion to applaud the
 
00:28:04.159 --> 00:28:05.029 align:start position:0%
initially made a motion to applaud the
past

00:28:05.029 --> 00:28:05.039 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
he went through that we'd have accepted
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
by representative martin they both
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
withdrew their out to pass
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
and then follow that up with a motion to
 
00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:18.559 align:start position:0%
phoenix so we've withdrawn motion
 
00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
several times
 
00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
that uh without taking a roll call vote
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
to withdraw so it's been done i
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
understand the paper would be confusing
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
we do have the benefit of obviously
 
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200 align:start position:0%
having a live reporting as well
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
so i don't i don't believe there'll be
 
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
any confusion to the public
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
the bill has never never left our
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
committee so
 
00:28:41.590 --> 00:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
there's no there's nothing on the docket
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
showing that it was
 
00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
i would just say that we've never we've
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
always been drawing it before a vote
 
00:29:00.549 --> 00:29:00.559 align:start position:0%
but this was already voted and now
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
we reconsider it that's what i'm trying
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
i i think it's a it's a valid concern
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
and it wouldn't hurt
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
the emotions already being withdrawn and
 
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:12.310 align:start position:0%
the emotions already being withdrawn and
then

00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
we've already recognized another motion
 
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.870 align:start position:0%
we've already recognized another motion
so

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
i i guess if we were going to vote to do
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
the to withdraw the ought to pass
 
00:29:24.870 --> 00:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
we may have we may have gone past that
 
00:29:26.070 --> 00:29:26.080 align:start position:0%
the only way to do that would be to
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
withdraw the
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
motion to retain but i think we're just
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
going around
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
that's creating more confusion but i do
 
00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
representative rose thank you mr
 
00:29:41.510 --> 00:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
chairman just to clarify i
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
i did text the clerk because there was
 
00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:46.000 align:start position:0%
some confusion in the room
 
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
and he is still on our call and he has
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
informed me that yes we did the
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
reconsideration was correct
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
then myself making the motion to
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
withdraw the about to pass
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
representative while seconding that was
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what we needed to do and now we
 
00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.230 align:start position:0%
exactly what we needed to do and now we
are

00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:30:06.549 --> 00:30:06.559 align:start position:0%
thumbs up to go forward with the
 
00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:14.230 align:start position:0%
thumbs up to go forward with the
retaining

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman if i recall right
 
00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative this
 
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
right i should have voted on it the
 
00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
example you gave us
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
i don't think there was an actual vote i
 
00:30:31.029 --> 00:30:31.039 align:start position:0%
think there was a motion
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
then we discussed then they said oh okay
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
well maybe we should make a different
 
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:35.990 align:start position:0%
well maybe we should make a different
motion

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
motion
 
00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:37.679 align:start position:0%
then they would drown their they would
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
draw their motion i don't think there
 
00:30:40.950 --> 00:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
was ever a boat
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
like this this was an actual boat that
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
we you know we might be able to do it
 
00:30:49.029 --> 00:30:49.039 align:start position:0%
according to the clerk it just doesn't
 
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:51.200 align:start position:0%
look good you know the public's looking
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
going who
 
00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
what the hell's going on and in my eyes
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
a piece of paper i understand what
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
you're saying and representing
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
also noticed that distinguished by
 
00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.789 align:start position:0%
also noticed that distinguished by
example

00:31:06.789 --> 00:31:06.799 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
by pointing out that there was an actual
 
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
quote done on hd
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
i will say i'll say the same thing i'll
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
repeat it but i think the representation
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
i'll say again
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
that practice may have been a good
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
receiver to follow the problems we've
 
00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
read now
 
00:31:24.389 --> 00:31:24.399 align:start position:0%
that most of them were drawn and there's
 
00:31:27.430 --> 00:31:27.440 align:start position:0%
now a motion to routine
 
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
that would have to be what's wrong in
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
order to do that okay if the motion's
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
already been withdrawn
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
how do we load on something that's
 
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
moving stronger i think that the
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
my point is the time to deal with what's
 
00:31:39.190 --> 00:31:39.200 align:start position:0%
being recommended
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
may be best practice but it's also
 
00:31:41.039 --> 00:31:44.710 align:start position:0%
may be best practice but it's also
passed

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
there is still a record of our what
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
we're doing and again we're
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
live streaming this is recorded
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
for the entire world watching i i don't
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
believe there'll be any
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
disservices see
 
00:32:15.830 --> 00:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
representative newman representative i
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
recommend uh turning on your
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
video device from seven new one you
 
00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.669 align:start position:0%
video device from seven new one you
recognize

00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
yes mr speaker and i just have a
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry i thought i heard
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
someone say
 
00:32:30.549 --> 00:32:30.559 align:start position:0%
move the motion and i'm wondering if
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
you're asking if someone someone made a
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation to move the question
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
uh i would say that if
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's i'm not just mr chair just to
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
clarify i'm not questioning whether that
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
was correct or not i just wanted to know
 
00:32:51.990 --> 00:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
if i heard it
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
and may have and may have a follow-up
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
when a motion
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
to move the question is made i believe
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
that it needs to have a vote and it has
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
to be passed by two thirds
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i believe
 
00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:06.789 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh i believe
actually

00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:33:09.909 --> 00:33:09.919 align:start position:0%
in the masons manual that in committee
 
00:33:09.919 --> 00:33:11.029 align:start position:0%
in the masons manual that in committee
that

00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:11.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
no one no member can make a motion to
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's not permitted in the
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
in any conversations you hear between
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
myself representative wallace uh it's
 
00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
it's a recommendation on emotion but

you have a great great great american
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
day and uh thank you and every
 
00:45:58.829 --> 00:45:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:00.069 align:start position:0%
 
service

00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
service
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
if there are any members of the public
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
who are in attendance that
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:22.720 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair will recognize
 
00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you very much my name
 
00:46:30.550 --> 00:46:30.560 align:start position:0%
is melissa staples i'm the director of
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state police forensic
 
00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:33.270 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire state police forensic
laboratory

00:46:33.270 --> 00:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
laboratory
 
00:46:35.349 --> 00:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
and i am here to provide some
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
information about
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
what this bill accomplishes why was it
 
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:40.150 align:start position:0%
what this bill accomplishes why was it
needed

00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
needed
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
and of course this bill is certainly
 
00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:43.839 align:start position:0%
supported by the department
 
00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:45.839 align:start position:0%
so i'd like to address the second part
 
00:46:47.349 --> 00:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
of the legislation which pertains
 
00:46:48.630 --> 00:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
specifically to the drug
 
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
analogs which starts on page 1 line 19.
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
around 2012 synthetic drugs such as
 
00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.230 align:start position:0%
around 2012 synthetic drugs such as
spice

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
spice
 
00:46:58.950 --> 00:46:58.960 align:start position:0%
k2 and bath salts became readily
 
00:46:58.960 --> 00:46:59.750 align:start position:0%
k2 and bath salts became readily
available

00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
requiring law enforcement and medical
 
00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
personnel to respond to numerous
 
00:47:05.109 --> 00:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
overdoses on a daily basis
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
many in public locations in fact by 2014
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
these drugs led then governor maggie
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
hassan to declare state of emergency
 
00:47:16.630 --> 00:47:16.640 align:start position:0%
due to the extreme public health threat
 
00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
legislation put in place at the time was
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
successful in quelling the distribution
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
of these drugs
 
00:47:24.549 --> 00:47:24.559 align:start position:0%
however drug analogs such as additional
 
00:47:26.309 --> 00:47:26.319 align:start position:0%
bath salts are becoming prevalent once
 
00:47:26.319 --> 00:47:27.030 align:start position:0%
bath salts are becoming prevalent once
again

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
particularly in the western part of the
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
state this is causing medical
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
emergencies and increases in crime
 
00:47:34.549 --> 00:47:34.559 align:start position:0%
but the current law does not support
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
prosecution for these drugs
 
00:47:38.549 --> 00:47:38.559 align:start position:0%
the current law regarding what is
 
00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:40.240 align:start position:0%
considered to be a drug analog
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
is essentially unenforceable and i'd
 
00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
like to take a moment to explain why
 
00:47:47.430 --> 00:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
the first part of the current verbiage
 
00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.230 align:start position:0%
the first part of the current verbiage
for

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
the definition of a controlled drug
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
analog reads as follows
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
control dog drug analog means a
 
00:47:57.190 --> 00:47:57.200 align:start position:0%
substance that has a chemical structure
 
00:47:59.270 --> 00:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
substantially similar to that of a
 
00:48:00.549 --> 00:48:00.559 align:start position:0%
controlled drug
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
and that was specifically designed to
 
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
produce an effect
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
substantially similar to that of a
 
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
controlled drug
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
and there are problems with each of
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
those two components of the definition
 
00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
first substantially similar structure is
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
not defined
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
the word substantially is a relative
 
00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
term which does not establish a clear
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
legal standard
 
00:48:23.109 --> 00:48:23.119 align:start position:0%
which leaves prosecutors without a clear
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
standard on which to base their charges
 
00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:28.720 align:start position:0%
or to prove a case second
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
specifically designed to produce an
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
effect substantially similar to that of
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
a controlled drug
 
00:48:36.069 --> 00:48:36.079 align:start position:0%
would require prosecutors to know what
 
00:48:37.990 --> 00:48:38.000 align:start position:0%
the person who manufactured the drug was
 
00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:38.870 align:start position:0%
the person who manufactured the drug was
thinking

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
00:48:40.950 --> 00:48:40.960 align:start position:0%
what their intent was when they produced
 
00:48:42.069 --> 00:48:42.079 align:start position:0%
the drug
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
clearly this is almost impossible to
 
00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.190 align:start position:0%
clearly this is almost impossible to
prove

00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
prove
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
the proposed language in this bill
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
solves both of these problems
 
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
first there is a new definition of
 
00:48:53.589 --> 00:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
substantially similar structure which is
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
provided on page 2 line 10
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
which goes into detail about what this
 
00:49:00.150 --> 00:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
term means so it's no longer
 
00:49:01.829 --> 00:49:01.839 align:start position:0%
a relative term that could be up for
 
00:49:01.839 --> 00:49:03.910 align:start position:0%
a relative term that could be up for
interpretation

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
secondly the intent of the manufacturer
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
is replaced
 
00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
with the ability to produce laboratory
 
00:49:11.109 --> 00:49:11.119 align:start position:0%
studies which show
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
this analog to essentially have the same
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
effect as the original drug
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
and that portion is on page 1 line 23.
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
these studies would show things like the
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
drug binds with the same receptors in
 
00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:24.880 align:start position:0%
the body as the controlled drug
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
communication with the dea indicates
 
00:49:28.309 --> 00:49:28.319 align:start position:0%
that they're pretty quick to produce
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
those studies
 
00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
which then support the effect
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
scientifically rather than trying to
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
determine the person's intended effect
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
chapter 359-0 which had is being
 
00:49:43.990 --> 00:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
repealed on page
 
00:49:47.589 --> 00:49:47.599 align:start position:0%
2 line 18 was a stopgap measure put in
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
place to prohibit the sale of spice in
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
retail establishments
 
00:49:53.430 --> 00:49:53.440 align:start position:0%
this was put in place at a time when
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
people could purchase spice at your
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
corner market
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
and it made it a violation to sell those
 
00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
types of analogs and was successful in
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
getting the product off the shelves
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
but then when they went to the black
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
market the analog wall really couldn't
 
00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
be enforced
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
but with a new definition of analog the
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
section of 359.0 is no longer needed as
 
00:50:13.990 --> 00:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
sales and retail establishments could be
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
prosecuted under the new definition
 
00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
as a felony the news section 359-0
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
regarding synthetic urine
 
00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%
um synthetic urines for those who who
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
may not be familiar with that
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
really have no legitimate purpose
 
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
they're designed specifically to provide
 
00:50:32.710 --> 00:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
blank urine samples for those who must
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
take drug tests
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps as a condition of employment
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
like a cdl license
 
00:50:40.549 --> 00:50:40.559 align:start position:0%
or if someone is on probation or parole
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
or maybe even as part of a rehab program
 
00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:45.200 align:start position:0%
these products are cylinder names such
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
as quick fix
 
00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
ultra pure magnum detox
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
and an individual utilizing these
 
00:50:52.549 --> 00:50:52.559 align:start position:0%
synthetic urines could be putting others
 
00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:53.520 align:start position:0%
at risk
 
00:50:56.069 --> 00:50:56.079 align:start position:0%
for example in the case of a a cdl
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
driver who may be using drugs and
 
00:50:59.349 --> 00:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
driving on our highways
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
it could prevent people from receiving
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
services such as someone who might be in
 
00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:03.670 align:start position:0%
services such as someone who might be in
rehab

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
rehab
 
00:51:05.349 --> 00:51:05.359 align:start position:0%
who may be still using but providing
 
00:51:07.270 --> 00:51:07.280 align:start position:0%
clean urine samples
 
00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
which could be beneficial to those
 
00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.950 align:start position:0%
which could be beneficial to those
individuals

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to take a moment to
 
00:51:14.549 --> 00:51:14.559 align:start position:0%
clarify the purpose of this legislation
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
it is very important
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:23.839 align:start position:0%
you may have for me
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:29.829 --> 00:51:29.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair oh thank you for
 
00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:31.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
i use stated that there was no there is
 
00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
no use for
 
00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh synthetic urine but my understanding
 
00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
is synthetic urine is used to calibrate
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh medical instruments and also my
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh non-human uh synthetic urine is used
 
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:55.839 align:start position:0%
to attract uh animal as well as
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
to repel animals are these are these not
 
00:51:58.640 --> 00:51:59.349 align:start position:0%
to repel animals are these are these not
legitimate

00:51:59.349 --> 00:51:59.359 align:start position:0%
legitimate
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
uses i thank you for your question uh
 
00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.240 align:start position:0%
quite honestly being in the forensic
 
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
realm i'm not familiar with those other
 
00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.790 align:start position:0%
realm i'm not familiar with those other
uses

00:52:06.790 --> 00:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
uses
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
um i think the intent of this
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
legislation is really to
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
ban the common sale of these things uh
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
so that they are very much
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
um being able to be uh
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
received by the individuals who are
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
using it for the purposes i described
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
um however as you mentioned there could
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
be other potential uses that i'm not
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
00:52:31.109 --> 00:52:31.119 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative fine night you're
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that there was a lot
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
past the house in 2017
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
that specifically for synthetic urine
 
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
so that consumers can still purchase it
 
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:51.589 align:start position:0%
so that consumers can still purchase it
for

00:52:51.589 --> 00:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
what representative boarding a was
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
suggesting and also
 
00:52:57.910 --> 00:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
we can go after criminals using it to
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
cheat drug tests
 
00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
how would this differ is this updating
 
00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
the law or
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
can you elaborate on what how this
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
differs from the 2017 law
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know i wish i could i do remember
 
00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
testifying on the same subject
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
several years ago and i kind of
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
honestly i kind of lost track of what
 
00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
had happened with that legislation
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to review it um if you had
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
the number for me but at this point
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
i'd like to review it before i had
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh saying no for the hands raised i want
 
00:53:52.020 --> 00:53:52.030 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.030 --> 00:53:54.390 align:start position:0%

00:53:57.030 --> 00:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
good good morning mr chair and members
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:00.160 align:start position:0%
my name is bob oxley and i am the
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
director of field services for the
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
department of corrections
 
00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
and the department of corrections
 
00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
supports sb 34.
 
00:54:09.430 --> 00:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
i'll be very brief this morning as i've
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony but i want
 
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:11.750 align:start position:0%
submitted written testimony but i want
to

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
sb 34 would change how new hampshire
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
currently defines a controlled
 
00:54:23.349 --> 00:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
drug analog this bill would
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
appropriately change the definition
 
00:54:27.589 --> 00:54:27.599 align:start position:0%
focusing on the chemistry
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
and makeup of the drug rather than the
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
drug dealer's intent
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
these drug analogs started in sullivan
 
00:54:35.349 --> 00:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
county about five years ago
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
and we've now seen them in several other
 
00:54:38.549 --> 00:54:38.559 align:start position:0%
counties and becoming
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
a problem as drug dealers continue to
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
get more sophisticated in the area of
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
controlled drug analogs we expect to see
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
more in the future throughout the state
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
sb 34 would allow our probation parole
 
00:54:51.990 --> 00:54:52.000 align:start position:0%
office to to
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
focus on combating these sophisticated
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
synthetic drugs
 
00:54:57.109 --> 00:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
and will improve the lives and
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
opportunities for those in the
 
00:54:58.319 --> 00:54:59.270 align:start position:0%
opportunities for those in the
communities

00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:55:02.549 --> 00:55:02.559 align:start position:0%
mostly impacted by them again i said
 
00:55:04.829 --> 00:55:04.839 align:start position:0%
it'd be brief but i am available for
 
00:55:04.839 --> 00:55:08.630 align:start position:0%
it'd be brief but i am available for
questions

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
synthetic uh
 
00:55:25.589 --> 00:55:25.599 align:start position:0%
isn't the sale in possession of
 
00:55:27.750 --> 00:55:27.760 align:start position:0%
synthetic urine against
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:36.150 --> 00:55:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um i'm not
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
certain but i'll i'll certainly find out
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
i know it's it's a problem
 
00:55:41.589 --> 00:55:41.599 align:start position:0%
for the probation of parole officers
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
you know when they when they use it when
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
when being tested
 
00:55:48.789 --> 00:55:48.799 align:start position:0%
it's for no other reason to disguise
 
00:55:50.789 --> 00:55:50.799 align:start position:0%
their illegal activity
 
00:55:52.630 --> 00:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
but but i will find out i'm not sure if
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%

questions that mr burt asked there are
 
00:56:51.270 --> 00:56:51.280 align:start position:0%
18 states that now make synthetic urine
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
banned and

great intent behind this bill that i
 
00:59:19.030 --> 00:59:19.040 align:start position:0%
have to agree with a lot of testimonies
 
00:59:21.589 --> 00:59:21.599 align:start position:0%
considering a person's age and the

decisions that we're able to make
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
and with that being said it kind of led

us to more questions about

01:00:05.829 --> 01:00:05.839 align:start position:0%
how you fix this without caveats with
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
your industry
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.549 --> 01:00:18.559 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight you're
 
01:00:18.559 --> 01:00:21.030 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight you're
recognized

01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um i really
 
01:00:29.030 --> 01:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
find that uh retaining this is
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
it's really a disheartening move i think
 
01:00:32.079 --> 01:00:33.430 align:start position:0%
it's really a disheartening move i think
that

01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
this bill is perfect it simply clarifies
 
01:00:39.030 --> 01:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to be condemning
 
01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
a child in our state from the right to
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
be heard before a court of their peers
 
01:00:47.670 --> 01:00:47.680 align:start position:0%
we're simply denying them our right to
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
be heard
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
forever for the rest of their lives when
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
they did something
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
when they didn't have fully developed
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
frontal lobes
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's up to us to condemn
 
01:01:01.910 --> 01:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
anybody in that situation
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
and really again this is just to allow
 
01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
someone the opportunity to have their
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
voice heard
 
01:01:13.589 --> 01:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
they can then you know by case-by-case
 
01:01:13.599 --> 01:01:14.470 align:start position:0%
they can then you know by case-by-case
basis

01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
deny that person if they're not on the
 
01:01:19.430 --> 01:01:19.440 align:start position:0%
track to rehabilitation
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
and there's a course correction made for
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
each individual
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
that is in the criminal justice system
 
01:01:28.630 --> 01:01:28.640 align:start position:0%
by denying
 
01:01:31.589 --> 01:01:31.599 align:start position:0%
this to minors you are condemning them
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
for the rest of their lives
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
i cannot support this retained motion i
 
01:01:37.109 --> 01:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
think it does a disservice to
 
01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
all children that could be caught in a
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
terrible situation
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative manager it's not about
 
01:01:48.549 --> 01:01:48.559 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not able to hear very clearly when
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
people in the room are
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
speaking it's very uh i wanted to know
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
if it was just on my side or
 
01:02:01.029 --> 01:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
everybody else i can hear who are on
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh zoom but when some members
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
in the room speak it's very choppy just
 
01:02:08.710 --> 01:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
ask if i'm the only one i can check my
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
side and then another member
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
who's working remotely did someone
 
01:02:16.950 --> 01:02:16.960 align:start position:0%
second that
 
01:02:22.789 --> 01:02:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.150 --> 01:02:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you i have to agree with
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight that this
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
bill is very good at the way it is
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh maybe it's not perfect it doesn't
 
01:02:39.270 --> 01:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
take care of
 
01:02:42.710 --> 01:02:42.720 align:start position:0%
of adults that are younger
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
are older than juvenile uh but
 
01:02:49.829 --> 01:02:49.839 align:start position:0%
this would uh be a good thing for
 
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599 align:start position:0%
before i recognize anyone to speak on on
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
the bill the question can their members
 
01:03:05.190 --> 01:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
participate remotely are they anyone
 
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
else having trouble hearing
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
the members of the room if so can you
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
give me a
 
01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
thumbs up mr chair
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
representative o'hare the i think the
 
01:03:19.109 --> 01:03:19.119 align:start position:0%
reason that comes choppy is
 
01:03:21.349 --> 01:03:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh members in the room that have mics
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
near their
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
them are moving papers and that is
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh making the mic go to that
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
person and that's why it becomes choppy
 
01:03:39.910 --> 01:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
they're not doing it now but during some
 
01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
people were speaking some people were
 
01:03:44.710 --> 01:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
moving papers
 
01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:46.720 align:start position:0%
by the mics and that would be uh taken
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
away from the conversation
 
01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
it may have been me i apologize now
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
can you guys get this okay that was
 
01:03:58.309 --> 01:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
definitely me
 
01:03:59.829 --> 01:03:59.839 align:start position:0%
that was the chair and i apologize for
 
01:04:04.710 --> 01:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair representative muse
 
01:04:14.470 --> 01:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i i believe this is a
 
01:04:15.349 --> 01:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
bill that
 
01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh that we should be passing not
 
01:04:17.599 --> 01:04:18.630 align:start position:0%
uh that we should be passing not
retaining

01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
retaining
 
01:04:21.430 --> 01:04:21.440 align:start position:0%
um i think we heard a lot of convincing
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh testimony uh
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
just about the fact that um the people
 
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
of the age
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about um essentially
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
don't have fully developed brains yet um
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
and well they're definitely capable of
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
of horrible actions just as adults
 
01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
are capable of those actions to hold
 
01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:44.549 align:start position:0%
are capable of those actions to hold
them

01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
up for the worst
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
punishment that our justice system can
 
01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.870 align:start position:0%
punishment that our justice system can
offer

01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
offer
 
01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
with no chance of having an opportunity
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
for parole no matter how much they've
 
01:04:57.750 --> 01:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
developed or how much they've changed
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
their lives afterwards seems to be
 
01:05:03.109 --> 01:05:03.119 align:start position:0%
a very harsh thing uh that
 
01:05:06.309 --> 01:05:06.319 align:start position:0%
really is unfitting uh for our justice
 
01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:07.670 align:start position:0%
really is unfitting uh for our justice
system

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
so i would urge you uh to
 
01:05:13.990 --> 01:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
reject the retaining motion and uh and
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can
 
01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:21.829 --> 01:05:21.839 align:start position:0%
representative catherine you're
 
01:05:21.839 --> 01:05:24.870 align:start position:0%
representative catherine you're
recognized

01:05:24.870 --> 01:05:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
same here um i agree with everything
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
that was said
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
um with my colleagues um i really think
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
it's important that we do remember the
 
01:05:35.270 --> 01:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
situation in terms of
 
01:05:37.990 --> 01:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
the frontal lobe that was given there
 
01:05:39.510 --> 01:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
was quite a bit of testimony
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
testimony from the right people or the
 
01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:43.190 align:start position:0%
testimony from the right people or the
medical

01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
medical
 
01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:46.480 align:start position:0%
people as well as documentation
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
so i we have to remember that
 
01:05:54.230 --> 01:05:54.240 align:start position:0%
until you're in your mid-20s your mind
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
is still really growing developing and
 
01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:57.829 align:start position:0%
is still really growing developing and
especially

01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
especially
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
for reasoning and things of that nature
 
01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:00.870 align:start position:0%
for reasoning and things of that nature
so

01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:04.630 --> 01:06:04.640 align:start position:0%
to send someone to uh prison for
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
a lifetime and i think i mentioned when
 
01:06:07.910 --> 01:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
i um actually
 
01:06:11.109 --> 01:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
opened this for uh representative burch
 
01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
that there was a man um i think then i
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
said he was 86 but he was 83 years old
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
that was released
 
01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
just the day before we actually had the
 
01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:22.559 align:start position:0%
hearing on this
 
01:06:25.029 --> 01:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
and that's a long time and what they
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
said was when he was in his 70s
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
he went before the board and they were
 
01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
going to release him but they wanted him
 
01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
to be on parole
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
but he wanted to be a free man he hadn't
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
been a free man
 
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:39.760 align:start position:0%
free person since he was a teenager
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
so he declined that and then finally
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
at age 83 they released him
 
01:06:49.589 --> 01:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
as a free man so um
 
01:06:52.789 --> 01:06:52.799 align:start position:0%
i it really disturbs me that we would
 
01:06:52.799 --> 01:06:53.190 align:start position:0%
i it really disturbs me that we would
even

01:06:53.190 --> 01:06:53.200 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
think to give a child a life sentence
 
01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
any child and as stated before
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
most of the states have done away with
 
01:07:03.039 --> 01:07:04.150 align:start position:0%
most of the states have done away with
that

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
so um i really think that new hampshire
 
01:07:07.829 --> 01:07:07.839 align:start position:0%
is better than that to be honest with
 
01:07:07.839 --> 01:07:08.789 align:start position:0%
is better than that to be honest with
you

01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:07:11.750 --> 01:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
so that's my two cents on that so i
 
01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.390 align:start position:0%
so that's my two cents on that so i
believe

01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
that the bill is fine the way it is and
 
01:07:19.109 --> 01:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized yes
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr speaker i miss the chairman
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
i i agree with thunder and i would like
 
01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
to say that
 
01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
we're not setting them free they're
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
going before a judge
 
01:07:37.349 --> 01:07:37.359 align:start position:0%
and there's a parole voting whatnot that
 
01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:40.799 align:start position:0%
listens to what they say and i think a
 
01:07:41.670 --> 01:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
lot of people
 
01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:45.359 align:start position:0%
change um during the years
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
and they should be giving a second
 
01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
representative newman you were
 
01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.950 align:start position:0%
representative newman you were
recognized

01:07:54.950 --> 01:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
01:07:57.910 --> 01:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i also agree that
 
01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
sentencing a child to
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
life without parole um takes away all
 
01:08:04.390 --> 01:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
chances of rehabilitation
 
01:08:06.069 --> 01:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
and i think we've all read about people
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
that have committed murder
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
and rehabilitated themselves to the
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
point where they have degrees
 
01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
and they teach and they help out in in
 
01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
the prison even though they have no
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
possibility of ever being released
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
and i think it's almost cruel and
 
01:08:22.309 --> 01:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
unusual punishment
 
01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.669 --> 01:08:39.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair this time it is about
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
and i think looking at it
 
01:08:45.910 --> 01:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
this is a very important bill for new
 
01:08:48.229 --> 01:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
hampshire when we are facing
 
01:08:51.269 --> 01:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
such a shortage i mean heart
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
youngsters to be life imprisoned
 
01:08:58.309 --> 01:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
and not have a chance of uh parole
 
01:09:01.590 --> 01:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
we are just the human potential and i
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
think this
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
is just not right
 
01:09:08.309 --> 01:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
action to take and i think we need to
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
look at
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
what's available to us in how do we
 
01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
harness because it's very
 
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
evident the science scientific studies
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
evolving brain this gives those
 
01:09:23.669 --> 01:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh youngsters an opportunity we have the
 
01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to train
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
and shape those minds while they are
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
imprisoned and make that
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
wrong the right in terms of neurological
 
01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:35.910 align:start position:0%
wrong the right in terms of neurological
growth

01:09:35.910 --> 01:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
growth
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i think this would be a hindrance
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
if we retain it let us uh i think
 
01:09:45.829 --> 01:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
looking at the bill looks like a good
 
01:09:46.789 --> 01:09:46.799 align:start position:0%
one to
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:55.199 --> 01:09:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
senator

01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing is um
 
01:10:06.950 --> 01:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner hanks sent us documentation
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
i hope that everybody took the time to
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
take a look at that documentation
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
um i think if i remember correcting now
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
it was
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
four or five
 
01:10:19.270 --> 01:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
people in there that at the time they
 
01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:21.280 align:start position:0%
committed the crime they were 17 years
 
01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:22.709 align:start position:0%
committed the crime they were 17 years
old

01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
old
 
01:10:25.030 --> 01:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire i don't
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
remember and i don't have it in front of
 
01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:26.950 align:start position:0%
remember and i don't have it in front of
me

01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
what age they are now but again i just
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
like to encourage the team that um
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
remember it's called rehabilitation
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
people are not people are sent there for
 
01:10:39.430 --> 01:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
their crime
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
but also for rehabilitating so that's
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr jim
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
i just want to simply state that one
 
01:10:58.630 --> 01:10:58.640 align:start position:0%
on the motion to retain i will be voting
 
01:10:59.590 --> 01:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
against it
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
for the simple basic reasons that a lot
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
of people have already expressed
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
i feel it's uh it's not appropriate to
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
retain this so
 
01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
and what else can they the underlying
 
01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:16.550 align:start position:0%
and what else can they the underlying
bill

01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
as it's written under every circumstance
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
there'll be no circumstance where a
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
right now on the new hampshire law that
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
would that would be applicable for a
 
01:11:32.239 --> 01:11:33.669 align:start position:0%
would that would be applicable for a
juvenile

01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
juvenile
 
01:11:36.310 --> 01:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh his first degree murder second degree
 
01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:36.790 align:start position:0%
uh his first degree murder second degree
murder

01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
murder
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
and then a third conviction of felony
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
sexual assault
 
01:11:42.550 --> 01:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
those are the situations where a
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
juvenile would face
 
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
a life sentence a
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
second degree murder it's not a
 
01:11:52.149 --> 01:11:52.159 align:start position:0%
mandatory bison therefore it's the
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
second degree murder
 
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:56.159 align:start position:0%
charge which uh for sentence would not
 
01:11:56.159 --> 01:11:56.550 align:start position:0%
charge which uh for sentence would not
be

01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
miller versus alabama in 2012
 
01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
as written our first
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
first degree murder sentence for a minor
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
would violate that provision
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
so there is some we could do some
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
housekeeping work which is why
 
01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
i would favor retaining the bill so we
 
01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.229 align:start position:0%
i would favor retaining the bill so we
can

01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
we can put in the amendments at least
 
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
clean up some of the constitutional
 
01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:26.870 align:start position:0%
clean up some of the constitutional
inconsistencies

01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
this but in my opinion if this bill is
 
01:12:30.630 --> 01:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
not retained i would be supporting an
 
01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:32.070 align:start position:0%
not retained i would be supporting an
ipl

01:12:32.070 --> 01:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
ipl
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
because i believe it goes beyond the
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
what the miller decision
 
01:12:39.669 --> 01:12:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh stated because miller
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
the mandatory sentence is the problem
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
and the amendment really would figure
 
01:12:44.709 --> 01:12:44.719 align:start position:0%
out for a
 
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
juvenile charge first degree murder when
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
would an appropriate time be
 
01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that you also don't
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
take away the discretion for
 
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
a judge to send in someone about
 
01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:57.830 align:start position:0%
a judge to send in someone about
juvenile

01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
juvenile
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
life in prison it can still be done the
 
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
miller case is not said that can't be
 
01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:02.960 align:start position:0%
done it just can't
 
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
get mandatory sentence i did put some
 
01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
some i draft together however it will
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
take some time to bet that that's done
 
01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:12.070 align:start position:0%
take some time to bet that that's done
properly

01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
properly
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
so i would say it's in the interest of
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
retaining it rather than putting
 
01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:16.640 align:start position:0%
something forward that i would say i'm
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
not confident
 
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
right but when i'm hearing about the
 
01:13:20.950 --> 01:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
brain development
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
and people talk about the mid-20s i know
 
01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:23.990 align:start position:0%
and people talk about the mid-20s i know
this

01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
reference before i i don't have the
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
exact age but i know
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
the situation that happened just south
 
01:13:31.990 --> 01:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
of uh new hampshire massachusetts
 
01:13:35.430 --> 01:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
i thought i think the
 
01:13:38.229 --> 01:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
18 or 19 but either way they're not in
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
their mid-20s
 
01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
their brain is not fully developed what
 
01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
that person did was let off two bombs in
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
the city of boston
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
injured several people a child was
 
01:13:48.239 --> 01:13:49.590 align:start position:0%
injured several people a child was
killed

01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
killed
 
01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
five days later they murdered a police
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
officer full of blood
 
01:13:56.149 --> 01:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
and then we've got a shootout police
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
officers in watertown
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
in the presidential neighborhood and
 
01:14:01.590 --> 01:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
what i'm hearing today is that that
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
person's praying you know that person's
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
not juveniles
 
01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
that that person would be unusual to
 
01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:07.430 align:start position:0%
that that person would be unusual to
send

01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
send
 
01:14:12.830 --> 01:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
that person to a life sentence nevermind
 
01:14:15.990 --> 01:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
yep so uh i think
 
01:14:18.070 --> 01:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
i believe it goes to this as britain
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
would go too far
 
01:14:20.790 --> 01:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
but i think that there's there is some
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
work you could do if it's retained
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
i would be i would assure the members of
 
01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
this committee that i would work with
 
01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.350 align:start position:0%
this committee that i would work with
them

01:14:27.350 --> 01:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
to put some drought forward that
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
i would support and pass but that's
 
01:14:36.870 --> 01:14:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized thank
 
01:14:40.149 --> 01:14:40.159 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
and um i agree with everything that
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
you've said
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh you know the miller case is very
 
01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:47.590 align:start position:0%
uh you know the miller case is very
clear

01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:51.750 align:start position:0%
clear
um

01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
helen hank sent us some information that
 
01:14:56.870 --> 01:14:56.880 align:start position:0%
i still have more questions too
 
01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
and i think we really need to look at
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
because i think one of our
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
representatives said it and then also
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
a couple other people said it that were
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of this
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
bill that this is just a stepping stone
 
01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
to age 24.
 
01:15:12.630 --> 01:15:12.640 align:start position:0%
so i think we need to look at all of
 
01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:14.070 align:start position:0%
so i think we need to look at all of
that

01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
so retain really is the right motion at
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
so we can look at those things that i
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
have concerns about
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
and like you said if this does not pass
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative hopper uh thank you mr
 
01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
chair and i agree
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of what people have said about how
 
01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:36.149 align:start position:0%
a lot of what people have said about how
the

01:15:36.149 --> 01:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
brain of teenagers it's really not even
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
close to develop
 
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
and we should do something but the fact
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
of the matter
 
01:15:46.310 --> 01:15:46.320 align:start position:0%
is if we decide this today or november
 
01:15:48.149 --> 01:15:48.159 align:start position:0%
for somebody serving a life sentence
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
without parole it will make no
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
substantial difference and holding off
 
01:15:53.669 --> 01:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
and doing it right
 
01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
is what i'm going to vote for
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
and representative harvard i i will i
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
agree with what you said
 
01:16:03.030 --> 01:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
in the miller case uh the support was
 
01:16:05.189 --> 01:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
very clear that it applies retroactively
 
01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:06.640 align:start position:0%
so if there was
 
01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
a minor or juvenile who sentenced a
 
01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
mandatory sentence of life without
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
people in the state of new hampshire
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's something the miller case would
 
01:16:17.110 --> 01:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
still apply that came out in 2012 so i
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
would be surprised
 
01:16:21.030 --> 01:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
that i would be surprised to hear that
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
there's still a
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been addressed already but
 
01:16:27.510 --> 01:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
i have i haven't reviewed all the
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
information representative
 
01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:33.679 align:start position:0%
yes i could support your um
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
interim study if you are going to be
 
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
sure that you're going to write
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
representatives i gave you my word that
 
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
i've already drafted something but it
 
01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:50.719 align:start position:0%
this is not my area of expertise uh
 
01:16:52.870 --> 01:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
and i want to make sure that it's it's
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
done right it
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
is kind of bouncing around to several
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
rsas it would take time
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
in my time where i'm not in a public
 
01:17:03.590 --> 01:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
area i do work full-time
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
i have a family i do my best but i i
 
01:17:07.110 --> 01:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
want to make sure if something is put
 
01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:08.149 align:start position:0%
want to make sure if something is put
forward

01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
uh it's done right and then obviously
 
01:17:11.830 --> 01:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
give the members the time to absorb
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
what it does it does not but again as
 
01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:15.669 align:start position:0%
what it does it does not but again as
written

01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:17:17.189 --> 01:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh i think this is going in the
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
direction of an idea because
 
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you mr
 
01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:23.510 align:start position:0%
representative thank you thank you mr
chairman

01:17:23.510 --> 01:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
yes when i spoke before and then you
 
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
spoke i had a follow-up to you
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
and my follow-up has to do with the fact
 
01:17:31.199 --> 01:17:33.110 align:start position:0%
and my follow-up has to do with the fact
that

01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
i have a hard time thinking that a
 
01:17:38.149 --> 01:17:38.159 align:start position:0%
juvenile in the category of
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
16 to 18 years old
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
is totally lost and we just throw him in
 
01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.470 align:start position:0%
is totally lost and we just throw him in
jail

01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
jail
 
01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
and give him no chance for parole and
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that the parole board's
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
going to let them out
 
01:17:55.110 --> 01:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
they got to review it and see what's
 
01:17:57.189 --> 01:17:57.199 align:start position:0%
what and i'm saying
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
i have a hard time saying we want to
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
just throw this kid in jail
 
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
and wash our hands up i'm not in that
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
category of a christian
 
01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:14.930 align:start position:0%
 
parole

01:18:14.930 --> 01:18:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:17.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um this is more of a
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
clarification for the chair um because
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
i respect that it sounds like the
 
01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:27.590 align:start position:0%
i respect that it sounds like the
committee

01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:18:29.669 --> 01:18:29.679 align:start position:0%
does take this concern really serious
 
01:18:31.590 --> 01:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
and if there really is an
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh overreach in this bill i just don't
 
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
understand it so if you could explain
 
01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
that to me because
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
as i understand the wording of this
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
right now it just says that we can still
 
01:18:48.070 --> 01:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh sentence a minor to life
 
01:18:50.310 --> 01:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
we just as it stands on the books
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to have any hearing
 
01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
so i thought that what this would do was
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
say we can still sentence them to life
 
01:18:57.120 --> 01:18:57.669 align:start position:0%
say we can still sentence them to life
but

01:18:57.669 --> 01:18:57.679 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
they are allowed a hearing at some point
 
01:19:02.950 --> 01:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
i don't understand where the overreach
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
or the
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
the what needs to be clarified or
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
how it goes too far if you could explain
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
that to me
 
01:19:15.990 --> 01:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
or try again i know you just spoke but
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
i've only
 
01:19:20.149 --> 01:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
stayed in my in my humble opinion
 
01:19:21.669 --> 01:19:21.679 align:start position:0%
not speaking and members of the
 
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.320 align:start position:0%
committee so
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
if if a juvenile sentence to life in
 
01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:29.110 align:start position:0%
if if a juvenile sentence to life in
prison

01:19:29.110 --> 01:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
prison
 
01:19:31.910 --> 01:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's they still could be announced a
 
01:19:33.270 --> 01:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
possibility cold that's
 
01:19:36.870 --> 01:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
that's correct but if that is something
 
01:19:38.310 --> 01:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
what this bill does it would take the
 
01:19:40.709 --> 01:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
discretion away during the sentencing
 
01:19:40.719 --> 01:19:41.590 align:start position:0%
discretion away during the sentencing
hearing

01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:19:43.110 --> 01:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
that there would be no circumstance
 
01:19:45.669 --> 01:19:45.679 align:start position:0%
where a juvenile would be sentenced to
 
01:19:45.679 --> 01:19:46.950 align:start position:0%
where a juvenile would be sentenced to
life

01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
life
 
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
without any exception whatsoever
 
01:19:51.910 --> 01:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
this would this takes away that
 
01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:54.550 align:start position:0%
this would this takes away that
exception

01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
that goes i also will say
 
01:20:00.630 --> 01:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
that if the first degree murder which as
 
01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:01.510 align:start position:0%
that if the first degree murder which as
written

01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
written
 
01:20:05.350 --> 01:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
is a mandatory life in person without
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
venomous control if a juvenile were to
 
01:20:10.070 --> 01:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
be convicted of first degree murder i
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
guess the question
 
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
when putting together an amendment is
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
when would that juvenile
 
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
field rule comparing it to
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
second-degree murder although a person a
 
01:20:26.709 --> 01:20:26.719 align:start position:0%
juvenile could be sentenced to life
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh in person without the vote for second
 
01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:29.750 align:start position:0%
uh in person without the vote for second
humor

01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
humor
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
at the discretion during the sentencing
 
01:20:31.679 --> 01:20:32.870 align:start position:0%
at the discretion during the sentencing
here

01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
for that situation if no
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
fixed time period is assigned then
 
01:20:43.270 --> 01:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
that juvenile would be eligible for 18
 
01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:44.790 align:start position:0%
that juvenile would be eligible for 18
years

01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:20:47.669 --> 01:20:47.679 align:start position:0%
so again it's not just simply putting an
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
amendment in
 
01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
my humble opinion i like it i think it's
 
01:20:54.629 --> 01:20:54.639 align:start position:0%
worth discussing as a committee
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
and making sure it's done right but i
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
also think we can clean up some
 
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
language uh to make sure that the
 
01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
holding from milligrams to alabama is at
 
01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:06.149 align:start position:0%
holding from milligrams to alabama is at
least

01:21:06.149 --> 01:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
least
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
on the bus i think at the very least we
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
did that but also
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
by doing that we got to then maybe see
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
how we want the rest of the proceeds
 
01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.070 align:start position:0%
how we want the rest of the proceeds
together

01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
but that's not something that i felt
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
that would be done very quickly and then
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
making sure that it's done right because
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.669 --> 01:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i appreciate the
 
01:21:39.350 --> 01:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
thought that you and other committee
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
members have put into this and
 
01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
and really wanting to get it right um
 
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
i think the bill uh i think the bill is
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay as it is
 
01:21:52.070 --> 01:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
um i'd like to see it get to the floor
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
this year i'd like to defeat the
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
retaining motion and make another motion
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:03.590 --> 01:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
viewpoints offered today retaining
 
01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
closes this door
 
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see a chance at at otp or
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
itl and see where it falls
 
01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
but um retaining i don't think we're
 
01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
going to get to a different result next
 
01:22:15.510 --> 01:22:15.520 align:start position:0%
year i think
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
we have the bill let's vote on it now
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
representative testament you recognize
 
01:22:30.390 --> 01:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
uh i think i'll
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
support the retaining of the bill not
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
because i don't believe
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
that the bill has merit
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
but you know i was going to say this
 
01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
earlier and i
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
what really bothers me we've got a lot
 
01:22:50.629 --> 01:22:50.639 align:start position:0%
of people here talking about
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
how horrible it would be to do something
 
01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
would be a permanent situation
 
01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:00.719 align:start position:0%
for a young person before
 
01:23:03.990 --> 01:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
their minds are completely formed
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
and i put a bill forward it got voted
 
01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
down for exactly that reason
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh and it turned out
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
you know i was just saying it's not
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
right to
 
01:23:21.669 --> 01:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
have an operation or drugs
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
to change a child's sex now that's
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
obviously something
 
01:23:28.709 --> 01:23:28.719 align:start position:0%
that couldn't be fixed because they
 
01:23:31.110 --> 01:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
hadn't had a chance to
 
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
to reach the age of you know all their
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
brain developing
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:42.229 --> 01:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
unreasonable for for some people who i
 
01:23:44.629 --> 01:23:44.639 align:start position:0%
know are against that kind of a bill
 
01:23:46.470 --> 01:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
to be in support of it in a situation
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
like this it just doesn't make any sense
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
you're not consistent
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:58.390 --> 01:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.110 --> 01:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
all right and and i i just when i say
 
01:24:02.629 --> 01:24:02.639 align:start position:0%
that we're retaining it that's not
 
01:24:06.390 --> 01:24:06.400 align:start position:0%
i'm just as written i believe the bill
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
goes too far but there is there is some
 
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
falses we can put into place
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
i think with with potential amendments
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
and i would also put out that any
 
01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that we have whenever
 
01:24:21.030 --> 01:24:21.040 align:start position:0%
we're able to meet all members of the
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
committee are still allowed to
 
01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.030 align:start position:0%
committee are still allowed to
participate

01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
participate
 
01:24:27.030 --> 01:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
but obviously not all voting subjects so
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
this is something that i'm willing to
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
work on with everyone together
 
01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
but uh i would be advocating for an
 
01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
ideal as written and i would
 
01:24:36.990 --> 01:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
probably support you
 
01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:41.350 align:start position:0%
probably support you
[Music]

01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized thank
 
01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman i think that it's going
 
01:24:47.910 --> 01:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
to be a question toward you
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
my good friend from manchester um i
 
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
value his opinions
 
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:00.149 --> 01:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
young people in prison forever and just
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
throwing the key away i i do support him
 
01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:25:07.030 --> 01:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
but i believe and i hope you can clarify
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
that the military
 
01:25:10.709 --> 01:25:10.719 align:start position:0%
has taken care of that pretty much
 
01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
saying that yes we
 
01:25:15.270 --> 01:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
might have four people on there but they
 
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
do have a possibility for parole is that
 
01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:18.950 align:start position:0%
do have a possibility for parole is that
correct

01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
so i don't know the facts and
 
01:25:22.950 --> 01:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
circumstances of the
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
four of five juveniles that is currently
 
01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:26.470 align:start position:0%
four of five juveniles that is currently
serving

01:25:26.470 --> 01:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
serving
 
01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
life sentence i agree with with the
 
01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:29.750 align:start position:0%
life sentence i agree with with the
words

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
words
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
from the representative as well i agree
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
that just simply having a mandatory
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
life in prison without rule as a
 
01:25:39.910 --> 01:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
penalty or a punishment for a crime to
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
apply to a juvenile
 
01:25:44.229 --> 01:25:44.239 align:start position:0%
is not appropriate and the miller case
 
01:25:46.390 --> 01:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
specifically said they cannot have
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
accounting and mandatory life without
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
the world
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
so the miller case from the military
 
01:25:53.990 --> 01:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
alabama 2012
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
has already solved that problem this is
 
01:25:59.750 --> 01:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
what this is taking him a step further
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
with no circumstance whatsoever
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
regardless of how many 17 year olds can
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
kill 200 people
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
on 200 different occasions and would not
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
be able to serve
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
so what i'm saying is that there should
 
01:26:21.510 --> 01:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
be some exception
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
that i believe the judgment has the
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
discretion which familiar case allows
 
01:26:27.669 --> 01:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
the court to still have a juvenile
 
01:26:30.629 --> 01:26:30.639 align:start position:0%
sentence political it's just a matter of
 
01:26:34.149 --> 01:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
not being mandatory so going through the
 
01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:35.600 align:start position:0%
rsas and finding all of the
 
01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
circumstances where juvenile could be
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
sentenced to life
 
01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
in prison or whether it's management
 
01:26:42.550 --> 01:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's what i was doing
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out which rsas are will
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
be implicated and if the
 
01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:48.639 align:start position:0%
juvenile is not going to serve i'll let
 
01:26:52.709 --> 01:26:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
i think it's important for us to figure
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
out what should that
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
be the appropriate time for you to be
 
01:26:58.629 --> 01:26:58.639 align:start position:0%
out of the role and that's something i
 
01:26:58.639 --> 01:26:58.950 align:start position:0%
out of the role and that's something i
think

01:26:58.950 --> 01:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:27:01.430 --> 01:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
all twenty one of us can contribute to
 
01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
that whether we
 
01:27:03.830 --> 01:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
support the amendment or not i still
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
think people contributed our members
 
01:27:06.629 --> 01:27:06.639 align:start position:0%
contributed to that
 
01:27:08.490 --> 01:27:08.500 align:start position:0%
conversation would be productive because
 
01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:10.070 align:start position:0%
conversation would be productive because

you know will see because i am going to
 
01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
vote to retain
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
because i still have a lot of questions
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
and with those questions we'll be able
 
01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
to vote later on
 
01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
not to pass or itl um
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
but by retaining it it will allow us to
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
look at these issues that we're looking
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
at and
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
further you know to make it into this
 
01:27:44.870 --> 01:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
because i agree you know if somebody
 
01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:45.270 align:start position:0%
because i agree you know if somebody
kills

01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
kills
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
200 people um you know there's a problem
 
01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:48.709 align:start position:0%
200 people um you know there's a problem
here

01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
um but you know if it's a you know
 
01:27:55.030 --> 01:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
you know every life is valuable and you
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
know we need to make sure that we look
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
at that
 
01:28:13.669 --> 01:28:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:17.590 --> 01:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
if you're in in prison for a long time
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
and you have a possibility for parole
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
and you're supposed to be rehabilitating
 
01:28:25.830 --> 01:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
you you work through that
 
01:28:27.270 --> 01:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
at some point you've changed your mind
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
and you try to become a model
 
01:28:32.310 --> 01:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
prisoner if there is no possibility for
 
01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.430 align:start position:0%
prisoner if there is no possibility for
parole

01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
parole
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%

01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
after until april so
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
and we would have a deadline you know we
 
01:29:17.110 --> 01:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
need to see this bill
 
01:29:20.149 --> 01:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
uh die on the table because we didn't
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
properly vetted amendment
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
i i would also say if you were not in
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
some of the restrictions that we would
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
have been this might have been something
 
01:29:28.709 --> 01:29:28.719 align:start position:0%
we could have worked on but it's very
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
complicated but i
 
01:29:31.750 --> 01:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
when i say i've already put my own
 
01:29:34.310 --> 01:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
personal graph together
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
it's helpful so i would also
 
01:29:39.830 --> 01:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
value the input of other members on
 
01:29:41.110 --> 01:29:41.120 align:start position:0%
submitting that so that's why i think
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the subcommittee
 
01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
would benefit from bill and i think i
 
01:29:47.200 --> 01:29:47.210 align:start position:0%
evaluated his opinion
 
01:29:47.210 --> 01:29:49.110 align:start position:0%
evaluated his opinion

01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman my final comments
 
01:29:57.590 --> 01:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
at this time will be i can understand
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
five families in new york to get
 
01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
together and have a meeting
 
01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:09.280 align:start position:0%
they get to a point where they say i
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
need an assurance
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
that such and such is going to happen
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
asking here now because if you retain
 
01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.030 align:start position:0%
asking here now because if you retain
something

01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:22.639 align:start position:0%
as i understand it it could very easily
 
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
die in the shuffle it just gets
 
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:29.199 align:start position:0%
a retained bill could die in retain
 
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
especially like with coven we get
 
01:30:33.189 --> 01:30:33.199 align:start position:0%
another upsurge and all of a sudden
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
we're not meeting
 
01:30:37.590 --> 01:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
anymore i have a hard time with that so
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking about it can i get some
 
01:30:41.510 --> 01:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
assurance that we're gonna
 
01:30:44.790 --> 01:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
bring this bill back to retain with some
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
new provisions in it soon
 
01:30:51.669 --> 01:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:53.110 --> 01:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
i would swear anything you want that
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
i've already put a draft
 
01:30:57.030 --> 01:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
i would swear on anything that you asked
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
me that i already put
 
01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:09.470 align:start position:0%

01:31:18.870 --> 01:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated subject so i'm not
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable that my vetting
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
process is done and then i
 
01:31:26.070 --> 01:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
would value the members of this
 
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
committee's input
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
on that policy as well so when i say
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
that it's been done
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
and it's already insiders so it's not
 
01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
going anywhere even if i went somewhere
 
01:31:36.550 --> 01:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
it's not going
 
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%

discussion on this
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%

house bill 632 just passed
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
this time we're going to close the
 
01:34:49.669 --> 01:34:49.679 align:start position:0%
executive session on health bill
 
01:34:49.679 --> 01:34:52.709 align:start position:0%
executive session on health bill
632.

01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
yes i think we need to explain that
 
01:34:59.510 --> 01:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
when a bill goes is retained that it can
 
01:35:00.550 --> 01:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
come out
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
with a new bill in the next session
 
01:35:07.030 --> 01:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
which will be in january
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
and we will get it right
 
01:35:13.350 --> 01:35:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you and i only get to base my
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
experience the last term that we would
 
01:35:15.189 --> 01:35:15.199 align:start position:0%
likely have
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
an executive session on this in the fall
 
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm hoping that
 
01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
so hopefully sooner rather than later we
 
01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
can start having the subject mates work
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
on the entertainment
 
01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:28.400 align:start position:0%

01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
another bill for reconsideration and
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
will likely
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%

i will take the uh recommendation from

i will take the uh recommendation from
representative

02:10:46.629 --> 02:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately i believe there was
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
the most
 
02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
of that excuse me to legislate
 
02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
that motion was made by representative
 
02:10:57.440 --> 02:10:58.709 align:start position:0%
that motion was made by representative
hurt

02:10:58.709 --> 02:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
hurt
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
paul yes and seconded by wallace
 
02:11:05.270 --> 02:11:05.280 align:start position:0%
now the second american wallace
 
02:11:06.950 --> 02:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
if both those numbers wish that we draw
 
02:11:17.220 --> 02:11:17.230 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:17.230 --> 02:11:21.109 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:11:21.109 --> 02:11:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:23.109 --> 02:11:23.119 align:start position:0%
would a member wish to make a motion to
 
02:11:25.030 --> 02:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
withdraw that
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
makes me delicious that's uber
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
there a second yeah second by
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative hopper
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
seeing him
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
i have a question representing you
 
02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:42.870 align:start position:0%
i have a question representing you
recognized

02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
recognized
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
yeah um i as i understood it we don't
 
02:11:46.229 --> 02:11:46.239 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
02:11:48.629 --> 02:11:48.639 align:start position:0%
this with the i if they pulled if they
 
02:11:50.830 --> 02:11:50.840 align:start position:0%
um pulled it back so why are we doing it
 
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
now you are 100
 
02:11:54.629 --> 02:11:54.639 align:start position:0%
correct in that you do not have to do
 
02:11:54.639 --> 02:11:56.069 align:start position:0%
correct in that you do not have to do
this

02:11:56.069 --> 02:11:56.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:03.669 --> 02:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
it's true yeah i'm just saying that we
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
just need to be consistent that's all
 
02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:05.990 align:start position:0%
just need to be consistent that's all
because

02:12:05.990 --> 02:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:12:07.669 --> 02:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
if we do it different than what we did a
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
few minutes ago it
 
02:12:10.629 --> 02:12:10.639 align:start position:0%
just seems like we're not consistent
 
02:12:12.550 --> 02:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
with how we're supposed to do things
 
02:12:18.870 --> 02:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:18.880 --> 02:12:37.850 align:start position:0%
 
we

02:12:37.850 --> 02:12:37.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:37.860 --> 02:12:57.220 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:12:57.220 --> 02:12:57.230 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:57.230 --> 02:12:59.669 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:12:59.669 --> 02:12:59.679 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
is that it's not necessary to do a roll
 
02:13:02.790 --> 02:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
call vote
 
02:13:05.589 --> 02:13:05.599 align:start position:0%
to withdraw the motion but it is a
 
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:12.069 --> 02:13:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair for for calling on
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
me uh
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm i'm certainly going to defer to
 
02:13:19.669 --> 02:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
you uh as the chair of the committee
 
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
um i would just note that um
 
02:13:25.910 --> 02:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
the the the fact of the matter is that
 
02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:26.629 align:start position:0%
the the the fact of the matter is that
um

02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
by taking the reconsideration vote
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
you've undone
 
02:13:34.149 --> 02:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
the prior vote um so
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh withdrawing emotion is proper
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
um and as long as the seconder also
 
02:13:43.589 --> 02:13:43.599 align:start position:0%
agrees to withdraw the motion
 
02:13:47.430 --> 02:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
it to to take a vote on something
 
02:13:50.870 --> 02:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
that is is frankly sort of ministerial
 
02:13:54.870 --> 02:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
um is just it's just irregular
 
02:13:57.990 --> 02:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
um i i understand the concerns
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
raised by uh the two gentlemen uh on the
 
02:14:02.159 --> 02:14:03.030 align:start position:0%
raised by uh the two gentlemen uh on the
committee

02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:14:06.870 --> 02:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
um but because essentially the the vote
 
02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
was undone uh by your action
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
um a emotion again
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
you don't have to withdraw it you can
 
02:14:18.229 --> 02:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
simply vote down the motion because it
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
was still before you as well
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
um but a motion to just to withdraw
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
emotion is is just something that is a
 
02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:32.390 --> 02:14:32.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr clark and i think that was
 
02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh i i
 
02:14:35.270 --> 02:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and thank you
 
02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
for the explanation i think given
 
02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
that again this being a live reported
 
02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:41.109 align:start position:0%
that again this being a live reported
hearing

02:14:41.109 --> 02:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
02:14:43.830 --> 02:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
and the public was able to hear that
 
02:14:43.840 --> 02:14:45.350 align:start position:0%
and the public was able to hear that
that

02:14:45.350 --> 02:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:48.470 --> 02:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
it would be irregular for us to take a
 
02:14:49.589 --> 02:14:49.599 align:start position:0%
vote on some of the things
 
02:14:51.189 --> 02:14:51.199 align:start position:0%
wrong that we've already considered so i
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
think at this point
 
02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
i would recognize uh representative
 
02:15:03.030 --> 02:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
i like the promotion out that we retain
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
i think i've talked quite a bit about
 
02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
this bill um
 
02:15:10.470 --> 02:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
you're expecting that motion to repeat
 
02:15:11.990 --> 02:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
oh secondary
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
that has been that motion to retain been
 
02:15:21.990 --> 02:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
seconded by representative anthologist
 
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
anyone wishes to speak uh on the motion
 
02:15:25.430 --> 02:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
02:15:29.870 --> 02:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
all right open
 
02:15:29.880 --> 02:15:33.350 align:start position:0%
all right open

seeing no uh seeing no hands raised the

02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
on house till 598 before we adjourn
 
02:17:42.950 --> 02:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
just one housekeeping matter and i will
 
02:17:45.110 --> 02:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
assure you that if you have any
 
02:17:48.309 --> 02:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
questions about this that um do a much
 
02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
better job of explaining this to myself
 
02:17:54.549 --> 02:17:54.559 align:start position:0%
last during the last time we met we
 
02:17:58.070 --> 02:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
did a reconsideration in of a retained
 
02:17:58.080 --> 02:17:59.429 align:start position:0%
did a reconsideration in of a retained
bill

02:17:59.429 --> 02:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
he was hd 576.
 
02:18:05.830 --> 02:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
after the reconsideration
 
02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:20.070 --> 02:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
despite that uh unification amongst the
 
02:18:22.389 --> 02:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
committee on that until
 
02:18:25.830 --> 02:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
he when the bill was retained earlier
 
02:18:28.790 --> 02:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
it was delivered to the clerk and by the
 
02:18:29.509 --> 02:18:29.519 align:start position:0%
bill being
 
02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
delivered to the clerk despite being
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
retained it was actually no longer
 
02:18:37.669 --> 02:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
in our committee and for that reason uh
 
02:18:40.950 --> 02:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
it was not proper for us to reconsider
 
02:18:43.429 --> 02:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
the bill and then to vote on it both on
 
02:18:43.439 --> 02:18:44.150 align:start position:0%
the bill and then to vote on it both on
the

02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
chats although that was a good exercise
 
02:18:47.040 --> 02:18:49.990 align:start position:0%
chats although that was a good exercise
and

02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:51.429 --> 02:18:51.439 align:start position:0%
i should say good exercise to the main
 
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
correct procedural matter if not
 
02:18:55.589 --> 02:18:55.599 align:start position:0%
essentially that that whole
 
02:18:57.429 --> 02:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
reconsideration then off the task
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
would not be it's not proper because the
 
02:19:01.349 --> 02:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
bill of the money
 
02:19:04.230 --> 02:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
that bill would is will remain uh
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
continue to be retained by the committee
 
02:19:10.950 --> 02:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh considering what uh what we voted on
 
02:19:13.509 --> 02:19:13.519 align:start position:0%
i can imagine that we will eventually
 
02:19:14.790 --> 02:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
pass that field
 
02:19:16.709 --> 02:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
this time just to clarify the members
 
02:19:18.830 --> 02:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
that bill would not be
 
02:19:21.990 --> 02:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh leaving this committee has not
 
02:19:22.870 --> 02:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
defended us
 
02:19:27.750 --> 02:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:28.870 --> 02:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
there's not there's not much we can do
 
02:19:31.750 --> 02:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:33.830 --> 02:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr j could you
 
02:19:35.589 --> 02:19:35.599 align:start position:0%
clarify the clarification
 
02:19:37.990 --> 02:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh beginning with uh what bill we're
 
02:19:39.030 --> 02:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:49.190 --> 02:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
that we retained well we initially
 
02:19:59.590 --> 02:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
after we retained it completely the
 
02:20:04.790 --> 02:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
public hearing was on march 3rd
 
02:20:10.710 --> 02:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
it was it was documented on march 9th i
 
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
believe on march
 
02:20:19.510 --> 02:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
10th we opened the public hearing
 
02:20:21.830 --> 02:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i reopened the executive
 
02:20:21.840 --> 02:20:23.030 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i reopened the executive
session

02:20:23.030 --> 02:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:20:27.670 --> 02:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
and it i there's a motion to reconsider
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
hp 576 and after this was reconsidered
 
02:20:33.510 --> 02:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
a motion about the past however because
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:20:37.270 --> 02:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
delivered to the clerk once the bill is
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
delivered to the court
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
whether it's any speed to legislate off
 
02:20:42.230 --> 02:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
the pass
 
02:20:45.030 --> 02:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
about the past cemented detained the
 
02:20:46.309 --> 02:20:46.319 align:start position:0%
committee no longer has
 
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
it's no longer the possession there will
 
02:20:51.510 --> 02:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
be not able to take action
 
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
i i was unaware that it was you know
 
02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:55.270 align:start position:0%
i i was unaware that it was you know
delivered

02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
delivered
 
02:20:58.230 --> 02:20:58.240 align:start position:0%
when that action was done so my
 
02:20:59.830 --> 02:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
understanding is that
 
02:21:02.630 --> 02:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
all the good work we did in community we
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
showed on
 
02:21:07.030 --> 02:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
not a proper procedure to do that so
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
that motion free consideration and not
 
02:21:14.309 --> 02:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
to pass themselves would be
 
02:21:17.349 --> 02:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
nullified and the bill will remain
 
02:21:17.359 --> 02:21:18.070 align:start position:0%
nullified and the bill will remain
retained

02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
retained
 
02:21:19.830 --> 02:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
there's no disrespect to the bill itself
 
02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
there's no disrespect to
 
02:21:24.469 --> 02:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
that's just when i went through my
 
02:21:25.990 --> 02:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
paperwork i was i
 
02:21:28.630 --> 02:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
i didn't see that it was talking about
 
02:21:28.640 --> 02:21:30.870 align:start position:0%
i didn't see that it was talking about
but

02:21:30.870 --> 02:21:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:34.950 --> 02:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
that's true so i've lost that paperwork
 
02:21:35.910 --> 02:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
so what
 
02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
what was the title of what was 576
 
02:21:41.110 --> 02:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
relative to the victim's compensation
 
02:21:45.510 --> 02:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:50.030 --> 02:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:00.860 --> 02:22:00.870 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:00.870 --> 02:22:16.710 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:22:16.710 --> 02:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
um i have a question for the chair
 
02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
on hb 576
 
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
um so this is
 
02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
retained because we didn't
 
02:22:32.070 --> 02:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
do it we didn't reconsider it correctly
 
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:54.350 --> 02:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:54.360 --> 02:23:02.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:23:02.070 --> 02:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions from the court
 
02:23:05.349 --> 02:23:05.359 align:start position:0%
they can be directed at the clerk
 
02:23:08.630 --> 02:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:10.550 --> 02:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
but that's the procedure that's uh and
 
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
there's not much i can do to
 
02:23:16.830 --> 02:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:19.510 --> 02:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized
 
02:23:21.910 --> 02:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
okay um i understand that but is the
 
02:23:24.790 --> 02:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
clerk still with us
 
02:23:27.910 --> 02:23:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:33.670 --> 02:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
okay i have a question of the clerk
 
02:23:36.870 --> 02:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
i'm here representative okay is it
 
02:23:41.590 --> 02:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
is there anything that we can do to um
 
02:23:45.670 --> 02:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
i guess so that the 19-0 vote goes
 
02:23:45.680 --> 02:23:45.990 align:start position:0%
i guess so that the 19-0 vote goes
through

02:23:45.990 --> 02:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:23:48.790 --> 02:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
or anything that we can do to what would
 
02:23:51.270 --> 02:23:51.280 align:start position:0%
it take to pull it back to us or
 
02:23:53.429 --> 02:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
you know well i'm just not sure and i'm
 
02:23:54.710 --> 02:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
just asking
 
02:23:56.870 --> 02:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
sure so the sure the short answer is it
 
02:23:58.790 --> 02:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's still with you
 
02:24:01.750 --> 02:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh the issue is that it the the action
 
02:24:01.760 --> 02:24:03.030 align:start position:0%
uh the issue is that it the the action
um

02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:05.910 --> 02:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
isn't before the isn't going before the
 
02:24:07.270 --> 02:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
body at this point
 
02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
because because you you did vote to
 
02:24:10.389 --> 02:24:10.399 align:start position:0%
retain it
 
02:24:12.309 --> 02:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
the list of retained bills was
 
02:24:14.389 --> 02:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
transmitted to my office and so we
 
02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
we did docketed accordingly so that
 
02:24:19.990 --> 02:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
at that point just as if a bill had been
 
02:24:21.990 --> 02:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
reported out as itl that had been
 
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
transmitted to my office
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
it could not be reconsidered by the
 
02:24:27.750 --> 02:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
committee um so the list had been
 
02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:28.870 align:start position:0%
committee um so the list had been
transmitted

02:24:28.870 --> 02:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
transmitted
 
02:24:31.510 --> 02:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
um and while the the bill is still
 
02:24:33.429 --> 02:24:33.439 align:start position:0%
technically in your possession
 
02:24:36.710 --> 02:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh but your your report uh for this year
 
02:24:38.389 --> 02:24:38.399 align:start position:0%
is that you've retained it for action in
 
02:24:39.750 --> 02:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
the second year
 
02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
um you can begin uh uh
 
02:24:45.590 --> 02:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
as you conclude your work in in on house
 
02:24:46.950 --> 02:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
bills and senate bills
 
02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
uh the speaker has indicated that you
 
02:24:51.349 --> 02:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
can begin retained bill work sessions
 
02:24:54.790 --> 02:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh for for the second year um and
 
02:24:56.950 --> 02:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
and obviously uh come the fall this this
 
02:24:58.230 --> 02:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
could be reported out and
 
02:24:59.830 --> 02:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
and certainly it sounds like it's almost
 
02:25:01.830 --> 02:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
a consent calendar item
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
um uh and not being familiar with a
 
02:25:05.190 --> 02:25:05.200 align:start position:0%
particular bill
 
02:25:07.270 --> 02:25:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh but but that being said i will say
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
that this uh that you
 
02:25:10.710 --> 02:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh are not the only committee that has
 
02:25:12.870 --> 02:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
found themselves in this situation
 
02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
um there there is a a
 
02:25:19.510 --> 02:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
an alternative whereby um on the full
 
02:25:20.630 --> 02:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
floor of the house
 
02:25:24.309 --> 02:25:24.319 align:start position:0%
a bill could be withdrawn from committee
 
02:25:27.750 --> 02:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
however um i would suggest that um
 
02:25:30.230 --> 02:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
that that is not a good practice uh
 
02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
because it
 
02:25:33.270 --> 02:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
it essentially is taken away from your
 
02:25:34.309 --> 02:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
committee because
 
02:25:37.110 --> 02:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
uh with without a recommendation from
 
02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh and it sort of makes the committee
 
02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
look like they have not done
 
02:25:44.630 --> 02:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
um sort of their their diligence in that
 
02:25:44.640 --> 02:25:45.510 align:start position:0%
um sort of their their diligence in that
reporting

02:25:45.510 --> 02:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh so i do um that is sort of the
 
02:25:47.760 --> 02:25:48.950 align:start position:0%
uh so i do um that is sort of the
situation

02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
situation
 
02:25:53.190 --> 02:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
on um on that particular bill
 
02:25:57.580 --> 02:25:57.590 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you very much
 
02:25:57.590 --> 02:26:03.429 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you very much
[Music]

02:26:03.429 --> 02:26:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:06.230 --> 02:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
thank you just to further clarify this
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
question is to
 
02:26:10.469 --> 02:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
clerk hold smith and uh
 
02:26:12.710 --> 02:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
so the reta even though it's retained
 
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
and it's still
 
02:26:16.710 --> 02:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
in technically in the position of the
 
02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:17.990 align:start position:0%
in technically in the position of the
committee

02:26:17.990 --> 02:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:26:20.950 --> 02:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
not committee cannot act on it is that
 
02:26:21.590 --> 02:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
what you're
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
what you're saying yes representative
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
amanda putin when a bill is retained by
 
02:26:27.750 --> 02:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
a committee it means it is retained for
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
the first year
 
02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
session uh so that means that uh
 
02:26:33.270 --> 02:26:33.280 align:start position:0%
technically that the committee has has
 
02:26:36.309 --> 02:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
opted to do more work on it um over the
 
02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
over the few months uh in between the
 
02:26:40.070 --> 02:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
first year and the second year
 
02:26:42.550 --> 02:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
um there this this obviously we we have
 
02:26:44.389 --> 02:26:44.399 align:start position:0%
about 120 bills that have been
 
02:26:47.110 --> 02:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
listed as retained thus far um most of
 
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
those have to do
 
02:26:50.790 --> 02:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
with um things where whereby the
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
committee does wish to do more work
 
02:26:57.270 --> 02:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:00.830 --> 02:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
so this is not like the follow-up mr
 
02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:15.349 align:start position:0%
so this is not like the follow-up mr
chair

02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:27.349 --> 02:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:29.670 --> 02:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr clerk and what what is the
 
02:27:30.870 --> 02:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
consequence if it
 
02:27:34.070 --> 02:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
if the bill is not reported out by the
 
02:27:35.830 --> 02:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
end of the year what's the consequence
 
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
in the second year in that case
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
if we don't get anything done um
 
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
you have to um the committees have to
 
02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:43.990 align:start position:0%
you have to um the committees have to
come

02:27:43.990 --> 02:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
come
 
02:27:46.630 --> 02:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
back uh in the fall and and report on
 
02:27:47.270 --> 02:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
all of their
 
02:27:49.110 --> 02:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
i have an executive session on all of
 
02:28:01.750 --> 02:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:05.110 --> 02:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
um this is um just for executive session
 
02:28:08.150 --> 02:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh unless we're done with that i just
 
02:28:09.270 --> 02:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
feel like we
 
02:28:12.389 --> 02:28:12.399 align:start position:0%
made a mistake and the bill's good and
 
02:28:14.309 --> 02:28:14.319 align:start position:0%
we should fight to overturn this on the
 
02:28:14.319 --> 02:28:18.630 align:start position:0%
we should fight to overturn this on the
floor

02:28:18.630 --> 02:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:20.150 --> 02:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
i agree that the bill was good and i
 
02:28:25.590 --> 02:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sure i'm sure we'll get this bill
 
02:28:28.950 --> 02:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
out of our committee
 
02:28:30.469 --> 02:28:30.479 align:start position:0%
we would have gone on the train calendar
 
02:28:32.070 --> 02:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
if not for
 
02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:33.530 align:start position:0%
if not for
situations

02:28:33.530 --> 02:28:33.540 align:start position:0%
situations
 
02:28:33.540 --> 02:28:35.750 align:start position:0%
situations
