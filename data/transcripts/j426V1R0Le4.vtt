New Hampshire we want this to be a

two-way conversation and
 
00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 align:start position:0%
um we're just going to begin by
 
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 align:start position:0%
introducing uh ourselves so we are both
 
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
Scholars at the mercatus center at
 
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 align:start position:0%
George Mason University uh Mercedes is a
 
00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 align:start position:0%
university-based research center where
 
00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 align:start position:0%
non-partisan non-profit
 
00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
we do not Lobby and we work with
 
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:11.280 align:start position:0%
legislators such as yourselves
 
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
not all 50 states but a lot of States we
 
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
work with federal policy makers and
 
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
locals as well as other academics and
 
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
people interested in housing issues
 
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
mercatus covers a range of issues Beyond
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
Urban economics and housing so we've got
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
colleagues who are working on drone
 
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
policy monetary policy lots of different
 
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
kind of Niche areas I would say within
 
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 align:start position:0%
economics broadly
 
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:35.270 align:start position:0%
economics broadly
um

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:37.740 align:start position:0%
my name is Celine Firth so I'm I'm the
 
00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 align:start position:0%
one of the directors of the urbanity
 
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
project which is the urban economics and
 
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
housing group at Mercedes
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
um and I've been there since 2018. I got
 
00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
my PhD at the University of Rochester
 
00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
and got to retrain as an urban Economist
 
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
which is a lot more fun than being a
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
macro economist
 
00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
um I'll let Charlie introduce himself
 
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
and then then we'll jump right into
 
00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.529 align:start position:0%
and then then we'll jump right into
presentations

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:00.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh good morning chairman and
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
representatives again thank you also for
 
00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
for having us here this morning my name
 
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
is Charlie Gardner I'm a research fellow
 
00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
with mercadis my background is as an
 
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
attorney in private practice until
 
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
joining mercantis just a little earlier
 
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
this year but um I got my undergraduate
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
degree actually from from Dartmouth
 
00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
College just up the road so it's nice to
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
be back in New Hampshire uh uh after
 
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:26.340 align:start position:0%
some time and um
 
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
look forward to
 
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:30.780 align:start position:0%
presenting some information to you and
 
00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully taking any questions that you
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
may have so thank you again
 
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
so we've we've given you a folder and I
 
00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
hope you you know uh get to read this
 
00:07:41.089 --> 00:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
you know just some references that we'll
 
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
have to stuff in the folder while we're
 
00:07:43.969 --> 00:07:43.979 align:start position:0%
talking and then it's going to be more
 
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
reading for later so aside from our bios
 
00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
I put together a little
 
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
um some basic stats on New Hampshire and
 
00:07:52.249 --> 00:07:52.259 align:start position:0%
some policies that we're looking at in
 
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
other states I'll talk about that
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
handout a little bit
 
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
um there's testimony that I gave just
 
00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
written testimony on
 
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.510 align:start position:0%
written testimony on
um

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740 align:start position:0%
hb44 two months ago
 
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
on the right hand side of the folder is
 
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
the housing reform of the state's menu
 
00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:10.259 align:start position:0%
of options these are
 
00:08:12.050 --> 00:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
policies they're not relevant to every
 
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
single state but things that we thought
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
were broadly relevant to State
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
legislatures coming into this
 
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
legislative session and policy ideas
 
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
that we've seen work or that we would
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
like to see you know a state really try
 
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.620 align:start position:0%
and then my colleague Emily Hamilton
 
00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
and one of our research assistants just
 
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
published a New Hampshire case study on
 
00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:32.039 align:start position:0%
Accessory dwelling units and kind of
 
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
looked at a 2017 law that is fairly weak
 
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
but requires
 
00:08:40.329 --> 00:08:40.339 align:start position:0%
towns to allow accessory dwelling units
 
00:08:42.529 --> 00:08:42.539 align:start position:0%
there's lots of regulations that towns
 
00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
can have but what she found was that
 
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
there's actually quite a substantial
 
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
rate of Permitting given the uh given
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
the level of the
 
00:08:53.509 --> 00:08:53.519 align:start position:0%
stringencies that the law allows
 
00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
so just going into like the some of the
 
00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
stats first
 
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously you guys are here
 
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
because prices and rents are rising in
 
00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
the state and you know just to sort of
 
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
satisfy all of us make sure we're almost
 
00:09:09.470 --> 00:09:09.480 align:start position:0%
on the same page you know put together
 
00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:11.339 align:start position:0%
um just a graph of what's happened to
 
00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:14.459 align:start position:0%
prices in uh three the three largest
 
00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
counties in New Hampshire
 
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
in the past what is this
 
00:09:21.889 --> 00:09:21.899 align:start position:0%
seven years and you know you can see
 
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a strong upward trend
 
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:25.740 align:start position:0%
up into the beginning of the pandemic
 
00:09:29.509 --> 00:09:29.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
the key here for me as an economist is
 
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
to look at prices and rents together
 
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
so if you see prices rising without
 
00:09:41.150 --> 00:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
rents increasing
 
00:09:42.949 --> 00:09:42.959 align:start position:0%
you might sort of suspect that demand is
 
00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:44.459 align:start position:0%
coming from something
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
that's not fundamental right so it might
 
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
be just low interest rates it might be
 
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:50.360 align:start position:0%
Wall Street
 
00:09:52.670 --> 00:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
investors chasing returns wherever they
 
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
can get them
 
00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
but instead when you see rent and prices
 
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
rising together
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
this is basically going back to the
 
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
fundamentals right people don't rent
 
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
housing speculatively right rent is
 
00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
always I just want a place to live it's
 
00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:05.459 align:start position:0%
on a one-year basis
 
00:10:06.769 --> 00:10:06.779 align:start position:0%
I'm paying for this because I want to
 
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
live here right now and when prices are
 
00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
tracking that what it tells me is that
 
00:10:12.889 --> 00:10:12.899 align:start position:0%
the demand is fundamental the demand is
 
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
human it's based in people's jobs
 
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
people's retirement incomes where people
 
00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
want to live right now not something
 
00:10:23.389 --> 00:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
speculative and I think that's important
 
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:25.740 align:start position:0%
when we talk about solutions that we
 
00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:28.260 align:start position:0%
can't sort of
 
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:31.260 align:start position:0%
um you know play some magic trick or
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
push Wall Street out or
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
get interest rates right and make the
 
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
price problem disappear when it's based
 
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
in rents it's fundamental
 
00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:39.470 align:start position:0%
in rents it's fundamental
um

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
so it gets really important evidence
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
now New Hampshire's housing stock in
 
00:10:45.590 --> 00:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
this this is where the map comes in and
 
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
you can you know hopefully maybe find
 
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:49.740 align:start position:0%
your own District on here uh the space
 
00:10:51.769 --> 00:10:51.779 align:start position:0%
the the blocks your census tracts which
 
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
is how the data arrives which is not
 
00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:56.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't cleanly map to towns but usually
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
the census tracts follow Town borders
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
and as you can see there's actually a
 
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
pretty big decline in housing stock in
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
the North Country
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
um that's a big part of the map it's not
 
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
not a big part of the population of New
 
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and then downstate or most of
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
your districts are there's been a decent
 
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
increase in the housing stock but if you
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
look Statewide
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's housing stock and New
 
00:11:18.829 --> 00:11:18.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's population are growing at
 
00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
about two-thirds of the national rate
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
and that's for the the kind of most of a
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
decade coming into
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
the the pandemic obviously thinks since
 
00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:32.459 align:start position:0%
the pandemic things have been scrambled
 
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
and I'd say that probably the pandemic
 
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
accelerated that growing demand growth
 
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
um and that's going to look really
 
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
different in the different parts of the
 
00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:42.060 align:start position:0%
state right so downstate
 
00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
um long commutes are a lot more
 
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:45.180 align:start position:0%
tolerable when you only have to do them
 
00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:47.459 align:start position:0%
a couple times a week you know or or
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
maybe once or twice a month even so
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
folks who
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know have a downtown Boston job if
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
they've only got to go there
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
you know once a week
 
00:11:58.970 --> 00:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
an hour and a half commute or a long bus
 
00:12:00.889 --> 00:12:00.899 align:start position:0%
ride in from from Nashville is not so
 
00:12:00.899 --> 00:12:02.030 align:start position:0%
ride in from from Nashville is not so
bad

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
bad
 
00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
um and so you're gonna see I think
 
00:12:06.650 --> 00:12:06.660 align:start position:0%
durable Demand right that part-time work
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
is is going to stay with us so this
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
isn't just going to be a pandemic effect
 
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be more more demand for
 
00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
living at the very edges of Metro areas
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
which the Boston metro area absolutely
 
00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:19.740 align:start position:0%
gets into a lot of your districts
 
00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:21.300 align:start position:0%
and then Upstate in the you know in The
 
00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920 align:start position:0%
Lakes area
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
um on the mountains
 
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
there you're seeing I think a different
 
00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:29.579 align:start position:0%
demand that that's beyond most commuters
 
00:12:29.579 --> 00:12:30.769 align:start position:0%
demand that that's beyond most commuters
reach

00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
reach
 
00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:32.700 align:start position:0%
but there's some small number of work
 
00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
from anywhere people that's more likely
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
to be a pandemic effect that goes away
 
00:12:38.090 --> 00:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
you know some people who were maybe
 
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:40.140 align:start position:0%
summer folks could spend all year there
 
00:12:42.889 --> 00:12:42.899 align:start position:0%
in 2020 and 2021 maybe that's over for
 
00:12:42.899 --> 00:12:44.389 align:start position:0%
in 2020 and 2021 maybe that's over for
them

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
um longer term there's a big gonna be a
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
big boom of retirements just based on
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
the U.S demographics the Baby Boomers
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
are all hitting retirement
 
00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:54.360 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's a source of demand
 
00:12:56.569 --> 00:12:56.579 align:start position:0%
that's long-term
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
um and it's not a lot of people but then
 
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:00.740 align:start position:0%
if you're you know a town like Meredith
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
it doesn't take a lot of retirees from
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
New York to be a lot of people in
 
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.050 align:start position:0%
New York to be a lot of people in
Meredith

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
Meredith
 
00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
and so you can sort of get big
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
percentage increases from a relatively
 
00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:12.060 align:start position:0%
small population which puts pressure on
 
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
a quite small housing stock that you get
 
00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
in a a rural or a vacation oriented area
 
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
there's also more people like myself who
 
00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
can take kind of long vacations
 
00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
um and be away from their offices
 
00:13:26.629 --> 00:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
working remotely for a long time and so
 
00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
you can get increased demand for
 
00:13:32.509 --> 00:13:32.519 align:start position:0%
uh places to nice places to become
 
00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:34.139 align:start position:0%
vacation homes so somebody could say oh
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna go spend all of July you know
 
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
uh up in Ossipee instead of in DC and
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
skip that horrible DC weather but you
 
00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
know work most of those days and so
 
00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
that's going to be an increase in demand
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
so there's a bunch of sources
 
00:13:50.569 --> 00:13:50.579 align:start position:0%
um that rent data is telling me it's
 
00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:51.650 align:start position:0%
um that rent data is telling me it's
fundamental

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:51.660 align:start position:0%
fundamental
 
00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:53.700 align:start position:0%
and I I don't think we can you can
 
00:13:54.889 --> 00:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
weight the problem out or hope that
 
00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:57.420 align:start position:0%
higher interest rates uh solve it in the
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
long term so I'm going to hand it over
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
to Charlie and then
 
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:00.889 align:start position:0%
to Charlie and then
um

00:14:00.889 --> 00:14:00.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:02.329 --> 00:14:02.339 align:start position:0%
come back at the end and talk more about
 
00:14:03.949 --> 00:14:03.959 align:start position:0%
solutions that other states are seeing
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
and that we're we've identified in our
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
so just for a little bit of um review
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
and background on uh land use sort of
 
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
the legal perspective obviously land use
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
plannings existed for as long as there
 
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:20.220 align:start position:0%
have been cities but zoning in the
 
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
United States only only dates back about
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
a century and was approved by the
 
00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:27.959 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court in 1926.
 
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
um so compared to the history of
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
history the country in particular
 
00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:36.540 align:start position:0%
history of New Hampshire going back to
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
the 1600s a relatively a relatively
 
00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180 align:start position:0%
recent development
 
00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
obviously New Hampshire as you know it's
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
a setting of the uh the case which
 
00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
set in motion modern corporate law on
 
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
the free enterprise system the Dartmouth
 
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
versus Woodward case I just I think just
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
passed its 200th anniversary
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
um and that's some that's a tradition as
 
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
you know that's continued to the present
 
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it's continually
 
00:15:05.449 --> 00:15:05.459 align:start position:0%
uh rank near the top for uh or to the
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
close to the top among the 50 states for
 
00:15:08.889 --> 00:15:08.899 align:start position:0%
economic freedom
 
00:15:13.009 --> 00:15:13.019 align:start position:0%
now New Hampshire went approximately
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
300 years I believe the first settlement
 
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was 1623 to the 1920s
 
00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
without zoning so the historic
 
00:15:23.329 --> 00:15:23.339 align:start position:0%
towns and cities that
 
00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
we all know
 
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:26.180 align:start position:0%
in love in New Hampshire from Portsmouth
 
00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:28.860 align:start position:0%
Wolfeboro were all developed and planned
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
out and built before zoning
 
00:15:34.189 --> 00:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
today however at least the best estimate
 
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:36.420 align:start position:0%
I can find is the 220 out of New
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's 234 municipalities have
 
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.050 align:start position:0%
 
now

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:44.060 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's towns are
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
have derived their authority to Zone
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
from the state from from the state
 
00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:54.540 align:start position:0%
enabling statute which is uh New
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire revised Statute section 672-1
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
which has been amended a few times in
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
recent years
 
00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.509 align:start position:0%
recent years
um

00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
now that's the the current version of
 
00:16:05.689 --> 00:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
that statute which you may be very
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
familiar with I don't know simply
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
provides that zoning should continue to
 
00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
be the responsibility of municipalities
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
but also imposes some obligations upon
 
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
them including developing developing a
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
balanced supply of housing for people of
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
all incomes that's an obligation it's
 
00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
actually placed on municipalities
 
00:16:26.030 --> 00:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
promotion of Agriculture and Forestry
 
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
it's protecting those natural resources
 
00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:30.899 align:start position:0%
from development for other uses
 
00:16:33.889 --> 00:16:33.899 align:start position:0%
there's also a Prohibition on forbidding
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
in-home daycares not sure exactly when
 
00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:39.420 align:start position:0%
that was adopted but setting a limit on
 
00:16:41.329 --> 00:16:41.339 align:start position:0%
what local municipalities can do in
 
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:44.220 align:start position:0%
terms of restricting in-home businesses
 
00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:46.740 align:start position:0%
again consistent with economic freedom
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
so New Hampshire has through those
 
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
changes to the enabling statute and
 
00:16:54.050 --> 00:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
through certain other regulation has
 
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
acknowledged that there's a role for the
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
state in setting objectives for and
 
00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:00.300 align:start position:0%
limitations on that local zoning power
 
00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh both to promote individual property
 
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
rights to promote individual economic
 
00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:06.299 align:start position:0%
freedom for example what you can use
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
what sort of businesses you can run out
 
00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
of your own house
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
um which get down I think to the very
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
fundamentals of starting small
 
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
businesses and um
 
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
private Enterprise
 
00:17:17.699 --> 00:17:18.850 align:start position:0%
private Enterprise
so

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:18.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:21.289 --> 00:17:21.299 align:start position:0%
there is uh there is certainly a
 
00:17:24.049 --> 00:17:24.059 align:start position:0%
precedent for the state pushing back on
 
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
some of the most exclusionary and
 
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
restrictive rules that are set
 
00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:30.900 align:start position:0%
um by by local towns and cities and
 
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
Celine will tell you just in a moment
 
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
how how some other states are
 
00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
approaching these same issues and some
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
of the reforms
 
00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
than other states have been looking as a
 
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
way to
 
00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
return rights back to individual
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
Property Owners where municipalities
 
00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.590 align:start position:0%
Property Owners where municipalities
have

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
have interfered in a way that affects
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
property rights or economic freedom
 
00:17:51.059 --> 00:17:53.090 align:start position:0%
property rights or economic freedom
so

00:17:53.090 --> 00:17:53.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.590 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
in practice for example for here in
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
Concord the current zoning
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
heavily regulates existing areas close
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
to downtown where land values are
 
00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:07.460 align:start position:0%
relatively High
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
whereas undeveloped areas
 
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.330 align:start position:0%
whereas undeveloped areas
are

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
generally not treated with the the same
 
00:18:15.409 --> 00:18:15.419 align:start position:0%
degree of attention
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
and there's been a development that's
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
occurred in
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
farmland and Forest land
 
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
so primarily
 
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
sort of it is restricting opportunities
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
for redevelopment and growth in areas
 
00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
where the highest demand for it exists
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
whereas being indifferent to growth on
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
the periphery which I think is resulted
 
00:18:39.110 --> 00:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
in some of the development patterns
 
00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.049 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:45.059 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
again I would just emphasize that I do
 
00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:49.260 align:start position:0%
think there is a role here and there's
 
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:50.760 align:start position:0%
certainly president in New Hampshire and
 
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:52.860 align:start position:0%
from other states in the legislature
 
00:18:56.330 --> 00:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
taking a taking an active role in
 
00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
pushing back against some of the
 
00:19:00.289 --> 00:19:00.299 align:start position:0%
constraints on housing production and
 
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:02.700 align:start position:0%
some of the constraints on people's
 
00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
economic activities that you see at
 
00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:06.299 align:start position:0%
local levels and I'll turn it back to
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
slim to give you a little more detail on
 
00:19:12.169 --> 00:19:12.179 align:start position:0%
what's going on elsewhere but thank you
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Charlie
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
um so I talked in the sort of data
 
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
opening a little bit about supply and
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
demand so the demand is real it's
 
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:23.100 align:start position:0%
fundamental uh turning to the supply
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
side right ultimately
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
uh as policy makers you look at a market
 
00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:31.020 align:start position:0%
um you can just sort of stand back and
 
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
say like okay we see supply and demand
 
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
prices move uh as supply and demand move
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
and we're not going to touch it like
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
that's just the market working and fine
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
um or you can come in and say okay well
 
00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to affect the demand side
 
00:19:45.049 --> 00:19:45.059 align:start position:0%
somehow like we might try to
 
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
interest rates to lower demand or we
 
00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
might give people first time home buyer
 
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
credits or rental vouchers to boost
 
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
demand which can help individuals But
 
00:19:57.409 --> 00:19:57.419 align:start position:0%
ultimately that flows into prices so
 
00:19:57.419 --> 00:19:58.190 align:start position:0%
ultimately that flows into prices so
when

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
when
 
00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
when you give first-time homebuyers a
 
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
credit then the people they're competing
 
00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
against have to pay more to bid for the
 
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:07.500 align:start position:0%
same home so it has a distributional
 
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:09.780 align:start position:0%
effect maybe you like getting first-time
 
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
buyers into houses as opposed to letting
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
people move up or something else
 
00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:16.320 align:start position:0%
But ultimately the
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
you know the net effect to the economy
 
00:20:20.029 --> 00:20:20.039 align:start position:0%
is just you've got more money chasing
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
the same stock of houses
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
so when we're looking at this market now
 
00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760 align:start position:0%
you know our
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
interpretation as economists and and
 
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
lawyers is this isn't just a market you
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
should stand back from and say like okay
 
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
well this is just the world working and
 
00:20:36.049 --> 00:20:36.059 align:start position:0%
sometimes things get more expensive like
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
eggs lately right the chickens got sick
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
so eggs are more expensive okay there's
 
00:20:42.169 --> 00:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
not a lot we can do about that
 
00:20:42.179 --> 00:20:43.130 align:start position:0%
not a lot we can do about that
um

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:45.539 align:start position:0%
but in this case the government has
 
00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:48.419 align:start position:0%
played a very active role in determining
 
00:20:48.419 --> 00:20:49.250 align:start position:0%
played a very active role in determining
Supply

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
Supply
 
00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
right so we created zoning 100 plus
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
00:20:57.650 --> 00:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
and we delegated that power to
 
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
localities and they use zoning not just
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
to kind of make a place for everything
 
00:21:04.430 --> 00:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
and keep noxious uses away from
 
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
residential uses uh which I don't know
 
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
anybody who who objects to
 
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
but to really curate the way that towns
 
00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
grow this is true across the country uh
 
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is unique in having a you
 
00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
know the New England Town form of
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
government which we'll talk about in a
 
00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.190 align:start position:0%
government which we'll talk about in a
moment

00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
moment
 
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
but it's not unique in having a locally
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
based regulations that are decided by
 
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
usually very small numbers of people who
 
00:21:30.049 --> 00:21:30.059 align:start position:0%
show up to hearings or who vote in local
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
elections and who take an active
 
00:21:34.909 --> 00:21:34.919 align:start position:0%
interest in
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
the zoning that's that's often very
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
immediately in their neighborhood and so
 
00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:40.740 align:start position:0%
you certainly understand those interests
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
and why people get involved but we can't
 
00:21:46.010 --> 00:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
kind of look away from the fact that
 
00:21:48.409 --> 00:21:48.419 align:start position:0%
the supply side of the housing market is
 
00:21:51.230 --> 00:21:51.240 align:start position:0%
very much a government-led phenomenon
 
00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
which means that the you know Solutions
 
00:21:54.950 --> 00:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
are going to have to involve not be
 
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
solely governmental but have to involve
 
00:21:59.390 --> 00:21:59.400 align:start position:0%
government thinking about its role
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
so you know I I as an I'm a
 
00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts native so you know my
 
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
hometown had a militia and a welfare
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
state for a hundred years before the
 
00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
American Revolution happened right I
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
take Town history and town government
 
00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.220 align:start position:0%
really seriously
 
00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
uh the New England town government is a
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
um one of the greatest
 
00:22:23.810 --> 00:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
examples of and and examples for
 
00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:26.820 align:start position:0%
American democracy as its practice
 
00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
um people who know me as a scholar know
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
that I get I get really really angry
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
when people quote that tocqueville like
 
00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
Township like New England Township thing
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
like there's no townships right
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
townships are the uninhabited areas and
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
this happened because tocqueville wrote
 
00:22:40.850 --> 00:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
in French and then his translator was an
 
00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:42.140 align:start position:0%
Englishman who'd never been to America
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
and so tocqueville visited American
 
00:22:47.870 --> 00:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
towns it was a plaque right out there
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
um he wrote about commune in French and
 
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
that got translated back into English as
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
Township by somebody who had no idea
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
what he was talking about and this
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
entire branch of tocqueville scholarship
 
00:22:59.210 --> 00:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
has gone on talking about Township
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
governments as if they couldn't just
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
like show up in a New Hampshire town
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
on a random Tuesday and see town
 
00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
government in action and learn that it's
 
00:23:09.169 --> 00:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
actually called Town um so you've got
 
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
all these people in their Ivory Tower
 
00:23:11.390 --> 00:23:11.400 align:start position:0%
who have never been to a town meeting
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
and um don't know what to call it
 
00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:17.220 align:start position:0%
I get very worked up about that
 
00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:18.529 align:start position:0%
I get very worked up about that
um

00:23:18.529 --> 00:23:18.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
that said
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
town government shouldn't do everything
 
00:23:25.250 --> 00:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
and you know even even with that history
 
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
of having its own Army and its own uh
 
00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
welfare state
 
00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:31.260 align:start position:0%
this doesn't mean that unlimited
 
00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:34.980 align:start position:0%
unlimited power uh uh to regulate the
 
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
tax to spend is a good feature of town
 
00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
democracy and I think that zoning as
 
00:23:42.649 --> 00:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
we've given it to towns has actually
 
00:23:44.570 --> 00:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
weakened that democracy
 
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
by making towns much more interested in
 
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
trying to curate what goes on inside
 
00:23:52.909 --> 00:23:52.919 align:start position:0%
them via land use regulation rather than
 
00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
Serve and Protect
 
00:24:00.250 --> 00:24:00.260 align:start position:0%
what the citizens are doing as they they
 
00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
spontaneously transform their living
 
00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
patterns their business patterns their
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
land use patterns right so when you've
 
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
got a fundamentally fundamentally
 
00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.810 align:start position:0%
got a fundamentally fundamentally
exclusionary

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:11.820 align:start position:0%
exclusionary
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
um government right whether that's a
 
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
nation that says oh we're going to have
 
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
no immigrants and we're just gonna like
 
00:24:18.409 --> 00:24:18.419 align:start position:0%
you know we're for the natives and we
 
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
don't want anybody else here and we
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to change right that becomes
 
00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:24.059 align:start position:0%
a negative government it's just trying
 
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
to stop things from happening
 
00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
and I think the town government can be
 
00:24:30.409 --> 00:24:30.419 align:start position:0%
incredibly powerful incredibly useful
 
00:24:31.789 --> 00:24:31.799 align:start position:0%
but it shouldn't be in the role of
 
00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:34.020 align:start position:0%
saying who gets to be here and what gets
 
00:24:37.789 --> 00:24:37.799 align:start position:0%
to be here it can do things like
 
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
um guiding and creating public
 
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
Investments right you can't do Urban
 
00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
growth without streets sewers Parks
 
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
schools that's all the role of
 
00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.110 align:start position:0%
schools that's all the role of
government

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
and town government is an incredibly
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
powerful tool and an incredibly useful
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
one for letting citizens kind of
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
directly affect an impact
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
the way that growth happens and sort of
 
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
being the handmaiden and following what
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
people in their private lives are doing
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Josh
 
00:25:07.679 --> 00:25:09.409 align:start position:0%
thank you so much Josh
um

00:25:09.409 --> 00:25:09.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
zoning power shouldn't be unlimited that
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
also doesn't mean that zoning power
 
00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:16.380 align:start position:0%
should go to the state um
 
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
I think you know you see sort of
 
00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:22.260 align:start position:0%
I see people in maybe in California and
 
00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
Oregon merging this way a little bit
 
00:25:26.029 --> 00:25:26.039 align:start position:0%
that like well we can't trust the cities
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
and the towns so let's just basically
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
move the zoning power to the statement
 
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
although we're still going to have
 
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:32.340 align:start position:0%
zoning power we're still gonna have all
 
00:25:33.649 --> 00:25:33.659 align:start position:0%
these little rules that decide what can
 
00:25:35.330 --> 00:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
go where and I think that's a terrible
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
idea please don't
 
00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there's any any
 
00:25:42.289 --> 00:25:42.299 align:start position:0%
appetite for that New Hampshire happily
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
but I think there's three there's three
 
00:25:45.769 --> 00:25:45.779 align:start position:0%
Arguments for State preemption
 
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
um where preemption means not taking
 
00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
over zoning but putting guard rails on
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
what towns can do and streamlining their
 
00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:55.549 align:start position:0%
what towns can do and streamlining their
process

00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:25:57.649 --> 00:25:57.659 align:start position:0%
I'm going to leave you in suspense
 
00:26:02.390 --> 00:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.529 --> 00:26:03.539 align:start position:0%
so the first argument for State
 
00:26:05.690 --> 00:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
preemption is property rights
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
so any regulation or delegation of
 
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority
 
00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
um by a government to a government
 
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
should face the burden of proof right so
 
00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:16.130 align:start position:0%
should face the burden of proof right so
we

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
going back to the chickens and the eggs
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
like we regulate the way that chicken
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
farms are run
 
00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
because the regulations meet some
 
00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
standard of evidence that
 
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
if we don't regulate the waste from
 
00:26:27.289 --> 00:26:27.299 align:start position:0%
large chicken farms it's going to
 
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
pollute Downstream
 
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.049 align:start position:0%
pollute Downstream
um

00:26:30.049 --> 00:26:30.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
bodies of water and so we start with
 
00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
some scientific evidence we make sure
 
00:26:36.769 --> 00:26:36.779 align:start position:0%
the regulation fits the harm that is
 
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
could potentially be done by by badly
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
built chicken farms and you know the
 
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
result is a moderate moderate moderately
 
00:26:45.049 --> 00:26:45.059 align:start position:0%
regulated industry
 
00:26:46.970 --> 00:26:46.980 align:start position:0%
and we try to address those from time to
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
time no regulations perfect
 
00:26:51.049 --> 00:26:51.059 align:start position:0%
um I think building codes are a good
 
00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320 align:start position:0%
example of a
 
00:26:55.130 --> 00:26:55.140 align:start position:0%
a good but imperfect body of Regulation
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
um people who are deep in the Weeds on
 
00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
building codes will say oh no they're
 
00:26:58.850 --> 00:26:58.860 align:start position:0%
terrible there's all these little things
 
00:27:00.769 --> 00:27:00.779 align:start position:0%
which is ultimately like you look at it
 
00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:02.820 align:start position:0%
you say okay there's a technocratic body
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
that updates building codes the building
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
codes are the same for everyone
 
00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
more or less Nationwide with with small
 
00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:10.740 align:start position:0%
exceptions or difference in it in which
 
00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:12.419 align:start position:0%
edition of the building code they use
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
but if you're a builder you basically
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
know the rules
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
um and you can work anywhere
 
00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
and this the
 
00:27:21.529 --> 00:27:21.539 align:start position:0%
process for updating those rules is
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
based on evidence right so it's
 
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
um civil engineers and physicists are
 
00:27:27.409 --> 00:27:27.419 align:start position:0%
doing experiments and figuring out what
 
00:27:28.850 --> 00:27:28.860 align:start position:0%
stress loads different materials can
 
00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
take and
 
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:33.240 align:start position:0%
um uh policymakers are setting some kind
 
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:34.850 align:start position:0%
um uh policymakers are setting some kind
of

00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:34.860 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:27:34.860 --> 00:27:35.630 align:start position:0%
of
um

00:27:35.630 --> 00:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
tolerance for error right so we say like
 
00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
okay if an earthquake fits three
 
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
standard deviations bigger than the norm
 
00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:42.360 align:start position:0%
happens like we don't have to be
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
prepared for that and those are those
 
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
are policy calls and how much risk
 
00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:48.299 align:start position:0%
you're willing to abide by for what cost
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
and so it's not perfect and there's ways
 
00:27:53.029 --> 00:27:53.039 align:start position:0%
that building codes can and do and
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
should change
 
00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:55.580 align:start position:0%
but that's what Mo that's what
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
regulation that is respecting property
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
rights looks like
 
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
um the second the second for State
 
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
preemption is fairness
 
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:08.220 align:start position:0%
so if local governments are tilting the
 
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
playing field systematically against
 
00:28:12.529 --> 00:28:12.539 align:start position:0%
some New Hampshire citizens right people
 
00:28:15.049 --> 00:28:15.059 align:start position:0%
who the state government
 
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:17.940 align:start position:0%
takes into account as its constituents
 
00:28:19.549 --> 00:28:19.559 align:start position:0%
but a particular local government
 
00:28:21.529 --> 00:28:21.539 align:start position:0%
doesn't because they don't live there
 
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
the state can counterbalance that right
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
so if if you've got
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know say if the beach Town said
 
00:28:29.630 --> 00:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
the beaches are only for you know
 
00:28:31.250 --> 00:28:31.260 align:start position:0%
residents of the beach towns and nobody
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
else can can go to the beach anymore
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
um the state could step in and say no
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's you know this is a state resource
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
and although it's located in your town
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
you're not allowed to pass regulations
 
00:28:42.169 --> 00:28:42.179 align:start position:0%
that that completely prohibit public
 
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
access to the beach you can pass some
 
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
reasonable regulation that balances the
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
costs of traffic and pollution it makes
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
um we do this I think all the time with
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
with industry
 
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.310 align:start position:0%
with industry
um

00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
Commerce for taking into account
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
The Wider interests of the entire
 
00:29:05.029 --> 00:29:05.039 align:start position:0%
Commonwealth the entire state
 
00:29:06.529 --> 00:29:06.539 align:start position:0%
and saying
 
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
um we're going to make sure that local
 
00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:10.500 align:start position:0%
laws don't go beyond what's fair to
 
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.930 align:start position:0%
laws don't go beyond what's fair to
everyone

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:11.940 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
fairness there's arguments about it it's
 
00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
not it's not like a you know slam dunk
 
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:17.340 align:start position:0%
you say fairness and you get whatever
 
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:19.020 align:start position:0%
lie you want but there's an argument to
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
be made there
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
and then finally the the third argument
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
for State preemption is to solve
 
00:29:27.049 --> 00:29:27.059 align:start position:0%
Statewide problems and in this case the
 
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
burden of proof is flipped so here I
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
would say the state has to meet a burden
 
00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:32.820 align:start position:0%
of proof before preempting that with the
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
first two I said the localities need to
 
00:29:36.169 --> 00:29:36.179 align:start position:0%
meet a burden of proof especially that
 
00:29:39.289 --> 00:29:39.299 align:start position:0%
person localities to to limit someone's
 
00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:40.320 align:start position:0%
property right they need a burden to
 
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
prove it we need to do this to solve
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
some kind of local problem
 
00:29:45.529 --> 00:29:45.539 align:start position:0%
flipping this around
 
00:29:47.330 --> 00:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
if the state wants to solve a Statewide
 
00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:49.740 align:start position:0%
problem like say the Statewide problem
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
is uh unemployment's too high so we'd
 
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
like to have more jobs okay that's a
 
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:55.020 align:start position:0%
Statewide problem that's a reasonable
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
problem to solve
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
but to somehow preempt the towns maybe
 
00:30:01.310 --> 00:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
to take away some property taxes so they
 
00:30:02.690 --> 00:30:02.700 align:start position:0%
can even give a tax break to businesses
 
00:30:03.649 --> 00:30:03.659 align:start position:0%
or something
 
00:30:05.870 --> 00:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
you need to meet a burden of proof as a
 
00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
state legislator that this is really
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
the best way to and the lowest cost way
 
00:30:12.529 --> 00:30:12.539 align:start position:0%
for us to do this
 
00:30:15.529 --> 00:30:15.539 align:start position:0%
um and again it's not you know it's not
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
like you just say this and you get to
 
00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:18.720 align:start position:0%
make the law of it if you can make the
 
00:30:20.090 --> 00:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
argument that there's Statewide problems
 
00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
of housing on affordability of
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
um inability for workers to live near
 
00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:26.940 align:start position:0%
their jobs
 
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
um inability for employers to find
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
people to hire
 
00:30:32.269 --> 00:30:32.279 align:start position:0%
right so if you can make that case and
 
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:35.460 align:start position:0%
say there are Statewide problems here
 
00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:37.020 align:start position:0%
um or you know environmental problems
 
00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:39.720 align:start position:0%
Etc and then we're going to
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
take a targeted approach that that is
 
00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:43.260 align:start position:0%
focused on
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
addressing this problem and it does
 
00:30:46.850 --> 00:30:46.860 align:start position:0%
involve preempting the towns but here's
 
00:30:48.110 --> 00:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
why that's logical so I think you can
 
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:49.380 align:start position:0%
make the case there but that's a much
 
00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:50.940 align:start position:0%
harder case to make than simply saying
 
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
hey you shouldn't restrict people's
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
property rights to run a home daycare
 
00:30:59.630 --> 00:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
so then ultimately the issue for you you
 
00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
as you consider bills that would preempt
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
local Authority is whether the local
 
00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
Regulators can make a compelling case
 
00:31:10.029 --> 00:31:10.039 align:start position:0%
that a specific regulatory Authority not
 
00:31:12.289 --> 00:31:12.299 align:start position:0%
zoning is not just like one thing that
 
00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:14.100 align:start position:0%
is a big package deal with all sorts of
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
limits on what they can zone for so a
 
00:31:18.169 --> 00:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
specific type of zoning regulation
 
00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
is that sufficiently important
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
to meeting the local needs
 
00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:25.860 align:start position:0%
to Merit restricting right of citizens
 
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
to use and enjoy their private property
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
and whether that case is then outweighed
 
00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
on the state interest side
 
00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
by other citizens outside the towns
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
they're interested in housing
 
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.070 align:start position:0%
they're interested in housing
availability

00:31:37.070 --> 00:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
availability
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
or Statewide concerns such as
 
00:31:40.190 --> 00:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection housing
 
00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
affordability and economic growth
 
00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
that's my argument for whether to
 
00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
preempt it so how to think about
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
preemption and I wrote that in testimony
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
as well so you might have seen it before
 
00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.370 align:start position:0%
as well so you might have seen it before
um

00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:52.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:54.889 --> 00:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
now how you know even if you've decided
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
yes it's absolutely worth it we should
 
00:31:59.090 --> 00:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
do some preamp the towns somehow that
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell you what you should do and
 
00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
it doesn't tell you whether specific
 
00:32:06.289 --> 00:32:06.299 align:start position:0%
actions will have useful consequences
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
as we categorize State actions into five
 
00:32:08.399 --> 00:32:09.710 align:start position:0%
as we categorize State actions into five
buckets

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
buckets
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
um and this is in the don't go all
 
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:14.340 align:start position:0%
reading this because it's long but the
 
00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
menu of options is organized this way
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
so the first of those five buckets is
 
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
what I just called direct limits on
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
local regulation so an example of that
 
00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:23.580 align:start position:0%
would be capping or eliminating parking
 
00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:25.799 align:start position:0%
requirements so uh state of Connecticut
 
00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
right said for apartments you can't
 
00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.590 align:start position:0%
right said for apartments you can't
require

00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
um more than one parking space for a
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
one-bedroom apartment and
 
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.059 align:start position:0%
maybe two two for a three bedroom
 
00:32:36.059 --> 00:32:37.970 align:start position:0%
maybe two two for a three bedroom
Statewide

00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
Statewide
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
and so that's just a direct limit uh it
 
00:32:43.549 --> 00:32:43.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't require any executing Authority
 
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
it's just immediately you write it and
 
00:32:47.810 --> 00:32:47.820 align:start position:0%
it is done and that the towns have to
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:52.440 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's appealing because
 
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's simple
 
00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:55.310 align:start position:0%
it's simple
um

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
I think the limits on that are that
 
00:32:59.389 --> 00:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
you've got it has to be very broadly
 
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
applicable right so you can say a
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
parking requirement cap applies
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
everywhere and we don't have to know
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
that much about your local contacts to
 
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
know that someone living alone only
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
needs one car
 
00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.010 align:start position:0%
needs one car
um

00:33:10.010 --> 00:33:10.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
what gets harder is if you want to say
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
hey we want to treat Town centers
 
00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
differently than rural areas and you
 
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.269 align:start position:0%
differently than rural areas and you
know

00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:19.260 align:start position:0%
it's not impossible but the lawmaking
 
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
gets trickier there as you want to start
 
00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:21.960 align:start position:0%
taking into account
 
00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
textual factors
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
the second bucket would be streamlining
 
00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
procedures I think New Hampshire's
 
00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board is an excellent
 
00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:30.059 align:start position:0%
example of this that we we've taken
 
00:33:32.570 --> 00:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
promote sometimes in other states
 
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
and you know specifically for New
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
England states made up of small towns
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
with limited staff
 
00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
uh anything that streamlines procedures
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
has to really involve technical
 
00:33:44.039 --> 00:33:45.769 align:start position:0%
has to really involve technical
assistance

00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
um and even in even in California where
 
00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:49.700 align:start position:0%
they've done a lot of procedural changes
 
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
they've found that the biggest cities
 
00:33:54.289 --> 00:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
are sort of capable of doing these
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
themselves and even mid-sized California
 
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
cities of you know as big as the larger
 
00:34:01.130 --> 00:34:01.140 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire towns need State technical
 
00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.570 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire towns need State technical
assistance

00:34:02.570 --> 00:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:34:06.289 --> 00:34:06.299 align:start position:0%
um to rejigger some of these procedural
 
00:34:07.389 --> 00:34:07.399 align:start position:0%
things so I think there's actually
 
00:34:10.129 --> 00:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
streamlining is a really rich vein of
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
potential State action
 
00:34:13.490 --> 00:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
we don't have a lot in the menu of
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
options about that because it's so State
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
specific every state uh has its own sort
 
00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:21.419 align:start position:0%
of version of a Kafka novel of how you
 
00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
get or fail to get housing permitted
 
00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
and so examples of that I think some of
 
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:29.099 align:start position:0%
the most fruitful and simple examples of
 
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
that can involve
 
00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.389 align:start position:0%
that can involve
um

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:35.329 --> 00:34:35.339 align:start position:0%
moving types of decisions to simpler
 
00:34:35.339 --> 00:34:37.430 align:start position:0%
moving types of decisions to simpler
bodies

00:34:37.430 --> 00:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
bodies
 
00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:39.480 align:start position:0%
um so I
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
this might be in Arizona this year one
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
of the bills that's under consideration
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
um don't call it might not be Arizona
 
00:34:47.210 --> 00:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
don't quote me on that
 
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
um there's a certain type of of
 
00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
land use permission that currently by
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
State Statute has to be granted by
 
00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
the city council level body and it would
 
00:35:00.589 --> 00:35:00.599 align:start position:0%
allow them allow cities to move that
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
down to ministerial staff approval staff
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
approval is the easiest level of
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
approval it doesn't involve politics so
 
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
you know when staff says okay the zoning
 
00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
code says you know you can if you meet
 
00:35:14.569 --> 00:35:14.579 align:start position:0%
these conditions you can get a
 
00:35:16.849 --> 00:35:16.859 align:start position:0%
conditional use permit to put a store
 
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
here and the fact that the neighbors are
 
00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:19.980 align:start position:0%
unhappy about it doesn't really matter
 
00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:21.960 align:start position:0%
because you've met the conditions
 
00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
the elected officials
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
they look at the same law and they're
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
like ah it looks like you meet the
 
00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:28.920 align:start position:0%
conditions but my voters are really
 
00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:30.180 align:start position:0%
unhappy about this and I'm getting a lot
 
00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
of angry letters so I'm going to find
 
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
that you don't actually get the kids
 
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
um it also just is harder as a
 
00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
scheduling basis to find time on a city
 
00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
council schedule to approve every little
 
00:35:41.569 --> 00:35:41.579 align:start position:0%
thing so the more things you can move
 
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
down to the staff level
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
um the quicker and simpler those become
 
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:47.099 align:start position:0%
again in really small towns
 
00:35:47.099 --> 00:35:47.870 align:start position:0%
again in really small towns
um

00:35:47.870 --> 00:35:47.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
there things might be really different
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
because you might not have a full-time
 
00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:53.339 align:start position:0%
staff member
 
00:35:55.790 --> 00:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
so you have to think about your specific
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances and how to do that
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
streamlining so I think that some of the
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
folks that you're you're bringing in uh
 
00:36:02.810 --> 00:36:02.820 align:start position:0%
who have that granular level experience
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
in in individual towns individual
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
Builders they'll be able to inform that
 
00:36:07.609 --> 00:36:07.619 align:start position:0%
so I encourage you to do that but I
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot of specifics for you on
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
how to do streamlining
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal policy is a third area
 
00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:17.339 align:start position:0%
um aside from Simply subsidizing demand
 
00:36:18.829 --> 00:36:18.839 align:start position:0%
there's a lot you can do to get
 
00:36:23.089 --> 00:36:23.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:25.010 --> 00:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
the places in the U.S that have the
 
00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
biggest housing crises uh uh California
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
have some of the worst fiscal incentives
 
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
for housing production
 
00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
right so a huge difference between
 
00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:37.220 align:start position:0%
California and Texas on building housing
 
00:36:39.170 --> 00:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
aside from all the political differences
 
00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:41.099 align:start position:0%
that you would immediately think of is
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
tax law Texas has really high property
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
taxes and low income taxes so when
 
00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
somebody builds improves property in
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
Texas the local government is thrilled
 
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
because they get to tax it
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
in California
 
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
the property taxes are capped at a
 
00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
really low rate and they're distributed
 
00:36:58.609 --> 00:36:58.619 align:start position:0%
according to a bizarre formula that
 
00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
gives a difference every different city
 
00:37:01.790 --> 00:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
a different share of their capped
 
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
and so for California cities every new
 
00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:08.280 align:start position:0%
property is a fiscal burden and they
 
00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
have to kind of go back to the state and
 
00:37:10.849 --> 00:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
beg for more money for everything that
 
00:37:12.349 --> 00:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
they do
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
um and so when you get so these perverse
 
00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
incentives where development doesn't pay
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
for itself
 
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:22.140 align:start position:0%
then the entire city apparatus becomes a
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
an anti-development force of its own
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
because then the whole budget process
 
00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
has become becomes more difficult when
 
00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
you get growth
 
00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
so whatever you do fiscally you want to
 
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
make sure that those incentives for
 
00:37:33.589 --> 00:37:33.599 align:start position:0%
everyone involved
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
make sense you don't want to say
 
00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
you know free affordable housing
 
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
buildings of all tax liabilities forever
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
and that have the cities go the towns go
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
oh my gosh I don't want to I don't want
 
00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:45.660 align:start position:0%
to have affordable housing here it'll
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
never pay its way
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
right so you want to make sure that
 
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:50.520 align:start position:0%
most things most of the time are paying
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
their Freight that there isn't a huge
 
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:54.109 align:start position:0%
their Freight that there isn't a huge
bias

00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
bias
 
00:37:56.329 --> 00:37:56.339 align:start position:0%
um towards one type of land use over
 
00:37:58.010 --> 00:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
another so states that have a local
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
sales tax end up over Zoning for
 
00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
commercial they're all trying to get the
 
00:38:02.450 --> 00:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
Walmart because boy if you're the time
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
that gets the Walmart then you're set
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
for life with your sales taxes and if
 
00:38:07.609 --> 00:38:07.619 align:start position:0%
you miss out on the Walmart you're
 
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
constantly like skimping and scraping
 
00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
around the edge
 
00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:13.740 align:start position:0%
um the fourth category that we've got is
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
narrowing the scope of zoning Authority
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit different than the
 
00:38:19.609 --> 00:38:19.619 align:start position:0%
direct preemption and
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
you know this this really thinks about
 
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
not specific types of zoning but but
 
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
ways that zoning is done maybe an
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
example here is better than better than
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
how I can talk about it
 
00:38:33.349 --> 00:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
um it's one of the things that we have
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
in the menu of options that I think
 
00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:36.500 align:start position:0%
would be very relevant in New Hampshire
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
is to
 
00:38:41.170 --> 00:38:41.180 align:start position:0%
by Statute block zoning that makes
 
00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
existing conditions illegal this isn't
 
00:38:46.849 --> 00:38:46.859 align:start position:0%
something that happens a lot in small
 
00:38:49.609 --> 00:38:49.619 align:start position:0%
old towns which New Hampshire has many
 
00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
many of where the the zoning code that
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
gets adopted is written by some
 
00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:55.430 align:start position:0%
gets adopted is written by some
consultant

00:38:55.430 --> 00:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
consultant
 
00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
and basically copied and pasted for
 
00:38:58.310 --> 00:38:58.320 align:start position:0%
every talent that they do business with
 
00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
with very minor changes
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
and they aren't coming out and using
 
00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
tape measures and figuring out what
 
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
setbacks actually are in you know the
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
historic Center of
 
00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:11.099 align:start position:0%
Concord or a Durham and so they might
 
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
have setbacks from the roads like the
 
00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
how far the house has to be from the
 
00:39:17.329 --> 00:39:17.339 align:start position:0%
road that's appropriate to the first
 
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
town that they wrote this model code for
 
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
but has no relevance in your town but if
 
00:39:23.630 --> 00:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
you want the cheap consultant they're
 
00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
not going to spend a lot of time coming
 
00:39:25.849 --> 00:39:25.859 align:start position:0%
out with tape measures to your town
 
00:39:27.530 --> 00:39:27.540 align:start position:0%
they're just going to copy and paste and
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
say like what five changes do you want
 
00:39:30.359 --> 00:39:31.430 align:start position:0%
say like what five changes do you want
um

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
and I think what makes so many old New
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
England towns so great is this old
 
00:39:37.609 --> 00:39:37.619 align:start position:0%
pre-zoning character these places were
 
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
built before before modern zoning uh
 
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
long before
 
00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:44.579 align:start position:0%
and modern zoning just was not designed
 
00:39:45.829 --> 00:39:45.839 align:start position:0%
for them and you could you can come back
 
00:39:47.210 --> 00:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
you can get a more expensive like
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
form-based code consultant to come and
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
fix all this but again if you're a small
 
00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
town that's hard
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
and the simple thing here for the state
 
00:39:55.010 --> 00:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
to do is to say
 
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
the localities shouldn't be illegalizing
 
00:39:59.089 --> 00:39:59.099 align:start position:0%
what already exists
 
00:40:00.349 --> 00:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
um and I made a positive argument for
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
like hey what already exists is usually
 
00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:03.300 align:start position:0%
great we love it there's also a negative
 
00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:05.220 align:start position:0%
argument like maybe the town doesn't
 
00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
like what already exists and says like
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
ah we'd love to get rid of all this
 
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619 align:start position:0%
um and make our town something that it
 
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
isn't but they probably shouldn't right
 
00:40:15.050 --> 00:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
that's probably not the appropriate role
 
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
for government like I don't know we stop
 
00:40:18.530 --> 00:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
for gas in Salem on the way up and like
 
00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
everyone in Salem's really ugly no
 
00:40:23.150 --> 00:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
offense anybody from Salem here but it's
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
not great I can imagine a zoning code
 
00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
you know zoning administer coming in and
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
saying like hey we'd really like to
 
00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:30.780 align:start position:0%
change this and make it much nicer so
 
00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.099 align:start position:0%
we're just gonna like ban what's already
 
00:40:34.069 --> 00:40:34.079 align:start position:0%
here and anybody who builds anything on
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
this strip now has to build it according
 
00:40:37.849 --> 00:40:37.859 align:start position:0%
to a completely different standard
 
00:40:39.410 --> 00:40:39.420 align:start position:0%
now there's room for public improvements
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
like if the if they want to tax those
 
00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:42.660 align:start position:0%
people and then spend money to put in
 
00:40:45.230 --> 00:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
like a nice Boulevard and trees okay
 
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
that's that's a role for government and
 
00:40:47.569 --> 00:40:47.579 align:start position:0%
they should debate that put that in
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
their budget
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
but regulatorily Banning everything
 
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
that's there and saying like we'd like
 
00:40:54.230 --> 00:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
to be a nicer town than we really are
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
that puts this burden on property owners
 
00:40:57.950 --> 00:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
of every time I want to like add an
 
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
addition or do a major renovation
 
00:41:02.329 --> 00:41:02.339 align:start position:0%
I've got to get a variance to stick with
 
00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
my existing non-conforming land use
 
00:41:06.770 --> 00:41:06.780 align:start position:0%
um a lot of New England is
 
00:41:08.750 --> 00:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
non-conforming so Somerville Mass is
 
00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:11.339 align:start position:0%
most famous for this there they do this
 
00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
at the city level
 
00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:14.339 align:start position:0%
um they went through and analyzed their
 
00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
whole city and found that in the city of
 
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.050 align:start position:0%
whole city and found that in the city of
Somerville

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
Somerville
 
00:41:20.630 --> 00:41:20.640 align:start position:0%
population like 90 000 or so they found
 
00:41:23.569 --> 00:41:23.579 align:start position:0%
27 buildings which might comply with
 
00:41:25.190 --> 00:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
design code
 
00:41:26.329 --> 00:41:26.339 align:start position:0%
um and they weren't even sure about
 
00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:27.300 align:start position:0%
those because they didn't analyze
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
parking if they departing into account
 
00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
those 27 probably also wouldn't have
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
complied their whole city was illegal
 
00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
according to their zoning code and so
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
they threw it out and they started over
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
and said like okay let's do something
 
00:41:38.690 --> 00:41:38.700 align:start position:0%
totally different but that's a big
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
expense of operation by a substantial uh
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
relatively affluent suburb and um
 
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
you know I think for for a state one of
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
the ways that you can address this is to
 
00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
say like you you know the zoning the
 
00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:54.540 align:start position:0%
zoning shouldn't be doing the job of of
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
making everything illegal and trying to
 
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
regulatorily create revolutionary change
 
00:42:00.540 --> 00:42:01.670 align:start position:0%
regulatorily create revolutionary change
um

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:07.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
just said um I don't think I mentioned
 
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:10.980 align:start position:0%
the introduction but I'm the the
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
legislative Council for the town of
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
Newtown in Connecticut which was
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
originally settled about 1705
 
00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:18.109 align:start position:0%
originally settled about 1705
um

00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
there's a historic Main Street there in
 
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
historic district that obviously the
 
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
town is very proud of
 
00:42:24.710 --> 00:42:24.720 align:start position:0%
that was developed over many centuries
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
you know there's some houses there that
 
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:28.140 align:start position:0%
date Back to Before the Revolutionary
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
War on house lots of all different sizes
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
some on very large Lots some on very
 
00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
small Lots although the zoning that is
 
00:42:37.849 --> 00:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
currently there which dates back to the
 
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
1930s requires one acre perhaps
 
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
but if you actually look at the historic
 
00:42:47.750 --> 00:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
Zone up between 70 and 80 percent of the
 
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
houses are non-conforming with that so
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
the zoning that is in place
 
00:42:54.349 --> 00:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
is in conflict with the historic
 
00:42:56.150 --> 00:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
character that's trying to prevent the
 
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
house for example one of the old houses
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
were to burn down you couldn't rebuild
 
00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
it on the same lot without a variance so
 
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
something like that I think becomes yes
 
00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
it's a matter of fairness and
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
consistency but simply as a matter of
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
sort of regulatory purpose and benefit
 
00:43:14.569 --> 00:43:14.579 align:start position:0%
how do you really justify that that sort
 
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:16.980 align:start position:0%
of zoning which is in conflict with its
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
own context
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
um in terms of a public health or safety
 
00:43:23.089 --> 00:43:23.099 align:start position:0%
concern like what is what is the purpose
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
of that zoning whose interest is it
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
protecting uh what is it doing and
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
that's something you'll see actually in
 
00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:30.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of New England towns um I think
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
there's been some appreciation for that
 
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
some attempt to perform that I saw that
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
um concord's proposed new zoning code is
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
introducing a 2500 square foot lot size
 
00:43:40.849 --> 00:43:40.859 align:start position:0%
minimum for some of the neighborhoods
 
00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
around downtown which is comparable to
 
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
the patterns of development you'd see
 
00:43:49.609 --> 00:43:49.619 align:start position:0%
back 200 years ago
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
so I think there's there's a growing
 
00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:53.579 align:start position:0%
appreciation for that but I think in
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
some of these cases where there's this
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
egregious non-conformity with existing
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
conditions you have to wonder what what
 
00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
exactly what purpose is serving if not
 
00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:04.740 align:start position:0%
an exclusionary purpose or simply a way
 
00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:07.849 align:start position:0%
an exclusionary purpose or simply a way
of

00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
having the town oversee in detail every
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
single change it's made through an
 
00:44:13.309 --> 00:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
extensive variance process or special
 
00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:15.480 align:start position:0%
permit process just to make simple
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
changes to a house like rebuilding a
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
house that's burnt down so just another
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
another data point to consider
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you that's great yeah it reminds
 
00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
me we worked with the city of Auburn
 
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.170 align:start position:0%
me we worked with the city of Auburn
Maine

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:27.180 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
00:44:28.849 --> 00:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
um on a really extensive rezoning that
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
they did and one of the outcomes that
 
00:44:33.470 --> 00:44:33.480 align:start position:0%
they that no we didn't expect they
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
didn't expect but was really nice was
 
00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:38.220 align:start position:0%
that once they
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
um kind of pull stripped back a lot of
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
regulations they had this flood of
 
00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:45.240 align:start position:0%
um renovation permits pulled so people
 
00:44:47.630 --> 00:44:47.640 align:start position:0%
who probably would have been approved
 
00:44:50.569 --> 00:44:50.579 align:start position:0%
via variance or special permit to add a
 
00:44:52.609 --> 00:44:52.619 align:start position:0%
deck or you know re-roof an old garage
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
or something like that but they had to
 
00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
go through that hassle of getting
 
00:44:58.730 --> 00:44:58.740 align:start position:0%
permission from the city even it's a
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
pretty minor hassle in a place like
 
00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.250 align:start position:0%
pretty minor hassle in a place like
Auburn

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
Auburn
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
um even that was enough to dissuade them
 
00:45:04.609 --> 00:45:04.619 align:start position:0%
and so they had this sort of sudden
 
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
surge about 75 million I think in
 
00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:10.740 align:start position:0%
um renovation permits maybe I'm making
 
00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:12.060 align:start position:0%
that number up
 
00:45:14.809 --> 00:45:14.819 align:start position:0%
um that seems big for Robert anyway uh
 
00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
it was big for Auburn whatever the
 
00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:18.660 align:start position:0%
number was it was big for Auburn and the
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
number of Renovations they got and I
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
think that's just a great example like
 
00:45:23.329 --> 00:45:23.339 align:start position:0%
people would like to reinvest in their
 
00:45:23.339 --> 00:45:24.470 align:start position:0%
people would like to reinvest in their
property

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
and even even a small permitting barrier
 
00:45:29.569 --> 00:45:29.579 align:start position:0%
or uncertainty about whether they should
 
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
kind of go get plans written up for 500
 
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:34.260 align:start position:0%
bucks or something is enough to dissuade
 
00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.990 align:start position:0%
bucks or something is enough to dissuade
them

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:45:38.569 --> 00:45:38.579 align:start position:0%
um the last of my five areas of um
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
potential State preemption is on
 
00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:42.660 align:start position:0%
construction standards and again this
 
00:45:44.089 --> 00:45:44.099 align:start position:0%
can be very mild this can be merely
 
00:45:46.609 --> 00:45:46.619 align:start position:0%
giving cities and towns permission to
 
00:45:46.619 --> 00:45:48.230 align:start position:0%
giving cities and towns permission to
adopt

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
adopt
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
um something that's more permissive so
 
00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
the the area that's getting a lot of
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
attention right now is single staircase
 
00:45:57.309 --> 00:45:57.319 align:start position:0%
buildings Washington State and Virginia
 
00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:01.140 align:start position:0%
sort of and um I think one or two other
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
states are considering uh adding I think
 
00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:07.140 align:start position:0%
California considering allowing single
 
00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:09.660 align:start position:0%
stair buildings with higher fire safety
 
00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:11.210 align:start position:0%
stair buildings with higher fire safety
standards

00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:11.220 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:12.290 align:start position:0%
standards
um

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:12.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
which allows the building of uh
 
00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
multi-family on on narrow Old Town Lots
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
so it's again fairly useful in an older
 
00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
older development pattern places where
 
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
you'd like to sort of you know have that
 
00:46:25.849 --> 00:46:25.859 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:46:25.859 --> 00:46:26.870 align:start position:0%
kind of
um

00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
tall skinny apartment building instead
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
of the big wide parking platform or
 
00:46:34.609 --> 00:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
parking donut type that makes sense in
 
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
on a you know 10 Acre Site you're like
 
00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
okay we've got a quarter acre in a city
 
00:46:39.710 --> 00:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
what can we put here
 
00:46:41.450 --> 00:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's useful you know I
 
00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:43.020 align:start position:0%
don't think that's a huge application to
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire there but potentially in
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
Manchester and
 
00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
a few other Town centers
 
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
all right so then to talk about other
 
00:46:52.490 --> 00:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
cities so this is where I'll actually
 
00:46:54.890 --> 00:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
say do look at this the front of this uh
 
00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
we'll hand out
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
I just picked uh six states to highlight
 
00:47:00.839 --> 00:47:01.730 align:start position:0%
I just picked uh six states to highlight
um

00:47:01.730 --> 00:47:01.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:03.650 --> 00:47:03.660 align:start position:0%
these are reasonably comparable I'd say
 
00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
these are some of the busiest states in
 
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
the country right now every state that's
 
00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.490 --> 00:47:13.500 align:start position:0%
Republican Democrat
 
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
across the board everybody's at least
 
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
arguing about it and some are going to
 
00:47:21.109 --> 00:47:21.119 align:start position:0%
be making pretty sweeping strides in
 
00:47:22.609 --> 00:47:22.619 align:start position:0%
this case uh this is a little bit out of
 
00:47:24.230 --> 00:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
date as of like yesterday you can add
 
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
three more check marks in Arizona's
 
00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.230 align:start position:0%
three more check marks in Arizona's
column

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
column
 
00:47:28.849 --> 00:47:28.859 align:start position:0%
um three more a couple more bills came
 
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
out of committee there so these are
 
00:47:32.089 --> 00:47:32.099 align:start position:0%
almost all represent bills that are
 
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:34.920 align:start position:0%
either out of committee or that the the
 
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:37.560 align:start position:0%
majority party leadership is behind so
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
they are not baked in but they have a
 
00:47:42.589 --> 00:47:42.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable chance of passing in
 
00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
Washington and Colorado you've got
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
uh oh and Montana you've got Governors
 
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
to Democrats and a republican in those
 
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
cases who are the principal champions of
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
zoning reform in their states
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
in Arizona it's coming from
 
00:47:58.730 --> 00:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
uh legislators likewise in Massachusetts
 
00:47:58.740 --> 00:48:00.770 align:start position:0%
uh legislators likewise in Massachusetts
and

00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:02.690 --> 00:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
um and I think I actually don't know
 
00:48:04.069 --> 00:48:04.079 align:start position:0%
much about the Vermont case so that's
 
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
the the closest to home here
 
00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:07.010 align:start position:0%
the the closest to home here
um

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:09.650 --> 00:48:09.660 align:start position:0%
but as you see there's just a huge
 
00:48:11.450 --> 00:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
amount of potential reform we would not
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
have been able to make anything like
 
00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:13.740 align:start position:0%
this a year ago
 
00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
um there would have been a much sparser
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
table uh everybody's looking at
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit
 
00:48:21.530 --> 00:48:21.540 align:start position:0%
um legalization I think that's the most
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
obvious of the cases where
 
00:48:25.609 --> 00:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
there just is not a good regulatory case
 
00:48:27.829 --> 00:48:27.839 align:start position:0%
to say that you know you can have
 
00:48:29.089 --> 00:48:29.099 align:start position:0%
someone living in your house but you
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
can't let them have their own bathroom
 
00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
or door or kitchen
 
00:48:35.329 --> 00:48:35.339 align:start position:0%
um a lot of places are looking at
 
00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
allowing duplexes and fourplexes on most
 
00:48:39.170 --> 00:48:39.180 align:start position:0%
Lots that's obviously been introduced
 
00:48:42.650 --> 00:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
here in I think hb44
 
00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
um different states are looking at
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
streamlining permitting processes like I
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
said those are different across all the
 
00:48:49.069 --> 00:48:49.079 align:start position:0%
states parking minimums
 
00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:50.760 align:start position:0%
um the one that that's closest to my
 
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:53.339 align:start position:0%
heart now all six states are looking at
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
some relief from lot size minimums
 
00:48:56.329 --> 00:48:56.339 align:start position:0%
that's something that was not on the
 
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
agenda we've done a lot of research on
 
00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
um Charlie was one of the first people
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
writing about that five or ten years ago
 
00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
and and Mercedes done a lot of research
 
00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:07.140 align:start position:0%
on on lot size minimums and I think
 
00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:09.420 align:start position:0%
especially for enabling lower cost home
 
00:49:12.410 --> 00:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
ownership as opposed to multi-family
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
buildings both of which are important
 
00:49:14.569 --> 00:49:14.579 align:start position:0%
but if you want to get that
 
00:49:16.790 --> 00:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
homeownership piece you need smaller
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
Lots because you just can't make the
 
00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
land cheaper without letting people buy
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
smaller pieces of it so we're really
 
00:49:27.349 --> 00:49:27.359 align:start position:0%
encouraged at the
 
00:49:29.569 --> 00:49:29.579 align:start position:0%
you know amount of
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
um you know State consideration none of
 
00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
these have been signed into law yet
 
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
um so we'll see what happens but we're
 
00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:38.099 align:start position:0%
excited about that
 
00:49:38.099 --> 00:49:39.710 align:start position:0%
excited about that
um

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:40.970 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.370 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
then there's some systems in States and
 
00:49:47.329 --> 00:49:47.339 align:start position:0%
they're not on here
 
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
California has the longest standing one
 
00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.230 align:start position:0%
California has the longest standing one
Massachusetts

00:49:50.230 --> 00:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh has a pretty long-standing version of
 
00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
this and now New York's Governor is
 
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
trying to put in place what I'd call
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
sort of like a Rube Goldberg
 
00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:02.220 align:start position:0%
approach where you've got like a bunch
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
of different like
 
00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
classes of towns and ways of evaluating
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
like are you or are you not building
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
enough housing
 
00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
um and I can see the appeal to it where
 
00:50:14.210 --> 00:50:14.220 align:start position:0%
you've got you say like hey the towns
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
get to
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
you know choose their own adventure as
 
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
long as the results are good and the
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
states will vary the state will verify
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
that the results are good and if they're
 
00:50:22.849 --> 00:50:22.859 align:start position:0%
not then there's some Builders Remedy or
 
00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:24.660 align:start position:0%
some some preemption that kicks in if
 
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
the results are bad
 
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:28.740 align:start position:0%
and in theory I think this is really
 
00:50:31.609 --> 00:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
nice in practice it ends up being very
 
00:50:31.619 --> 00:50:32.870 align:start position:0%
nice in practice it ends up being very
complex

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:32.880 align:start position:0%
complex
 
00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:35.089 align:start position:0%
complex
and

00:50:35.089 --> 00:50:35.099 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:50:37.910 --> 00:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
um kind of conflict generative like
 
00:50:39.349 --> 00:50:39.359 align:start position:0%
there's always an arguments between the
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
states and the cities and lawsuits um or
 
00:50:44.569 --> 00:50:44.579 align:start position:0%
between the cities and the builders in
 
00:50:45.770 --> 00:50:45.780 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they go back and forth
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
over over 40b
 
00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.010 align:start position:0%
over over 40b
so

00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say don't do it or don't
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
consider it but I would definitely worry
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
about that in a state made up of small
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
towns that
 
00:51:00.230 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
you'd end up kind of demanding a lot of
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of reporting requirements and
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
some of the towns are small enough that
 
00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
just like if you happen to go through a
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
three-year spell where no developer
 
00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
brings a permit your zoning might be
 
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine but you're not going to
 
00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:11.700 align:start position:0%
show the growth just because you're a
 
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
small area and the arrival of permit
 
00:51:16.190 --> 00:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
applications is kind of random
 
00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:17.460 align:start position:0%
um so I don't think that's the best
 
00:51:19.930 --> 00:51:19.940 align:start position:0%
system but I but I kind of respect
 
00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
the the political science behind it and
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
trying to say like we really do want to
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
let the localities Govern but they need
 
00:51:29.089 --> 00:51:29.099 align:start position:0%
to show us that the outcomes are good
 
00:51:31.130 --> 00:51:31.140 align:start position:0%
um and so that's that's kind of a whole
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
other approach so we didn't want to take
 
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
up you know 90 minutes with talking
 
00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:38.220 align:start position:0%
um Charlie if you've got anything else
 
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:40.079 align:start position:0%
to say jump in here but I'd love to take
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
questions and just make this a an open
 
00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:45.490 align:start position:0%
questions and just make this a an open
dialogue

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:45.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:51.170 --> 00:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:54.589 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:51:54.589 --> 00:51:54.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
first of all thank you for an excellent
 
00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.650 align:start position:0%
first of all thank you for an excellent
presentation

00:51:57.650 --> 00:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to have to of course
 
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
read through all of this uh looks very
 
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.870 align:start position:0%
read through all of this uh looks very
interesting

00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:06.900 align:start position:0%
um I have two points slash questions one
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
very minor
 
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:10.380 align:start position:0%
um the other not so minor the first is
 
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
about the word Township
 
00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.510 align:start position:0%
about the word Township
um

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
are you aware that there are
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
municipalities in other states
 
00:52:20.569 --> 00:52:20.579 align:start position:0%
specifically in New Jersey
 
00:52:24.410 --> 00:52:24.420 align:start position:0%
um uh where uh okay I had no idea that
 
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
the word Township came from De
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
tocqueville I've only read bits and
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
pieces of detox building translation
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
um uh but there are municipalities in
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
New Jersey that are officially townships
 
00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh that's their name I grew up in one
 
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
yes yes um and they have Township
 
00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:41.990 align:start position:0%
yes yes um and they have Township
government

00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:52:45.049 --> 00:52:45.059 align:start position:0%
Etc uh so just wanted to make sure that
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
the word Township is not actually a joke
 
00:52:54.349 --> 00:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:56.700 align:start position:0%
a division so the entire Northwest
 
00:52:59.750 --> 00:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
Ordinance region which is the state's
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
um you know from Ohio to Minnesota they
 
00:53:04.430 --> 00:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
have these Square counties and each
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
county is divided into four townships
 
00:53:10.430 --> 00:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
New Jersey and Pennsylvania have
 
00:53:12.829 --> 00:53:12.839 align:start position:0%
slightly different townships uh yes we
 
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
have townships that are essentially
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
towns but they're mostly large rural
 
00:53:20.569 --> 00:53:20.579 align:start position:0%
districts that are now partly Suburban
 
00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
um so yes okay uh the other thing uh
 
00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
which is is more substantive
 
00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
um and before I I
 
00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
ask this question I'll mention the fact
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
that I grew up on a farm with a father
 
00:53:36.049 --> 00:53:36.059 align:start position:0%
who was extremely sensitive about people
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
interfering with his use of his own land
 
00:53:39.599 --> 00:53:41.630 align:start position:0%
interfering with his use of his own land
um however

00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
um however
 
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:44.150 align:start position:0%
um however
um uh

00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
have you considered the balance between
 
00:53:50.809 --> 00:53:50.819 align:start position:0%
um the need for more housing and
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
specifically people's need not to be
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
homeless the balance between that and
 
00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
the need of property owners to be able
 
00:54:02.089 --> 00:54:02.099 align:start position:0%
to do what they choose with their own
 
00:54:02.099 --> 00:54:03.890 align:start position:0%
to do what they choose with their own
property

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
um and that perhaps the need not to be
 
00:54:06.599 --> 00:54:07.809 align:start position:0%
um and that perhaps the need not to be
homeless

00:54:07.809 --> 00:54:07.819 align:start position:0%
homeless
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
should be a little higher in the balance
 
00:54:14.030 --> 00:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
weight than the needs of property owners
 
00:54:20.930 --> 00:54:20.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:23.520 align:start position:0%
um you know just a
 
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
I get some response to
 
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:29.220 align:start position:0%
um that sort of concern I I think those
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
I think those issues are in some way uh
 
00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.109 align:start position:0%
I think those issues are in some way uh
complementary

00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
complementary
 
00:54:35.450 --> 00:54:35.460 align:start position:0%
because when we're talking about
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh in general what we're talking about
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
here in terms of State preemption or
 
00:54:43.390 --> 00:54:43.400 align:start position:0%
state regulation would be
 
00:54:46.490 --> 00:54:46.500 align:start position:0%
limiting the scope of the town's
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
interference with individual property
 
00:54:48.119 --> 00:54:49.130 align:start position:0%
interference with individual property
rights

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
so I I think the ability of a property
 
00:54:55.790 --> 00:54:55.800 align:start position:0%
owner to do what he or she wants with
 
00:54:57.130 --> 00:54:57.140 align:start position:0%
their own property
 
00:55:00.650 --> 00:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
and the about the the ability
 
00:55:02.089 --> 00:55:02.099 align:start position:0%
to develop additional housing
 
00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities within a town
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
a really come down to the same basic
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
some underlying principle but being free
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
to do what you want with your own
 
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
property that would include say if you
 
00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
wanted to you know run a run a farm on
 
00:55:16.970 --> 00:55:16.980 align:start position:0%
your own property rather than
 
00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:18.780 align:start position:0%
subdividing it for housing being able to
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
to do that and to undertake whatever
 
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
uh you know activities are customarily
 
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:27.300 align:start position:0%
associated with it whether a lot of
 
00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:30.540 align:start position:0%
raising livestock planting crops
 
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
um anything like that but on the other
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
hand it also gives property owners the
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
ability to build more densely than they
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
might otherwise be able to which will
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
will not
 
00:55:44.589 --> 00:55:44.599 align:start position:0%
directly pertaining to the issue of
 
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:46.740 align:start position:0%
homelessness and policy interventions
 
00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:48.059 align:start position:0%
from homelessness
 
00:55:50.210 --> 00:55:50.220 align:start position:0%
I I think in general it's acknowledged
 
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:52.740 align:start position:0%
an increasing housing Supply
 
00:55:54.609 --> 00:55:54.619 align:start position:0%
meeting the demand that's there
 
00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
moderates increases in rents and ends up
 
00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:02.520 align:start position:0%
benefiting people of all incomes so um
 
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
I I don't at least from my perspective I
 
00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:07.140 align:start position:0%
don't see a conflict between those
 
00:56:08.569 --> 00:56:08.579 align:start position:0%
allowing people to do what they want
 
00:56:10.970 --> 00:56:10.980 align:start position:0%
with their own homes and their own
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
properties can can benefit both those
 
00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:14.809 align:start position:0%
properties can can benefit both those
instances

00:56:14.809 --> 00:56:14.819 align:start position:0%
instances
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you uh further yes comment
 
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
um yes I wasn't suggesting that that
 
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
there is a con which really identifies
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
that you know even though most people
 
00:56:24.119 --> 00:56:25.130 align:start position:0%
that you know even though most people
who

00:56:25.130 --> 00:56:25.140 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
end up homeless
 
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
um couldn't afford to rent like their
 
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
own one bedroom apartment even in a
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
cheap City
 
00:56:34.790 --> 00:56:34.800 align:start position:0%
cheap cities have far fewer homeless
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
people and so there's some mix of
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know how how easy is it for you as
 
00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:43.020 align:start position:0%
somebody who's you know completely out
 
00:56:44.390 --> 00:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
of work you have no income you don't
 
00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
have a Housing Voucher what are you
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
going to do you're probably not going
 
00:56:49.210 --> 00:56:49.220 align:start position:0%
and signing a lease you're probably
 
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
staying with a friend or an aunt who's
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
got an extra bedroom
 
00:56:56.569 --> 00:56:56.579 align:start position:0%
and that having some margins around the
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
edges of a housing market where people
 
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:00.780 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of extra space
 
00:57:02.690 --> 00:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
um ends up allowing people sort of
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
through relationships or you know local
 
00:57:07.130 --> 00:57:07.140 align:start position:0%
non-profits to solve those problems it
 
00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
also makes the state's funding go a lot
 
00:57:10.849 --> 00:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
further right so if you're a state and
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
saying like Okay
 
00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:14.160 align:start position:0%
let's let's you know be serious to
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
address our uh homelessness problem with
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
either assisted
 
00:57:20.329 --> 00:57:20.339 align:start position:0%
let's say you know Supportive Housing or
 
00:57:20.339 --> 00:57:22.130 align:start position:0%
let's say you know Supportive Housing or
vouchers

00:57:22.130 --> 00:57:22.140 align:start position:0%
vouchers
 
00:57:25.069 --> 00:57:25.079 align:start position:0%
um the housing and land costs sort of
 
00:57:26.329 --> 00:57:26.339 align:start position:0%
determine how much budget how much you
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
can do with it with a budget pot so like
 
00:57:30.829 --> 00:57:30.839 align:start position:0%
La is trying to build its way out of you
 
00:57:32.329 --> 00:57:32.339 align:start position:0%
know a hundred thousand two hundred
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
thousand homeless people but it cost
 
00:57:35.870 --> 00:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
them six or seven hundred thousand
 
00:57:38.089 --> 00:57:38.099 align:start position:0%
dollars a pop to build
 
00:57:40.970 --> 00:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
essentially studio apartments
 
00:57:42.770 --> 00:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
um so they just back themselves into
 
00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:46.940 align:start position:0%
this corner and you know there's the the
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
market kind of helps you on both sides
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
on the sort of the the most
 
00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.430 align:start position:0%
on the sort of the the most
um

00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
the richest homeless people the homeless
 
00:57:59.930 --> 00:57:59.940 align:start position:0%
people who have some income right if you
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
build more housing the price is going to
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
lower and some of them will be able to
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
house themselves
 
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
um or pay a little bit of rent to family
 
00:58:08.210 --> 00:58:08.220 align:start position:0%
and friends and then the people who
 
00:58:09.290 --> 00:58:09.300 align:start position:0%
really aren't going to be able to house
 
00:58:10.790 --> 00:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
themselves without helping the state
 
00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
will state be able to help more more of
 
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:15.240 align:start position:0%
them as the cost curves gets pushed down
 
00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:16.329 align:start position:0%
them as the cost curves gets pushed down
for

00:58:16.329 --> 00:58:16.339 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:58:19.130 --> 00:58:19.140 align:start position:0%
state-sponsored vouchers or you know
 
00:58:19.140 --> 00:58:20.329 align:start position:0%
state-sponsored vouchers or you know
that's

00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:58:22.430 --> 00:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I we agree there's no
 
00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
conflict we certainly could make this
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
presentation with a little more emphasis
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
there and you know maybe if I had
 
00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:28.140 align:start position:0%
another another cup of coffee or one
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
fewer that's where it would have ended
 
00:58:29.339 --> 00:58:30.490 align:start position:0%
fewer that's where it would have ended
up

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:30.500 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:58:35.089 --> 00:58:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.789 --> 00:58:37.799 align:start position:0%
thank you kind of building on the last
 
00:58:37.799 --> 00:58:39.170 align:start position:0%
thank you kind of building on the last
question

00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:39.180 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:40.490 align:start position:0%
question
um

00:58:40.490 --> 00:58:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:43.020 align:start position:0%
do you have any information about the
 
00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:44.569 align:start position:0%
do you have any information about the
government

00:58:44.569 --> 00:58:44.579 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire
 
00:58:50.450 --> 00:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
incentivizing non-development
 
00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
um and
 
00:58:56.329 --> 00:58:56.339 align:start position:0%
how much impact that has has had
 
00:58:59.569 --> 00:58:59.579 align:start position:0%
specifically current use
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
um and how other states might be
 
00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:05.870 align:start position:0%
um and how other states might be
incentivizing

00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
incentivizing
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
um kind of like
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
like tax breaks for farmland and and
 
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
bought a golf course to prevent it from
 
00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:25.319 align:start position:0%
becoming a subdivision and it's just
 
00:59:26.569 --> 00:59:26.579 align:start position:0%
sitting there
 
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
um Peabody Mass was just in the news for
 
00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
buying up a piece of land that they
 
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
didn't want develop into housing so it's
 
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
certainly done I I don't know New
 
00:59:38.809 --> 00:59:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:40.970 --> 00:59:40.980 align:start position:0%
just at least from my own experience I
 
00:59:42.530 --> 00:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
know Connecticut towns have the
 
00:59:44.450 --> 00:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
authority to offer certain tax
 
00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:46.740 align:start position:0%
reductions or abatements for
 
00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:47.390 align:start position:0%
reductions or abatements for
um

00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:47.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:49.370 --> 00:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
use of property for farming purposes
 
00:59:52.069 --> 00:59:52.079 align:start position:0%
which I think is fairly common to the
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
extent to which it's actually promoted
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
agricultural uses I don't I don't know
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's it's a sort of uh a here and there
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
sort of a patchwork
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
um but uh I know it's um it's
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
significant enough abatement that you
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
know it does seem to
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
be encouraging some reuse of older
 
01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:17.329 --> 01:00:17.339 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.609 --> 01:00:19.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:00:22.190 --> 01:00:22.200 align:start position:0%
um you piqued my interest on several
 
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:24.839 align:start position:0%
items that you spoke of
 
01:00:26.329 --> 01:00:26.339 align:start position:0%
um and I'm wondering if you can provide
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
further information single stair
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
limiting parking minimums
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
um I'm assuming just to be real quick on
 
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
it that this single stair are stack
 
01:00:41.030 --> 01:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
units or is in with each floor have just
 
01:00:44.809 --> 01:00:44.819 align:start position:0%
one or more than one apartment
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
so I think you could do it with two
 
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
apartments pretty easily um
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
technically with a single stair you
 
01:00:52.130 --> 01:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
could you know there's no there's no
 
01:00:53.510 --> 01:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
physical limit on how many units you
 
01:00:55.609 --> 01:00:55.619 align:start position:0%
could put but typically
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
um the value of that comes from
 
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
relatively narrow buildings and the
 
01:01:03.530 --> 01:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
ability to have Windows on
 
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
two or three sides of a unit instead of
 
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
just windows on one side of it and if I
 
01:01:09.289 --> 01:01:09.299 align:start position:0%
remember hearing you correctly you
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
talked about to do that to sweeten the
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
pot higher fire safety standards or
 
01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:17.220 align:start position:0%
higher construction standards on those
 
01:01:21.289 --> 01:01:21.299 align:start position:0%
units yeah right so the you know the
 
01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
U.S abides by something called the
 
01:01:24.650 --> 01:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
international building code which is a
 
01:01:26.990 --> 01:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
bit of a misnomer because it's not used
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
much internationally
 
01:01:32.510 --> 01:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
um it's US and Canada basically and
 
01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
most other developed countries allow
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
single stair buildings
 
01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:38.390 align:start position:0%
single stair buildings
height

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
height
 
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
you know one of the reasons for having
 
01:01:44.750 --> 01:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
two staircases is fire safety but
 
01:01:46.190 --> 01:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
obviously there's other ways to achieve
 
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
fire safety and so like you know the
 
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
goal is to achieve a certain level of
 
01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.109 align:start position:0%
goal is to achieve a certain level of
safety

01:01:51.109 --> 01:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
um not to achieve safety through one way
 
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
over another
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
so you can you can sort of make these
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
trade-offs and say okay you have to
 
01:01:59.150 --> 01:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
achieve the same safety that you choose
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
staircase building would achieve but if
 
01:02:02.329 --> 01:02:02.339 align:start position:0%
you do that through a mix of split
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
sprinklers or heavily rated walls
 
01:02:08.329 --> 01:02:08.339 align:start position:0%
um or you know type 3 Type 4
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
construction instead of type one
 
01:02:12.530 --> 01:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
um then that's great thank you if you
 
01:02:14.510 --> 01:02:14.520 align:start position:0%
could follow up with some parking
 
01:02:17.390 --> 01:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
minimum because I I live in rural
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
and our lots are small and there's been
 
01:02:24.530 --> 01:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:26.819 align:start position:0%
density but then when it comes down to
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
parking it's a killer so if you could
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
follow that along and one that I've
 
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
spoken to if I could Mr chairman I
 
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
apologize without asking one of the
 
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
things I've talked to a lot of our
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
concert everyone's saying we don't have
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
enough land to make Workforce housing
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and several of my
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
towns are over 50 or 60 percent of their
 
01:02:53.930 --> 01:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
land mass in conservation easement
 
01:02:56.930 --> 01:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
and so many of those maybe I'm wrong but
 
01:02:59.030 --> 01:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
many of those conservation easements
 
01:03:02.089 --> 01:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
could not open up the process again to
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
allow 20 or 30 Acres if they could it
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
would it would make you know
 
01:03:11.329 --> 01:03:11.339 align:start position:0%
an interesting conversation on one type
 
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
of land and how much so I'm wondering if
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
there have I'm cautioning them on New
 
01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
easements to make you know some
 
01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
condition to make that happen are you
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
aware of of any model conservation
 
01:03:27.410 --> 01:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
easements that are being worked on that
 
01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
would be more
 
01:03:37.490 --> 01:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
so um good group of questions so working
 
01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
backwards I don't know of anyone who's
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
done this but what I would suggest for a
 
01:03:48.190 --> 01:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
new conservation easement is to pair it
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
with up zonings that sort of offset the
 
01:03:54.370 --> 01:03:54.380 align:start position:0%
potential loss of developable land
 
01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
this has been done through again more
 
01:03:58.609 --> 01:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
Rube Goldberg type systems like in
 
01:04:00.770 --> 01:04:00.780 align:start position:0%
Montgomery County Maryland has a
 
01:04:03.349 --> 01:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
successful example of sort of tradable
 
01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
or if they wanted to preserve their
 
01:04:08.150 --> 01:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
farmland and they let the farmers sell
 
01:04:10.849 --> 01:04:10.859 align:start position:0%
their development rights to sort of
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
urban areas where extra growth would be
 
01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:14.990 align:start position:0%
urban areas where extra growth would be
welcomed

01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
welcomed
 
01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:17.220 align:start position:0%
uh lots and lots of places have imitated
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
that and they haven't worked so really
 
01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:20.339 align:start position:0%
Montgomery County and New York City are
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
the only ones that have worked and
 
01:04:23.329 --> 01:04:23.339 align:start position:0%
they're very large jurisdictions where
 
01:04:24.410 --> 01:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
there's lots of buyers and lots of
 
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
sellers don't try to make that work in a
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:30.470 --> 01:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:32.579 align:start position:0%
but just as a matter of like the town
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
meeting making this decision saying like
 
01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
hey if we if we take a conservation
 
01:04:38.930 --> 01:04:38.940 align:start position:0%
easement on such and such a land
 
01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know this is this could have been
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
developed as 50 homes let's make sure we
 
01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:45.000 align:start position:0%
zone for a capacity 50 homes where we do
 
01:04:46.730 --> 01:04:46.740 align:start position:0%
want them and so there's sort of a
 
01:04:48.410 --> 01:04:48.420 align:start position:0%
budgeting like a
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
um a net zero uh change in regulation
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
and that sort of fits in I think a lot
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
of people's concepts of like we would
 
01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
like to encourage growth to be where
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
Services already are where it's not
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
changing the the natural environment
 
01:05:04.010 --> 01:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
much and um
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
you know I but then the argument comes
 
01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:07.500 align:start position:0%
you actually have to like find a place
 
01:05:09.049 --> 01:05:09.059 align:start position:0%
to up Zone and
 
01:05:09.059 --> 01:05:09.589 align:start position:0%
to up Zone and
um

01:05:09.589 --> 01:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:11.579 align:start position:0%
you know the people any any specific
 
01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:13.619 align:start position:0%
spot people find some excuse not to
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
upzone it
 
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:18.020 align:start position:0%
um on parking minimums
 
01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh lots and lots of cities Nationwide
 
01:05:22.910 --> 01:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
have gotten rid of parking minimums in
 
01:05:26.270 --> 01:05:26.280 align:start position:0%
their downtowns or city-wide
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
um Auburn Maine which we worked with
 
01:05:29.690 --> 01:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
they got rid of commercial parking
 
01:05:32.089 --> 01:05:32.099 align:start position:0%
minimums entirely and took residential
 
01:05:34.370 --> 01:05:34.380 align:start position:0%
down to one per unit and I just think
 
01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:35.630 align:start position:0%
down to one per unit and I just think
generally

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
developers build the parking that they
 
01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
think they need and
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
so the big gains from changes in parking
 
01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:44.510 align:start position:0%
so the big gains from changes in parking
are

01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:05:46.309 --> 01:05:46.319 align:start position:0%
where the government just doesn't know
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
what the business needs so in Auburn as
 
01:05:49.309 --> 01:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
soon as they change the requirements
 
01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
they had two interesting proposals so
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
one was uh and these are not like I mean
 
01:05:55.609 --> 01:05:55.619 align:start position:0%
your Mercedes these are not walkable
 
01:05:57.650 --> 01:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
businesses one was um Olive Garden the
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
other was Target right these are very
 
01:06:01.010 --> 01:06:01.020 align:start position:0%
much car oriented businesses and
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
cariented locations
 
01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
Olive Garden wanted to buy an old
 
01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
restaurant shell
 
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
um that just wasn't quite big enough for
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
their business model and they wanted to
 
01:06:11.450 --> 01:06:11.460 align:start position:0%
sort of punch it out and add
 
01:06:14.690 --> 01:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
five or ten more tables worth of space
 
01:06:16.309 --> 01:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
um by taking over some of their parking
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
lot they were able to do that because
 
01:06:19.849 --> 01:06:19.859 align:start position:0%
the city gave them the flexibility on
 
01:06:20.930 --> 01:06:20.940 align:start position:0%
the parking minimums and they said we
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
don't you know we have this many tables
 
01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
this many parking space we don't need
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
all the parking spaces we need more
 
01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:25.970 align:start position:0%
all the parking spaces we need more
tables

01:06:25.970 --> 01:06:25.980 align:start position:0%
tables
 
01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
and then Target similarly bought a pad
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
site that had been I don't know Toys R
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
Us or something and they wanted to
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
expand the floor space they didn't need
 
01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
as much parking so I actually think
 
01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
commercial is where you can get a lot of
 
01:06:40.609 --> 01:06:40.619 align:start position:0%
benefit you're not getting housing from
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
commercial obviously
 
01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.609 align:start position:0%
commercial obviously
um

01:06:43.609 --> 01:06:43.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:45.289 --> 01:06:45.299 align:start position:0%
but in terms of efficiently using your
 
01:06:48.410 --> 01:06:48.420 align:start position:0%
land uh we just you know the these
 
01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
parking minimums that are written into
 
01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.049 align:start position:0%
parking minimums that are written into
code

01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:51.059 align:start position:0%
code
 
01:06:53.329 --> 01:06:53.339 align:start position:0%
they're just guesses nobody has any idea
 
01:06:55.670 --> 01:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
nobody has done a study
 
01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:56.270 align:start position:0%
nobody has done a study
um

01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
that has any external validity every
 
01:06:59.930 --> 01:06:59.940 align:start position:0%
business in every location has a
 
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
slightly different need and they're the
 
01:07:02.450 --> 01:07:02.460 align:start position:0%
ones best positioned to figure that out
 
01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:04.380 align:start position:0%
so lots of cities have done it they
 
01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
don't stop building parking but they
 
01:07:08.329 --> 01:07:08.339 align:start position:0%
build it in different places so like
 
01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:10.140 align:start position:0%
Buffalo did this Buffalo in Buffalo the
 
01:07:12.410 --> 01:07:12.420 align:start position:0%
big benefit was it allowed reuse of old
 
01:07:15.109 --> 01:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
buildings which Buffalo has a lot of
 
01:07:16.490 --> 01:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
um more easily so they'd had a problem
 
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:19.380 align:start position:0%
with these old pre-car era downtown
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
building said No Parking On Site
 
01:07:25.849 --> 01:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
they needed variances to get reused and
 
01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
reactivate it's either sitting vacant
 
01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
and the city benefited enormously from
 
01:07:30.410 --> 01:07:30.420 align:start position:0%
just getting rid of the parking minimums
 
01:07:33.410 --> 01:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
and letting people repurpose uh
 
01:07:34.609 --> 01:07:34.619 align:start position:0%
buildings without having to worry about
 
01:07:36.049 --> 01:07:36.059 align:start position:0%
parking and so
 
01:07:37.730 --> 01:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
your customers are going to have to get
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
there and if they don't like that's
 
01:07:41.089 --> 01:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
going to be your problem
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
um occasionally I'll get local leaders
 
01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
to say oh we need this because otherwise
 
01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:45.839 align:start position:0%
people park on the street well park on
 
01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:46.980 align:start position:0%
the street is a problem address parking
 
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
on the street you can do that with
 
01:07:49.910 --> 01:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
stickers you can do that through no
 
01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:51.900 align:start position:0%
parking on main roads
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
um address that like a lot of times
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
people try to use zoning to address some
 
01:07:57.470 --> 01:07:57.480 align:start position:0%
backdoor problem and it doesn't often
 
01:07:59.930 --> 01:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
work like people do large lot zoning to
 
01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:00.770 align:start position:0%
work like people do large lot zoning to
address

01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
address
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
you know storm water concerns but then
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
people are like putting pesticides on
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
two acre Lawns and it's like well this
 
01:08:09.170 --> 01:08:09.180 align:start position:0%
isn't actually solving the problem that
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
you wished it would solve address the
 
01:08:10.799 --> 01:08:12.049 align:start position:0%
you wished it would solve address the
problem

01:08:12.049 --> 01:08:12.059 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:14.039 align:start position:0%
don't address this other thing that is
 
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
tangentially related to it
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:08:22.610 --> 01:08:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
um thanks for taking more questions
 
01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.229 align:start position:0%
um thanks for taking more questions
um

01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
I I like your
 
01:08:32.150 --> 01:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
um your
 
01:08:35.150 --> 01:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
thoughts on kind of like making existing
 
01:08:37.189 --> 01:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
conditions illegal because the home that
 
01:08:39.769 --> 01:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
I currently live in is illegal
 
01:08:39.779 --> 01:08:42.229 align:start position:0%
I currently live in is illegal
um so

01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
um I I liked also your kind of like
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
phrasing of kind of maybe the state has
 
01:08:49.249 --> 01:08:49.259 align:start position:0%
a role in
 
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
um instead of this kind of what New
 
01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:53.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has is kind of like oftentimes
 
01:08:57.470 --> 01:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
rural character is is often used and
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to change that to
 
01:09:01.309 --> 01:09:01.319 align:start position:0%
historical character of the community
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
instead of rural character
 
01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
um how does
 
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
how did you see some of these um like
 
01:09:14.090 --> 01:09:14.100 align:start position:0%
proposals uh
 
01:09:17.450 --> 01:09:17.460 align:start position:0%
um kind of like being instantiated or
 
01:09:20.150 --> 01:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
being proposed because what I'm thinking
 
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
about is something like you know
 
01:09:25.070 --> 01:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
um you know within a certain number of
 
01:09:27.650 --> 01:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
feet of my house you can have the same
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
conditions that you know the same
 
01:09:31.849 --> 01:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
setbacks that my house has what what
 
01:09:35.030 --> 01:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
were the types of um
 
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
um like preserving of the historical
 
01:09:41.870 --> 01:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:45.169 --> 01:09:45.179 align:start position:0%
in some local zoning codes I know you do
 
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
see some accommodation for uh characters
 
01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
saying for example a setback can be
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
determined based upon the average of the
 
01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:53.400 align:start position:0%
surrounding houses and things like this
 
01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
that at least attempt
 
01:09:56.510 --> 01:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
um to acknowledge that there is an
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
existing historical context and that
 
01:10:00.610 --> 01:10:00.620 align:start position:0%
requiring somebody to be
 
01:10:03.169 --> 01:10:03.179 align:start position:0%
building Anew to build something that's
 
01:10:05.090 --> 01:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
completely different in scale and
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
setting from the existing homes is not
 
01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
preserving the historic context uh you
 
01:10:12.169 --> 01:10:12.179 align:start position:0%
know you see it here and there usually
 
01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
in response to individual cases where
 
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
somebody says this clearly this code is
 
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
not a protecting our the historic
 
01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
character of our town at all
 
01:10:23.930 --> 01:10:23.940 align:start position:0%
um but I think
 
01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
um as far as a
 
01:10:28.130 --> 01:10:28.140 align:start position:0%
state level
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
perform that number one that's something
 
01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
that could be reflected in the enabling
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
statute itself
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
um Connecticut in 2021 recently
 
01:10:39.290 --> 01:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
performed made some major changes to its
 
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
enabling statute to reflect some of
 
01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
these additional concerns and actually I
 
01:10:45.050 --> 01:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
think they took character completely out
 
01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
as a consideration although another
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
another way might be to change the type
 
01:10:51.229 --> 01:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
of character that's being protected
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
because I I know you typically hear this
 
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
um at least this phrase New England the
 
01:10:57.229 --> 01:10:57.239 align:start position:0%
rural character of the town which is
 
01:10:59.390 --> 01:10:59.400 align:start position:0%
somewhat of an oxymoron right it's like
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
the town it's the country it's like what
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
are we what are we protecting uh and it
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
becomes a little bit confused as to
 
01:11:07.729 --> 01:11:07.739 align:start position:0%
what's um you know what the underlying
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
goal is so I think clarifying some of
 
01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:12.300 align:start position:0%
those purposes from a Statewide
 
01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
perspective like what other resources
 
01:11:16.669 --> 01:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
we're we're trying to protect which is I
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
think it's already reflected somewhat
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
which it says you know protecting
 
01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:21.780 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and Forestry and a balanced
 
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
supply of housing you know reinforcing
 
01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
the the best qualities of the existing
 
01:11:27.709 --> 01:11:27.719 align:start position:0%
towns while protecting the best
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
qualities of uh you know farmland and
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
forests and historic natural resources
 
01:11:35.169 --> 01:11:35.179 align:start position:0%
and you know strengthening each of those
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
rather than promoting a
 
01:11:41.689 --> 01:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
super LeapFrog a pattern of development
 
01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
which you see now where
 
01:11:45.770 --> 01:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
um you know developments occur
 
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
just here and there according to
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
happenstance and who acquires a
 
01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
particular parcel of land so I think
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's one way of doing it also uh yeah
 
01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
the other approach is is directly
 
01:11:58.490 --> 01:11:58.500 align:start position:0%
intervening for example
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this is the current
 
01:12:01.910 --> 01:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislation that's proposed in Vermont
 
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
but it was one they had a couple years
 
01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
ago was simply setting lot sizes in
 
01:12:10.130 --> 01:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
areas served by city services like areas
 
01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
where there's a sewer and water and no
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
concern about
 
01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:15.900 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
or septics or anything like that and
 
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
simply setting some bottom line
 
01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
standards saying in those areas where
 
01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
there's already existing density we're
 
01:12:24.890 --> 01:12:24.900 align:start position:0%
going to say you can't set a lot size
 
01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:26.580 align:start position:0%
minimum more than ten thousand square
 
01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
feet there's just no justification for
 
01:12:30.729 --> 01:12:30.739 align:start position:0%
that for requiring things that are
 
01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
completely out of character with the
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
existing zone so if we see that all has
 
01:12:37.370 --> 01:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
no Health Banning farming on their
 
01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:38.810 align:start position:0%
no Health Banning farming on their
outskirts

01:12:38.810 --> 01:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
outskirts
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
um which of course is what people were
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
doing there a long time before the
 
01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:43.020 align:start position:0%
suburb came along and so that the
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
legislature stepping in to actually
 
01:12:45.890 --> 01:12:45.900 align:start position:0%
protect the farmers right to continue
 
01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.630 align:start position:0%
protect the farmers right to continue
farming

01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:47.640 align:start position:0%
farming
 
01:12:49.729 --> 01:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
um but the way that I would do the sort
 
01:12:52.010 --> 01:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
of protecting existing conditions it's
 
01:12:54.649 --> 01:12:54.659 align:start position:0%
easier in a settled area where you've
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
got the concept of a block
 
01:12:59.570 --> 01:12:59.580 align:start position:0%
where you can say like if a block has
 
01:13:01.189 --> 01:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
you know if you know you take like the
 
01:13:01.199 --> 01:13:01.970 align:start position:0%
you know if you know you take like the
the

01:13:01.970 --> 01:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
two-thirds or three quarters percentile
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
so like you can't you can't uh
 
01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:11.820 align:start position:0%
and enforce a regulation that would put
 
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
a quarter or a third of the houses on
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
this block or the parcels on this block
 
01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
and do not conformity
 
01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:19.739 align:start position:0%
that'd be one way to do it
 
01:13:19.739 --> 01:13:20.450 align:start position:0%
that'd be one way to do it
um

01:13:20.450 --> 01:13:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
you could do something like a a physical
 
01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
distance like 200 feet that would be
 
01:13:26.689 --> 01:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
able to work the benefit of that is it
 
01:13:29.209 --> 01:13:29.219 align:start position:0%
would work in rural areas as well
 
01:13:29.219 --> 01:13:29.810 align:start position:0%
would work in rural areas as well
um

01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:31.910 --> 01:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
do you think in rural areas there's more
 
01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:32.940 align:start position:0%
of a
 
01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
validity to say
 
01:13:36.649 --> 01:13:36.659 align:start position:0%
um all right well there's you know
 
01:13:37.850 --> 01:13:37.860 align:start position:0%
there's a few scattered buildings along
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
here but this is not settled according
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
to a certain pattern and so that if it
 
01:13:43.189 --> 01:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
gets built up We Want to Build It Up
 
01:13:44.689 --> 01:13:44.699 align:start position:0%
according to this pattern
 
01:13:47.149 --> 01:13:47.159 align:start position:0%
and there you're
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
you know a little bit more in keeping
 
01:13:51.229 --> 01:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
with the idea of what zoning is supposed
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:13:55.610 --> 01:13:55.620 align:start position:0%
um in the in the fully fully built out
 
01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.169 align:start position:0%
um in the in the fully fully built out
area

01:13:57.169 --> 01:13:57.179 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:13:58.910 --> 01:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
The Zone it's like sort of that the cow
 
01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
has left the barn like if you wanted to
 
01:14:02.270 --> 01:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
develop it under pattern a well pattern
 
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:03.900 align:start position:0%
B is already in place and you should
 
01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
just respect pattern B and it could it
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
could also go to uses so if you've got
 
01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:09.420 align:start position:0%
an area where
 
01:14:12.350 --> 01:14:12.360 align:start position:0%
there's a mix of uses
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
the town couldn't come along and say
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
um you know residential is banned here
 
01:14:17.209 --> 01:14:17.219 align:start position:0%
commercial is banned here if it's mixed
 
01:14:19.370 --> 01:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
use it gets to stay mixed use and you
 
01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
can't tell somebody
 
01:14:22.850 --> 01:14:22.860 align:start position:0%
I can't switch in One Direction the
 
01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
other if it's already a kind of an
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
established use in that area but I think
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
it'd be something to workshop and kind
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
of sit down with the towns and say like
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
hey how would this affect you how would
 
01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
you interpret this how do we think about
 
01:14:35.990 --> 01:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
rural areas because that's where my
 
01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
thinking is I think the most unclear
 
01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
um but I think there's a lot of cases
 
01:14:43.310 --> 01:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
where towns would say oh yeah we we had
 
01:14:44.810 --> 01:14:44.820 align:start position:0%
we had no intention of enforcing this
 
01:14:45.950 --> 01:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
regulation we always give people the
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
variance when they ask for it and just
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
saying like hey you know it seems to you
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
from the town perspective the variance
 
01:14:52.850 --> 01:14:52.860 align:start position:0%
feels cost less like you just do a
 
01:14:54.770 --> 01:14:54.780 align:start position:0%
little business and like you get a fee
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
but from the point of view of the
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
property owner
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
the variance is this big uncertainty
 
01:15:01.070 --> 01:15:01.080 align:start position:0%
they don't want to start the project as
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
even a tiny bit of uncertainty
 
01:15:04.850 --> 01:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
um and just removing that uncertainty I
 
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
think can really help them
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
representative Walsh
 
01:15:12.189 --> 01:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for coming
 
01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
here's some looks like a lot of helpful
 
01:15:15.590 --> 01:15:15.600 align:start position:0%
information here on some of the
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
solutions bear with me for a couple of
 
01:15:19.130 --> 01:15:19.140 align:start position:0%
minutes I've been taking notes through
 
01:15:20.810 --> 01:15:20.820 align:start position:0%
your whole testimony I wish we had
 
01:15:23.930 --> 01:15:23.940 align:start position:0%
stopped a couple times in the middle so
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
let me try to summarize all these
 
01:15:29.510 --> 01:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll start with looking at your
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
introduction overly restrictive local
 
01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
zoning is the fundamental cause of
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
America's housing shortage that's your
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
position you're not the first one to
 
01:15:39.709 --> 01:15:39.719 align:start position:0%
come here saying that is so
 
01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
and then you've referred to municipal
 
01:15:42.780 --> 01:15:45.229 align:start position:0%
and then you've referred to municipal
government

01:15:45.229 --> 01:15:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
um as the impediment and that's why the
 
01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:50.640 align:start position:0%
state should preempt some of these
 
01:15:52.729 --> 01:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
zoning restrictions
 
01:15:55.010 --> 01:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
have you done a town by Town study
 
01:15:56.330 --> 01:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
because I've always been under the
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
impression that the majority of zoning
 
01:16:01.669 --> 01:16:01.679 align:start position:0%
varying zoning ordinance are actually
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
adopted by the citizens of the towns I
 
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:06.659 align:start position:0%
believe the cities and some of our sb2
 
01:16:08.870 --> 01:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
towns it's actually the local governing
 
01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
body that makes the or has the authority
 
01:16:13.250 --> 01:16:13.260 align:start position:0%
and I thought the balance overwhelmingly
 
01:16:16.189 --> 01:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
was actually adopted by the citizens on
 
01:16:18.410 --> 01:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
either the warrant or town meeting have
 
01:16:20.689 --> 01:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
you looked into that because if that's
 
01:16:23.390 --> 01:16:23.400 align:start position:0%
the case I don't necessarily agree that
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
it's the government that is causing this
 
01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
it may be the citizens
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
I mean so we could we can have a debate
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
about townships and towns and whether
 
01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:32.820 align:start position:0%
whether the town meeting is the
 
01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:34.010 align:start position:0%
whether the town meeting is the
government

01:16:34.010 --> 01:16:34.020 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
um so I you know
 
01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:38.640 align:start position:0%
whether I wrote that you can you can
 
01:16:41.090 --> 01:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
gloss in town meeting for for as the
 
01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:43.020 align:start position:0%
form of government I think it is a form
 
01:16:44.570 --> 01:16:44.580 align:start position:0%
of government okay
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
um if if uh from a legal perspective you
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
want to draw a distinction there fine I
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right you know places
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
that have a town meeting are adopting
 
01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:54.900 align:start position:0%
their ordinances correct we just
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
defended the citizens choice and
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
Hooksett last week at our delayed
 
01:17:01.310 --> 01:17:01.320 align:start position:0%
meeting so so I am corrected the
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
majority of our municipalities it's the
 
01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
citizens that decide these things we can
 
01:17:07.370 --> 01:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
you're right debate whether that's
 
01:17:09.890 --> 01:17:09.900 align:start position:0%
local governing body or not uh but
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
getting back to that and again just so I
 
01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
can have some credible
 
01:17:15.169 --> 01:17:15.179 align:start position:0%
or some credibility when I'm looking
 
01:17:16.790 --> 01:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
through some of your suggestions again
 
01:17:18.729 --> 01:17:18.739 align:start position:0%
now we're talking about the government
 
01:17:21.229 --> 01:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
as the impediment and that's the reason
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
the state government should preempt
 
01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
the only thing I heard you mention is
 
01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:28.980 align:start position:0%
reasons for the pressure on demand is
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
covid-19 and remote working as the sole
 
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:33.659 align:start position:0%
driver from people coming from
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts you might want to look at
 
01:17:36.649 --> 01:17:36.659 align:start position:0%
the Millionaire's tax and a bunch of
 
01:17:37.910 --> 01:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
other things they're doing down there
 
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
that are making people come here were
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
there any other things that you think
 
01:17:44.510 --> 01:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
are pushing on demand or applying
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
pressure on the demand side
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
I mean there's lots of things Nationwide
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
so this is not a New Hampshire problem
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
right this is if this is a 50 state
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
um problem
 
01:17:58.490 --> 01:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
uh there are more American households
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
than there were a generation ago we make
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
more money we demand more living space
 
01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.890 align:start position:0%
more money we demand more living space
the

01:18:03.890 --> 01:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
you know if you look at that graph
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
of housing prices you'll see it was
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
steadily Rising through 2019 at the
 
01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
beginning of 2020 and then summer of
 
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
2020 it takes off
 
01:18:16.669 --> 01:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
it was still Rising before covet 19.
 
01:18:16.679 --> 01:18:17.270 align:start position:0%
it was still Rising before covet 19.
um

01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
um I think covid-19 to work from home
 
01:18:20.689 --> 01:18:20.699 align:start position:0%
are especially relevant in a place like
 
01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's within range of but
 
01:18:26.330 --> 01:18:26.340 align:start position:0%
not the you know core of a major
 
01:18:28.310 --> 01:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
metropolitan area yep so there are there
 
01:18:29.810 --> 01:18:29.820 align:start position:0%
are absolutely lots of other factors and
 
01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:30.830 align:start position:0%
are absolutely lots of other factors and
then

01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
some of the cyclical stuff is going to
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
be driven by interest rates
 
01:18:35.990 --> 01:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
um certainly not denying that those are
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
going to come and go you know don't make
 
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
your long-term laws to try to deal with
 
01:18:42.290 --> 01:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
what the FED did yesterday but
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
um yeah we We As Americans we want to
 
01:18:46.729 --> 01:18:46.739 align:start position:0%
live in bigger and bigger houses we want
 
01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:49.199 align:start position:0%
more and more space
 
01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
of course and I agree those are
 
01:18:53.390 --> 01:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons for it and again I'm
 
01:18:54.890 --> 01:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
not trying to I understand this is
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
information just again trying to get an
 
01:18:58.490 --> 01:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
understanding of what you put into the
 
01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
research before I can take the
 
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
information out of it and use it
 
01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
um and we keep talking about government
 
01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
as in strict of uh zoning is a problem
 
01:19:09.770 --> 01:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
and that's the reason we need to preempt
 
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
but if we're going to talk about the
 
01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
reasons and and causes by government
 
01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:15.420 align:start position:0%
because I'm a firm believer you need to
 
01:19:16.850 --> 01:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
know all the causes before you can come
 
01:19:19.130 --> 01:19:19.140 align:start position:0%
to Solutions have you looked at illegal
 
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
immigration I know it seems like uh the
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
elephant in the corner nobody wants to
 
01:19:24.709 --> 01:19:24.719 align:start position:0%
talk about but when we know we have
 
01:19:26.330 --> 01:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of people coming
 
01:19:28.130 --> 01:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
across the border in the last few years
 
01:19:30.169 --> 01:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
they're going everywhere have you
 
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
studied how that is affecting
 
01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
the supply side of housing in all our
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
states I mean so the funny thing like an
 
01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
honest answer here I'm not trying to
 
01:19:40.970 --> 01:19:40.980 align:start position:0%
troll you
 
01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:41.990 align:start position:0%
troll you
um

01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
a a significant issue in the 2010s boom
 
01:19:50.090 --> 01:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
was that there weren't the kind of cheap
 
01:19:51.770 --> 01:19:51.780 align:start position:0%
uh workers you could pick up at Home
 
01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:53.270 align:start position:0%
uh workers you could pick up at Home
Depot

01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
Depot
 
01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
um to do timber Framing and drywalling
 
01:19:59.630 --> 01:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
that there were in the 2005-2007 housing
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
boom it's one of the reasons that even
 
01:20:03.169 --> 01:20:03.179 align:start position:0%
though Prices rose just as much in like
 
01:20:06.290 --> 01:20:06.300 align:start position:0%
the 2014 to 19 time frame we didn't
 
01:20:08.330 --> 01:20:08.340 align:start position:0%
build nearly as much housing
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
um but you know we've done Texas is
 
01:20:11.810 --> 01:20:11.820 align:start position:0%
probably the state where we've done the
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
most work this year they they certainly
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
um know about illegal immigration they
 
01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
have a lot of people uh who both legally
 
01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:22.460 align:start position:0%
and illegally have migrated to Texas
 
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
they managed to House people who don't
 
01:20:26.810 --> 01:20:26.820 align:start position:0%
have a lot of money
 
01:20:28.610 --> 01:20:28.620 align:start position:0%
um they managed to put home ownership in
 
01:20:30.410 --> 01:20:30.420 align:start position:0%
reach of
 
01:20:33.410 --> 01:20:33.420 align:start position:0%
um working Texans by building a lot of
 
01:20:36.470 --> 01:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
house so you know wherever the demand
 
01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
comes from illegal immigrants don't
 
01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
demand much housing because they don't
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
have much money like ultimately demand
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
is a function of like how much you can
 
01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.669 align:start position:0%
is a function of like how much you can
pay

01:20:43.669 --> 01:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
pay
 
01:20:46.510 --> 01:20:46.520 align:start position:0%
um when I look at it as units
 
01:20:49.729 --> 01:20:49.739 align:start position:0%
sure but you know it don't like
 
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
if you look at number of people who
 
01:20:53.810 --> 01:20:53.820 align:start position:0%
occupy a housing unit right so
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
um the uh the affluent person who's able
 
01:20:58.370 --> 01:20:58.380 align:start position:0%
to say like I want a home office every
 
01:20:59.450 --> 01:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
one of my kids gets their own bedroom
 
01:21:03.470 --> 01:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
like they're using up a lot more of uh
 
01:21:05.030 --> 01:21:05.040 align:start position:0%
the square footage
 
01:21:07.370 --> 01:21:07.380 align:start position:0%
in a city than the family that's living
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
12 to a room doesn't mean the two
 
01:21:10.250 --> 01:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
absolute room is not there not denying
 
01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
that they're absolutely a source of
 
01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
source of demand
 
01:21:15.649 --> 01:21:15.659 align:start position:0%
um but I I
 
01:21:18.050 --> 01:21:18.060 align:start position:0%
don't see any correlation across the U.S
 
01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
that makes me think that that's a
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
significant or a major driver of what's
 
01:21:24.530 --> 01:21:24.540 align:start position:0%
happening now it's certainly less of a
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
driver than it was 15 or 20 years ago
 
01:21:27.770 --> 01:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
when there were a lot more illegal
 
01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
if I can thank you sir have you uh cost
 
01:21:36.169 --> 01:21:36.179 align:start position:0%
wise on the uh
 
01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
inflated rents and record home prices
 
01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
um what if you refresh my memory what
 
01:21:43.729 --> 01:21:43.739 align:start position:0%
were your major reasons for the spike in
 
01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
price short of the government caused
 
01:21:48.830 --> 01:21:48.840 align:start position:0%
inflation again these are all policies
 
01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
that are out of our hands we're looking
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
for Solutions here but a lot of the
 
01:21:54.050 --> 01:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
problems I see are are problems that
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
were developed by our federal government
 
01:21:58.310 --> 01:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
not so much US inflation was not caused
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
by the state of New Hampshire and you
 
01:22:02.149 --> 01:22:02.159 align:start position:0%
know and our energy policy was not
 
01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
adopted by the state of New Hampshire
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
but yet both of those things play a
 
01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
major role in the cost of development
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
and rental prices because most of your
 
01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:13.440 align:start position:0%
rentals actually have heat and hot water
 
01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
included so I just again I'm just
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
reiterating how much of this stuff
 
01:22:19.070 --> 01:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
you've actually looked at to come up
 
01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
with your summaries
 
01:22:22.790 --> 01:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
yeah no those are those are absolutely
 
01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
real factors um I think it's really
 
01:22:25.970 --> 01:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
important to look beyond the current
 
01:22:27.770 --> 01:22:27.780 align:start position:0%
moment um just as you you know you
 
01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
pointed out like does covid-19 stuff
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's maybe temporary and we shouldn't
 
01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
base all of our conclusions on that I
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
simply rape is also you know we were
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
doing this work before you know the
 
01:22:42.770 --> 01:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
inflation of the of 2021 2022
 
01:22:44.689 --> 01:22:44.699 align:start position:0%
um and we saw basically the same problem
 
01:22:47.390 --> 01:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
right you know so inflation
 
01:22:50.209 --> 01:22:50.219 align:start position:0%
shuffles the deck slightly differently
 
01:22:52.729 --> 01:22:52.739 align:start position:0%
but fundamentally you've got a nation of
 
01:22:54.110 --> 01:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
the growing population and growing
 
01:22:58.310 --> 01:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
wealth that has stopped building uh
 
01:22:59.930 --> 01:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
housing at the rate that it used if you
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
look at how many housing units per
 
01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
thousand Americans we built in 1950 or
 
01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
1960 or 1970 or 1980 or 1990 or 2000 or
 
01:23:10.850 --> 01:23:10.860 align:start position:0%
right up to 2008 it's higher than today
 
01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
we are building housing at the peak of
 
01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
our economic expansion when we were a
 
01:23:18.709 --> 01:23:18.719 align:start position:0%
booming country with very low
 
01:23:20.570 --> 01:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
unemployment we were building less
 
01:23:22.729 --> 01:23:22.739 align:start position:0%
housing per person than we were in
 
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
recessions in the 20th century we're
 
01:23:29.090 --> 01:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
below recessionary levels from when our
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
parents were trying to buy their first
 
01:23:32.689 --> 01:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
homes so I
 
01:23:34.610 --> 01:23:34.620 align:start position:0%
it's obviously a complex problem housing
 
01:23:35.689 --> 01:23:35.699 align:start position:0%
touches everything and everything
 
01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:37.260 align:start position:0%
touches housing so there's nothing you
 
01:23:38.570 --> 01:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
can bring up that'll say oh no no that's
 
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
totally unrelated house everything's
 
01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:41.810 align:start position:0%
totally unrelated house everything's
related

01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:41.820 align:start position:0%
related
 
01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
but you can't tell me look at the data
 
01:23:45.830 --> 01:23:45.840 align:start position:0%
and tell me oh we've got enough housing
 
01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's just these other things it's these
 
01:23:50.209 --> 01:23:50.219 align:start position:0%
guys in Washington like sure they affect
 
01:23:50.219 --> 01:23:51.649 align:start position:0%
guys in Washington like sure they affect
it

01:23:51.649 --> 01:23:51.659 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
but there's no musical chairs by which
 
01:23:55.970 --> 01:23:55.980 align:start position:0%
you can take a growing population and
 
01:23:57.649 --> 01:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
say oh we're going to stop building
 
01:23:59.630 --> 01:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
enough housing for them and then have to
 
01:24:00.709 --> 01:24:00.719 align:start position:0%
be enough housing like there's just no
 
01:24:02.149 --> 01:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
like there's nowhere to put all those
 
01:24:03.950 --> 01:24:03.960 align:start position:0%
heads in beds
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
um at the the rate that they're
 
01:24:06.239 --> 01:24:09.550 align:start position:0%
um at the the rate that they're
demanding

01:24:09.550 --> 01:24:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
of course
 
01:24:13.729 --> 01:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
um I agree with you in entirety in terms
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
of looking at construction standards and
 
01:24:19.250 --> 01:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
building codes uh as a as a problem and
 
01:24:21.530 --> 01:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
just I'll agree I'm a carpenter and the
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
developer as well so I know all about
 
01:24:24.169 --> 01:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
them they're ridiculous
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
have you looked
 
01:24:27.050 --> 01:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
um because I'm hearing this from other
 
01:24:29.689 --> 01:24:29.699 align:start position:0%
avenues too have you looked at this or
 
01:24:31.910 --> 01:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
maybe are you going to look at it it's
 
01:24:34.270 --> 01:24:34.280 align:start position:0%
not just building codes um
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
overburdensome and over regulated fire
 
01:24:38.930 --> 01:24:38.940 align:start position:0%
codes I'm starting to see those I'm
 
01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
hearing from developers that those are
 
01:24:42.169 --> 01:24:42.179 align:start position:0%
probably worse than the building codes
 
01:24:43.729 --> 01:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
to begin with have you looked at that
 
01:24:45.649 --> 01:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
angle because they're hugely expensive
 
01:24:47.950 --> 01:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
for some of these regulations
 
01:24:50.810 --> 01:24:50.820 align:start position:0%
so usually when I I'm not building
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
firecracker usually when I've seen them
 
01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
there together what's what's the
 
01:24:56.330 --> 01:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
difference if you're looking at them
 
01:24:58.850 --> 01:24:58.860 align:start position:0%
together that's fine thank you thank you
 
01:25:00.290 --> 01:25:00.300 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:02.340 align:start position:0%
um representative we had somebody from
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire building code
 
01:25:04.610 --> 01:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
officials Association was supposed to be
 
01:25:05.930 --> 01:25:05.940 align:start position:0%
here today not feeling well so we'll
 
01:25:07.490 --> 01:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
have them at the next meeting you'll be
 
01:25:09.350 --> 01:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
able to ask about that as well thank you
 
01:25:11.090 --> 01:25:11.100 align:start position:0%
um representative Gibbs thank you Mr
 
01:25:11.100 --> 01:25:12.770 align:start position:0%
um representative Gibbs thank you Mr
chairman

01:25:12.770 --> 01:25:12.780 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:25:14.450 --> 01:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
um just following up on the previous
 
01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:16.130 align:start position:0%
um just following up on the previous
question

01:25:16.130 --> 01:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
um am I correct in my understanding that
 
01:25:21.229 --> 01:25:21.239 align:start position:0%
new immigrants and particularly illegal
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
immigrants often live several households
 
01:25:27.169 --> 01:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
well we Define a household by people who
 
01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
live in a unit together so it's kind of
 
01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
it's a tautology well perhaps several
 
01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
families per unit certainly certainly at
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
it thank you
 
01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
anything else okay I'm gonna ask a
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
couple but please okay so
 
01:25:48.410 --> 01:25:48.420 align:start position:0%
um can you explain
 
01:25:48.420 --> 01:25:49.729 align:start position:0%
um can you explain
um

01:25:49.729 --> 01:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
I know when we last met we talked about
 
01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
protest petitions can you talk about
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
that a little bit
 
01:25:58.430 --> 01:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
um because going on the local level
 
01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:00.540 align:start position:0%
about how citizens control zoning
 
01:26:02.330 --> 01:26:02.340 align:start position:0%
ordinances I'd love to know a little bit
 
01:26:04.370 --> 01:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
about how we can reform protest
 
01:26:06.649 --> 01:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
petitions to affect you know maybe make
 
01:26:08.870 --> 01:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
it a little bit more difficult or a
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
higher standard to right stop
 
01:26:13.129 --> 01:26:13.139 align:start position:0%
development yeah great question
 
01:26:13.139 --> 01:26:13.790 align:start position:0%
development yeah great question
um

01:26:13.790 --> 01:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:17.209 --> 01:26:17.219 align:start position:0%
so 20 states in the U.S have protest
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
petition laws uh to have a weird
 
01:26:21.890 --> 01:26:21.900 align:start position:0%
referendum thing and the other 28 don't
 
01:26:23.450 --> 01:26:23.460 align:start position:0%
have any such law so this is not
 
01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:25.129 align:start position:0%
have any such law so this is not
Universal

01:26:25.129 --> 01:26:25.139 align:start position:0%
Universal
 
01:26:29.149 --> 01:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
um in states with a protest petition law
 
01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
if someone if the town wants to rezone
 
01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
whether through their own initiative or
 
01:26:36.120 --> 01:26:36.830 align:start position:0%
whether through their own initiative or
um

01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
because a citizen asked you know would
 
01:26:40.129 --> 01:26:40.139 align:start position:0%
you please ReSound my property so I can
 
01:26:41.689 --> 01:26:41.699 align:start position:0%
do such and such
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
if neighbors within a certain radius I
 
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
don't have the New Hampshire set you in
 
01:26:46.490 --> 01:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
front of me at the moment but if
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
neighbors in a certain radius
 
01:26:51.350 --> 01:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
um sign a petition
 
01:26:54.050 --> 01:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
uh against the rezoning then it kicks up
 
01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:55.189 align:start position:0%
uh against the rezoning then it kicks up
the

01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh required majority at city council or
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
town meeting
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
to a super majority
 
01:27:05.510 --> 01:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
and makes it much much harder I think
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
especially in a town meeting context
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
to pass a resume
 
01:27:14.209 --> 01:27:14.219 align:start position:0%
um and there's a bunch of reasons that
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
this is not great law so one is that it
 
01:27:19.310 --> 01:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
only enfranchises property owners and
 
01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
not renters
 
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
um so uh a case that I I wrote obviously
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
in Texas uh It was a commercial District
 
01:27:28.129 --> 01:27:28.139 align:start position:0%
so all the all the property owners are
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
commercial property owners somebody
 
01:27:30.709 --> 01:27:30.719 align:start position:0%
wants to build an assisted living
 
01:27:33.110 --> 01:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
facility and the owner of vacant land
 
01:27:36.410 --> 01:27:36.420 align:start position:0%
next to them protests and gets the thing
 
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
killed because
 
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:40.860 align:start position:0%
maybe they thought that they you know
 
01:27:42.410 --> 01:27:42.420 align:start position:0%
whatever they were planning to do with
 
01:27:44.450 --> 01:27:44.460 align:start position:0%
their land someday didn't mesh well with
 
01:27:45.649 --> 01:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
Assisted Living they'd like something
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
next to them that is drawing customers
 
01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
to the area to patronize their business
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
whatever they end up building right it's
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
like that's not an appropriate use of
 
01:27:55.910 --> 01:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
the zoning power to let one commercial
 
01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.890 align:start position:0%
the zoning power to let one commercial
landowner

01:27:57.890 --> 01:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
landowner
 
01:27:59.570 --> 01:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
you know shaft and other commercial
 
01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:01.070 align:start position:0%
you know shaft and other commercial
landowner

01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
landowner
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
um because they'd like to make more
 
01:28:04.070 --> 01:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
money right like that's not what we make
 
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
something for
 
01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:06.169 align:start position:0%
something for
um

01:28:06.169 --> 01:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
the other the other feature of that case
 
01:28:11.689 --> 01:28:11.699 align:start position:0%
that that highlights a failure of the
 
01:28:13.970 --> 01:28:13.980 align:start position:0%
participation law is that it's minority
 
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
rule so in Most states I'd have to again
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
look up for New Hampshire Most states if
 
01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
20 owners of 20 of the surrounding land
 
01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
protests that triggers the makes the
 
01:28:27.410 --> 01:28:27.420 align:start position:0%
participation valid and triggers the
 
01:28:28.850 --> 01:28:28.860 align:start position:0%
super majority requirement
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
so in this case one one neighbor
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
protested but four neighbors wrote in
 
01:28:35.270 --> 01:28:35.280 align:start position:0%
support and said great you know please
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
please approve this rezoning we're happy
 
01:28:38.149 --> 01:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
to have the assisted living facility
 
01:28:41.330 --> 01:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
next to us and there's no there's no
 
01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:42.900 align:start position:0%
offsetting it's not like if you get 80
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
in favor of 20 opposed it's still as if
 
01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:47.219 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood opposes it
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
um so there's a bill in Texas that would
 
01:28:51.590 --> 01:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
kick that up to 50 so it would leave the
 
01:28:52.910 --> 01:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
law in place it's a big deal in Texas
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
but it would at least make it you have
 
01:28:56.930 --> 01:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
to actually get a majority of the
 
01:28:58.610 --> 01:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
neighboring landowners a minority can't
 
01:29:01.010 --> 01:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
trigger the petition
 
01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:02.030 align:start position:0%
trigger the petition
um

01:29:02.030 --> 01:29:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:04.669 --> 01:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
and Massachusetts did reforms last year
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
01:29:09.890 --> 01:29:09.900 align:start position:0%
that allowed up zonings for more housing
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
to be essentially exempt
 
01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
um from they have so Massachusetts had
 
01:29:15.530 --> 01:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
the most restrictive rezoning law in the
 
01:29:17.810 --> 01:29:17.820 align:start position:0%
country so it required a super majority
 
01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
of city council or town meeting for any
 
01:29:21.649 --> 01:29:21.659 align:start position:0%
rezoning whatsoever we had to get
 
01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
two-thirds voted and so Governor Baker's
 
01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.090 align:start position:0%
two-thirds voted and so Governor Baker's
reforms

01:29:26.090 --> 01:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
reforms
 
01:29:28.850 --> 01:29:28.860 align:start position:0%
pushed that down to a 50 level four
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
reforms that would allow more housing so
 
01:29:33.050 --> 01:29:33.060 align:start position:0%
that sort of tilts the playing field a
 
01:29:36.830 --> 01:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
little bit in favor of Housing and I as
 
01:29:39.649 --> 01:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
a as a uh person who likes the idea that
 
01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:41.219 align:start position:0%
government should meet a higher bar for
 
01:29:41.219 --> 01:29:43.310 align:start position:0%
government should meet a higher bar for
regulation

01:29:43.310 --> 01:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
regulation
 
01:29:46.850 --> 01:29:46.860 align:start position:0%
um I like the idea of 50 to to lift
 
01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
regulations 66 to impose regulations
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts is not perfect it doesn't
 
01:29:53.689 --> 01:29:53.699 align:start position:0%
help commercial rezonings at all
 
01:29:55.250 --> 01:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
it only affects certain kinds of
 
01:29:57.470 --> 01:29:57.480 align:start position:0%
pro-housing rezonings
 
01:29:59.330 --> 01:29:59.340 align:start position:0%
um but I I see what they're doing there
 
01:30:02.209 --> 01:30:02.219 align:start position:0%
and I I like that concept can you give I
 
01:30:03.850 --> 01:30:03.860 align:start position:0%
I know you gave a commercial example
 
01:30:06.649 --> 01:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
could you give a residential example of
 
01:30:06.659 --> 01:30:07.510 align:start position:0%
could you give a residential example of
how

01:30:07.510 --> 01:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
first of all what our laws look like
 
01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
here and then give maybe a residential
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
example of how you know if we do lower
 
01:30:16.970 --> 01:30:16.980 align:start position:0%
the state lower the bar how that would
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
affect the outcome of that of that
 
01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
example so I don't have a New Hampshire
 
01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
examples off the top of my head
 
01:30:25.370 --> 01:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
um one that I know of in Oklahoma again
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
far away
 
01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:27.590 align:start position:0%
far away
um

01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:29.169 align:start position:0%
um
a

01:30:29.169 --> 01:30:29.179 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:30:32.810 --> 01:30:32.820 align:start position:0%
defunct Hotel wanted to so somebody
 
01:30:34.189 --> 01:30:34.199 align:start position:0%
somebody wanted to buy off defunct Hotel
 
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:36.440 align:start position:0%
turn half of it into a veterans homeless
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
housing and half of it into a hotel
 
01:30:41.090 --> 01:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
um and obviously like
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
the hotel part's not going to work if
 
01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
there's you know nuisances coming from
 
01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
the the homeless veterans right like
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
they thought they could make this work
 
01:30:52.370 --> 01:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
and make money on their hotel part while
 
01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
also providing housing to homeless vets
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
this is great this is what we want right
 
01:30:58.250 --> 01:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
people solving you know stepping up to
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
solve homelessness on their own
 
01:31:02.689 --> 01:31:02.699 align:start position:0%
The Neighbors which included uh
 
01:31:05.110 --> 01:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh Christian University and a Walmart
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
signed a protest petition and Oklahoma
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
probably has the already like the
 
01:31:12.169 --> 01:31:12.179 align:start position:0%
countries of the 20 states that have
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
these laws probably the best model
 
01:31:18.770 --> 01:31:18.780 align:start position:0%
um it's still cleared their 50 threshold
 
01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:20.930 align:start position:0%
um it's still cleared their 50 threshold
and

01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:31:23.209 --> 01:31:23.219 align:start position:0%
um killed or at least delayed that I I
 
01:31:24.770 --> 01:31:24.780 align:start position:0%
don't know what's the come of that case
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
that was a couple years ago I was
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
probably just dead at this point
 
01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:29.149 align:start position:0%
probably just dead at this point
um

01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
but again that's a case where
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
somebody was going to try to provide
 
01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
housing to a particularly needy
 
01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:36.050 align:start position:0%
housing to a particularly needy
population

01:31:36.050 --> 01:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
um and even with that higher threshold
 
01:31:39.169 --> 01:31:39.179 align:start position:0%
it's not a great example because it
 
01:31:40.189 --> 01:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell you like oh if you just
 
01:31:41.330 --> 01:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
made this little change you would fix
 
01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:42.470 align:start position:0%
made this little change you would fix
everything

01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
everything
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
um but you can kind of make these
 
01:31:45.530 --> 01:31:45.540 align:start position:0%
marginal changes you can push the
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
boundaries out so that the buffer is
 
01:31:49.729 --> 01:31:49.739 align:start position:0%
bigger and means that it is less likely
 
01:31:52.070 --> 01:31:52.080 align:start position:0%
to just be one or two uh grumpy
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
neighbors to kill a project you actually
 
01:31:55.129 --> 01:31:55.139 align:start position:0%
have to get serious neighborhood
 
01:31:55.139 --> 01:31:56.090 align:start position:0%
have to get serious neighborhood
opposition

01:31:56.090 --> 01:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
01:31:58.610 --> 01:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
you can certainly kick it up to 50 You
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
Can Count renters or all registered
 
01:32:03.110 --> 01:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
voters in the in the buffer
 
01:32:05.209 --> 01:32:05.219 align:start position:0%
um so that people who are prospective
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
renters are like oh I would like it if
 
01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
there was nice new rentals in my
 
01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:09.890 align:start position:0%
there was nice new rentals in my
neighborhood

01:32:09.890 --> 01:32:09.900 align:start position:0%
neighborhood
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to I just don't want
 
01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
anything to change I got mine and my
 
01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:16.020 align:start position:0%
property values Rising every year
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
um I think all of those things would
 
01:32:18.890 --> 01:32:18.900 align:start position:0%
help at the margin
 
01:32:21.530 --> 01:32:21.540 align:start position:0%
ultimately like two states just got rid
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
of the law entirely North Carolina and
 
01:32:26.330 --> 01:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin repealed it in
 
01:32:28.370 --> 01:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
North Carolina there was like one study
 
01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
and two or three little paper articles
 
01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
in a local paper Wisconsin you can't
 
01:32:34.310 --> 01:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
even find a mention of it in the news it
 
01:32:36.709 --> 01:32:36.719 align:start position:0%
was so trivial so unused
 
01:32:37.970 --> 01:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
um they were able to get rid of it I
 
01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:39.420 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's widely used in New
 
01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:40.610 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's widely used in New
Hampshire

01:32:40.610 --> 01:32:40.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:32:42.950 --> 01:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
um or if it's kind of used so often
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
people don't even know that the water is
 
01:32:46.850 --> 01:32:46.860 align:start position:0%
wet so I think both of those I've seen
 
01:32:48.490 --> 01:32:48.500 align:start position:0%
states where both of those are the case
 
01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
and so I'd have to do a little bit more
 
01:32:52.610 --> 01:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire specific research maybe
 
01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
maybe I did before we talked last time
 
01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:55.199 align:start position:0%
and I knew what I was talking about I
 
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at it
 
01:32:58.129 --> 01:32:58.139 align:start position:0%
um in the last few weeks well and and
 
01:32:59.570 --> 01:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful to inform the
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
committee maybe if you could look into
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
that and provide us feedback on that
 
01:33:05.870 --> 01:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
because I'm looking specifically at how
 
01:33:08.930 --> 01:33:08.940 align:start position:0%
those protest petitions uh restrict um
 
01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
specifically adus and other units that
 
01:33:13.850 --> 01:33:13.860 align:start position:0%
are being built on existing property I
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
think it's something we'd like to look
 
01:33:17.689 --> 01:33:17.699 align:start position:0%
at thank you absolutely
 
01:33:19.610 --> 01:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
um yeah we have we're rolling over a
 
01:33:20.930 --> 01:33:20.940 align:start position:0%
little bit but does anybody else have
 
01:33:23.209 --> 01:33:23.219 align:start position:0%
any questions represent broody
 
01:33:25.430 --> 01:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you very
 
01:33:27.169 --> 01:33:27.179 align:start position:0%
much for coming and speaking to us this
 
01:33:27.179 --> 01:33:28.430 align:start position:0%
much for coming and speaking to us this
morning

01:33:28.430 --> 01:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:33:30.350 --> 01:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
um I know you gave a lot of examples
 
01:33:32.209 --> 01:33:32.219 align:start position:0%
about a lot of things
 
01:33:34.850 --> 01:33:34.860 align:start position:0%
all around the country however we're in
 
01:33:37.070 --> 01:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh I think we're very
 
01:33:39.229 --> 01:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
unique in New Hampshire we're a small
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
state and we see an enormous influx of
 
01:33:45.530 --> 01:33:45.540 align:start position:0%
people from New York Connecticut and
 
01:33:46.990 --> 01:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
especially Massachusetts
 
01:33:49.370 --> 01:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
selling their High products price
 
01:33:51.590 --> 01:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
property there coming up here and
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
outbidding everybody all these local
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
people these kids who were born and
 
01:33:57.050 --> 01:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
raised here trying to buy their first
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
home they're out of the market and
 
01:34:01.189 --> 01:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I'm really concerned
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
about they have no shot at all
 
01:34:06.470 --> 01:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
um the only thing I think and I know
 
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
what I don't know what we can do on a
 
01:34:11.030 --> 01:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
state level as far as relieving packing
 
01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
I think is a big thing I'm a
 
01:34:15.830 --> 01:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts broker as well and I've
 
01:34:18.050 --> 01:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
sold property in in Cambridge and
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
Somerville uh four or five family units
 
01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
with zero packing they find a way to you
 
01:34:28.490 --> 01:34:28.500 align:start position:0%
know live there so I think parking if we
 
01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:30.360 align:start position:0%
could light lighten up on a parking for
 
01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
one thing especially in the cities but
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
these small towns who are
 
01:34:38.330 --> 01:34:38.340 align:start position:0%
really controlling their own you know
 
01:34:41.390 --> 01:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
towns that they want your town to stay
 
01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:43.500 align:start position:0%
the way it is and there's not much that
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
we can force them to do but um just keep
 
01:34:49.610 --> 01:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
up the Integrity of the State of New
 
01:34:52.189 --> 01:34:52.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it is a unique problem
 
01:34:54.169 --> 01:34:54.179 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire has
 
01:34:57.709 --> 01:34:57.719 align:start position:0%
a small state of surrounded by people
 
01:34:59.810 --> 01:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
that want to come in so and thank you
 
01:35:01.129 --> 01:35:01.139 align:start position:0%
for coming again thank you I think
 
01:35:03.470 --> 01:35:03.480 align:start position:0%
Montana is actually a really
 
01:35:04.970 --> 01:35:04.980 align:start position:0%
um good peer to look at is very
 
01:35:07.010 --> 01:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
different physical environment but the
 
01:35:08.450 --> 01:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
economic environment is very similar
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
where it's Californians in their case
 
01:35:13.850 --> 01:35:13.860 align:start position:0%
and it's further away but the it's a
 
01:35:15.110 --> 01:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
very small number of Californians to
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
make a lot of montanans
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
they've seen prices just absolutely
 
01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:20.810 align:start position:0%
they've seen prices just absolutely
Skyrocket

01:35:20.810 --> 01:35:20.820 align:start position:0%
Skyrocket
 
01:35:23.090 --> 01:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
um and I I really applaud governor
 
01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
gianforte and our we have a good friend
 
01:35:27.229 --> 01:35:27.239 align:start position:0%
there who runs the think tank Kendall
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
cotton at the frontier Institute they've
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
just taken the lead and said like We
 
01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
Can't Stop The Californians there's no
 
01:35:34.129 --> 01:35:34.139 align:start position:0%
legal way under the U.S Constitution to
 
01:35:36.169 --> 01:35:36.179 align:start position:0%
say that California can't move here and
 
01:35:38.030 --> 01:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
bring the 1.2 million dollars of home
 
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
equity that they have and outbid the
 
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:41.820 align:start position:0%
montanans and we have to build enough
 
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
housing for everyone
 
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and so they've taken a very strong
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
like we're gonna build our way out of
 
01:35:48.719 --> 01:35:50.030 align:start position:0%
like we're gonna build our way out of
this

01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:35:52.850 --> 01:35:52.860 align:start position:0%
um because there's no you know the U.S
 
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution you can't stop people from
 
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
um but I I would absolutely take a look
 
01:35:58.970 --> 01:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
at them and and kind of the the common
 
01:36:00.649 --> 01:36:00.659 align:start position:0%
problem that they're dealing with
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
and there's people that come in with
 
01:36:04.430 --> 01:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
much much more money than what our
 
01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
people have yeah because you get to cash
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
out in the big city yeah absolutely
 
01:36:11.510 --> 01:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I just add to that I guess that's
 
01:36:13.970 --> 01:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
that's also an issue with um some of the
 
01:36:15.890 --> 01:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
air the the states surrounding New York
 
01:36:17.330 --> 01:36:17.340 align:start position:0%
um Connecticut as well where there's
 
01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
been a huge run-up and
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
property prices over the last couple
 
01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
years so you've seen a lot of people
 
01:36:24.290 --> 01:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic moving out of New
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
York coming up looking for uh maybe
 
01:36:28.610 --> 01:36:28.620 align:start position:0%
they're working remotely now
 
01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:30.360 align:start position:0%
so they're looking for an opportunity to
 
01:36:31.729 --> 01:36:31.739 align:start position:0%
live a couple hours out from the city
 
01:36:33.169 --> 01:36:33.179 align:start position:0%
they only have to go in one or two days
 
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
a week so suddenly you have a complete
 
01:36:36.970 --> 01:36:36.980 align:start position:0%
reconfiguration of the the job market
 
01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
and these exorbent towns which weren't
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
as desirable certainly are
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
um but just like uh Saleem said you see
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
that um people coming in with the the
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
money to buy for example just uh buy a
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
house in cash or uh whatever it is I
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
mean there's not even any chance to
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
um to get into a bidding process much
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
less with somebody who grew up in the
 
01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
town let's say who's working
 
01:37:01.729 --> 01:37:01.739 align:start position:0%
um you know just started working as a
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
teacher at one of the elementary schools
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
and is looking to find a place they have
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely no chance to compete with
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
somebody like that and I mean I've seen
 
01:37:11.330 --> 01:37:11.340 align:start position:0%
that happen in my own town people have
 
01:37:14.030 --> 01:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
had to move out because their landlord
 
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
was selling because the the prices were
 
01:37:18.050 --> 01:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
going up and um
 
01:37:20.149 --> 01:37:20.159 align:start position:0%
they essentially they lost their rental
 
01:37:22.010 --> 01:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
and had to move out someplace else so
 
01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
that the need is as acute and it's
 
01:37:27.649 --> 01:37:27.659 align:start position:0%
immediate and it's right you can't
 
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
um you can't throw up any roadblocks to
 
01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
keep people from coming out but you can
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
create new housing opportunities
 
01:37:37.729 --> 01:37:37.739 align:start position:0%
and hopefully those can be done in a way
 
01:37:39.070 --> 01:37:39.080 align:start position:0%
that benefit
 
01:37:41.450 --> 01:37:41.460 align:start position:0%
the locals as well people who would like
 
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
to stay in the town create ways
 
01:37:48.290 --> 01:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
find ways to create that housing housing
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
options that are appealing and
 
01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:50.570 align:start position:0%
options that are appealing and
affordable

01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
affordable
 
01:37:54.169 --> 01:37:54.179 align:start position:0%
to you know uh to locals people from the
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
area rather than only creating the you
 
01:37:58.610 --> 01:37:58.620 align:start position:0%
know at the very highest end and that's
 
01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
something that regulations can affect
 
01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
um you know knocking down some of these
 
01:38:05.330 --> 01:38:05.340 align:start position:0%
obstacles to creating a new housing
 
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
that's you know not um
 
01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
you know it's substandard but obviously
 
01:38:13.490 --> 01:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
affordable attainable to young people
 
01:38:18.669 --> 01:38:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you um have you seen anything
 
01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:25.070 align:start position:0%
thank you um have you seen anything
um

01:38:25.070 --> 01:38:25.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh with uh kind of like off-site
 
01:38:30.890 --> 01:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
building and 3D building
 
01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:32.570 align:start position:0%
building and 3D building
um

01:38:32.570 --> 01:38:32.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
um projects if if states are proposing
 
01:38:38.830 --> 01:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
um kind of uh
 
01:38:42.649 --> 01:38:42.659 align:start position:0%
unilateral approval or a Statewide
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
approval process of a specific design
 
01:38:47.810 --> 01:38:47.820 align:start position:0%
that can be like replicated throughout
 
01:38:52.010 --> 01:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
the state and therefore can avoid some
 
01:38:54.050 --> 01:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
of the you know regulatory costs of
 
01:38:56.990 --> 01:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
approving each individual design and and
 
01:38:58.910 --> 01:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
say okay this design has been approved
 
01:39:00.890 --> 01:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
at the state level as long as it's built
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
you know with this design then you're
 
01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:07.129 --> 01:39:07.139 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
a stand away that HUD code manufactured
 
01:39:11.390 --> 01:39:11.400 align:start position:0%
homes work it's Federal not State
 
01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.290 align:start position:0%
homes work it's Federal not State
um

01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:14.090 --> 01:39:14.100 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any states that have
 
01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:15.470 align:start position:0%
I don't know of any states that have
done

01:39:15.470 --> 01:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:39:18.830 --> 01:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
um Factory site approvals of other forms
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
of manufactured housing so usually
 
01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
this is it's a very it's a very messy
 
01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
area of of law because you
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
the physical product and the inspection
 
01:39:34.610 --> 01:39:34.620 align:start position:0%
process are not necessarily linked so a
 
01:39:36.709 --> 01:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
manuf a home that is manufactured can be
 
01:39:38.689 --> 01:39:38.699 align:start position:0%
a HUD code manufactured home where the
 
01:39:40.250 --> 01:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
HUD inspector comes to the factory puts
 
01:39:42.470 --> 01:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
a seal on it and then it has approval
 
01:39:44.689 --> 01:39:44.699 align:start position:0%
for anywhere in the U.S but when you
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
install that home in a New Hampshire
 
01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
town there's a good chance that it's the
 
01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
local building inspector still gets to
 
01:39:50.810 --> 01:39:50.820 align:start position:0%
come out
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
and inspect and you know approve or
 
01:39:55.550 --> 01:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
reject it
 
01:39:55.560 --> 01:39:56.149 align:start position:0%
reject it
um

01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:58.250 --> 01:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
or if you have a factory that's building
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
you know modular or manufacturing homes
 
01:40:03.050 --> 01:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
that aren't HUD code those definitely
 
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
then have to be inspected by the local
 
01:40:07.010 --> 01:40:07.020 align:start position:0%
building crew uh local local building
 
01:40:07.020 --> 01:40:08.270 align:start position:0%
building crew uh local local building
inspector

01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
inspector
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
so there's a few states that have
 
01:40:13.610 --> 01:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
required uh that
 
01:40:16.669 --> 01:40:16.679 align:start position:0%
HUD code manufactured homes be allowed
 
01:40:18.050 --> 01:40:18.060 align:start position:0%
everywhere where a single family home is
 
01:40:19.450 --> 01:40:19.460 align:start position:0%
left I think that's a good policy
 
01:40:22.189 --> 01:40:22.199 align:start position:0%
there's been a a
 
01:40:24.770 --> 01:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
a major campaign in the 60s and 70s that
 
01:40:26.629 --> 01:40:26.639 align:start position:0%
sort of the results which persist this
 
01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
day of attaching stigma to Manufactured
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
Homes uh that they they don't deserve
 
01:40:32.990 --> 01:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
it's not the jodes anymore
 
01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.669 align:start position:0%
it's not the jodes anymore
and

01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:34.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:40:36.890 --> 01:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
so allowing them everywhere is good but
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
the a big part of the benefit of them so
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
part of the benefit is that they're
 
01:40:41.209 --> 01:40:41.219 align:start position:0%
built indoors so you don't have to deal
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
with weather delays and so it's a little
 
01:40:43.669 --> 01:40:43.679 align:start position:0%
bit cheaper
 
01:40:45.290 --> 01:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
um part of the benefit is that the
 
01:40:46.850 --> 01:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
inspection happens all at once and you
 
01:40:47.629 --> 01:40:47.639 align:start position:0%
don't have to have the local building
 
01:40:50.570 --> 01:40:50.580 align:start position:0%
inspector and
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
um that also kind of kind of remove like
 
01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:53.990 align:start position:0%
um that also kind of kind of remove like
his

01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
his
 
01:40:55.970 --> 01:40:55.980 align:start position:0%
localities can sort of Shadow ban them
 
01:40:57.950 --> 01:40:57.960 align:start position:0%
like officially the state says you have
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
to allow all HUD code homes like sure we
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
allow all head code homes but also we
 
01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
require that roof pitch B acts in our
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
town and by the way HUD requires a roof
 
01:41:07.850 --> 01:41:07.860 align:start position:0%
picture of why and so like never the
 
01:41:09.410 --> 01:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
twain she'll meet no hudco home is ever
 
01:41:10.790 --> 01:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
going to meet this roof pitch and that
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
roof pitch
 
01:41:14.209 --> 01:41:14.219 align:start position:0%
and so you need a sort of substantial
 
01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
statute to say you have to allow these
 
01:41:17.030 --> 01:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
and you really have to allow them and
 
01:41:19.010 --> 01:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
they're not subject to local building
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
codes the other reason that we don't
 
01:41:23.390 --> 01:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
like manufactured homes typically is
 
01:41:25.610 --> 01:41:25.620 align:start position:0%
that a lot not the majority anymore but
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are placed in manufactured
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
home parks which are
 
01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
like factories for legal problems
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
because you've got the land owned by the
 
01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
park owner and the structure owned by
 
01:41:38.750 --> 01:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
the resident and so you're constantly
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
getting conflicts and you've got this
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
captured asset problem where it's like
 
01:41:45.350 --> 01:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 000 to move the so-called
 
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
mobile home it's not actually mobile
 
01:41:47.639 --> 01:41:48.290 align:start position:0%
mobile home it's not actually mobile
um

01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:48.300 --> 01:41:49.790 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
so the the park owner kind of has
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
captured the resident and can change the
 
01:41:55.970 --> 01:41:55.980 align:start position:0%
rent and they are much less mobile than
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
a regular renter who only has to move
 
01:41:59.090 --> 01:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
the sofa
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
um and then if the person leaves and
 
01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
abandons the property well the property
 
01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't belong to the park owners they
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
can't just re-rent it to somebody else
 
01:42:07.370 --> 01:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
like if you you know if you have a
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
regular multi-family tenant they walk
 
01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
away you say okay well we're gonna throw
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
out their belongings or into somebody
 
01:42:14.149 --> 01:42:14.159 align:start position:0%
else who knows what happened to Joe
 
01:42:15.950 --> 01:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
01:42:17.870 --> 01:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
so you end up with units that sit vacant
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
until they're like ready to be
 
01:42:21.229 --> 01:42:21.239 align:start position:0%
demolished so there's all sorts of
 
01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
problems that arise with mobile home
 
01:42:24.229 --> 01:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
parks I don't love those
 
01:42:26.090 --> 01:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
I understand why they exist but but they
 
01:42:28.129 --> 01:42:28.139 align:start position:0%
they create legal problems the houses
 
01:42:30.530 --> 01:42:30.540 align:start position:0%
themselves are fine and if you allow
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
people to fee simple install a house
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
without a local building inspector that
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
is the primary source of low-cost
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
housing in most of Rural America
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
um and that's how I would say most of
 
01:42:44.209 --> 01:42:44.219 align:start position:0%
the country rarely works is that people
 
01:42:46.070 --> 01:42:46.080 align:start position:0%
put these houses on no local building
 
01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
inspector shows up
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
for fifty to a hundred thousand dollars
 
01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:53.219 align:start position:0%
you've got a perfectly serviceable small
 
01:42:55.790 --> 01:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
single family house
 
01:42:57.530 --> 01:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.010 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

01:43:01.010 --> 01:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
in reference to
 
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
um mobile home parks manufactured
 
01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:07.010 align:start position:0%
um mobile home parks manufactured
housing

01:43:07.010 --> 01:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
um uh certainly we have had some legal
 
01:43:13.030 --> 01:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
problems around here in reference to
 
01:43:18.290 --> 01:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh Park's owned by Park owners and units
 
01:43:20.750 --> 01:43:20.760 align:start position:0%
owned by unit owners and it's become
 
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
quite complex occasionally
 
01:43:26.870 --> 01:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
um but uh I'm here I'll just give you
 
01:43:29.629 --> 01:43:29.639 align:start position:0%
one sentence background uh I live in a
 
01:43:32.570 --> 01:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
condo townhouse uh where the land and
 
01:43:35.629 --> 01:43:35.639 align:start position:0%
the outdoor the outer part is owned by
 
01:43:38.930 --> 01:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
the condo association and the indoors is
 
01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:40.440 align:start position:0%
owned by me
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
um so how is that different from the
 
01:43:45.649 --> 01:43:45.659 align:start position:0%
mobile home park situation that you've
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
just described
 
01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:49.139 align:start position:0%
so there's no the condo association is
 
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
is owned by all the condo owners so you
 
01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
have no incentive to jack up your own
 
01:43:54.890 --> 01:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
condo fees imagine if instead of the
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
condo association it was you know some
 
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
right Berkshire Hathaway or some random
 
01:44:03.290 --> 01:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
dude before Town's over who realized
 
01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
that he could jack up the condo fees and
 
01:44:06.530 --> 01:44:06.540 align:start position:0%
pocket the money so I think that's the
 
01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:07.729 align:start position:0%
pocket the money so I think that's the
difference

01:44:07.729 --> 01:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:44:10.129 --> 01:44:10.139 align:start position:0%
well and I think what we're
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
well we're talking about you know the
 
01:44:13.790 --> 01:44:13.800 align:start position:0%
unit owners could come together and
 
01:44:15.229 --> 01:44:15.239 align:start position:0%
create an association or Co-op or
 
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
something of that sort there's a great
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
one great example in Goffstown of how
 
01:44:21.050 --> 01:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
the property was sold and then the
 
01:44:22.729 --> 01:44:22.739 align:start position:0%
residents purchased the property and
 
01:44:24.649 --> 01:44:24.659 align:start position:0%
created it to their own that has
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
happened locally a couple of times as
 
01:44:27.109 --> 01:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
well yeah
 
01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:28.739 align:start position:0%
I think allowing allowing also
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
subdivision into little tiny Lots
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
um and you know fee simple ownership is
 
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
the most advantaged form condos have had
 
01:44:40.490 --> 01:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
a kind of bad 20 years in the US for a
 
01:44:43.490 --> 01:44:43.500 align:start position:0%
number of reasons and
 
01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of
 
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
financial and legal infrastructure
 
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
to make fee simple homes work really
 
01:44:52.669 --> 01:44:52.679 align:start position:0%
well for a lot of people and so
 
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
subdividing so if you've got a mobile
 
01:44:55.250 --> 01:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
home park you're like ah we really like
 
01:44:58.970 --> 01:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
to preserve this as a as a neighborhood
 
01:44:58.980 --> 01:45:00.229 align:start position:0%
to preserve this as a as a neighborhood
um

01:45:00.229 --> 01:45:00.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:02.030 --> 01:45:02.040 align:start position:0%
just breaking it up into Lots which is
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
not normally allowed because the minimum
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
loss sizes are too small but we've
 
01:45:06.290 --> 01:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
physically got the same build pattern
 
01:45:09.709 --> 01:45:09.719 align:start position:0%
it's only to everyone's advantage to
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
turn these into small Lots let people
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
own their land and their unit and then
 
01:45:15.410 --> 01:45:15.420 align:start position:0%
they get access to all of the mortgage
 
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
infrastructure all of the legal
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that protects your house
 
01:45:22.910 --> 01:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
um and then also the city then has you
 
01:45:25.010 --> 01:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
know the authority if someone's a
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
nuisance they can take action if
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
someone's behind on their taxes
 
01:45:30.410 --> 01:45:30.420 align:start position:0%
they're sort of all the normal recourse
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
that we have towards a unified single
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
piece of property it gets a lot simpler
 
01:45:36.649 --> 01:45:36.659 align:start position:0%
and I think it benefits residents more
 
01:45:37.850 --> 01:45:37.860 align:start position:0%
and allows them to then appreciate
 
01:45:40.010 --> 01:45:40.020 align:start position:0%
invest Etc
 
01:45:42.050 --> 01:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
um I think condo kind of forms of
 
01:45:43.669 --> 01:45:43.679 align:start position:0%
ownership are
 
01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
meet certain needs
 
01:45:47.810 --> 01:45:47.820 align:start position:0%
um but they haven't they have not
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
performed very well in the last past
 
01:45:51.950 --> 01:45:51.960 align:start position:0%
quarter Century I'm not 100 sure why
 
01:45:54.530 --> 01:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna wrap up
 
01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much that's
 
01:45:58.850 --> 01:45:58.860 align:start position:0%
been very helpful
 
01:46:00.109 --> 01:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
um if you could follow up with us
 
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:01.860 align:start position:0%
specifically about the things that we've
 
01:46:03.709 --> 01:46:03.719 align:start position:0%
talked about that would be awesome we're
 
01:46:06.050 --> 01:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
looking at things regarding adus and
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
other stuff so I appreciate you coming
 
01:46:10.729 --> 01:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
by and traveling all to New Hampshire so

thank you very much we appreciate
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
shopliving New Hampshire
 
01:46:16.850 --> 01:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
all right we uh we had a uh somebody
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
cancel from the 11 30 or

10 30 to 11 15 so we're gonna try to
 
01:46:23.149 --> 01:46:23.159 align:start position:0%

early but let's take a 10 minute break
 
01:46:24.659 --> 01:46:25.550 align:start position:0%
early but let's take a 10 minute break
and

01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:46:28.910 --> 01:46:28.920 align:start position:0%
we'll come back come back at um
 
01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:39.169 --> 01:58:39.179 align:start position:0%
okay Welcome Back special committee on
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
housing so our next presentation is
 
01:58:42.649 --> 01:58:42.659 align:start position:0%
going to be from Christopher Parker from
 
01:58:44.750 --> 01:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
the city of Dover Christopher is the
 
01:58:46.250 --> 01:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
Deputy city manager and director of
 
01:58:49.370 --> 01:58:49.380 align:start position:0%
strategic strategic initiatives thank
 
01:58:51.770 --> 01:58:51.780 align:start position:0%
you for coming
 
01:58:53.930 --> 01:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
good morning just mind hitting your mic
 
01:58:57.890 --> 01:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:01.729 --> 01:59:01.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:03.649 --> 01:59:03.659 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
01:59:03.659 --> 01:59:05.570 align:start position:0%
there you go
technology

01:59:05.570 --> 01:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
technology
 
01:59:07.490 --> 01:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
again my name is Christopher Parker I'm
 
01:59:09.229 --> 01:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
the deputy city manager with city of
 
01:59:11.149 --> 01:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
Dover for way of background I've been
 
01:59:14.330 --> 01:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
with the city since 1997 including over
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
20 years with the Department of planning
 
01:59:17.870 --> 01:59:17.880 align:start position:0%
and Community Development of which I was
 
01:59:21.169 --> 01:59:21.179 align:start position:0%
the director for I believe 15 and a half
 
01:59:24.589 --> 01:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
years so I have definitely witnessed
 
01:59:26.089 --> 01:59:26.099 align:start position:0%
housing changes in the cities
 
01:59:28.609 --> 01:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
particularly having grown up there and
 
01:59:31.970 --> 01:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to discuss our philosophy
 
01:59:33.950 --> 01:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
discuss the the zoning that we've
 
01:59:36.890 --> 01:59:36.900 align:start position:0%
enacted in other land use changes and
 
01:59:38.510 --> 01:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
then take questions if that works for
 
01:59:40.189 --> 01:59:40.199 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
01:59:42.709 --> 01:59:42.719 align:start position:0%
so our philosophy is our philosophy is
 
01:59:45.350 --> 01:59:45.360 align:start position:0%
rooted in a couple different areas the
 
01:59:47.830 --> 01:59:47.840 align:start position:0%
first is that we want to encourage
 
01:59:50.270 --> 01:59:50.280 align:start position:0%
private rights private property rights
 
01:59:53.030 --> 01:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
including development rights and and
 
01:59:55.550 --> 01:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
protect those development rights whether
 
01:59:57.649 --> 01:59:57.659 align:start position:0%
they belong to the community whether
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
they belong to the property owner or the
 
02:00:01.790 --> 02:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
butter we recognize that all three
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
groups have vested interest in Land
 
02:00:06.649 --> 02:00:06.659 align:start position:0%
Development in the community
 
02:00:10.129 --> 02:00:10.139 align:start position:0%
in the face of housing we have decided
 
02:00:12.169 --> 02:00:12.179 align:start position:0%
as a community that it is better to be
 
02:00:15.229 --> 02:00:15.239 align:start position:0%
welcoming and open and encourage density
 
02:00:17.570 --> 02:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
and development encouraging more people
 
02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
to participate in our community and be
 
02:00:22.850 --> 02:00:22.860 align:start position:0%
engaged in our community than to do the
 
02:00:25.189 --> 02:00:25.199 align:start position:0%
alternative in that regards as we've
 
02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
studied housing and the variables that
 
02:00:29.149 --> 02:00:29.159 align:start position:0%
affect housing over the past 10 to 20
 
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
years we've recognized a few things
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
the most important one I think is
 
02:00:37.370 --> 02:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
recognizing the variables that go into
 
02:00:39.530 --> 02:00:39.540 align:start position:0%
the cost of housing I'm going to run
 
02:00:41.089 --> 02:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
through those
 
02:00:43.490 --> 02:00:43.500 align:start position:0%
they're a bit alliterative and in their
 
02:00:46.189 --> 02:00:46.199 align:start position:0%
design that way but they're I think they
 
02:00:48.770 --> 02:00:48.780 align:start position:0%
the terms cover more of a broad area so
 
02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
the first is land
 
02:00:53.810 --> 02:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
the cost of land has to play into it
 
02:00:55.850 --> 02:00:55.860 align:start position:0%
land particularly in a community that's
 
02:00:58.010 --> 02:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
celebrating its 400th anniversary this
 
02:01:00.470 --> 02:01:00.480 align:start position:0%
year is a little bit tight and we have
 
02:01:03.649 --> 02:01:03.659 align:start position:0%
developed continually over the past 400
 
02:01:05.629 --> 02:01:05.639 align:start position:0%
years particularly over the past 20
 
02:01:07.629 --> 02:01:07.639 align:start position:0%
years I believe in the
 
02:01:10.850 --> 02:01:10.860 align:start position:0%
2010 and 2020 census we were among the
 
02:01:13.850 --> 02:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
fastest growing communities in the state
 
02:01:16.490 --> 02:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
so land costs have continued to rise and
 
02:01:18.290 --> 02:01:18.300 align:start position:0%
if you pay attention to the market and
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
you pay attention to Market forces
 
02:01:22.129 --> 02:01:22.139 align:start position:0%
you'll recognize that even in recessions
 
02:01:24.890 --> 02:01:24.900 align:start position:0%
land might stabilize but it typically
 
02:01:26.570 --> 02:01:26.580 align:start position:0%
does not actually go down it's kind of
 
02:01:28.609 --> 02:01:28.619 align:start position:0%
like taxes things stabilize but they
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily go down
 
02:01:34.010 --> 02:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
the second L that I would refer to is
 
02:01:37.030 --> 02:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
Lumber and this could be any material
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
required to build houses I just like the
 
02:01:42.169 --> 02:01:42.179 align:start position:0%
L of lumber so it can be the nails it
 
02:01:45.050 --> 02:01:45.060 align:start position:0%
can be the drywall it can be the roofing
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
it can be certainly the timber required
 
02:01:50.689 --> 02:01:50.699 align:start position:0%
those costs have considered continue to
 
02:01:53.209 --> 02:01:53.219 align:start position:0%
go up as well
 
02:01:55.609 --> 02:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
the third L would be labor
 
02:01:58.609 --> 02:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
we do not do well as a state Community
 
02:02:01.370 --> 02:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
or Society of encouraging people to go
 
02:02:06.050 --> 02:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
into the labor force from a Hands-On
 
02:02:07.930 --> 02:02:07.940 align:start position:0%
standpoint the average age of a
 
02:02:10.430 --> 02:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
electrician in this state is 55 years
 
02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:12.350 align:start position:0%
electrician in this state is 55 years
old

02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
old
 
02:02:16.430 --> 02:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
the average age of a carpenter is older
 
02:02:19.010 --> 02:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
and if you think about what is needed to
 
02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
build houses it is labor and lumber
 
02:02:23.990 --> 02:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
you can have all the land you want if
 
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
you don't have people that actually can
 
02:02:27.770 --> 02:02:27.780 align:start position:0%
build the house or if any of you like me
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
have tried to do remodeling of our own
 
02:02:31.910 --> 02:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
house or fix something
 
02:02:34.070 --> 02:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
you'll find that that labor pool has
 
02:02:35.870 --> 02:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
continued to dwindle and it continued to
 
02:02:39.169 --> 02:02:39.179 align:start position:0%
go much more costly
 
02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
take a break for a second on that and go
 
02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
through some of the cost element that
 
02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
those three areas bring up
 
02:02:47.510 --> 02:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
if you think about the cost of a house
 
02:02:49.910 --> 02:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
and let's use a 1600 square foot house
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
which I will admit is bigger than my
 
02:02:55.430 --> 02:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
house but is typically considered a a
 
02:02:58.370 --> 02:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
middle range house today the cost of
 
02:03:01.850 --> 02:03:01.860 align:start position:0%
that house would be about 205 dollars a
 
02:03:03.050 --> 02:03:03.060 align:start position:0%
square foot
 
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
on a good day
 
02:03:07.609 --> 02:03:07.619 align:start position:0%
so that 1600 square foot house is over
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
three hundred thousand dollars almost
 
02:03:12.410 --> 02:03:12.420 align:start position:0%
350 000 just to build
 
02:03:14.689 --> 02:03:14.699 align:start position:0%
let's not add the land in let's not add
 
02:03:16.850 --> 02:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
the fact that the the Builder isn't
 
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
doing it to be altruistic and wants to
 
02:03:20.810 --> 02:03:20.820 align:start position:0%
profit they are in the business of of
 
02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:21.649 align:start position:0%
profit they are in the business of of
that

02:03:21.649 --> 02:03:21.659 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:03:24.290 --> 02:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
so there's a reason why we see continued
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
escalation in affordability just from a
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
market standpoint
 
02:03:31.609 --> 02:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
back to the L's of which there are five
 
02:03:35.390 --> 02:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
the fourth L is Lending
 
02:03:37.790 --> 02:03:37.800 align:start position:0%
for a number of years The Lending aspect
 
02:03:39.350 --> 02:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
was good
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
if you look back up until really the
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
past year year and a half
 
02:03:46.729 --> 02:03:46.739 align:start position:0%
mortgage rates interest rates were very
 
02:03:46.739 --> 02:03:47.870 align:start position:0%
mortgage rates interest rates were very
favorable

02:03:47.870 --> 02:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
favorable
 
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
and that it was spurring development and
 
02:03:52.129 --> 02:03:52.139 align:start position:0%
what I would hear often from developers
 
02:03:55.250 --> 02:03:55.260 align:start position:0%
was the cost of money is so cheap I can
 
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
absorb the cost of land Lumber and labor
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
to make it ameliorate out I can deal
 
02:04:04.669 --> 02:04:04.679 align:start position:0%
with that what I'm hearing now is
 
02:04:07.010 --> 02:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
we built houses when interest rates were
 
02:04:10.189 --> 02:04:10.199 align:start position:0%
in the the mid teens in the early 80s we
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
built houses in the 90s when the
 
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
interest rates were in the high single
 
02:04:16.320 --> 02:04:17.390 align:start position:0%
interest rates were in the high single
digits

02:04:17.390 --> 02:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
digits
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
we can build houses now at the six
 
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
the big thing we're finding with with
 
02:04:22.980 --> 02:04:23.750 align:start position:0%
the big thing we're finding with with
um

02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
interest rate Rising is it someone like
 
02:04:25.679 --> 02:04:27.109 align:start position:0%
interest rate Rising is it someone like
me

02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:04:30.589 --> 02:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
who has a 2.3 interest rate
 
02:04:32.930 --> 02:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
is not going to sell their house
 
02:04:35.330 --> 02:04:35.340 align:start position:0%
and so existing home sales have
 
02:04:38.570 --> 02:04:38.580 align:start position:0%
flatlined or coming on the market supply
 
02:04:41.689 --> 02:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
is flatlined or stabilized at or excuse
 
02:04:44.050 --> 02:04:44.060 align:start position:0%
me receded and that is what's driving
 
02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
costs relative to that is that the
 
02:04:49.370 --> 02:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
supply is going down because new houses
 
02:04:51.410 --> 02:04:51.420 align:start position:0%
are still being built and new house
 
02:04:53.810 --> 02:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
financing has different mechanisms in
 
02:04:55.609 --> 02:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
place different programs than existing
 
02:04:58.790 --> 02:04:58.800 align:start position:0%
home typically a new home they can buy
 
02:05:00.770 --> 02:05:00.780 align:start position:0%
down points they can reduce that
 
02:05:03.589 --> 02:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
interest rate assist a buyer an existing
 
02:05:05.209 --> 02:05:05.219 align:start position:0%
home seller is not going to have that
 
02:05:08.330 --> 02:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
same opportunity to do so or may not
 
02:05:10.129 --> 02:05:10.139 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the same opportunity
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
through their buying power so they're
 
02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
going to face that and again if you have
 
02:05:17.930 --> 02:05:17.940 align:start position:0%
a low interest rate
 
02:05:20.570 --> 02:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
you have to make the decision do I want
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
to take on a new interest rate and is
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
the property I'm going to buy that much
 
02:05:27.950 --> 02:05:27.960 align:start position:0%
better than what I have now
 
02:05:31.490 --> 02:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
and so we're seeing a very uh dramatic
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
change than what we saw a few years ago
 
02:05:33.599 --> 02:05:34.850 align:start position:0%
change than what we saw a few years ago
on

02:05:34.850 --> 02:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:05:37.970 --> 02:05:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh existing homes coming on the market
 
02:05:41.810 --> 02:05:41.820 align:start position:0%
so the fifth L is legislative
 
02:05:44.450 --> 02:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
and we recognize in Dover that we could
 
02:05:46.370 --> 02:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
as a community
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
buy land and sell it dirt cheap we
 
02:05:53.109 --> 02:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
certainly could try to buy materials or
 
02:05:56.390 --> 02:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
provide labor but the reality is none of
 
02:05:57.830 --> 02:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
those things are going to happen
 
02:06:00.109 --> 02:06:00.119 align:start position:0%
so you come down to financing The
 
02:06:03.169 --> 02:06:03.179 align:start position:0%
Lending l or legislative and for the
 
02:06:05.209 --> 02:06:05.219 align:start position:0%
community the most cost effective
 
02:06:06.589 --> 02:06:06.599 align:start position:0%
measure we determined was the
 
02:06:06.599 --> 02:06:07.669 align:start position:0%
measure we determined was the
legislative

02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:10.500 align:start position:0%
so starting in 2010 we started making
 
02:06:13.010 --> 02:06:13.020 align:start position:0%
legislative changes regarding housing
 
02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
housing affordability and Housing
 
02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:17.870 align:start position:0%
housing affordability and Housing
Opportunity

02:06:17.870 --> 02:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
Opportunity
 
02:06:20.450 --> 02:06:20.460 align:start position:0%
one of the first was prior to the state
 
02:06:23.209 --> 02:06:23.219 align:start position:0%
adopting accessory dwelling unit
 
02:06:24.890 --> 02:06:24.900 align:start position:0%
regulations the city of Dover put
 
02:06:26.689 --> 02:06:26.699 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit regulations in
 
02:06:29.990 --> 02:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
place in fact we worked with a variety
 
02:06:34.010 --> 02:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders in 2010 and 11 when the
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
state was developing its regulations and
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are modeled off of what we
 
02:06:40.609 --> 02:06:40.619 align:start position:0%
had already looked at in Dover at the
 
02:06:40.619 --> 02:06:41.689 align:start position:0%
had already looked at in Dover at the
time

02:06:41.689 --> 02:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
time
 
02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
we recognized at the time it was both an
 
02:06:47.330 --> 02:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get new homeowners or
 
02:06:49.729 --> 02:06:49.739 align:start position:0%
people that wanted to move towards home
 
02:06:52.850 --> 02:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
ownership a unit it was also a way for
 
02:06:55.070 --> 02:06:55.080 align:start position:0%
people to stay in their homes one of the
 
02:06:56.930 --> 02:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
things we constantly want to be aware of
 
02:06:58.669 --> 02:06:58.679 align:start position:0%
is that housing is not just for the
 
02:07:01.370 --> 02:07:01.380 align:start position:0%
young old or in between it's for all so
 
02:07:02.990 --> 02:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
we wanted to be able to provide
 
02:07:05.510 --> 02:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities for aging and home by
 
02:07:07.850 --> 02:07:07.860 align:start position:0%
allowing people that maybe would have
 
02:07:10.070 --> 02:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
been empty nesters would have sold and
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
tried to find a place to stay in the
 
02:07:13.750 --> 02:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
community to stay in their existing home
 
02:07:18.169 --> 02:07:18.179 align:start position:0%
rent a space to help recoup some income
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
to bring in income so that was one of
 
02:07:22.070 --> 02:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we we did the accessory
 
02:07:23.589 --> 02:07:23.599 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit ordinance
 
02:07:26.510 --> 02:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
13 years ago
 
02:07:28.669 --> 02:07:28.679 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we started looking
 
02:07:31.310 --> 02:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
at our density and and we made a
 
02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
conscious decision as a community that
 
02:07:34.570 --> 02:07:34.580 align:start position:0%
we wanted to start building Community
 
02:07:37.490 --> 02:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
particularly walkable communities and
 
02:07:39.890 --> 02:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
increasing our density and recognizing
 
02:07:43.250 --> 02:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
that density was not bad it really came
 
02:07:47.810 --> 02:07:47.820 align:start position:0%
down to an idea that still resonates I
 
02:07:49.729 --> 02:07:49.739 align:start position:0%
think and I'll use myself as an example
 
02:07:52.790 --> 02:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
again I have a 24 year old
 
02:07:54.709 --> 02:07:54.719 align:start position:0%
I would really like him to not live in
 
02:07:55.850 --> 02:07:55.860 align:start position:0%
my basement
 
02:07:58.070 --> 02:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
at the same time I don't necessarily
 
02:07:59.450 --> 02:07:59.460 align:start position:0%
want him living in California because
 
02:08:01.189 --> 02:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
that's where he can afford to live
 
02:08:02.930 --> 02:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
probably a bad example
 
02:08:04.310 --> 02:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
I would like him to be able to live in
 
02:08:06.350 --> 02:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
Dover just as I moved out of my parents
 
02:08:08.930 --> 02:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
basement and moved into an apartment in
 
02:08:10.970 --> 02:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
the community and and then bought a home
 
02:08:12.410 --> 02:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
in the community and raised my family
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
there I want the same for him so we try
 
02:08:18.109 --> 02:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
to personalize it and look at it not as
 
02:08:18.119 --> 02:08:19.010 align:start position:0%
to personalize it and look at it not as
a

02:08:19.010 --> 02:08:19.020 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:08:21.950 --> 02:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
a how do we encourage Outsiders to come
 
02:08:24.050 --> 02:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
but we recognize that we want to help
 
02:08:27.770 --> 02:08:27.780 align:start position:0%
provide an a way for our own Community
 
02:08:29.570 --> 02:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
to grow and stay in the community
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
whether they are empty nesters or
 
02:08:35.209 --> 02:08:35.219 align:start position:0%
starting out in the world
 
02:08:38.629 --> 02:08:38.639 align:start position:0%
so we recognize that density is a way to
 
02:08:42.109 --> 02:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
do that so we created about that same
 
02:08:44.629 --> 02:08:44.639 align:start position:0%
time a transfer of development rights
 
02:08:46.609 --> 02:08:46.619 align:start position:0%
ordinance and the transfer development
 
02:08:49.729 --> 02:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
rights ordinance idea is
 
02:08:52.490 --> 02:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
you want to preserve and protect open
 
02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:53.990 align:start position:0%
you want to preserve and protect open
space

02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
space
 
02:08:55.669 --> 02:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
and at the same time you don't want that
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
property in order to lose their
 
02:08:58.310 --> 02:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
development rights so they can then
 
02:09:00.950 --> 02:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
transfer them somewhere else so we
 
02:09:03.890 --> 02:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
identified at the time a mechanism and
 
02:09:05.570 --> 02:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
it was based upon the Spalding Turnpike
 
02:09:08.330 --> 02:09:08.340 align:start position:0%
which effectively bisects the community
 
02:09:11.570 --> 02:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
if if my hand is over right down the
 
02:09:13.189 --> 02:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
middle is the Smalling Turnpike and so
 
02:09:15.530 --> 02:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
the ordinance at the time said
 
02:09:18.410 --> 02:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
if you own land to the west of the
 
02:09:20.270 --> 02:09:20.280 align:start position:0%
Spalding that tended to be our more
 
02:09:24.229 --> 02:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
rurally designated zoning and land uses
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
if you own land there and choose to you
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
can provide the density to someone on
 
02:09:33.290 --> 02:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
the east side of the Spalding
 
02:09:35.810 --> 02:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
so there was typical underlying zoning
 
02:09:38.629 --> 02:09:38.639 align:start position:0%
density allowed Etc and you were able to
 
02:09:40.189 --> 02:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
take that and there was a formula that
 
02:09:41.290 --> 02:09:41.300 align:start position:0%
was created
 
02:09:44.149 --> 02:09:44.159 align:start position:0%
I like to say that I'm not an engineer
 
02:09:45.770 --> 02:09:45.780 align:start position:0%
because I don't do math I'm an architect
 
02:09:47.930 --> 02:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
for the same reason so the math on this
 
02:09:49.070 --> 02:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
was really bad
 
02:09:52.250 --> 02:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
but the formula allows you to go from A
 
02:09:53.629 --> 02:09:53.639 align:start position:0%
to B
 
02:09:55.570 --> 02:09:55.580 align:start position:0%
and that existed
 
02:09:58.609 --> 02:09:58.619 align:start position:0%
unutilized for eight years
 
02:10:01.250 --> 02:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
2018 we said okay we need to figure out
 
02:10:03.589 --> 02:10:03.599 align:start position:0%
a way to make this utilized and so we
 
02:10:06.109 --> 02:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
re-looked at it from the standpoint of
 
02:10:09.050 --> 02:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
land banking and we calculated the
 
02:10:12.410 --> 02:10:12.420 align:start position:0%
amount of money the city through its
 
02:10:14.890 --> 02:10:14.900 align:start position:0%
conservation efforts in in other ways
 
02:10:17.030 --> 02:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
had put
 
02:10:19.189 --> 02:10:19.199 align:start position:0%
land into conservation and protected it
 
02:10:21.470 --> 02:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
we calculated the value of that we
 
02:10:25.550 --> 02:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
calculated the cost per acre and we said
 
02:10:27.950 --> 02:10:27.960 align:start position:0%
you can reimburse the city and buy the
 
02:10:29.209 --> 02:10:29.219 align:start position:0%
development rights that the community
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
has bought again our mindset is that the
 
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
property owner has has development
 
02:10:35.930 --> 02:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
rights the city has development rights
 
02:10:38.030 --> 02:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
and the butters have development right
 
02:10:39.890 --> 02:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
so this was a way to take into account
 
02:10:42.229 --> 02:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
those two
 
02:10:44.330 --> 02:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
so at the time
 
02:10:47.089 --> 02:10:47.099 align:start position:0%
again this is 2018 we calculated that
 
02:10:49.729 --> 02:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
the city had spent thirteen thousand
 
02:10:52.310 --> 02:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
four hundred and two dollars per acre
 
02:10:56.390 --> 02:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
on land preservation so we said you can
 
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
buy density from the city
 
02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
and place it anywhere in their criteria
 
02:11:02.390 --> 02:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
it's not as blanket as
 
02:11:05.050 --> 02:11:05.060 align:start position:0%
we're going to go here it is a
 
02:11:07.970 --> 02:11:07.980 align:start position:0%
articulated zoning ordinance
 
02:11:10.370 --> 02:11:10.380 align:start position:0%
and we said we're going to allow this to
 
02:11:10.380 --> 02:11:11.510 align:start position:0%
and we said we're going to allow this to
occur

02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
occur
 
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
and then the design the design of
 
02:11:16.850 --> 02:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
affordability came up
 
02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
and so what we said was we want to
 
02:11:20.510 --> 02:11:20.520 align:start position:0%
encourage affordability in our master
 
02:11:22.910 --> 02:11:22.920 align:start position:0%
plan specifically said
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
set at the time and still says even
 
02:11:27.649 --> 02:11:27.659 align:start position:0%
though it's a newer chapter that smaller
 
02:11:29.870 --> 02:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
units are more desirable that we were
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
hearing from Millennials we were hearing
 
02:11:36.410 --> 02:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
from Baby Boomers we were hearing from
 
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
people that like myself and my wife that
 
02:11:40.189 --> 02:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
want to downsize
 
02:11:42.830 --> 02:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
that they want essentially the same
 
02:11:45.649 --> 02:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
thing they want places to hang their hat
 
02:11:47.930 --> 02:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
and to have experiences out of they they
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
are less inclined both of those age
 
02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
groups to want to
 
02:11:54.169 --> 02:11:54.179 align:start position:0%
paint the house every couple years fix
 
02:11:57.050 --> 02:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
the boiler worry about the the roof
 
02:11:58.189 --> 02:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
caving in
 
02:12:00.530 --> 02:12:00.540 align:start position:0%
mowing lawns they have other things they
 
02:12:01.850 --> 02:12:01.860 align:start position:0%
want to be doing with their time they
 
02:12:04.070 --> 02:12:04.080 align:start position:0%
want smaller unit
 
02:12:06.050 --> 02:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
thousand square foot was the the unit
 
02:12:08.570 --> 02:12:08.580 align:start position:0%
size that we had heard a lot of so we
 
02:12:12.550 --> 02:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:16.970 --> 02:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
13402 is the the general price however
 
02:12:19.729 --> 02:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
if you're willing to create a 1400
 
02:12:21.530 --> 02:12:21.540 align:start position:0%
square foot unit
 
02:12:23.990 --> 02:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
we will allow you to pay two-thirds that
 
02:12:26.089 --> 02:12:26.099 align:start position:0%
cost nine thousand dollars
 
02:12:28.129 --> 02:12:28.139 align:start position:0%
if you are willing to do a thousand
 
02:12:30.589 --> 02:12:30.599 align:start position:0%
square foot unit you can pay six
 
02:12:32.689 --> 02:12:32.699 align:start position:0%
thousand per
 
02:12:35.570 --> 02:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
the trade-off is those thousand and
 
02:12:38.330 --> 02:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
fourteen hundred square foot units are
 
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
deed restricted for no expansion
 
02:12:44.450 --> 02:12:44.460 align:start position:0%
no additional space
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
and the idea was when we looked at the
 
02:12:49.430 --> 02:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
market at the time there was a very
 
02:12:52.370 --> 02:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
different cost
 
02:12:55.970 --> 02:12:55.980 align:start position:0%
per square foot for homes that were a
 
02:12:58.129 --> 02:12:58.139 align:start position:0%
thousand or 1400 square feet they
 
02:13:00.350 --> 02:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
typically were
 
02:13:02.629 --> 02:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
um closer to the two and a quarter to
 
02:13:04.550 --> 02:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
three and a quarter price point
 
02:13:08.089 --> 02:13:08.099 align:start position:0%
then larger units the 2200 square foot
 
02:13:11.270 --> 02:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
2500 square foot much closer to the five
 
02:13:16.189 --> 02:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
550 entry point versus this desirable
 
02:13:16.199 --> 02:13:17.629 align:start position:0%
550 entry point versus this desirable
smaller

02:13:17.629 --> 02:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
smaller
 
02:13:20.089 --> 02:13:20.099 align:start position:0%
square footage
 
02:13:22.669 --> 02:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
so this seemed like a good idea and we
 
02:13:24.410 --> 02:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
were getting a lot of interest in the
 
02:13:26.629 --> 02:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
first year I think we raised over a
 
02:13:28.430 --> 02:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the conservation
 
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
fund through
 
02:13:32.089 --> 02:13:32.099 align:start position:0%
the selling of the density and locking
 
02:13:32.099 --> 02:13:33.109 align:start position:0%
the selling of the density and locking
in

02:13:33.109 --> 02:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:13:35.870 --> 02:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
the problem we found is the market
 
02:13:37.970 --> 02:13:37.980 align:start position:0%
and the market is a very good thing but
 
02:13:40.490 --> 02:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
it also likes to do what it wants to do
 
02:13:40.500 --> 02:13:42.290 align:start position:0%
it also likes to do what it wants to do
so

02:13:42.290 --> 02:13:42.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:45.470 --> 02:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
what happened was I would buy
 
02:13:47.990 --> 02:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
a development right and I would say I'm
 
02:13:49.729 --> 02:13:49.739 align:start position:0%
going to limit this to a thousand square
 
02:13:52.310 --> 02:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
feet or 1400 square feet
 
02:13:54.530 --> 02:13:54.540 align:start position:0%
and then I would start building my house
 
02:13:55.850 --> 02:13:55.860 align:start position:0%
and I would put it on the market and the
 
02:13:58.970 --> 02:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
market was so strong that someone would
 
02:14:01.729 --> 02:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
come along and offer to buy it and then
 
02:14:03.830 --> 02:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
they would say you know what
 
02:14:06.109 --> 02:14:06.119 align:start position:0%
I don't want Builder grade I want Cherry
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
cabinets I don't want laminate floor I
 
02:14:12.950 --> 02:14:12.960 align:start position:0%
want X floor I don't want formica I want
 
02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
Granite quartz name your countertop I
 
02:14:20.569 --> 02:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
don't want the 8 by 10 deck I want a 22
 
02:14:20.579 --> 02:14:21.950 align:start position:0%
don't want the 8 by 10 deck I want a 22
by

02:14:21.950 --> 02:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:14:26.089 --> 02:14:26.099 align:start position:0%
18 deck and all of a sudden those 1400
 
02:14:28.550 --> 02:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
square foot units which were listed on
 
02:14:29.870 --> 02:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
the market for three and a quarter we're
 
02:14:33.649 --> 02:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
selling for a 450 to 500 000.
 
02:14:35.870 --> 02:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
so we thought well
 
02:14:38.569 --> 02:14:38.579 align:start position:0%
on the one hand it the ordinance did
 
02:14:40.550 --> 02:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what we wanted to do it spurred
 
02:14:42.830 --> 02:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
increased growth it spurred smaller
 
02:14:44.510 --> 02:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
units but it was not getting the
 
02:14:46.609 --> 02:14:46.619 align:start position:0%
affordable aspect
 
02:14:49.069 --> 02:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
so we we met with Builders because one
 
02:14:51.890 --> 02:14:51.900 align:start position:0%
of the things that we have done in the
 
02:14:51.900 --> 02:14:52.810 align:start position:0%
of the things that we have done in the
community

02:14:52.810 --> 02:14:52.820 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:14:55.729 --> 02:14:55.739 align:start position:0%
since about when I started with the
 
02:14:58.370 --> 02:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
community is we have said look unless I
 
02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
win Powerball I'm not going to be a
 
02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:01.189 align:start position:0%
win Powerball I'm not going to be a
developer

02:15:01.189 --> 02:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
developer
 
02:15:03.169 --> 02:15:03.179 align:start position:0%
so that means that whether it's myself
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
the planning board the the zoning board
 
02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
or the the city council we can make
 
02:15:09.470 --> 02:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
regulations all we want but if we can't
 
02:15:11.870 --> 02:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
find people that want to use them why
 
02:15:13.490 --> 02:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
did we create these ordinances if
 
02:15:16.550 --> 02:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
they're not usable by the public by the
 
02:15:17.810 --> 02:15:17.820 align:start position:0%
landowner it's then their useless
 
02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:18.950 align:start position:0%
landowner it's then their useless
ordinances

02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
02:15:22.030 --> 02:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
so we we continually meet with
 
02:15:24.290 --> 02:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
development professionals whether they
 
02:15:27.729 --> 02:15:27.739 align:start position:0%
are developers attorneys
 
02:15:31.970 --> 02:15:31.980 align:start position:0%
Financial or surveyor Engineers we meet
 
02:15:33.410 --> 02:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
with them and say
 
02:15:36.229 --> 02:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
how would these actually get effectuated
 
02:15:38.689 --> 02:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
and through that we kept hearing time
 
02:15:40.609 --> 02:15:40.619 align:start position:0%
and time again there were two major
 
02:15:42.709 --> 02:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
things that drove the price of
 
02:15:44.870 --> 02:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
development from their standpoint one
 
02:15:47.689 --> 02:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
was time and one was money
 
02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
the longer the process the more they
 
02:15:52.970 --> 02:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
have to send an attorney to a meeting
 
02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
the longer that that occurs or the more
 
02:15:58.370 --> 02:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
costs they incur the more they pass that
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
on to the end user the second was the
 
02:16:04.250 --> 02:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
the cost so we looked at our fee
 
02:16:06.890 --> 02:16:06.900 align:start position:0%
structures and we said short of giving
 
02:16:09.109 --> 02:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
density and saying we don't there is no
 
02:16:11.810 --> 02:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
value to density which is a bad thing
 
02:16:13.430 --> 02:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
what can we do
 
02:16:17.030 --> 02:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
so we came up with a change in 2020
 
02:16:19.010 --> 02:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
that says
 
02:16:22.010 --> 02:16:22.020 align:start position:0%
those three layers still exist
 
02:16:25.609 --> 02:16:25.619 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted the 14 in the thousand
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
but we added a new layer which was HUD
 
02:16:31.490 --> 02:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
fair market restricted
 
02:16:34.250 --> 02:16:34.260 align:start position:0%
and we said if you are willing to build
 
02:16:35.509 --> 02:16:35.519 align:start position:0%
a unit
 
02:16:37.790 --> 02:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
and restrict the value to the HUD fair
 
02:16:39.650 --> 02:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
market value as published by New
 
02:16:41.450 --> 02:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing Finance in April of
 
02:16:42.650 --> 02:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
every year
 
02:16:47.330 --> 02:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
then there is no cost for that unit
 
02:16:49.790 --> 02:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
the difference the the distinction is
 
02:16:51.830 --> 02:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
similar to how the other units are deed
 
02:16:54.110 --> 02:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
restricted so they can't be below above
 
02:16:56.810 --> 02:16:56.820 align:start position:0%
14 or a thousand square feet in this
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
case the unit is is forever deeded as
 
02:17:03.770 --> 02:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh meeting needing to meet those targets
 
02:17:03.780 --> 02:17:05.030 align:start position:0%
uh meeting needing to meet those targets
and

02:17:05.030 --> 02:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:08.389 --> 02:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
unlike the other programs where we say
 
02:17:10.849 --> 02:17:10.859 align:start position:0%
whatever your your base density could
 
02:17:13.129 --> 02:17:13.139 align:start position:0%
have been let's say that this table is
 
02:17:16.250 --> 02:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
my lot and by the base zoning I could
 
02:17:19.370 --> 02:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
get eight units on it and I use the
 
02:17:20.990 --> 02:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
transfer development rights program to
 
02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
buy an additional three those three are
 
02:17:24.770 --> 02:17:24.780 align:start position:0%
the ones that would be restricted at the
 
02:17:26.770 --> 02:17:26.780 align:start position:0%
Thousand or the 1400 but the original
 
02:17:29.810 --> 02:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
what what my rights to to start with
 
02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
would be unrestricted and would have no
 
02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:35.209 align:start position:0%
would be unrestricted and would have no
impacts

02:17:35.209 --> 02:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
impacts
 
02:17:37.790 --> 02:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
in this case we said
 
02:17:39.290 --> 02:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
we're going to make that change
 
02:17:39.300 --> 02:17:40.310 align:start position:0%
we're going to make that change
different

02:17:40.310 --> 02:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
those eight units you could have gotten
 
02:17:44.810 --> 02:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
by right those also have to be
 
02:17:47.209 --> 02:17:47.219 align:start position:0%
deed restricted so the whole thing has
 
02:17:50.450 --> 02:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
to be restricted
 
02:17:52.730 --> 02:17:52.740 align:start position:0%
we've had one I think fairly public
 
02:17:56.030 --> 02:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
success with that uh on Back River Road
 
02:17:57.830 --> 02:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
in Dover we have a project called The
 
02:18:01.490 --> 02:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
Cottages the base density on the seven
 
02:18:04.310 --> 02:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
acre lot was nine units they're building
 
02:18:05.990 --> 02:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
44 units
 
02:18:09.110 --> 02:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
they are 400 square foot units
 
02:18:11.929 --> 02:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
they're one bedroom they are designed so
 
02:18:13.910 --> 02:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
that you have indoor and outdoor space
 
02:18:17.150 --> 02:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
they have Farmers porches they have an
 
02:18:20.150 --> 02:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
area where you will be able to have a
 
02:18:23.570 --> 02:18:23.580 align:start position:0%
fire pit and outdoor enjoyment they're
 
02:18:26.030 --> 02:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
based on a design around a common area
 
02:18:31.070 --> 02:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
so each one looks at the old style New
 
02:18:32.209 --> 02:18:32.219 align:start position:0%
England common
 
02:18:34.429 --> 02:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
they have parking that's set aside there
 
02:18:35.929 --> 02:18:35.939 align:start position:0%
are walking trails there's a community
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
building so that when you have a party
 
02:18:39.770 --> 02:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
where you need to fit more than four
 
02:18:41.810 --> 02:18:41.820 align:start position:0%
people in your your unit you can rent
 
02:18:43.610 --> 02:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
that similar to a club room that you
 
02:18:45.889 --> 02:18:45.899 align:start position:0%
might find in a a apartment or
 
02:18:47.629 --> 02:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
condominium building
 
02:18:49.370 --> 02:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
there is uh
 
02:18:51.770 --> 02:18:51.780 align:start position:0%
laundry facility there there no there's
 
02:18:53.929 --> 02:18:53.939 align:start position:0%
laundry facilities in each unit there's
 
02:18:56.450 --> 02:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
a gym I believe in that club room
 
02:19:00.169 --> 02:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
so the idea they had was we need to
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
to embrace this and that's their their
 
02:19:02.639 --> 02:19:04.070 align:start position:0%
to embrace this and that's their their
program

02:19:04.070 --> 02:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
since that project we have approved I
 
02:19:09.349 --> 02:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
believe five more projects with that
 
02:19:11.929 --> 02:19:11.939 align:start position:0%
same basic philosophy of developers
 
02:19:14.089 --> 02:19:14.099 align:start position:0%
property owners have said
 
02:19:16.669 --> 02:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
if I can lower my barrier to entry
 
02:19:20.389 --> 02:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
if I can reduce my upfront costs
 
02:19:21.950 --> 02:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
I'm more than willing to make these
 
02:19:24.049 --> 02:19:24.059 align:start position:0%
commitments because The Upfront costs
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
are what they're struggling to overcome
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
to get shovels on the ground they're
 
02:19:30.169 --> 02:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
comfortable that the strength of the
 
02:19:31.490 --> 02:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
market they will be able to rent the
 
02:19:34.250 --> 02:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
units they will be able to commit to the
 
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
unit occupation
 
02:19:39.110 --> 02:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
and get the the derivatives they need
 
02:19:40.969 --> 02:19:40.979 align:start position:0%
later on to
 
02:19:43.009 --> 02:19:43.019 align:start position:0%
carry the cost
 
02:19:45.169 --> 02:19:45.179 align:start position:0%
it's just that upfront cost that is is
 
02:19:47.030 --> 02:19:47.040 align:start position:0%
much more of a struggle particularly as
 
02:19:50.690 --> 02:19:50.700 align:start position:0%
interest rates have gone up and as the
 
02:19:54.050 --> 02:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
labor and lumber costs have gone up
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
so I would say that we have had success
 
02:20:00.950 --> 02:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
in this sort of changing the philosophy
 
02:20:02.570 --> 02:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
to say we're going to incentivize
 
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
density that is the the Avenue we took
 
02:20:08.210 --> 02:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
of we don't think it's fair to bang
 
02:20:10.310 --> 02:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
people over the head and say you have to
 
02:20:12.770 --> 02:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
do this but if we give people an option
 
02:20:15.410 --> 02:20:15.420 align:start position:0%
we give people an option that appeals to
 
02:20:17.570 --> 02:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
them and says we want you to be whole
 
02:20:17.580 --> 02:20:19.030 align:start position:0%
them and says we want you to be whole
too

02:20:19.030 --> 02:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
too
 
02:20:21.469 --> 02:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
there are the reason that that the home
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
builder is the reason that that the
 
02:20:25.010 --> 02:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
development Community builds is because
 
02:20:26.450 --> 02:20:26.460 align:start position:0%
that's their business
 
02:20:28.010 --> 02:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
and so they need to be respected for
 
02:20:29.330 --> 02:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
that and they need to be made hold at
 
02:20:30.530 --> 02:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
the same time
 
02:20:34.429 --> 02:20:34.439 align:start position:0%
we recognize that unfettered market is
 
02:20:36.530 --> 02:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
creating a scenario where affordability
 
02:20:40.550 --> 02:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
is a struggle and so to that regard we
 
02:20:42.650 --> 02:20:42.660 align:start position:0%
have found this this path to be working
 
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:47.330 --> 02:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much if you're going
 
02:20:49.010 --> 02:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
to lost a lot to think about
 
02:20:50.570 --> 02:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
um I have one question before I take
 
02:20:50.580 --> 02:20:51.290 align:start position:0%
um I have one question before I take
them

02:20:51.290 --> 02:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
um how is the increased density affected
 
02:20:55.849 --> 02:20:55.859 align:start position:0%
the stress on the community water sewer
 
02:20:57.770 --> 02:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
can you talk a little bit about that and
 
02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
if you've maybe put aside some extra
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
funding to reinforce
 
02:21:06.170 --> 02:21:06.180 align:start position:0%
um the extra use that it's getting
 
02:21:08.809 --> 02:21:08.819 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and I will say
 
02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
when I've gone to other communities and
 
02:21:12.469 --> 02:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
talked about this process the first
 
02:21:14.690 --> 02:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
thing I say is if you don't have water
 
02:21:16.730 --> 02:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
and sewer infrastructure density is the
 
02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:17.469 align:start position:0%
and sewer infrastructure density is the
biggest

02:21:17.469 --> 02:21:17.479 align:start position:0%
biggest
 
02:21:19.389 --> 02:21:19.399 align:start position:0%
concern you're going to have because
 
02:21:22.510 --> 02:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
lack of water and sewer infrastructure
 
02:21:25.610 --> 02:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
is what holds back most communities from
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
a density we are 80 of our community has
 
02:21:33.950 --> 02:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
water and sewer infrastructure we
 
02:21:37.550 --> 02:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
while we have agreed that the cost to
 
02:21:39.050 --> 02:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
buy the units is something we are
 
02:21:43.670 --> 02:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
willing to bring down we have not
 
02:21:46.730 --> 02:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
reduced our water sewer investment fees
 
02:21:50.090 --> 02:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
and we have not removed our impact fees
 
02:21:53.230 --> 02:21:53.240 align:start position:0%
so we have impact fees for school
 
02:21:57.950 --> 02:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
police fire and Recreation and so a
 
02:22:01.250 --> 02:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
single-family home in Dover it it is
 
02:22:04.250 --> 02:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
approximately fourteen thousand dollars
 
02:22:07.550 --> 02:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
of investment or impact fees per unit
 
02:22:11.450 --> 02:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
to come in the The Cottage units I
 
02:22:12.830 --> 02:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned are a little bit less because
 
02:22:14.389 --> 02:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
they they are one bedroom they're
 
02:22:15.650 --> 02:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
typically not going to generate
 
02:22:17.030 --> 02:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
school-aged children in the school
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
portion of our impact fees is the
 
02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
highest but the water sewer investment
 
02:22:24.110 --> 02:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
is specifically to address capacity
 
02:22:26.270 --> 02:22:26.280 align:start position:0%
issues and to allow us as a community to
 
02:22:28.250 --> 02:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
continue to invest in our infrastructure
 
02:22:31.070 --> 02:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
needs and make sure that the water and
 
02:22:33.530 --> 02:22:33.540 align:start position:0%
sewer infrastructure are in place and
 
02:22:35.650 --> 02:22:35.660 align:start position:0%
have you seen a
 
02:22:38.330 --> 02:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
obviously increase stress but have have
 
02:22:40.490 --> 02:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
those fees been able to
 
02:22:43.429 --> 02:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh balance with the The increased stress
 
02:22:45.770 --> 02:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
on the yes the the
 
02:22:47.870 --> 02:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
impacts have not been necessarily
 
02:22:50.389 --> 02:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
stressful they've been we've been aware
 
02:22:52.670 --> 02:22:52.680 align:start position:0%
of them but the fees are put in place
 
02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
and our Capital Improvements program is
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
designed to anticipate that growth
 
02:22:58.910 --> 02:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
02:23:02.750 --> 02:23:02.760 align:start position:0%
we do not take on off-site impacts or
 
02:23:04.610 --> 02:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
take that off the table for you so if
 
02:23:06.830 --> 02:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
you're a property owner that that 44
 
02:23:08.510 --> 02:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
unit uh
 
02:23:11.270 --> 02:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
project that I mentioned they had to
 
02:23:13.610 --> 02:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
make water and sewer upgrades to the
 
02:23:15.590 --> 02:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
lines in their area to make sure they
 
02:23:17.030 --> 02:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
could accommodate
 
02:23:20.210 --> 02:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
that we could accommodate the the needs
 
02:23:22.130 --> 02:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
it was a it's a back and forth
 
02:23:24.469 --> 02:23:24.479 align:start position:0%
conversation but through the Capital
 
02:23:26.090 --> 02:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
Improvements program we are trying to
 
02:23:27.889 --> 02:23:27.899 align:start position:0%
anticipate continued growth and
 
02:23:27.899 --> 02:23:29.270 align:start position:0%
anticipate continued growth and
direction

02:23:29.270 --> 02:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
direction
 
02:23:31.010 --> 02:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
great thank you representative Rudy
 
02:23:33.170 --> 02:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I think you stole
 
02:23:36.469 --> 02:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
my question however uh my question was
 
02:23:38.570 --> 02:23:38.580 align:start position:0%
to include uh your permitting your
 
02:23:41.809 --> 02:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
permitting fees your building permits
 
02:23:44.050 --> 02:23:44.060 align:start position:0%
and all that your fire
 
02:23:47.570 --> 02:23:47.580 align:start position:0%
school fire of course the water and
 
02:23:51.349 --> 02:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
sewer that's all in it you mentioned
 
02:23:55.010 --> 02:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
fourteen thousand for a single family
 
02:23:57.590 --> 02:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
what about the 40 unit building and
 
02:24:01.130 --> 02:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
excuse me and let's include the actual
 
02:24:03.230 --> 02:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
cost of the permits that does not
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
include any building permit or
 
02:24:09.830 --> 02:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
entitlement fees so if you think about
 
02:24:13.309 --> 02:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
it the average cost for that project the
 
02:24:15.650 --> 02:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
44 unit project
 
02:24:15.660 --> 02:24:16.490 align:start position:0%
44 unit project
um

02:24:16.490 --> 02:24:16.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:18.889 --> 02:24:18.899 align:start position:0%
they probably our site our site plan
 
02:24:21.530 --> 02:24:21.540 align:start position:0%
review fees are capped at 10 000 per
 
02:24:21.540 --> 02:24:22.550 align:start position:0%
review fees are capped at 10 000 per
project

02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
so they they paid a uh the site plan
 
02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
review fees to go through the
 
02:24:30.170 --> 02:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
entitlement process and then they paid
 
02:24:33.230 --> 02:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
any inspection fees those fees the
 
02:24:36.050 --> 02:24:36.060 align:start position:0%
entitlement review fees as well as the
 
02:24:38.090 --> 02:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
inspection fees whether they be site
 
02:24:40.849 --> 02:24:40.859 align:start position:0%
inspections in the engineering office or
 
02:24:43.969 --> 02:24:43.979 align:start position:0%
the fire Life Safety or building
 
02:24:46.910 --> 02:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
inspection fees those are all going into
 
02:24:50.450 --> 02:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
the operating fund to help maintain the
 
02:24:52.429 --> 02:24:52.439 align:start position:0%
costs associated with the service it's a
 
02:24:54.110 --> 02:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
fee for service model
 
02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
so we do not
 
02:24:58.429 --> 02:24:58.439 align:start position:0%
remove those fees or ameliorate those
 
02:25:00.230 --> 02:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
fees those fees are the fees they are
 
02:25:03.770 --> 02:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
what we do is when you come in the
 
02:25:05.929 --> 02:25:05.939 align:start position:0%
initial conversation with us we give you
 
02:25:07.490 --> 02:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
an estimate of what we think those fees
 
02:25:09.290 --> 02:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
are going to be so you can build those
 
02:25:11.630 --> 02:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
into your proforma because we do not
 
02:25:13.790 --> 02:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
want you to get down the road and then
 
02:25:15.950 --> 02:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
say wait a second I didn't realize I was
 
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
going to have to pay this
 
02:25:19.670 --> 02:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
so we have gotten very Adept over the
 
02:25:22.309 --> 02:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
past 10 years that I don't want to waste
 
02:25:23.750 --> 02:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
my time so I don't want to have
 
02:25:25.429 --> 02:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
conversations that sound great and then
 
02:25:27.469 --> 02:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
have someone come along and say oh I
 
02:25:28.610 --> 02:25:28.620 align:start position:0%
can't afford this
 
02:25:31.190 --> 02:25:31.200 align:start position:0%
so we make sure it's upfront what those
 
02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
costs are and and again we are at a um
 
02:25:38.330 --> 02:25:38.340 align:start position:0%
we have an application fee a 200
 
02:25:40.370 --> 02:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
application fee and then it is footage
 
02:25:43.010 --> 02:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
for multi-family or by unit for single
 
02:25:45.770 --> 02:25:45.780 align:start position:0%
family the the entitlement review costs
 
02:25:46.910 --> 02:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
and then the building permit review
 
02:25:49.190 --> 02:25:49.200 align:start position:0%
costs are based on a couple locations
 
02:25:52.670 --> 02:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
where your town spoke on this project
 
02:25:56.750 --> 02:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
so the initial density for that unit for
 
02:25:58.730 --> 02:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
the Cottages would have allowed I think
 
02:26:01.969 --> 02:26:01.979 align:start position:0%
you said nine units so did they buy the
 
02:26:04.610 --> 02:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
development rights that got about three
 
02:26:06.469 --> 02:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
questions did they buy the development
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
rights to gain the extra 36 units by
 
02:26:14.030 --> 02:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
agreeing to do the HUD rental rate
 
02:26:15.889 --> 02:26:15.899 align:start position:0%
they effectively bought it but there was
 
02:26:20.090 --> 02:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:24.290 --> 02:26:24.300 align:start position:0%
talked about follow-up capping the size
 
02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
of buildings so
 
02:26:29.809 --> 02:26:29.819 align:start position:0%
are you also capping the size of those
 
02:26:31.910 --> 02:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
Cottages so that they can't come back
 
02:26:34.250 --> 02:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
later in one ad for an addition off the
 
02:26:35.809 --> 02:26:35.819 align:start position:0%
side or so forth
 
02:26:38.570 --> 02:26:38.580 align:start position:0%
they are capped at 600 square feet so in
 
02:26:40.670 --> 02:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
this case they are building 400 they're
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
capped at six the layout for those
 
02:26:45.170 --> 02:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
specific ones are such that they will
 
02:26:48.050 --> 02:26:48.060 align:start position:0%
probably not meet the building code if
 
02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
they do any enlargement we did have them
 
02:26:54.070 --> 02:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
build in some storage space off the rear
 
02:26:56.570 --> 02:26:56.580 align:start position:0%
from an aesthetic standpoint we
 
02:26:59.870 --> 02:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
recognize that people have things and we
 
02:27:01.309 --> 02:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to be able to like bikes and
 
02:27:02.990 --> 02:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
things like that so we wanted to
 
02:27:05.630 --> 02:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
encourage them and I should
 
02:27:08.590 --> 02:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
should clarify in case it's not clear
 
02:27:12.050 --> 02:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
the 600 the thousand and the 1400 is
 
02:27:13.490 --> 02:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
conditioned space
 
02:27:16.490 --> 02:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
so the spaces might be larger
 
02:27:19.130 --> 02:27:19.140 align:start position:0%
because if it's unconditioned
 
02:27:19.140 --> 02:27:20.510 align:start position:0%
because if it's unconditioned
us

02:27:20.510 --> 02:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
us
 
02:27:20.520 --> 02:27:21.650 align:start position:0%
us
um

02:27:21.650 --> 02:27:21.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:24.610 --> 02:27:24.620 align:start position:0%
basement crawl space an attic
 
02:27:26.809 --> 02:27:26.819 align:start position:0%
ventilation those sort of things those
 
02:27:29.330 --> 02:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
do not count it is conditioned usable
 
02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
space that is the cap and finally one
 
02:27:32.220 --> 02:27:32.990 align:start position:0%
space that is the cap and finally one
more

02:27:32.990 --> 02:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:27:36.889 --> 02:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
so as I read about those Lofts and
 
02:27:40.610 --> 02:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
the the cottages and it talks about I'm
 
02:27:43.670 --> 02:27:43.680 align:start position:0%
assuming there's a bedroom a grade
 
02:27:45.849 --> 02:27:45.859 align:start position:0%
but there's also a loft upstairs
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
so you told me that you know this is
 
02:27:53.710 --> 02:27:53.720 align:start position:0%
primarily you know a couple or a person
 
02:27:59.030 --> 02:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
but then the worrisome item for
 
02:28:03.290 --> 02:28:03.300 align:start position:0%
Town fathers is that they will grow the
 
02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
family and you'll have the second
 
02:28:08.270 --> 02:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
bedroom upstairs is that Captain anyway
 
02:28:10.969 --> 02:28:10.979 align:start position:0%
it's not and when those when that was
 
02:28:12.110 --> 02:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
going through the entitlement project
 
02:28:14.630 --> 02:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
the state had not
 
02:28:17.090 --> 02:28:17.100 align:start position:0%
um adopted schedule Q of the building
 
02:28:19.309 --> 02:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
code which is specifically targeted
 
02:28:19.319 --> 02:28:20.750 align:start position:0%
code which is specifically targeted
towards

02:28:20.750 --> 02:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
towards
 
02:28:23.510 --> 02:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
what the market likes to call tiny homes
 
02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
and so it in our mind
 
02:28:27.080 --> 02:28:28.849 align:start position:0%
and so it in our mind
those

02:28:28.849 --> 02:28:28.859 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:28:31.730 --> 02:28:31.740 align:start position:0%
Loft areas were unconditioned space they
 
02:28:33.230 --> 02:28:33.240 align:start position:0%
were being provided as additional
 
02:28:35.090 --> 02:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
storage space and the way that they are
 
02:28:36.429 --> 02:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
laid out
 
02:28:39.170 --> 02:28:39.180 align:start position:0%
it's not full Headroom
 
02:28:41.870 --> 02:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
so we our agreement with them is that
 
02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
these are one bedroom units so we
 
02:28:46.070 --> 02:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
through a development agreement process
 
02:28:48.830 --> 02:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
locked that in because we wanted to make
 
02:28:51.490 --> 02:28:51.500 align:start position:0%
sure that there was no bait and switch
 
02:28:54.590 --> 02:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
conversation we have our end up hold the
 
02:28:56.990 --> 02:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
developer has their end to uphold
 
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
if I could just ask and what is the what
 
02:29:03.530 --> 02:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
is the HUD rate for that rental unit
 
02:29:07.030 --> 02:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
when they were approved it was I believe
 
02:29:08.809 --> 02:29:08.819 align:start position:0%
990 dollars
 
02:29:11.809 --> 02:29:11.819 align:start position:0%
a month and it is now closer to twelve
 
02:29:14.510 --> 02:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a month with utilities
 
02:29:18.290 --> 02:29:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh the utility I believe the electric is
 
02:29:20.210 --> 02:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
included but water sewer is not included
 
02:29:22.010 --> 02:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for the
 
02:29:22.020 --> 02:29:23.389 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you for the
courtesy

02:29:23.389 --> 02:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
courtesy
 
02:29:26.630 --> 02:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
of course representative Gibbs thank you
 
02:29:29.150 --> 02:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
um uh I have two questions
 
02:29:31.010 --> 02:29:31.020 align:start position:0%
um uh first
 
02:29:33.410 --> 02:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
um am I correct in assuming that in
 
02:29:35.030 --> 02:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
addition to the fees that you've
 
02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:36.230 align:start position:0%
addition to the fees that you've
described

02:29:36.230 --> 02:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
described
 
02:29:39.950 --> 02:29:39.960 align:start position:0%
um is the city also receiving uh
 
02:29:43.130 --> 02:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
substantially higher property taxes uh
 
02:29:45.650 --> 02:29:45.660 align:start position:0%
for the developed properties then you're
 
02:29:47.690 --> 02:29:47.700 align:start position:0%
receiving before
 
02:29:50.389 --> 02:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
certainly when land is developed the tax
 
02:29:52.610 --> 02:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
evaluation does change and so that is
 
02:29:54.410 --> 02:29:54.420 align:start position:0%
something we're aware of but we do not
 
02:29:57.230 --> 02:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
calculate it as part of the process
 
02:29:58.910 --> 02:29:58.920 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
02:30:01.370 --> 02:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
um but does that assist in
 
02:30:01.380 --> 02:30:02.030 align:start position:0%
um but does that assist in
in

02:30:02.030 --> 02:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:30:04.370 --> 02:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
um addressing any for instance Water and
 
02:30:07.370 --> 02:30:07.380 align:start position:0%
Sewer issues so the water and sewer uh
 
02:30:09.770 --> 02:30:09.780 align:start position:0%
our Enterprise fund so they are again
 
02:30:12.050 --> 02:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
user fees so if there is water sewer
 
02:30:14.990 --> 02:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
usage that is accounted for from an
 
02:30:17.510 --> 02:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
operating budget standpoint yes we do
 
02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
anticipate that increased valuation will
 
02:30:23.690 --> 02:30:23.700 align:start position:0%
help cover the general Municipal cost
 
02:30:26.809 --> 02:30:26.819 align:start position:0%
police response fire response Etc that
 
02:30:29.870 --> 02:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
may be generated one thing that is of
 
02:30:29.880 --> 02:30:30.650 align:start position:0%
may be generated one thing that is of
note

02:30:30.650 --> 02:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
note
 
02:30:34.550 --> 02:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
and and I'm I'm using the the cottage
 
02:30:36.349 --> 02:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
project but it would apply to any
 
02:30:38.450 --> 02:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
similar in that case one of the things
 
02:30:41.150 --> 02:30:41.160 align:start position:0%
we negotiated with the the property
 
02:30:42.889 --> 02:30:42.899 align:start position:0%
owner was through the development
 
02:30:45.230 --> 02:30:45.240 align:start position:0%
process was that it would remain as a
 
02:30:45.240 --> 02:30:46.490 align:start position:0%
process was that it would remain as a
single

02:30:46.490 --> 02:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
single
 
02:30:49.969 --> 02:30:49.979 align:start position:0%
entity uh governing we didn't want to
 
02:30:53.090 --> 02:30:53.100 align:start position:0%
have 44 new water and sewer users we
 
02:30:55.130 --> 02:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
wanted to have one entity that was going
 
02:30:57.230 --> 02:30:57.240 align:start position:0%
to be making sure the payments were made
 
02:30:59.690 --> 02:30:59.700 align:start position:0%
at the same time from a life safety
 
02:31:01.070 --> 02:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
standpoint we wanted to make sure there
 
02:31:04.030 --> 02:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
was one entity that was plowing and
 
02:31:05.929 --> 02:31:05.939 align:start position:0%
making sure that there were no
 
02:31:09.349 --> 02:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
obstructions for response as opposed to
 
02:31:13.190 --> 02:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
having to deal with 44 individuals thank
 
02:31:13.200 --> 02:31:14.030 align:start position:0%
having to deal with 44 individuals thank
you

02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:31:15.770 --> 02:31:15.780 align:start position:0%
um and my second question is I hope
 
02:31:15.780 --> 02:31:17.150 align:start position:0%
um and my second question is I hope
simpler

02:31:17.150 --> 02:31:17.160 align:start position:0%
simpler
 
02:31:19.610 --> 02:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
um uh I found
 
02:31:23.150 --> 02:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
um uh your development incentive really
 
02:31:25.250 --> 02:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
very interesting
 
02:31:28.250 --> 02:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
um and I would like to
 
02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
um be able to read a copy of your
 
02:31:32.809 --> 02:31:32.819 align:start position:0%
current transfer development rights
 
02:31:35.929 --> 02:31:35.939 align:start position:0%
ordinance would it be possible for you
 
02:31:39.469 --> 02:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
to send that ordinance or link to that
 
02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
ordinance to the committee members by
 
02:31:45.650 --> 02:31:45.660 align:start position:0%
email absolutely we have uh I have it in
 
02:31:47.630 --> 02:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
two forms and I'll send both I guess to
 
02:31:50.090 --> 02:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander did you have a
 
02:31:52.330 --> 02:31:52.340 align:start position:0%
special email
 
02:31:54.530 --> 02:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
to you it's House special Committee of
 
02:31:56.270 --> 02:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
housing great I I can certainly send
 
02:31:58.010 --> 02:31:58.020 align:start position:0%
that out this afternoon
 
02:32:00.950 --> 02:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
um it'll be twofold one the a link to
 
02:32:04.309 --> 02:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
the PDF of the the ordinance itself and
 
02:32:05.929 --> 02:32:05.939 align:start position:0%
then we have an information sheet that
 
02:32:08.030 --> 02:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
we developed hopefully putting some of
 
02:32:10.969 --> 02:32:10.979 align:start position:0%
it in layman's terms uh to help explain
 
02:32:13.010 --> 02:32:13.020 align:start position:0%
the processes and the opportunities
 
02:32:15.469 --> 02:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
thank you that would be very helpful
 
02:32:17.990 --> 02:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
great representative Walsh
 
02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
yep thank you Mr chair thanks for coming
 
02:32:21.590 --> 02:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
it is an interesting sounding ordinance
 
02:32:24.110 --> 02:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
uh aside front she asked the two things
 
02:32:25.630 --> 02:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
I wanted to as far as more information
 
02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
on top of the PDF and the Layman's
 
02:32:31.610 --> 02:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
version any images or anything else you
 
02:32:32.929 --> 02:32:32.939 align:start position:0%
can provide just to give people a sense
 
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
of it sure I can provide the
 
02:32:38.389 --> 02:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
what we call the yield plan which is the
 
02:32:41.210 --> 02:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
here's what you could have done plan and
 
02:32:42.950 --> 02:32:42.960 align:start position:0%
then the here's what they did do plan
 
02:32:45.770 --> 02:32:45.780 align:start position:0%
we've got a couple different projects
 
02:32:47.809 --> 02:32:47.819 align:start position:0%
that we could probably look at getting
 
02:32:47.819 --> 02:32:48.590 align:start position:0%
that we could probably look at getting
you

02:32:48.590 --> 02:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:32:52.370 --> 02:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
we also have this was one of those we
 
02:32:56.030 --> 02:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:58.070 --> 02:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
planning board
 
02:33:00.410 --> 02:33:00.420 align:start position:0%
review takes one meeting
 
02:33:02.690 --> 02:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
so we work the staff Works behind the
 
02:33:05.570 --> 02:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
scenes with the applicant
 
02:33:09.050 --> 02:33:09.060 align:start position:0%
maybe two months but then it is a one
 
02:33:10.429 --> 02:33:10.439 align:start position:0%
meeting presentation of the planning
 
02:33:11.809 --> 02:33:11.819 align:start position:0%
board this was actually a two meeting
 
02:33:13.610 --> 02:33:13.620 align:start position:0%
and I was glad it was a two because it
 
02:33:17.270 --> 02:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
was a good opportunity for the developer
 
02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
and the staff to to walk the public
 
02:33:20.450 --> 02:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
through not just the board members
 
02:33:22.070 --> 02:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
through but the public through this
 
02:33:24.230 --> 02:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity that was before us
 
02:33:27.170 --> 02:33:27.180 align:start position:0%
the partners the the developers they
 
02:33:30.349 --> 02:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
produced I think some great examples of
 
02:33:30.359 --> 02:33:31.630 align:start position:0%
produced I think some great examples of
renderings

02:33:31.630 --> 02:33:31.640 align:start position:0%
renderings
 
02:33:34.510 --> 02:33:34.520 align:start position:0%
of balloon test examples of things
 
02:33:36.950 --> 02:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
because people heard high density and
 
02:33:38.750 --> 02:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
they assumed it was much different than
 
02:33:41.090 --> 02:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
than what it is so I'll provide those as
 
02:33:42.830 --> 02:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
well because I think that was really
 
02:33:45.889 --> 02:33:45.899 align:start position:0%
helpful for people to think it's not
 
02:33:47.929 --> 02:33:47.939 align:start position:0%
people like to use the term tiny house
 
02:33:49.670 --> 02:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
and the reason I use Cottages is because
 
02:33:52.370 --> 02:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
we all see the HGTV idea of a tiny house
 
02:33:54.050 --> 02:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
and that's not what these are
 
02:33:56.510 --> 02:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
in some ways it's getting back to a more
 
02:33:56.520 --> 02:33:58.309 align:start position:0%
in some ways it's getting back to a more
basic

02:33:58.309 --> 02:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
basic
 
02:34:01.309 --> 02:34:01.319 align:start position:0%
um living space that that really meets
 
02:34:02.809 --> 02:34:02.819 align:start position:0%
your needs as opposed to your wants
 
02:34:05.570 --> 02:34:05.580 align:start position:0%
because folks that are needing to afford
 
02:34:07.010 --> 02:34:07.020 align:start position:0%
this that is what they're trying to
 
02:34:09.710 --> 02:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
achieve is their basic needs
 
02:34:09.720 --> 02:34:13.010 align:start position:0%
achieve is their basic needs
representative

02:34:13.010 --> 02:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:15.250 --> 02:34:15.260 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking questions
 
02:34:15.260 --> 02:34:15.590 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking questions
[Music]

02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:16.929 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:34:16.929 --> 02:34:16.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:21.950 --> 02:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
my concern as I'm I was hearing the uh
 
02:34:24.110 --> 02:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
what was going on in in
 
02:34:27.710 --> 02:34:27.720 align:start position:0%
your situation was kind of like we
 
02:34:31.010 --> 02:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
agreed or we negotiated or
 
02:34:33.650 --> 02:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
um we came to an agreement about
 
02:34:35.929 --> 02:34:35.939 align:start position:0%
X like the you know it was going to be
 
02:34:39.290 --> 02:34:39.300 align:start position:0%
all owned by one person or whatever and
 
02:34:39.300 --> 02:34:41.510 align:start position:0%
all owned by one person or whatever and
that

02:34:41.510 --> 02:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:34:44.650 --> 02:34:44.660 align:start position:0%
brings the question of how reproducible
 
02:34:47.210 --> 02:34:47.220 align:start position:0%
is this
 
02:34:49.910 --> 02:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
um situation is this kind of a one-off
 
02:34:52.070 --> 02:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
if you have to make certain agreements
 
02:34:54.590 --> 02:34:54.600 align:start position:0%
for it or how much was
 
02:34:58.130 --> 02:34:58.140 align:start position:0%
um just following what was in this
 
02:35:00.410 --> 02:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
um ordinance that you gave me or that
 
02:35:01.910 --> 02:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to provide for to the
 
02:35:01.920 --> 02:35:02.990 align:start position:0%
you're going to provide for to the
committee

02:35:02.990 --> 02:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:35:05.389 --> 02:35:05.399 align:start position:0%
that's just like you know boilerplate
 
02:35:07.790 --> 02:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
anyone could have done this exact same
 
02:35:09.530 --> 02:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
thing and
 
02:35:11.990 --> 02:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
um you know can you kind of talk about
 
02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
like is there was there variances was
 
02:35:17.630 --> 02:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
there you know
 
02:35:21.290 --> 02:35:21.300 align:start position:0%
um hurdles that you still saw that would
 
02:35:23.570 --> 02:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
make it hard to reproduce the same type
 
02:35:25.610 --> 02:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
of thing elsewhere thank you
 
02:35:25.620 --> 02:35:27.410 align:start position:0%
of thing elsewhere thank you
so

02:35:27.410 --> 02:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:30.950 --> 02:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
I am a big purveyor of the idea that
 
02:35:33.530 --> 02:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
rules are meant to be Rewritten
 
02:35:36.230 --> 02:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
and that something that was written in
 
02:35:39.530 --> 02:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
1948 which is when Dover adopted zoning
 
02:35:42.889 --> 02:35:42.899 align:start position:0%
it very rarely should it be the same in
 
02:35:46.309 --> 02:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
2023 I have a copy of the 1948 zoning
 
02:35:47.570 --> 02:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
ordinance and there are things that are
 
02:35:49.790 --> 02:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
still in there
 
02:35:53.630 --> 02:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
but the idea was we want to learn from
 
02:35:55.969 --> 02:35:55.979 align:start position:0%
the the current trends we want to learn
 
02:35:58.090 --> 02:35:58.100 align:start position:0%
from the past and we want to learn from
 
02:36:01.610 --> 02:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
what our stakeholders are telling us
 
02:36:05.030 --> 02:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
to that extent it's been written
 
02:36:07.429 --> 02:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
so that it can be transferable because
 
02:36:09.410 --> 02:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
we want to be sharing with with other
 
02:36:11.990 --> 02:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
community members uh the the planning
 
02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
director uh Donna Benton who
 
02:36:15.070 --> 02:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately could not be here today
 
02:36:16.969 --> 02:36:16.979 align:start position:0%
she is the president of the New
 
02:36:19.490 --> 02:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire planners Association and she
 
02:36:21.230 --> 02:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
thinks of things from the standpoint of
 
02:36:22.849 --> 02:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
we need to be sharing
 
02:36:25.370 --> 02:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
so the ordinance itself I think is
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
highly transferable
 
02:36:31.190 --> 02:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
it is a search and replace Dover for x
 
02:36:33.410 --> 02:36:33.420 align:start position:0%
the other portions
 
02:36:35.630 --> 02:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
I think are
 
02:36:38.030 --> 02:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be transferable in the sense
 
02:36:41.270 --> 02:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
that your community and its reaction to
 
02:36:44.510 --> 02:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
a site plan or a subdivision plan needs
 
02:36:46.130 --> 02:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
to be calibrated to your community as
 
02:36:48.889 --> 02:36:48.899 align:start position:0%
opposed to what dover's was I mentioned
 
02:36:50.750 --> 02:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:36:50.760 --> 02:36:51.710 align:start position:0%
the the
um

02:36:51.710 --> 02:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance and the snow plowing and
 
02:36:55.370 --> 02:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
things like that the fire chief was the
 
02:36:56.929 --> 02:36:56.939 align:start position:0%
one that said
 
02:36:59.150 --> 02:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
at one point the layout they were going
 
02:37:01.790 --> 02:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
to have to lose 10 units because they
 
02:37:04.190 --> 02:37:04.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't meet the fire code of distance
 
02:37:08.210 --> 02:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
between where the the access way is to
 
02:37:10.190 --> 02:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
the front door of the unit
 
02:37:12.590 --> 02:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
the fire chief came in and said I
 
02:37:14.450 --> 02:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
understand how important this is
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
let's think creatively
 
02:37:17.870 --> 02:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
and we looked at it and he said if you
 
02:37:19.910 --> 02:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
did this and this and we did this and
 
02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:21.349 align:start position:0%
did this and this and we did this and
this

02:37:21.349 --> 02:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:37:23.330 --> 02:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
you can get those 10 units
 
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
but in order for us to feel comfortable
 
02:37:28.429 --> 02:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
with that we need you to say we're not
 
02:37:30.290 --> 02:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
going to leave it up to the individual
 
02:37:32.270 --> 02:37:32.280 align:start position:0%
tenants to shovel their walkway in the
 
02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:33.170 align:start position:0%
tenants to shovel their walkway in the
winter

02:37:33.170 --> 02:37:33.180 align:start position:0%
winter
 
02:37:36.889 --> 02:37:36.899 align:start position:0%
we want a
 
02:37:39.410 --> 02:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
a agreement that you are going to as the
 
02:37:41.630 --> 02:37:41.640 align:start position:0%
management company do this the company
 
02:37:43.610 --> 02:37:43.620 align:start position:0%
said we take pride in ownership and we
 
02:37:44.570 --> 02:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
don't want
 
02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
to see dishevelment either so it works
 
02:37:48.830 --> 02:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
for us
 
02:37:50.570 --> 02:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
those sorts of things are in a
 
02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
development agreement which is easily
 
02:37:54.770 --> 02:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
templatable and and we've shared both
 
02:37:56.450 --> 02:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
the ordinance the development agreement
 
02:37:58.550 --> 02:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
as well as other aspects of the lease
 
02:38:01.429 --> 02:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
the lease agreement that that is part of
 
02:38:04.070 --> 02:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
the approval which says number one an
 
02:38:05.690 --> 02:38:05.700 align:start position:0%
improvement on the site to provide
 
02:38:08.090 --> 02:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
visitor parking and the leases say if
 
02:38:09.710 --> 02:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
you have a visitor this is the visitor
 
02:38:12.550 --> 02:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
parking space not over here
 
02:38:15.830 --> 02:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
the this was one I I felt unfortunate
 
02:38:15.840 --> 02:38:16.790 align:start position:0%
the this was one I I felt unfortunate
about

02:38:16.790 --> 02:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:38:19.070 --> 02:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
the initial plan had a community garden
 
02:38:20.750 --> 02:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
that was going to go in the front of the
 
02:38:23.150 --> 02:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
property along the main road the
 
02:38:24.650 --> 02:38:24.660 align:start position:0%
neighbor said that they did not want
 
02:38:28.190 --> 02:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
that that they were against that because
 
02:38:30.349 --> 02:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
they assumed that it would be positive
 
02:38:31.849 --> 02:38:31.859 align:start position:0%
in the beginning and then people would
 
02:38:33.290 --> 02:38:33.300 align:start position:0%
lose interest and it would look
 
02:38:35.870 --> 02:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
overgrown and weedy the developer said
 
02:38:37.670 --> 02:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
that they would not include that
 
02:38:40.969 --> 02:38:40.979 align:start position:0%
component the developer originally
 
02:38:43.190 --> 02:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
talked about doing solar panels
 
02:38:45.230 --> 02:38:45.240 align:start position:0%
and to help offset
 
02:38:47.870 --> 02:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
electric cost the neighbors said they
 
02:38:49.790 --> 02:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to see solar panels solar
 
02:38:50.990 --> 02:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
panels are
 
02:38:53.929 --> 02:38:53.939 align:start position:0%
ugly just like Community Gardens are and
 
02:38:56.929 --> 02:38:56.939 align:start position:0%
so they reworked the layout to address
 
02:38:56.939 --> 02:38:57.889 align:start position:0%
so they reworked the layout to address
that

02:38:57.889 --> 02:38:57.899 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:39:01.490 --> 02:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
the biggest butter that that uh came out
 
02:39:03.410 --> 02:39:03.420 align:start position:0%
was ironically the person that sold the
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
property to
 
02:39:08.750 --> 02:39:08.760 align:start position:0%
the property or the developer who
 
02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
did not think that the the density was
 
02:39:12.530 --> 02:39:12.540 align:start position:0%
going to be as high as it was and they
 
02:39:13.910 --> 02:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
came out and they said we want more
 
02:39:15.170 --> 02:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
money which the planning board
 
02:39:19.150 --> 02:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
thankfully said that is not our purview
 
02:39:19.160 --> 02:39:20.750 align:start position:0%
thankfully said that is not our purview
and

02:39:20.750 --> 02:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:39:24.710 --> 02:39:24.720 align:start position:0%
he wanted he wanted a different curb cut
 
02:39:26.270 --> 02:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
for his own house because his house was
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
next door and they were able to to work
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
that in and work a couple things in what
 
02:39:33.950 --> 02:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
I'm getting at is in every case there
 
02:39:36.469 --> 02:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
was going to be a butter mitigation
 
02:39:39.410 --> 02:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
the the density conversation comes into
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
play because one of our criteria is it
 
02:39:45.290 --> 02:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
has to be the density has to be
 
02:39:47.150 --> 02:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
in keeping with the density and
 
02:39:50.570 --> 02:39:50.580 align:start position:0%
intensity of the neighboring lot so the
 
02:39:52.969 --> 02:39:52.979 align:start position:0%
in order to get the ordinance the
 
02:39:56.210 --> 02:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
property owner has to show that these
 
02:39:57.410 --> 02:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
are not going to stand out like a sore
 
02:39:59.630 --> 02:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
thumb in the example we typically use is
 
02:40:01.610 --> 02:40:01.620 align:start position:0%
if you have a single family neighborhood
 
02:40:02.929 --> 02:40:02.939 align:start position:0%
and someone came in and they said we're
 
02:40:06.170 --> 02:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
going to put in a a 10 10 unit single
 
02:40:06.180 --> 02:40:06.950 align:start position:0%
going to put in a a 10 10 unit single
building

02:40:06.950 --> 02:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
building
 
02:40:09.650 --> 02:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
that would not be keeping with the
 
02:40:11.690 --> 02:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
spirit and intent of the neighborhood in
 
02:40:15.770 --> 02:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
this case there were singles duplex and
 
02:40:18.010 --> 02:40:18.020 align:start position:0%
triplexes all within
 
02:40:22.250 --> 02:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
uh the I believe it's 250 foot in either
 
02:40:22.260 --> 02:40:24.050 align:start position:0%
uh the I believe it's 250 foot in either
direction

02:40:24.050 --> 02:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
direction
 
02:40:26.870 --> 02:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
um review area that we have including a
 
02:40:29.750 --> 02:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
10 unit right across the street
 
02:40:32.389 --> 02:40:32.399 align:start position:0%
so there was it was a much less of a
 
02:40:34.849 --> 02:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
concern in that regard further up the
 
02:40:36.770 --> 02:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
road we had a different project that
 
02:40:38.690 --> 02:40:38.700 align:start position:0%
they came in they said they wanted 80
 
02:40:41.809 --> 02:40:41.819 align:start position:0%
units where they could have gotten 40.
 
02:40:44.750 --> 02:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh the I believe at the end of the day
 
02:40:47.870 --> 02:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
the planning board agreed to
 
02:40:49.849 --> 02:40:49.859 align:start position:0%
um about half of that
 
02:40:51.710 --> 02:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
and when the planning board agrees to
 
02:40:54.530 --> 02:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
give you the additional unit count
 
02:40:57.770 --> 02:40:57.780 align:start position:0%
it says this is the most you can do you
 
02:41:00.290 --> 02:41:00.300 align:start position:0%
now go through the site plan process and
 
02:41:01.849 --> 02:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
if you can't fit it because the
 
02:41:03.710 --> 02:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
engineering and the site work doesn't
 
02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:04.969 align:start position:0%
engineering and the site work doesn't
work

02:41:04.969 --> 02:41:04.979 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:41:07.730 --> 02:41:07.740 align:start position:0%
don't come back to us and say
 
02:41:10.370 --> 02:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
figure out a way it's up to you so in
 
02:41:11.389 --> 02:41:11.399 align:start position:0%
that case
 
02:41:14.030 --> 02:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
that project got approved for somewhere
 
02:41:15.650 --> 02:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
closer to 60 and they ended up doing
 
02:41:18.050 --> 02:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
closer to 50 because the storm water
 
02:41:21.230 --> 02:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
management all of the other aspects of
 
02:41:23.570 --> 02:41:23.580 align:start position:0%
the site planning came into play the
 
02:41:26.990 --> 02:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
ledge Wetlands Etc and that's that's
 
02:41:28.730 --> 02:41:28.740 align:start position:0%
another thing I should put out there is
 
02:41:31.270 --> 02:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
the planning board has been very clear
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
that it is not interested in
 
02:41:35.520 --> 02:41:36.410 align:start position:0%
that it is not interested in
um

02:41:36.410 --> 02:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:39.670 --> 02:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
as a point uh
 
02:41:41.809 --> 02:41:41.819 align:start position:0%
point-blank conversation it's not
 
02:41:43.610 --> 02:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
interested in saying Wetlands Wetlands
 
02:41:45.410 --> 02:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
buffers steep slopes
 
02:41:48.230 --> 02:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh stream beds
 
02:41:50.270 --> 02:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
you will give you uh conditional use
 
02:41:52.370 --> 02:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
permits to get around those for density
 
02:41:55.250 --> 02:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
it says you have to make the case you
 
02:41:56.870 --> 02:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
still have to apply for that relief you
 
02:42:00.170 --> 02:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
still have to justify under the local
 
02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
and state code why we should we should
 
02:42:05.809 --> 02:42:05.819 align:start position:0%
Grant this environmental relief and show
 
02:42:07.550 --> 02:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
us that there was no other way to do it
 
02:42:09.650 --> 02:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
because density is good and we want to
 
02:42:11.809 --> 02:42:11.819 align:start position:0%
promote it but the other hand there's a
 
02:42:13.790 --> 02:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
balance and we want to make sure we
 
02:42:16.429 --> 02:42:16.439 align:start position:0%
maintain that balance okay so it seems
 
02:42:19.550 --> 02:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
to me that you're saying the butters had
 
02:42:21.110 --> 02:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
an issue whether it was going to be 9
 
02:42:23.450 --> 02:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
units or 44 and you did your best to
 
02:42:25.370 --> 02:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
alleviate those concerns but at the end
 
02:42:28.490 --> 02:42:28.500 align:start position:0%
of the day the planning board out had to
 
02:42:30.710 --> 02:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
make a great call okay correct
 
02:42:33.410 --> 02:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
all right representative Walsh just a
 
02:42:34.730 --> 02:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
quick question
 
02:42:36.290 --> 02:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
um just to give my until I see the
 
02:42:38.570 --> 02:42:38.580 align:start position:0%
information just a general sense
 
02:42:40.550 --> 02:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
how big was the lot you were looking at
 
02:42:42.830 --> 02:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
if it's 12 homes I must say I'm assuming
 
02:42:44.750 --> 02:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
at least 12 acres and what was the
 
02:42:47.690 --> 02:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
zoning in the area at the time
 
02:42:50.750 --> 02:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
would you believe it's seven acres
 
02:42:53.270 --> 02:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
so the zoning is 12 000 square foot
 
02:42:55.130 --> 02:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
minimum lot size
 
02:42:57.410 --> 02:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
so it's uh well that's actually our
 
02:42:59.150 --> 02:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
Suburban density
 
02:43:02.809 --> 02:43:02.819 align:start position:0%
um our our largest zone is acre
 
02:43:05.330 --> 02:43:05.340 align:start position:0%
um and it's we Dover uses contiguous
 
02:43:08.809 --> 02:43:08.819 align:start position:0%
Upland not square footage so it's 12 000
 
02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
contiguous Upland
 
02:43:12.410 --> 02:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh our
 
02:43:15.290 --> 02:43:15.300 align:start position:0%
our more urban is down to four thousand
 
02:43:19.670 --> 02:43:19.680 align:start position:0%
square foot Lots so in this case the the
 
02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
Seven Acres was going to yield nine Lots
 
02:43:24.849 --> 02:43:24.859 align:start position:0%
because they're steep slopes there's
 
02:43:27.349 --> 02:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
Wetlands there's Wetland buffers there's
 
02:43:29.690 --> 02:43:29.700 align:start position:0%
a stream the Bellamy river is in the
 
02:43:31.250 --> 02:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
back side so there was a Shoreland
 
02:43:32.990 --> 02:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
overlay District
 
02:43:34.969 --> 02:43:34.979 align:start position:0%
things of that nature so
 
02:43:38.570 --> 02:43:38.580 align:start position:0%
they got the developer has said they got
 
02:43:40.490 --> 02:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
44 units on three acres because that's
 
02:43:43.070 --> 02:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
when you when you look at the specific
 
02:43:46.010 --> 02:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
build a build area I say it's on the
 
02:43:47.510 --> 02:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
Seven Acres because the storm water
 
02:43:50.150 --> 02:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
management and the the trails that they
 
02:43:52.550 --> 02:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
provided and the things of that nature
 
02:43:56.030 --> 02:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
take up the full seven acres
 
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
02:44:00.110 --> 02:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
perfect well thank you very much for
 
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
coming and we look forward to you
 
02:44:04.790 --> 02:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
sending us an email regarding uh the
 
02:44:06.050 --> 02:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
site plan and everything so we can look
 
02:44:07.730 --> 02:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
at that you're very welcome thank you
 
02:44:09.590 --> 02:44:09.600 align:start position:0%
for having me and I am always available
 
02:44:11.690 --> 02:44:11.700 align:start position:0%
and happy to chat as is Miss Benton who
 
02:44:14.570 --> 02:44:14.580 align:start position:0%
could not be here perfect thank you
 
02:44:16.429 --> 02:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
so with that we're gonna break for lunch
 
02:44:18.590 --> 02:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
so let's uh we have a presentation on
 
02:44:20.870 --> 02:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
the zoning Atlas at one o'clock so we'll
 
03:17:38.210 --> 03:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:40.250 --> 03:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
uh we are going to hear from our last
 
03:17:42.710 --> 03:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
presenter today I want to welcome
 
03:17:44.150 --> 03:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
um the saint ansem College Center for
 
03:17:45.590 --> 03:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
ethics and Society to come up and
 
03:17:47.750 --> 03:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
present some new research on the New
 
03:17:49.309 --> 03:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire zoning Atlas came out I think
 
03:17:51.590 --> 03:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
this week right so I want to invite up
 
03:17:54.590 --> 03:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
um an old college professor of not of
 
03:17:56.450 --> 03:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
mine but at St ansem College
 
03:17:57.650 --> 03:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
um that I knew while I was at College
 
03:18:00.290 --> 03:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
Max Latona and then I'd also like to
 
03:18:01.670 --> 03:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
invite up Ben Frost from New Hampshire
 
03:18:05.330 --> 03:18:05.340 align:start position:0%
Housing and uh Jason sorens from
 
03:18:08.809 --> 03:18:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:10.429 --> 03:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
the American Institute for economic
 
03:18:30.550 --> 03:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:33.650 --> 03:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
okay thank you um representative
 
03:18:35.269 --> 03:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
Alexander in the committee for inviting
 
03:18:36.650 --> 03:18:36.660 align:start position:0%
us here today
 
03:18:38.330 --> 03:18:38.340 align:start position:0%
um you've already been introduced to us
 
03:18:41.510 --> 03:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
I do want to say that the three of us
 
03:18:43.309 --> 03:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
um are part of the leadership team for
 
03:18:45.050 --> 03:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
this project that I'll be describing in
 
03:18:46.910 --> 03:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
a moment there are a few others who
 
03:18:48.170 --> 03:18:48.180 align:start position:0%
couldn't make it today and I'll mention
 
03:18:49.849 --> 03:18:49.859 align:start position:0%
them as well
 
03:18:51.469 --> 03:18:51.479 align:start position:0%
um uh but we're very happy to be here
 
03:18:53.990 --> 03:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
today to give you what is actually the
 
03:18:57.290 --> 03:18:57.300 align:start position:0%
first Glimpse to the new um of the New
 
03:18:59.690 --> 03:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire zoning Atlas a project that
 
03:19:01.010 --> 03:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
has been under development for well over
 
03:19:03.190 --> 03:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
a year since December of
 
03:19:05.870 --> 03:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
2021 actually
 
03:19:07.849 --> 03:19:07.859 align:start position:0%
and our purposes today is to sort of
 
03:19:10.130 --> 03:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
give you an overview of the project talk
 
03:19:11.750 --> 03:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
about the process by which it was
 
03:19:11.760 --> 03:19:13.309 align:start position:0%
about the process by which it was
completed

03:19:13.309 --> 03:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
completed
 
03:19:15.170 --> 03:19:15.180 align:start position:0%
some of the major findings that we've
 
03:19:17.690 --> 03:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
made as a result of the project some
 
03:19:20.210 --> 03:19:20.220 align:start position:0%
potential policy implications and to
 
03:19:21.230 --> 03:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
give you a sort of an advanced
 
03:19:22.969 --> 03:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
demonstration a little demonstration of
 
03:19:24.710 --> 03:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
the atlas itself and how it could be
 
03:19:24.720 --> 03:19:26.929 align:start position:0%
the atlas itself and how it could be
used

03:19:26.929 --> 03:19:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:26.939 --> 03:19:28.070 align:start position:0%
 
um so

03:19:28.070 --> 03:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:19:30.110 --> 03:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
without further Ado we'll just uh talk a
 
03:19:31.070 --> 03:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
little bit about
 
03:19:33.290 --> 03:19:33.300 align:start position:0%
um some of the basics of the atlas
 
03:19:33.300 --> 03:19:35.090 align:start position:0%
um some of the basics of the atlas
um

03:19:35.090 --> 03:19:35.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:37.370 --> 03:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
so as I mentioned our leadership team
 
03:19:39.410 --> 03:19:39.420 align:start position:0%
that developed this uh is really there's
 
03:19:41.929 --> 03:19:41.939 align:start position:0%
really three organizations that are
 
03:19:43.730 --> 03:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
um uh Partners in developing the atlas
 
03:19:45.469 --> 03:19:45.479 align:start position:0%
it's the center for ethics in society at
 
03:19:47.510 --> 03:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
St Anselm College
 
03:19:49.550 --> 03:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire Housing Finance
 
03:19:53.030 --> 03:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
Authority and uh the office of Planning
 
03:19:54.170 --> 03:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
and Development the State Office of
 
03:19:56.150 --> 03:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
planning and development and
 
03:19:57.769 --> 03:19:57.779 align:start position:0%
representing the office of planning and
 
03:19:59.929 --> 03:19:59.939 align:start position:0%
development is Noah hodgets uh the
 
03:20:02.210 --> 03:20:02.220 align:start position:0%
principal planner he cannot be here
 
03:20:02.220 --> 03:20:02.950 align:start position:0%
principal planner he cannot be here
today

03:20:02.950 --> 03:20:02.960 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:20:05.389 --> 03:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
due to illness
 
03:20:07.969 --> 03:20:07.979 align:start position:0%
but in addition we also have a wonderful
 
03:20:10.309 --> 03:20:10.319 align:start position:0%
GIS specialist a rick leader of Barnes
 
03:20:12.710 --> 03:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
who did incredible work on this project
 
03:20:15.290 --> 03:20:15.300 align:start position:0%
he could not be here today as well and
 
03:20:16.969 --> 03:20:16.979 align:start position:0%
finally Sarah Martian
 
03:20:19.130 --> 03:20:19.140 align:start position:0%
um some of you may remember her from her
 
03:20:21.550 --> 03:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
work in Nashua uh as well as with the
 
03:20:23.450 --> 03:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
Northern New England chapter the
 
03:20:25.130 --> 03:20:25.140 align:start position:0%
American planners Association she is
 
03:20:28.309 --> 03:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
currently a chief of staff at our the
 
03:20:30.469 --> 03:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
Community Loan Fund so uh that is our
 
03:20:32.030 --> 03:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
leadership team
 
03:20:34.250 --> 03:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
um and we've been working on this
 
03:20:37.610 --> 03:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
project now for as I said uh 12 to 13 of
 
03:20:40.070 --> 03:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
14 to 15 months
 
03:20:41.450 --> 03:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
so the first thing I'd like to talk
 
03:20:42.950 --> 03:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
about is a little bit is what is the New
 
03:20:44.690 --> 03:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire zoning Atlas um
 
03:20:46.490 --> 03:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
and quite simply it's a collaborative
 
03:20:51.290 --> 03:20:51.300 align:start position:0%
project to research catalog digitize and
 
03:20:53.269 --> 03:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
graphically display all of New
 
03:20:55.250 --> 03:20:55.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's zoning regulations Community
 
03:20:59.630 --> 03:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:02.090 --> 03:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
um why do we need such a thing well um
 
03:21:04.550 --> 03:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
as you well know I'm sure zoning is
 
03:21:06.769 --> 03:21:06.779 align:start position:0%
complicated in New Hampshire it's
 
03:21:06.779 --> 03:21:08.269 align:start position:0%
complicated in New Hampshire it's
decentralized

03:21:08.269 --> 03:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
decentralized
 
03:21:10.429 --> 03:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
um you know as as we know there's going
 
03:21:12.830 --> 03:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
to be there's over 250 jurisdictions in
 
03:21:14.269 --> 03:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Each of which has been
 
03:21:17.389 --> 03:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
granted its own authority to uh to
 
03:21:19.070 --> 03:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
provide to create its own land use
 
03:21:19.080 --> 03:21:20.929 align:start position:0%
provide to create its own land use
ordinances

03:21:20.929 --> 03:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
03:21:23.690 --> 03:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
um so it's inconsistent from one
 
03:21:25.370 --> 03:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction to the next what those
 
03:21:27.830 --> 03:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
zoning rules or land use ordinances say
 
03:21:29.990 --> 03:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
and even within a jurisdiction from one
 
03:21:32.269 --> 03:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
District to the next and I dare say
 
03:21:34.010 --> 03:21:34.020 align:start position:0%
we've found inconsistencies within
 
03:21:36.230 --> 03:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
single zoning codes as we went through
 
03:21:39.050 --> 03:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
the project so lots of inconsistency all
 
03:21:42.230 --> 03:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
around zoning is is complex as you know
 
03:21:44.349 --> 03:21:44.359 align:start position:0%
there are layers and layers upon
 
03:21:46.490 --> 03:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
regulations that can govern housing
 
03:21:46.500 --> 03:21:47.510 align:start position:0%
regulations that can govern housing
production

03:21:47.510 --> 03:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
production
 
03:21:49.849 --> 03:21:49.859 align:start position:0%
um includes housing treatments but also
 
03:21:52.309 --> 03:21:52.319 align:start position:0%
dimensional regulations on additional
 
03:21:53.809 --> 03:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
things like parking and so on and so
 
03:21:56.750 --> 03:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
forth full of jargon zoning codes are
 
03:21:58.250 --> 03:21:58.260 align:start position:0%
difficult for the average person to read
 
03:22:00.170 --> 03:22:00.180 align:start position:0%
you have words like accessory use and
 
03:22:02.630 --> 03:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
buffer zones conditional use setbacks
 
03:22:05.450 --> 03:22:05.460 align:start position:0%
easements Frontage impervious surfaces
 
03:22:07.190 --> 03:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
and so on so it's difficult to
 
03:22:09.769 --> 03:22:09.779 align:start position:0%
understand Zoning for the average person
 
03:22:12.290 --> 03:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
it's also piecemeal just in terms of how
 
03:22:14.990 --> 03:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
these zoning codes were developed over
 
03:22:16.849 --> 03:22:16.859 align:start position:0%
time it wasn't systematically done in
 
03:22:20.630 --> 03:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
most cases but each year some change or
 
03:22:23.809 --> 03:22:23.819 align:start position:0%
addition is is introduced into the code
 
03:22:26.330 --> 03:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
and in the end you have basically a very
 
03:22:28.210 --> 03:22:28.220 align:start position:0%
much piecemeal
 
03:22:30.830 --> 03:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
set of rules and that are not
 
03:22:33.230 --> 03:22:33.240 align:start position:0%
systematically streamlined so
 
03:22:35.389 --> 03:22:35.399 align:start position:0%
given all of those complications our
 
03:22:38.269 --> 03:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
zoning Atlas is intended to help
 
03:22:40.429 --> 03:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
communities and policy makers in New
 
03:22:42.349 --> 03:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire simply understand our zoning
 
03:22:44.570 --> 03:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
understand the zoning within a given
 
03:22:47.269 --> 03:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
Community but also collectively across
 
03:22:48.889 --> 03:22:48.899 align:start position:0%
the communities and
 
03:22:51.110 --> 03:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
to understand how that how those zoning
 
03:22:53.150 --> 03:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
rules impact housing Supply and
 
03:22:53.160 --> 03:22:54.410 align:start position:0%
rules impact housing Supply and
affordability

03:22:54.410 --> 03:22:54.420 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
03:22:56.990 --> 03:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
so what we really hope to do with this
 
03:22:59.750 --> 03:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
Atlas is to generate a healthy Statewide
 
03:23:02.630 --> 03:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
discourse about our land use ordinances
 
03:23:04.969 --> 03:23:04.979 align:start position:0%
and how they impact housing Supply and
 
03:23:07.130 --> 03:23:07.140 align:start position:0%
affordability and we think understanding
 
03:23:10.610 --> 03:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
is the best tool to facilitate that kind
 
03:23:12.349 --> 03:23:12.359 align:start position:0%
of discourse and this is what this Atlas
 
03:23:14.150 --> 03:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
is intended to help help us understand
 
03:23:16.190 --> 03:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
our zoning so
 
03:23:18.530 --> 03:23:18.540 align:start position:0%
so that uh that's uh
 
03:23:20.990 --> 03:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
simple overview of the project I do want
 
03:23:23.450 --> 03:23:23.460 align:start position:0%
to acknowledge our partners who made
 
03:23:25.250 --> 03:23:25.260 align:start position:0%
this possible I've already mentioned the
 
03:23:27.170 --> 03:23:27.180 align:start position:0%
center for ethics and Society New
 
03:23:29.630 --> 03:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing and the office of
 
03:23:31.070 --> 03:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
planning and development in business and
 
03:23:33.349 --> 03:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
economic Affairs but we also have some
 
03:23:34.490 --> 03:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
funding partners that have been very
 
03:23:37.429 --> 03:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
important I'd like to thank citizens uh
 
03:23:39.410 --> 03:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
Charles Koch Foundation the mercatus
 
03:23:41.809 --> 03:23:41.819 align:start position:0%
center ever North and New Hampshire
 
03:23:43.490 --> 03:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
Realtors all have been very important
 
03:23:46.610 --> 03:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
for producing this project I also want
 
03:23:48.349 --> 03:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
to make a note or nod to our national
 
03:23:51.290 --> 03:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
Partners as you may know there is a
 
03:23:54.290 --> 03:23:54.300 align:start position:0%
national zoning Atlas project going on
 
03:23:56.570 --> 03:23:56.580 align:start position:0%
um led by Sarah brona not of Cornell
 
03:23:59.269 --> 03:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
University and there are a number of
 
03:24:01.429 --> 03:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
other states at least 30 or so that are
 
03:24:04.490 --> 03:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
currently working on atlases so we're
 
03:24:06.469 --> 03:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
part of a growing I think Consciousness
 
03:24:08.690 --> 03:24:08.700 align:start position:0%
and awareness Across the Nation about
 
03:24:10.670 --> 03:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
zoning regulations how they impact
 
03:24:13.429 --> 03:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
housing production and we're excited to
 
03:24:15.530 --> 03:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
see um this kind of work happening
 
03:24:17.090 --> 03:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
across uh
 
03:24:17.100 --> 03:24:19.190 align:start position:0%
across uh
the country

03:24:19.190 --> 03:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
the country
 
03:24:20.809 --> 03:24:20.819 align:start position:0%
um just quickly our timeline and
 
03:24:23.030 --> 03:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
Milestones so as I mentioned this idea
 
03:24:25.610 --> 03:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
was generated in December of 2021 in
 
03:24:27.530 --> 03:24:27.540 align:start position:0%
January of 2022 we assembled our
 
03:24:28.670 --> 03:24:28.680 align:start position:0%
leadership team who I've already
 
03:24:30.349 --> 03:24:30.359 align:start position:0%
introduced to
 
03:24:32.269 --> 03:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
um and by March we secured funding for
 
03:24:34.070 --> 03:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
the project
 
03:24:38.570 --> 03:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
um and in April May we hired our zoning
 
03:24:41.090 --> 03:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to really dig into these
 
03:24:43.190 --> 03:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
data you can do so we're going to make
 
03:24:46.490 --> 03:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
these um publicly available for free
 
03:24:48.830 --> 03:24:48.840 align:start position:0%
online so that researchers can use them
 
03:24:51.290 --> 03:24:51.300 align:start position:0%
and really anyone can use them there are
 
03:24:53.570 --> 03:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
two data sets one is sort of the the raw
 
03:24:56.030 --> 03:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
data which is a a Google sheet anyone
 
03:24:58.070 --> 03:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
can get into there and and and look at
 
03:24:59.750 --> 03:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
that and it's got all the zoning
 
03:25:01.729 --> 03:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
districts in the state
 
03:25:04.010 --> 03:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
um base and overlay districts it
 
03:25:06.170 --> 03:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
includes districts that don't appear on
 
03:25:09.110 --> 03:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
zoning Maps like a lot of flood plain
 
03:25:12.050 --> 03:25:12.060 align:start position:0%
Wetland and aquifer protection districts
 
03:25:14.030 --> 03:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
that are not actually map units are not
 
03:25:16.490 --> 03:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
allowed so residential districts could
 
03:25:17.750 --> 03:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
be one of two types it could be
 
03:25:19.969 --> 03:25:19.979 align:start position:0%
primarily residential which means that
 
03:25:22.849 --> 03:25:22.859 align:start position:0%
not much commercial or industrial use is
 
03:25:24.889 --> 03:25:24.899 align:start position:0%
allowed there they could allow some
 
03:25:28.309 --> 03:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
Agriculture and Forestry use could allow
 
03:25:30.190 --> 03:25:30.200 align:start position:0%
maybe churches
 
03:25:32.990 --> 03:25:33.000 align:start position:0%
utilities some some government functions
 
03:25:34.670 --> 03:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
but if they don't allow some general
 
03:25:36.590 --> 03:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
category of commercial or industrial use
 
03:25:38.570 --> 03:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
we code them as primarily residential
 
03:25:40.429 --> 03:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
mixed with residential means they allow
 
03:25:42.050 --> 03:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
both residential and some general
 
03:25:44.349 --> 03:25:44.359 align:start position:0%
category of commercial use
 
03:25:46.309 --> 03:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
non-residential districts come in three
 
03:25:46.319 --> 03:25:47.410 align:start position:0%
non-residential districts come in three
types

03:25:47.410 --> 03:25:47.420 align:start position:0%
types
 
03:25:50.210 --> 03:25:50.220 align:start position:0%
we assessed whether they're primarily a
 
03:25:52.030 --> 03:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
commercial a General commercial District
 
03:25:54.710 --> 03:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
primarily an industrial district or
 
03:25:56.570 --> 03:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
primarily just a conservation or maybe
 
03:25:58.670 --> 03:25:58.680 align:start position:0%
agriculture District where neither
 
03:26:00.769 --> 03:26:00.779 align:start position:0%
commercial nor residential uses are
 
03:26:00.779 --> 03:26:02.510 align:start position:0%
commercial nor residential uses are
allowed

03:26:02.510 --> 03:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
allowed
 
03:26:04.550 --> 03:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
then we take into account youth zoning
 
03:26:06.830 --> 03:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
of various types so we we look at
 
03:26:09.410 --> 03:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
whether single-family homes are allowed
 
03:26:12.590 --> 03:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
duplexes or two family three family four
 
03:26:15.229 --> 03:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
family and then five or more family
 
03:26:17.510 --> 03:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
units are allowed right so that has to
 
03:26:19.370 --> 03:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
do with a number of units allowed in a
 
03:26:20.929 --> 03:26:20.939 align:start position:0%
single structure
 
03:26:23.090 --> 03:26:23.100 align:start position:0%
uh we code features relating to
 
03:26:25.990 --> 03:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
affordable housing if they're a special
 
03:26:30.349 --> 03:26:30.359 align:start position:0%
benefits or requirements for dwelling
 
03:26:32.450 --> 03:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
units that are guaranteed affordable so
 
03:26:34.070 --> 03:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
there's a legal mandate that they'd be
 
03:26:35.809 --> 03:26:35.819 align:start position:0%
affordable to people of a certain income
 
03:26:38.349 --> 03:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
then we have that information in there
 
03:26:41.210 --> 03:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units or accessory
 
03:26:42.769 --> 03:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
Apartments as they're sometimes called
 
03:26:45.229 --> 03:26:45.239 align:start position:0%
we have several features of those
 
03:26:47.750 --> 03:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
available and how manufactured housing
 
03:26:50.389 --> 03:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
is treated so those are some examples of
 
03:26:52.490 --> 03:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
the the kind of use categories that we
 
03:26:55.969 --> 03:26:55.979 align:start position:0%
capture in the zoning Atlas and then in
 
03:26:58.010 --> 03:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
addition to that we capture a
 
03:27:00.830 --> 03:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
dimensional and parking regulations so
 
03:27:03.110 --> 03:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
that includes things like minimum lot
 
03:27:05.210 --> 03:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
size minimum Frontage minimum front
 
03:27:07.670 --> 03:27:07.680 align:start position:0%
setback minimum side setback minimum
 
03:27:09.769 --> 03:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
rear setback maximum lot coverage
 
03:27:12.290 --> 03:27:12.300 align:start position:0%
maximum height maximum number of
 
03:27:12.300 --> 03:27:13.729 align:start position:0%
maximum height maximum number of
bedrooms

03:27:13.729 --> 03:27:13.739 align:start position:0%
bedrooms
 
03:27:15.590 --> 03:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
a number of these a number of these
 
03:27:18.290 --> 03:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
features uh that you can think of we
 
03:27:20.870 --> 03:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
have in our data set so we are talking
 
03:27:23.330 --> 03:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
about ultimately about 200 different
 
03:27:26.929 --> 03:27:26.939 align:start position:0%
variables or fields in this data set
 
03:27:26.939 --> 03:27:27.530 align:start position:0%
variables or fields in this data set
um

03:27:27.530 --> 03:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:29.750 --> 03:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
you know capturing everything from
 
03:27:31.130 --> 03:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
minimum parking requirements to
 
03:27:32.389 --> 03:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
dimensional regulations to use
 
03:27:34.729 --> 03:27:34.739 align:start position:0%
categories we also capture whether a
 
03:27:38.229 --> 03:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
district allows dwelling units that are
 
03:27:41.210 --> 03:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
elderly only for a certain type so maybe
 
03:27:43.729 --> 03:27:43.739 align:start position:0%
it allows three family structures but
 
03:27:46.490 --> 03:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
only if they're limited to elderly or
 
03:27:48.170 --> 03:27:48.180 align:start position:0%
maybe they allow three family structures
 
03:27:49.670 --> 03:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
but only if they're guaranteed
 
03:27:51.610 --> 03:27:51.620 align:start position:0%
affordable so we capture
 
03:27:54.830 --> 03:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
those characteristics as well
 
03:27:57.050 --> 03:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
um so this is a lot of information so
 
03:28:00.050 --> 03:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
feel free to ask as we go along I I have
 
03:28:02.570 --> 03:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
a question how did you account for Flex
 
03:28:04.130 --> 03:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
Zones commercial industrial or
 
03:28:05.450 --> 03:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
commercial residential like how do you
 
03:28:07.429 --> 03:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
is are there data points for those yes
 
03:28:10.250 --> 03:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
so um so those would be classified as
 
03:28:13.070 --> 03:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
mixed with residential if they allow uh
 
03:28:14.510 --> 03:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
mixed use or if they allow both
 
03:28:17.330 --> 03:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
residential and Commercial structures
 
03:28:19.010 --> 03:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
um then that's a mix with residential
 
03:28:19.020 --> 03:28:20.030 align:start position:0%
um then that's a mix with residential
district

03:28:20.030 --> 03:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:28:21.830 --> 03:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
um so we are able to show you although
 
03:28:23.750 --> 03:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
our focus is on housing we are able to
 
03:28:25.010 --> 03:28:25.020 align:start position:0%
show you
 
03:28:27.830 --> 03:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
um what parts of New Hampshire allow at
 
03:28:30.050 --> 03:28:30.060 align:start position:0%
least one General category of commercial
 
03:28:30.060 --> 03:28:31.729 align:start position:0%
least one General category of commercial
use

03:28:31.729 --> 03:28:31.739 align:start position:0%
use
 
03:28:34.610 --> 03:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
um and and that's fairly interesting we
 
03:28:36.229 --> 03:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
see that
 
03:28:38.210 --> 03:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
um I'm just going to kind of make a
 
03:28:40.550 --> 03:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
generalization here that in in the more
 
03:28:41.870 --> 03:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
rural parts of the state actually
 
03:28:43.849 --> 03:28:43.859 align:start position:0%
there's there tends to be more land
 
03:28:46.130 --> 03:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
available for commercial and Industrial
 
03:28:47.630 --> 03:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
use and maybe that's part of their
 
03:28:49.849 --> 03:28:49.859 align:start position:0%
strategy to grow their tax base whereas
 
03:28:50.990 --> 03:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
in the more kind of suburban
 
03:28:53.030 --> 03:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
Southeastern part of the state
 
03:28:54.290 --> 03:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
um you have a lot of districts that
 
03:28:56.510 --> 03:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
exclude commercial entirely
 
03:29:00.170 --> 03:29:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:01.309 --> 03:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
I speak your
 
03:29:02.510 --> 03:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
secure from experience
 
03:29:04.790 --> 03:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
um is there such a thing as commercial
 
03:29:04.800 --> 03:29:06.650 align:start position:0%
um is there such a thing as commercial
agricultural

03:29:06.650 --> 03:29:06.660 align:start position:0%
agricultural
 
03:29:09.530 --> 03:29:09.540 align:start position:0%
yes so uh by under state law
 
03:29:12.710 --> 03:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
agricultural use is allowed throughout
 
03:29:15.469 --> 03:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
the entire territory unless it's a
 
03:29:17.690 --> 03:29:17.700 align:start position:0%
conservation only area
 
03:29:19.490 --> 03:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
um so there's there aren't any
 
03:29:21.950 --> 03:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities that actually prohibit
 
03:29:24.830 --> 03:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
um agricultural uses that wasn't my
 
03:29:25.910 --> 03:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
question okay
 
03:29:27.769 --> 03:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
um are there areas where where
 
03:29:30.349 --> 03:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
agricultural use is allowed
 
03:29:32.210 --> 03:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
um but there are restrictions on
 
03:29:35.809 --> 03:29:35.819 align:start position:0%
commercial use yes yes so
 
03:29:37.670 --> 03:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
um we have as a category of
 
03:29:39.650 --> 03:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
non-residential District we have a
 
03:29:42.170 --> 03:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
conservation slash agriculture category
 
03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
so those would be districts where
 
03:29:46.849 --> 03:29:46.859 align:start position:0%
residential is not allowed commercials
 
03:29:49.250 --> 03:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
not allowed Industrials not allowed but
 
03:29:52.370 --> 03:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
agriculture might be so
 
03:29:55.309 --> 03:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
commercial use in
 
03:29:59.090 --> 03:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
exactly for housing use exactly thank
 
03:29:59.100 --> 03:29:59.750 align:start position:0%
exactly for housing use exactly thank
you

03:29:59.750 --> 03:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:30:01.490 --> 03:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
um and it's and another good point here
 
03:30:02.750 --> 03:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
if we really want to get into the weeds
 
03:30:05.630 --> 03:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
is if it allows commercial uses only
 
03:30:08.450 --> 03:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
through special exception or something
 
03:30:10.309 --> 03:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
like that we do code it as commercial
 
03:30:12.290 --> 03:30:12.300 align:start position:0%
being allowed even though that's a kind
 
03:30:14.330 --> 03:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
of special permit so long as it doesn't
 
03:30:16.370 --> 03:30:16.380 align:start position:0%
require an actual variance as we know
 
03:30:18.349 --> 03:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
the the criteria for a variance can be
 
03:30:19.370 --> 03:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
quite restrictive and there's no
 
03:30:21.170 --> 03:30:21.180 align:start position:0%
guarantee of getting one
 
03:30:25.150 --> 03:30:25.160 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's the approach we took
 
03:30:28.190 --> 03:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
yes I'm going to go through a few of the
 
03:30:29.809 --> 03:30:29.819 align:start position:0%
findings and then hand it over to Ben
 
03:30:29.819 --> 03:30:31.250 align:start position:0%
findings and then hand it over to Ben
Frost

03:30:31.250 --> 03:30:31.260 align:start position:0%
Frost
 
03:30:33.530 --> 03:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
so just a a little bit of what you're
 
03:30:35.750 --> 03:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
going to see once this is
 
03:30:38.750 --> 03:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
um goes live to the public on May 9th
 
03:30:41.330 --> 03:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to go through a section
 
03:30:43.790 --> 03:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
of the zoning Atlas website called a
 
03:30:46.429 --> 03:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
story map and it has a kind of
 
03:30:49.969 --> 03:30:49.979 align:start position:0%
analytical description of features of
 
03:30:52.010 --> 03:30:52.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire zoning along with
 
03:30:55.790 --> 03:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:58.130 --> 03:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
um and then we're also going to have in
 
03:30:59.450 --> 03:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
there and we're going to talk about it
 
03:31:02.929 --> 03:31:02.939 align:start position:0%
briefly today a really detailed analysis
 
03:31:05.030 --> 03:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
of Manchester and the surrounding
 
03:31:06.650 --> 03:31:06.660 align:start position:0%
communities and how they zone for
 
03:31:06.660 --> 03:31:08.809 align:start position:0%
communities and how they zone for
housing

03:31:08.809 --> 03:31:08.819 align:start position:0%
housing
 
03:31:10.729 --> 03:31:10.739 align:start position:0%
there's also going to be an interactive
 
03:31:12.710 --> 03:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
Atlas and you're going to see a
 
03:31:15.889 --> 03:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
demonstration of that today uh and I'm
 
03:31:17.630 --> 03:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
very excited about this this is a
 
03:31:19.190 --> 03:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
feature that I think is going to get a
 
03:31:21.830 --> 03:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
lot of attention and use it will allow
 
03:31:23.690 --> 03:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
you to show
 
03:31:23.700 --> 03:31:24.290 align:start position:0%
you to show
um

03:31:24.290 --> 03:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:26.090 --> 03:31:26.100 align:start position:0%
what parts of the state are available
 
03:31:28.969 --> 03:31:28.979 align:start position:0%
for single family two family five plus
 
03:31:31.790 --> 03:31:31.800 align:start position:0%
family with minimum lot sizes between
 
03:31:36.530 --> 03:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
various types where elderly only housing
 
03:31:38.330 --> 03:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
is is allowed where affordable only
 
03:31:41.150 --> 03:31:41.160 align:start position:0%
housing is allowed
 
03:31:42.530 --> 03:31:42.540 align:start position:0%
um so that you're going to be able to to
 
03:31:44.150 --> 03:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
do a lot of things there and you can
 
03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
click on any uh zoning district and
 
03:31:49.729 --> 03:31:49.739 align:start position:0%
you're going to get the whole set of
 
03:31:51.830 --> 03:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
attributes for that zoning District so
 
03:31:53.870 --> 03:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
again if you really want to to dig into
 
03:31:55.849 --> 03:31:55.859 align:start position:0%
it you're going to find all those things
 
03:31:57.889 --> 03:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
I just mentioned that we have in there
 
03:32:00.229 --> 03:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
are going to be available to you so the
 
03:32:01.849 --> 03:32:01.859 align:start position:0%
whole thing
 
03:32:02.929 --> 03:32:02.939 align:start position:0%
the whole thing will be searchable
 
03:32:04.610 --> 03:32:04.620 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to search for an address
 
03:32:07.250 --> 03:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
and it'll pull up that zoning District
 
03:32:09.410 --> 03:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
that address is a part of that's
 
03:32:11.929 --> 03:32:11.939 align:start position:0%
incredible representative Reed
 
03:32:13.550 --> 03:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
first of all I just want to apologize
 
03:32:16.190 --> 03:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
for coming in late uh absolutely no
 
03:32:18.170 --> 03:32:18.180 align:start position:0%
disrespect meant I'm super excited about
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
these tools that you're developing this
 
03:32:25.309 --> 03:32:25.319 align:start position:0%
particular one will the type of housing
 
03:32:28.130 --> 03:32:28.140 align:start position:0%
allowed in the area be like so where a
 
03:32:30.429 --> 03:32:30.439 align:start position:0%
mobile home is allowed versus not or
 
03:32:33.469 --> 03:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
modular is one that I seem to always get
 
03:32:35.690 --> 03:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
fuzzy on where that's allowed so that
 
03:32:38.690 --> 03:32:38.700 align:start position:0%
will be yeah so um in the interactive
 
03:32:41.210 --> 03:32:41.220 align:start position:0%
Atlas I I don't know that we have a
 
03:32:42.590 --> 03:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
filter set up but maybe this is
 
03:32:44.210 --> 03:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
something we could set up in the next
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
month it sure would be pretty easy to
 
03:32:47.030 --> 03:32:47.040 align:start position:0%
show where Manufacturing Housing is
 
03:32:49.370 --> 03:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
allowed we do have some static maps that
 
03:32:51.349 --> 03:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
show how manufactured housing is treated
 
03:32:52.790 --> 03:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
but to make that part of the interactive
 
03:32:55.849 --> 03:32:55.859 align:start position:0%
Atlas would be would be a cool idea
 
03:32:58.370 --> 03:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
representative another one and this
 
03:33:00.170 --> 03:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
might be slightly off topic but going
 
03:33:02.090 --> 03:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
off of what representative Gibbs had
 
03:33:03.910 --> 03:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
brought up in you speaking on
 
03:33:07.190 --> 03:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
agriculture so there's nowhere in the
 
03:33:10.309 --> 03:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
state on the state level the state you
 
03:33:12.050 --> 03:33:12.060 align:start position:0%
said the state guarantees that
 
03:33:14.210 --> 03:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
agriculture is allowed everywhere
 
03:33:16.729 --> 03:33:16.739 align:start position:0%
so is does that mean that towns don't
 
03:33:18.469 --> 03:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
have ordinances that prohibit certain
 
03:33:20.929 --> 03:33:20.939 align:start position:0%
agricultural activity there are certain
 
03:33:23.389 --> 03:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
types of Agriculture that they can but I
 
03:33:25.010 --> 03:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
believe it's and Ben you may know that
 
03:33:26.690 --> 03:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
the law on this I think is tilling of
 
03:33:28.610 --> 03:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
the ground or something like that is the
 
03:33:31.490 --> 03:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
phrase in state law
 
03:33:31.500 --> 03:33:34.849 align:start position:0%
phrase in state law
crops

03:33:34.849 --> 03:33:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:37.670 --> 03:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
everywhere so you can you can keep your
 
03:33:39.170 --> 03:33:39.180 align:start position:0%
garden no matter what district you
 
03:33:41.330 --> 03:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
happen to be living in you can throw a
 
03:33:43.670 --> 03:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
lot of wheat or whatever but but
 
03:33:46.910 --> 03:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
livestock livestock there may be some
 
03:33:50.269 --> 03:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
limitations on things like livestock and
 
03:33:52.969 --> 03:33:52.979 align:start position:0%
there's also the and then we're talking
 
03:33:55.849 --> 03:33:55.859 align:start position:0%
just now about zoning there's also other
 
03:33:58.130 --> 03:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
regulatory issues such as site plan
 
03:34:00.830 --> 03:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
review so that a municipality May
 
03:34:04.849 --> 03:34:04.859 align:start position:0%
legitimately subject a some portions of
 
03:34:07.490 --> 03:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
a farming operation to site plan review
 
03:34:13.070 --> 03:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
such as a Farm Stand is it then unusual
 
03:34:15.050 --> 03:34:15.060 align:start position:0%
for a town to prohibit things like
 
03:34:17.870 --> 03:34:17.880 align:start position:0%
backyard chickens things like that or is
 
03:34:20.269 --> 03:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
that fairly common well that that could
 
03:34:23.210 --> 03:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
fall under livestock and so there are
 
03:34:26.750 --> 03:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
communities that do limit the phenomenon
 
03:34:29.750 --> 03:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
known as Urban chickens some limit just
 
03:34:32.570 --> 03:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
roosters and allow the hens because for
 
03:34:35.150 --> 03:34:35.160 align:start position:0%
obvious reasons roosters are noisy so
 
03:34:36.950 --> 03:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
that is subject to limitations so what
 
03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
you're saying representative Reed is we
 
03:34:40.849 --> 03:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
need a filter for urban chicken we need
 
03:34:42.290 --> 03:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
an urban chicken I would like an urban
 
03:34:45.889 --> 03:34:45.899 align:start position:0%
chicken filter and in bees too thank you
 
03:34:49.010 --> 03:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:50.450 --> 03:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
we're getting we're getting great ideas
 
03:34:51.469 --> 03:34:51.479 align:start position:0%
I'm so glad we're doing these
 
03:34:51.479 --> 03:34:54.950 align:start position:0%
I'm so glad we're doing these
pre-briefings

03:34:54.950 --> 03:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:58.190 --> 03:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
all right so uh we're gonna Focus here
 
03:35:01.729 --> 03:35:01.739 align:start position:0%
today on five uh we think big findings
 
03:35:04.429 --> 03:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
from the from the zoning Atlas And so
 
03:35:06.290 --> 03:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
one of the the big findings is we wanted
 
03:35:08.750 --> 03:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
to look at what land is available for
 
03:35:11.269 --> 03:35:11.279 align:start position:0%
starter homes and in particular when we
 
03:35:14.150 --> 03:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
think about a starter home uh for
 
03:35:15.889 --> 03:35:15.899 align:start position:0%
ownership typically this is going to be
 
03:35:18.830 --> 03:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
a detached single family home but it's
 
03:35:21.650 --> 03:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
going to come with a small amount of
 
03:35:23.750 --> 03:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
land because it's not going to be
 
03:35:25.490 --> 03:35:25.500 align:start position:0%
affordable if you have a large parcel
 
03:35:27.110 --> 03:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
say 50 acres and you're going to
 
03:35:29.090 --> 03:35:29.100 align:start position:0%
subdivide that and build some
 
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
single-family homes on it they're not
 
03:35:32.090 --> 03:35:32.100 align:start position:0%
going to be affordable if you can only
 
03:35:34.309 --> 03:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
put 20 single-family homes on it as
 
03:35:36.830 --> 03:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to you know 60 single-family
 
03:35:39.229 --> 03:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
homes on it and so minimum lot size and
 
03:35:42.290 --> 03:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
other density restrictions uh are a
 
03:35:44.750 --> 03:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
significant factor in whether affordable
 
03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
single-family homes are going to be
 
03:35:46.319 --> 03:35:47.330 align:start position:0%
single-family homes are going to be
available

03:35:47.330 --> 03:35:47.340 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:35:51.070 --> 03:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
so here we have a map showing where
 
03:35:53.389 --> 03:35:53.399 align:start position:0%
single-family homes are allowed on less
 
03:35:57.410 --> 03:35:57.420 align:start position:0%
than an acre with less than 200 feet of
 
03:35:59.510 --> 03:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
minimum Road Frontage
 
03:36:01.849 --> 03:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
okay and what we see here is only about
 
03:36:06.349 --> 03:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
16 of the buildable land area in New
 
03:36:08.030 --> 03:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is available for that kind of
 
03:36:10.269 --> 03:36:10.279 align:start position:0%
development so even if we exclude
 
03:36:12.050 --> 03:36:12.060 align:start position:0%
conservation lands like the White
 
03:36:13.490 --> 03:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
Mountain National Forest you see that
 
03:36:15.229 --> 03:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
big gray area in the middle that's what
 
03:36:18.050 --> 03:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
that is uh if we exclude lakes and water
 
03:36:20.210 --> 03:36:20.220 align:start position:0%
bodies and wetlands over 10 acres in
 
03:36:23.389 --> 03:36:23.399 align:start position:0%
sizes are non-buildable areas even if we
 
03:36:25.550 --> 03:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
exclude them only 16 of the rest of the
 
03:36:27.469 --> 03:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
areas available for small lot single
 
03:36:29.750 --> 03:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
family so those are the orange places on
 
03:36:31.969 --> 03:36:31.979 align:start position:0%
the map here and you see that actually a
 
03:36:34.010 --> 03:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
few of the the cities do reasonably well
 
03:36:38.150 --> 03:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
here Nashua Manchester Londonderry
 
03:36:40.870 --> 03:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
um Dover Rochester
 
03:36:44.990 --> 03:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
Somersworth and then a few highly rural
 
03:36:46.910 --> 03:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
areas some without zoning in the kind of
 
03:36:49.610 --> 03:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
Northwestern part of the state but
 
03:36:51.349 --> 03:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
everywhere else you know my town of
 
03:36:52.910 --> 03:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
Amherst for example there's no land
 
03:37:00.170 --> 03:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:03.590 --> 03:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
finding number two uh we were sort of
 
03:37:05.570 --> 03:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
surprised by this we found that two
 
03:37:07.790 --> 03:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
families seems to be the most harshly
 
03:37:10.849 --> 03:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
treated housing type in New Hampshire so
 
03:37:12.410 --> 03:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
there's actually as we're going to see
 
03:37:15.349 --> 03:37:15.359 align:start position:0%
even less land available for
 
03:37:17.389 --> 03:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
um small lot to family than there is
 
03:37:19.550 --> 03:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
either single family or five Family
 
03:37:19.560 --> 03:37:21.110 align:start position:0%
either single family or five Family
actually

03:37:21.110 --> 03:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:37:24.349 --> 03:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
um structures so uh so we find here it's
 
03:37:27.110 --> 03:37:27.120 align:start position:0%
about 11 of the land area is available
 
03:37:29.210 --> 03:37:29.220 align:start position:0%
for duplexes
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
um with a a maximum density of of
 
03:37:35.150 --> 03:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
greater than two units per acre
 
03:37:37.309 --> 03:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
and so again this is a kind of a measure
 
03:37:41.809 --> 03:37:41.819 align:start position:0%
of where you can find and are able to
 
03:37:44.510 --> 03:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
build affordable two family sort of
 
03:37:45.889 --> 03:37:45.899 align:start position:0%
naturally affordable two family
 
03:37:45.899 --> 03:37:47.210 align:start position:0%
naturally affordable two family
structures

03:37:47.210 --> 03:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
structures
 
03:37:50.330 --> 03:37:50.340 align:start position:0%
we also found 70 jurisdictions where two
 
03:37:52.610 --> 03:37:52.620 align:start position:0%
family is just not allowed at all by
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
right you might be able to do it with a
 
03:37:58.070 --> 03:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
special permit but you can't do it by
 
03:37:58.080 --> 03:38:00.550 align:start position:0%
special permit but you can't do it by
right

03:38:00.550 --> 03:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:00.560 --> 03:38:02.450 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:38:02.450 --> 03:38:02.460 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:38:04.550 --> 03:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you again for taking my
 
03:38:07.190 --> 03:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
question is that do you do you expect
 
03:38:08.809 --> 03:38:08.819 align:start position:0%
that that's just it doesn't make any
 
03:38:10.250 --> 03:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
sense right do you expect that that's
 
03:38:14.030 --> 03:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
just pure like stigma around duplexes or
 
03:38:15.889 --> 03:38:15.899 align:start position:0%
what do you think might be causing that
 
03:38:17.809 --> 03:38:17.819 align:start position:0%
you know it's hard to speculate too much
 
03:38:20.690 --> 03:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
but I think part of what's going on here
 
03:38:22.190 --> 03:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
um as we're going to see with five
 
03:38:23.870 --> 03:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
family being more available than two
 
03:38:25.429 --> 03:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
families it probably has something to do
 
03:38:26.929 --> 03:38:26.939 align:start position:0%
with the state's Workforce housing
 
03:38:28.969 --> 03:38:28.979 align:start position:0%
statute it's the workforce housing
 
03:38:31.870 --> 03:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
statute defines uh Workforce
 
03:38:34.670 --> 03:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
multi-family as five units or more in a
 
03:38:36.889 --> 03:38:36.899 align:start position:0%
structure that is Affordable and there's
 
03:38:39.590 --> 03:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
a definition of affordability in there
 
03:38:42.530 --> 03:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
um and so that has probably caused a lot
 
03:38:46.010 --> 03:38:46.020 align:start position:0%
of communities to be a little bit more
 
03:38:49.070 --> 03:38:49.080 align:start position:0%
tolerant of five family than they are of
 
03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
two three and four family but even so it
 
03:38:53.690 --> 03:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
is kind of interesting the other the
 
03:38:55.490 --> 03:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
other feature of this is that two
 
03:38:59.510 --> 03:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
families under state laws not allowed to
 
03:39:02.630 --> 03:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
be subject to site plan review and it
 
03:39:04.070 --> 03:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
could be that some communities think
 
03:39:06.290 --> 03:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
that well with site plan review we can
 
03:39:08.090 --> 03:39:08.100 align:start position:0%
have a public hearing there's some
 
03:39:10.670 --> 03:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
discretion involved maybe we'll allow
 
03:39:13.130 --> 03:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
something if site plan review is
 
03:39:15.170 --> 03:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
available that we will not allow if it's
 
03:39:16.150 --> 03:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
not available
 
03:39:19.070 --> 03:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
again this is somewhat speculative but
 
03:39:20.929 --> 03:39:20.939 align:start position:0%
that may be a reason why three and four
 
03:39:22.309 --> 03:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
families are actually a little bit more
 
03:39:25.130 --> 03:39:25.140 align:start position:0%
widely available than two family
 
03:39:26.809 --> 03:39:26.819 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
03:39:28.790 --> 03:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:39:28.800 --> 03:39:29.450 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

03:39:29.450 --> 03:39:29.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:31.130 --> 03:39:31.140 align:start position:0%
I'm curious
 
03:39:32.929 --> 03:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
um I I should mention I work for hype
 
03:39:34.910 --> 03:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
for 29 years
 
03:39:37.969 --> 03:39:37.979 align:start position:0%
um I'm curious why the definite and you
 
03:39:39.590 --> 03:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
may know this or you may not but if you
 
03:39:41.269 --> 03:39:41.279 align:start position:0%
do I'd be interested
 
03:39:43.969 --> 03:39:43.979 align:start position:0%
um why these definition of Workforce
 
03:39:47.090 --> 03:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
housing is five or more units
 
03:39:48.950 --> 03:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
um normally the definition of
 
03:39:50.990 --> 03:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
multi-family housing is four or more
 
03:39:53.090 --> 03:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
units so do you know why in this case
 
03:39:54.830 --> 03:39:54.840 align:start position:0%
it's five or more
 
03:39:57.229 --> 03:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
that's it's hard to say I mean this was
 
03:39:59.870 --> 03:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
enacted in I think 2008
 
03:40:01.790 --> 03:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
um and so that probably there's
 
03:40:03.590 --> 03:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
something about legislative intent there
 
03:40:05.809 --> 03:40:05.819 align:start position:0%
that that I'm not privy to there is
 
03:40:07.309 --> 03:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
there is history to this representative
 
03:40:08.990 --> 03:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
Gibbs and
 
03:40:12.710 --> 03:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
it was maintained at the time in 2008
 
03:40:16.550 --> 03:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
that five units was the the minimum
 
03:40:19.010 --> 03:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
number of units necessary for a
 
03:40:21.469 --> 03:40:21.479 align:start position:0%
developer profitably to be able to
 
03:40:24.590 --> 03:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
develop multi-family now the statutes
 
03:40:28.429 --> 03:40:28.439 align:start position:0%
have two different definitions of in
 
03:40:30.650 --> 03:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
effect multi-family the workforce
 
03:40:34.550 --> 03:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
housing law says five or more the site
 
03:40:37.969 --> 03:40:37.979 align:start position:0%
plan enabling statute says three or more
 
03:40:39.710 --> 03:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
meaning that's the jurisdictional
 
03:40:42.410 --> 03:40:42.420 align:start position:0%
threshold for planning Board review
 
03:40:45.650 --> 03:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
uh so for a planning board to exercise
 
03:40:48.110 --> 03:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over something other than a
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
single family home as as Jason properly
 
03:40:53.269 --> 03:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
said they cannot do site plan review on
 
03:40:55.790 --> 03:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
a duplex they can do if they want to
 
03:41:00.830 --> 03:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
site plan review on a three Plex or more
 
03:41:02.929 --> 03:41:02.939 align:start position:0%
to meet the requirement of the workforce
 
03:41:05.950 --> 03:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
housing law a municipality must allow
 
03:41:09.590 --> 03:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
five unit structures somewhere it's in
 
03:41:12.170 --> 03:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
some reasonable fashion
 
03:41:13.849 --> 03:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:41:15.170 --> 03:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
thank you both
 
03:41:16.550 --> 03:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:41:22.130 --> 03:41:22.140 align:start position:0%
okay so uh let's move now to uh five
 
03:41:23.530 --> 03:41:23.540 align:start position:0%
plus family
 
03:41:25.910 --> 03:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
and here we have a slightly different
 
03:41:29.929 --> 03:41:29.939 align:start position:0%
map because it shows also where uh five
 
03:41:33.170 --> 03:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
plus family is allowed only with
 
03:41:35.510 --> 03:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
restrictions so either it must be
 
03:41:37.969 --> 03:41:37.979 align:start position:0%
guaranteed affordable or it must be
 
03:41:41.269 --> 03:41:41.279 align:start position:0%
elderly only housing and we see that for
 
03:41:42.650 --> 03:41:42.660 align:start position:0%
instance I think that's Londonderry
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
there in yellow much of its territory is
 
03:41:48.290 --> 03:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
is open to restricted
 
03:41:50.150 --> 03:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
um five plus family
 
03:41:52.910 --> 03:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh and so we see here that small lot 5
 
03:41:54.889 --> 03:41:54.899 align:start position:0%
family is available on somewhat less
 
03:41:58.010 --> 03:41:58.020 align:start position:0%
land than small lot single family was
 
03:42:00.229 --> 03:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
and again this is defined as maximum
 
03:42:01.849 --> 03:42:01.859 align:start position:0%
density of greater than two units per
 
03:42:01.859 --> 03:42:03.650 align:start position:0%
density of greater than two units per
acre

03:42:03.650 --> 03:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
acre
 
03:42:05.389 --> 03:42:05.399 align:start position:0%
um but it is allowed on on more land
 
03:42:09.050 --> 03:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
than the small Lot 2 family was
 
03:42:12.650 --> 03:42:12.660 align:start position:0%
um and so uh overall I think the the
 
03:42:14.630 --> 03:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
conclusion from from all three of these
 
03:42:16.130 --> 03:42:16.140 align:start position:0%
findings is however that the vast
 
03:42:19.610 --> 03:42:19.620 align:start position:0%
majority of land is not available for
 
03:42:22.330 --> 03:42:22.340 align:start position:0%
um moderately dense housing of any type
 
03:42:25.790 --> 03:42:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh so that's going to be over 80 percent
 
03:42:27.469 --> 03:42:27.479 align:start position:0%
of the land areas not available for
 
03:42:29.630 --> 03:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
small lot single family two family or
 
03:42:32.090 --> 03:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
five family or anything in between
 
03:42:33.650 --> 03:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
and with that I'll turn it over to you
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:40.910 --> 03:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
Jason present the the remaining two uh
 
03:42:43.250 --> 03:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
findings that we have the and these just
 
03:42:45.650 --> 03:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
bear in mind uh these are five findings
 
03:42:48.650 --> 03:42:48.660 align:start position:0%
that we chose because they really
 
03:42:51.530 --> 03:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
um uh struck us as being important uh
 
03:42:54.050 --> 03:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
but this is very preliminary uh and
 
03:42:56.809 --> 03:42:56.819 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more to learn about the
 
03:42:58.849 --> 03:42:58.859 align:start position:0%
data that are available and will be
 
03:43:01.969 --> 03:43:01.979 align:start position:0%
ourselves studying it and relying on
 
03:43:04.130 --> 03:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
others to do the same finding number
 
03:43:07.550 --> 03:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
four uh looks at a region of the state
 
03:43:09.170 --> 03:43:09.180 align:start position:0%
and so this is Manchester and it's
 
03:43:11.389 --> 03:43:11.399 align:start position:0%
surrounding seven communities and we
 
03:43:14.929 --> 03:43:14.939 align:start position:0%
wanted to essentially zoom in on a a
 
03:43:17.330 --> 03:43:17.340 align:start position:0%
portion of the state to do a more
 
03:43:20.510 --> 03:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
in-depth analysis of this and to
 
03:43:22.370 --> 03:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
demonstrate one of the really important
 
03:43:24.349 --> 03:43:24.359 align:start position:0%
functions of the zoning Atlas and that
 
03:43:27.110 --> 03:43:27.120 align:start position:0%
is it can be combined with other sets of
 
03:43:27.120 --> 03:43:28.130 align:start position:0%
is it can be combined with other sets of
data

03:43:28.130 --> 03:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
data
 
03:43:30.590 --> 03:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
and so what we did here was we took the
 
03:43:33.530 --> 03:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
data that are in the zoning Atlas and
 
03:43:36.229 --> 03:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
combined it with data showing the
 
03:43:38.150 --> 03:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
footprint of buildings
 
03:43:40.670 --> 03:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
that is demonstrating that a property
 
03:43:43.070 --> 03:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
has already been developed so while the
 
03:43:46.190 --> 03:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
zoning Atlas itself might say that for
 
03:43:48.290 --> 03:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
these eight communities Manchester and
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
its surrounding seven communities 21 of
 
03:43:53.630 --> 03:43:53.640 align:start position:0%
the land is available for development in
 
03:43:56.570 --> 03:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
fact a good portion of that has already
 
03:43:57.889 --> 03:43:57.899 align:start position:0%
been developed
 
03:44:00.769 --> 03:44:00.779 align:start position:0%
meaning when you combine these two data
 
03:44:02.690 --> 03:44:02.700 align:start position:0%
sets the zoning Atlas and the the
 
03:44:04.670 --> 03:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
footprint data that we had available to
 
03:44:08.690 --> 03:44:08.700 align:start position:0%
us only 7.8 percent of the land area is
 
03:44:10.910 --> 03:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
available for development
 
03:44:15.170 --> 03:44:15.180 align:start position:0%
that means not a lot in these uh fairly
 
03:44:17.030 --> 03:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
densely developed communities you know
 
03:44:19.370 --> 03:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
Manchester Bedford would argue that it's
 
03:44:21.950 --> 03:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
fairly built out Londonderry might also
 
03:44:24.170 --> 03:44:24.180 align:start position:0%
there's opportunity there perhaps for
 
03:44:26.269 --> 03:44:26.279 align:start position:0%
redevelopment of existing areas that
 
03:44:27.950 --> 03:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
have places that already have
 
03:44:30.590 --> 03:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
development but that's a lot tougher to
 
03:44:30.600 --> 03:44:32.389 align:start position:0%
development but that's a lot tougher to
do

03:44:32.389 --> 03:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:44:34.550 --> 03:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
so let's go to the next one and the last
 
03:44:37.130 --> 03:44:37.140 align:start position:0%
uh finding and this like the like
 
03:44:39.889 --> 03:44:39.899 align:start position:0%
finding number four this this shows an
 
03:44:41.750 --> 03:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
important utility of the zoning Atlas
 
03:44:43.910 --> 03:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
the ability to combine different
 
03:44:46.250 --> 03:44:46.260 align:start position:0%
attributes so what we did here looking
 
03:44:48.830 --> 03:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
at accessory dwelling units
 
03:44:51.769 --> 03:44:51.779 align:start position:0%
um and and looking at uh how
 
03:44:55.190 --> 03:44:55.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities approach uh their legal
 
03:44:58.070 --> 03:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
obligation under statutes to allow
 
03:45:01.250 --> 03:45:01.260 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units but also in
 
03:45:03.349 --> 03:45:03.359 align:start position:0%
some cases to impose restrictions which
 
03:45:07.550 --> 03:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
they legally can do making it harder to
 
03:45:09.889 --> 03:45:09.899 align:start position:0%
develop accessory dwelling units the
 
03:45:11.450 --> 03:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
bright yellow color
 
03:45:15.530 --> 03:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
shows those areas that where two parking
 
03:45:17.630 --> 03:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
spaces are required for any accessory
 
03:45:19.729 --> 03:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
developing unit no matter the size so
 
03:45:22.250 --> 03:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
you could have a studio apartment where
 
03:45:24.469 --> 03:45:24.479 align:start position:0%
really only one person possibly could
 
03:45:27.170 --> 03:45:27.180 align:start position:0%
live without you know having to trample
 
03:45:29.750 --> 03:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
over the other person they're not likely
 
03:45:32.150 --> 03:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
to have two cars and yet the
 
03:45:34.610 --> 03:45:34.620 align:start position:0%
municipality requires two parking spaces
 
03:45:37.849 --> 03:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
or uh and so that's one attribute the
 
03:45:39.950 --> 03:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
other is whether a public process is
 
03:45:42.710 --> 03:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
required uh irrespective of the number
 
03:45:44.809 --> 03:45:44.819 align:start position:0%
of parking spaces so these two things
 
03:45:47.090 --> 03:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
merge together show those communities
 
03:45:49.849 --> 03:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
where it is quite a bit more difficult
 
03:45:52.429 --> 03:45:52.439 align:start position:0%
to build accessory dwelling units to get
 
03:45:55.849 --> 03:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
a permit to do it and you see that
 
03:45:57.530 --> 03:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
throughout the state that that's an
 
03:45:59.929 --> 03:45:59.939 align:start position:0%
awful lot of the state's municipalities
 
03:46:02.870 --> 03:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
that make it tough to develop accessory
 
03:46:04.969 --> 03:46:04.979 align:start position:0%
dwelling units which is probably the
 
03:46:07.670 --> 03:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
most innocuous way of increasing our
 
03:46:10.729 --> 03:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
housing Supply so so to clarify
 
03:46:14.510 --> 03:46:14.520 align:start position:0%
a municipality can require two spots on
 
03:46:16.910 --> 03:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
any additional ad you build so it's only
 
03:46:18.530 --> 03:46:18.540 align:start position:0%
one by right but
 
03:46:20.809 --> 03:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to require up to two
 
03:46:22.910 --> 03:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
spots in addition to the Adu a a
 
03:46:25.429 --> 03:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
municipality may require and the law
 
03:46:28.790 --> 03:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
calls for adequate parking what is
 
03:46:30.769 --> 03:46:30.779 align:start position:0%
adequate is up to the municipality to
 
03:46:30.779 --> 03:46:32.269 align:start position:0%
adequate is up to the municipality to
decide

03:46:32.269 --> 03:46:32.279 align:start position:0%
decide
 
03:46:34.969 --> 03:46:34.979 align:start position:0%
and so the legislature defines adequate
 
03:46:37.429 --> 03:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
parking for the purpose of an Adu unless
 
03:46:39.590 --> 03:46:39.600 align:start position:0%
the unless the legislature intervened
 
03:46:43.309 --> 03:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
and limited that Municipal Authority so
 
03:46:46.550 --> 03:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
you see on this Madeline the the the the
 
03:46:48.530 --> 03:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
pink colors
 
03:46:50.450 --> 03:46:50.460 align:start position:0%
are those municipalities that require
 
03:46:53.210 --> 03:46:53.220 align:start position:0%
more than two parking spaces for an
 
03:46:54.889 --> 03:46:54.899 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit
 
03:46:57.050 --> 03:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
I won't call them out but
 
03:46:58.849 --> 03:46:58.859 align:start position:0%
um you can see where they are and you
 
03:47:00.650 --> 03:47:00.660 align:start position:0%
can compare on the map which communities
 
03:47:03.830 --> 03:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
do that so for an accessory apartment
 
03:47:06.469 --> 03:47:06.479 align:start position:0%
that may be a studio the municipality
 
03:47:09.229 --> 03:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
might require three parking spaces or
 
03:47:11.389 --> 03:47:11.399 align:start position:0%
four parking spaces because they deem
 
03:47:12.650 --> 03:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
that to be
 
03:47:12.660 --> 03:47:16.010 align:start position:0%
that to be
adequate

03:47:16.010 --> 03:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:18.590 --> 03:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
let's move on now to our implications
 
03:47:20.870 --> 03:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
and impact oh
 
03:47:25.550 --> 03:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:28.429 --> 03:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
okay representative Gibbs oh thank you
 
03:47:30.889 --> 03:47:30.899 align:start position:0%
um has anyone ever uh tried challenging
 
03:47:32.389 --> 03:47:32.399 align:start position:0%
that in court
 
03:47:35.630 --> 03:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
um that requiring two or three or four
 
03:47:39.410 --> 03:47:39.420 align:start position:0%
parking spaces as adequate parking
 
03:47:42.590 --> 03:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
um is essentially a violation of the
 
03:47:45.050 --> 03:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
common sense definition of the term
 
03:47:47.330 --> 03:47:47.340 align:start position:0%
adequate in the statute
 
03:47:49.849 --> 03:47:49.859 align:start position:0%
uh as far as I'm no as far as I know
 
03:47:51.950 --> 03:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
Representative no one has yet challenged
 
03:47:54.349 --> 03:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh that sort of requirement
 
03:47:57.229 --> 03:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
but it may be it may be um ripe for a
 
03:47:57.239 --> 03:47:58.490 align:start position:0%
but it may be it may be um ripe for a
challenge

03:47:58.490 --> 03:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
03:48:00.889 --> 03:48:00.899 align:start position:0%
uh we want to move on to the uh
 
03:48:04.370 --> 03:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
implications and the impact of the atlas
 
03:48:06.290 --> 03:48:06.300 align:start position:0%
um and first off uh
 
03:48:10.370 --> 03:48:10.380 align:start position:0%
the zoning Atlas itself is agnostic it
 
03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't make judgments it simply
 
03:48:14.570 --> 03:48:14.580 align:start position:0%
provides data
 
03:48:18.349 --> 03:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
in an effort to provide folks with the
 
03:48:19.969 --> 03:48:19.979 align:start position:0%
information available to answer
 
03:48:22.370 --> 03:48:22.380 align:start position:0%
questions so first off what is it that
 
03:48:24.590 --> 03:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
people need to know about zoning
 
03:48:28.070 --> 03:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
what is its impact on development and in
 
03:48:30.410 --> 03:48:30.420 align:start position:0%
particular and this is what really drove
 
03:48:33.530 --> 03:48:33.540 align:start position:0%
this team to develop the zoning Atlas
 
03:48:36.229 --> 03:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
what is the relationship between zoning
 
03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
and Housing Development
 
03:48:42.170 --> 03:48:42.180 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't doesn't judge it doesn't
 
03:48:44.870 --> 03:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
provide necessarily the answers but it
 
03:48:47.389 --> 03:48:47.399 align:start position:0%
provides the tools to people who have
 
03:48:50.870 --> 03:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
the questions to get the answers
 
03:48:53.750 --> 03:48:53.760 align:start position:0%
and then really backing up what is what
 
03:48:56.269 --> 03:48:56.279 align:start position:0%
is the purpose of zoning
 
03:48:58.969 --> 03:48:58.979 align:start position:0%
anyway you know if you go back we've had
 
03:49:01.250 --> 03:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
zoning in New Hampshire for now almost
 
03:49:02.929 --> 03:49:02.939 align:start position:0%
100 years
 
03:49:05.630 --> 03:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
it's in the mid-1920s when the
 
03:49:09.590 --> 03:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
legislature passed uh it's a a form of
 
03:49:11.809 --> 03:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
what was then called the the standard
 
03:49:14.570 --> 03:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
State zoning enabling act which was a a
 
03:49:16.849 --> 03:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
model that was promulgated by the
 
03:49:18.950 --> 03:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
federal government under the the U.S
 
03:49:21.290 --> 03:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
Department of Commerce uh in the in the
 
03:49:25.130 --> 03:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
20s New Hampshire adopted a late draft
 
03:49:28.550 --> 03:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
of that in I think 1925.
 
03:49:32.330 --> 03:49:32.340 align:start position:0%
and that was that uh in the city of
 
03:49:35.450 --> 03:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
Manchester adopted zoning under that and
 
03:49:37.550 --> 03:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
that was upheld by the New Hampshire
 
03:49:40.370 --> 03:49:40.380 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court as a legitimate exercise
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
of what is known as the police power
 
03:49:46.550 --> 03:49:46.560 align:start position:0%
that is to protect public health safety
 
03:49:48.290 --> 03:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
and Welfare
 
03:49:50.750 --> 03:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
that is the essence of the police power
 
03:49:53.929 --> 03:49:53.939 align:start position:0%
and this is a power that is uh inherent
 
03:49:57.229 --> 03:49:57.239 align:start position:0%
in the legislature and given two
 
03:50:00.170 --> 03:50:00.180 align:start position:0%
municipalities through acts that you
 
03:50:00.180 --> 03:50:02.870 align:start position:0%
municipalities through acts that you
adopt

03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:04.490 --> 03:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
um over time
 
03:50:07.670 --> 03:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
uh the interpretation of what zoning is
 
03:50:11.690 --> 03:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
for has dramatically expanded and I
 
03:50:13.969 --> 03:50:13.979 align:start position:0%
would say in some cases has been
 
03:50:13.979 --> 03:50:15.590 align:start position:0%
would say in some cases has been
contorted

03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
contorted
 
03:50:19.370 --> 03:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
so in the 70s and 80s we had a real
 
03:50:21.950 --> 03:50:21.960 align:start position:0%
really boom booming time for development
 
03:50:25.849 --> 03:50:25.859 align:start position:0%
and population growth uh and we see a
 
03:50:28.729 --> 03:50:28.739 align:start position:0%
response to that among municipalities to
 
03:50:32.210 --> 03:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
say no we don't want to grow anymore to
 
03:50:34.309 --> 03:50:34.319 align:start position:0%
dramatically limit any kind of
 
03:50:37.910 --> 03:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
development except uh in some cases a
 
03:50:40.370 --> 03:50:40.380 align:start position:0%
single-family large lot development
 
03:50:43.130 --> 03:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
and the fruits of that you see now in
 
03:50:45.050 --> 03:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
the maps we just showed what is the
 
03:50:47.990 --> 03:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
ability of anyone in any Community to
 
03:50:51.650 --> 03:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
develop a small home on a small lot it
 
03:50:54.170 --> 03:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
is dramatically constrained you can't
 
03:50:57.110 --> 03:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
build starter homes in New Hampshire for
 
03:50:59.330 --> 03:50:59.340 align:start position:0%
the most part
 
03:51:01.250 --> 03:51:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
03:51:04.670 --> 03:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to tell you what
 
03:51:06.889 --> 03:51:06.899 align:start position:0%
I'm hearing and see if I am in fact
 
03:51:08.450 --> 03:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
hearing you correctly so you're saying
 
03:51:10.490 --> 03:51:10.500 align:start position:0%
that even the variability for a
 
03:51:13.250 --> 03:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
municipality to have zoning was approved
 
03:51:14.870 --> 03:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
originally for the health safety and
 
03:51:18.050 --> 03:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
Welfare of people and now over the last
 
03:51:20.150 --> 03:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
hundred years we've seen that not just
 
03:51:22.370 --> 03:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
move Beyond well outside of that scope
 
03:51:23.870 --> 03:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
of health safety and Welfare but
 
03:51:26.090 --> 03:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
actually working actively against the
 
03:51:28.969 --> 03:51:28.979 align:start position:0%
health safety and Welfare of people
 
03:51:32.210 --> 03:51:32.220 align:start position:0%
I think you can make that argument uh
 
03:51:35.630 --> 03:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
there are many communities in New
 
03:51:37.729 --> 03:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and throughout the country
 
03:51:41.030 --> 03:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
frankly that use Zoning for the purpose
 
03:51:43.090 --> 03:51:43.100 align:start position:0%
of exclusion
 
03:51:47.570 --> 03:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
whether it is based on fear of change or
 
03:51:49.670 --> 03:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
fear of people who are different from
 
03:51:53.330 --> 03:51:53.340 align:start position:0%
them or fear of development generally it
 
03:51:55.429 --> 03:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
is it is uh something that
 
03:51:57.769 --> 03:51:57.779 align:start position:0%
municipalities have done whether
 
03:52:00.110 --> 03:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
consciously or not
 
03:52:02.510 --> 03:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
and I would say over the past couple
 
03:52:04.550 --> 03:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
decades have become increasingly
 
03:52:07.490 --> 03:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
sophisticated at doing it so it's harder
 
03:52:10.250 --> 03:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
to challenge these sorts of things in
 
03:52:10.260 --> 03:52:12.290 align:start position:0%
to challenge these sorts of things in
court

03:52:12.290 --> 03:52:12.300 align:start position:0%
court
 
03:52:14.929 --> 03:52:14.939 align:start position:0%
um yeah I know I've already said this is
 
03:52:17.929 --> 03:52:17.939 align:start position:0%
a state delegated power and you the
 
03:52:20.990 --> 03:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
legislature have the ability then to say
 
03:52:23.530 --> 03:52:23.540 align:start position:0%
how that power is used you're giving
 
03:52:26.929 --> 03:52:26.939 align:start position:0%
municipalities this Authority
 
03:52:30.410 --> 03:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
you have the authority to say yes but
 
03:52:34.190 --> 03:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
and a couple of those circumstances are
 
03:52:37.070 --> 03:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
the accessory dwelling unit law it is a
 
03:52:40.269 --> 03:52:40.279 align:start position:0%
state law zoning mandate you require
 
03:52:43.610 --> 03:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
municipalities to allow at least one
 
03:52:45.290 --> 03:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
attached accessory dwelling unit
 
03:52:48.830 --> 03:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
wherever a single-family home is allowed
 
03:52:50.630 --> 03:52:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
03:52:52.729 --> 03:52:52.739 align:start position:0%
there's flexibility in that law we
 
03:52:54.290 --> 03:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
talked about the parking requirements
 
03:52:57.229 --> 03:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
there's other points of flexibility in
 
03:53:01.130 --> 03:53:01.140 align:start position:0%
what the legislature adopted in 2016 and
 
03:53:02.870 --> 03:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
there are a good number of
 
03:53:05.570 --> 03:53:05.580 align:start position:0%
municipalities that use that flexibility
 
03:53:07.250 --> 03:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
to the max
 
03:53:10.130 --> 03:53:10.140 align:start position:0%
to limit Property Owners ability to
 
03:53:12.530 --> 03:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
build accessory dwelling units they make
 
03:53:14.690 --> 03:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
it very difficult practically and
 
03:53:14.700 --> 03:53:16.250 align:start position:0%
it very difficult practically and
feasible

03:53:16.250 --> 03:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
feasible
 
03:53:19.309 --> 03:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
a second instance of where you the
 
03:53:21.769 --> 03:53:21.779 align:start position:0%
legislature have told municipalities
 
03:53:24.590 --> 03:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
yes you can Zone but is the workforce
 
03:53:26.809 --> 03:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
housing law adopted by the legislature
 
03:53:28.690 --> 03:53:28.700 align:start position:0%
in 2008
 
03:53:32.269 --> 03:53:32.279 align:start position:0%
it requires that the basic requirement
 
03:53:34.550 --> 03:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
is that municipalities must allow
 
03:53:36.830 --> 03:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
through their zoning ordinances if they
 
03:53:38.570 --> 03:53:38.580 align:start position:0%
choose to have one
 
03:53:40.610 --> 03:53:40.620 align:start position:0%
they must allow a reasonable and
 
03:53:42.170 --> 03:53:42.180 align:start position:0%
realistic opportunity for the
 
03:53:43.670 --> 03:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
development of Workforce housing
 
03:53:46.250 --> 03:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
generally speaking
 
03:53:49.250 --> 03:53:49.260 align:start position:0%
part of that is that municipalities must
 
03:53:51.849 --> 03:53:51.859 align:start position:0%
allow as I said earlier in some place
 
03:53:54.050 --> 03:53:54.060 align:start position:0%
within their municipalities in a
 
03:53:55.389 --> 03:53:55.399 align:start position:0%
reasonable Place
 
03:53:58.969 --> 03:53:58.979 align:start position:0%
multi-unit structures of five five units
 
03:54:00.410 --> 03:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
or more
 
03:54:02.210 --> 03:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
they have to do that
 
03:54:04.849 --> 03:54:04.859 align:start position:0%
and so as as Jason pointed out with the
 
03:54:07.309 --> 03:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
the the comparison of the duplexes
 
03:54:09.170 --> 03:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
versus the five flexes because
 
03:54:11.570 --> 03:54:11.580 align:start position:0%
municipalities have been required to
 
03:54:14.330 --> 03:54:14.340 align:start position:0%
meet this requirement of of allowing for
 
03:54:17.330 --> 03:54:17.340 align:start position:0%
five Plex units somewhere it may be
 
03:54:19.910 --> 03:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
easier to develop a five unit structure
 
03:54:21.290 --> 03:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
in that town
 
03:54:22.790 --> 03:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
that I duplex
 
03:54:25.189 --> 03:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
and that just doesn't make sense
 
03:54:27.889 --> 03:54:27.899 align:start position:0%
uh so and this represents the fact that
 
03:54:30.729 --> 03:54:30.739 align:start position:0%
some municipalities will do the
 
03:54:33.889 --> 03:54:33.899 align:start position:0%
absolute minimum
 
03:54:36.469 --> 03:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
even if it defies logic
 
03:54:38.450 --> 03:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
because that's what the law tells them
 
03:54:42.889 --> 03:54:42.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:45.650 --> 03:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
so where does this lead us
 
03:54:48.650 --> 03:54:48.660 align:start position:0%
I can represent four questions thank you
 
03:54:50.929 --> 03:54:50.939 align:start position:0%
along the lines of Workforce housing uh
 
03:54:53.450 --> 03:54:53.460 align:start position:0%
is there a formula a percentage formula
 
03:54:56.389 --> 03:54:56.399 align:start position:0%
based on population there is no formula
 
03:54:59.210 --> 03:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
uh representative and this there is a a
 
03:55:01.550 --> 03:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
really strong legislative history on
 
03:55:04.849 --> 03:55:04.859 align:start position:0%
this that goes back to before uh the
 
03:55:06.410 --> 03:55:06.420 align:start position:0%
year in which the workforce housing law
 
03:55:08.870 --> 03:55:08.880 align:start position:0%
was adopted goes back
 
03:55:13.849 --> 03:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
well in 2003 Senate Bill 95 passed the
 
03:55:16.910 --> 03:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
Senate wound up in the house uh got uh
 
03:55:18.950 --> 03:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
retained by the house Municipal and
 
03:55:21.410 --> 03:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
County government committee and then in
 
03:55:24.830 --> 03:55:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh 20 in 2004 and January ultimately the
 
03:55:27.229 --> 03:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
the bill died but there was a lot of
 
03:55:29.570 --> 03:55:29.580 align:start position:0%
consideration in those two years of what
 
03:55:32.450 --> 03:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
sorts of requirements might be imposed
 
03:55:34.849 --> 03:55:34.859 align:start position:0%
by the legislature or are there safe
 
03:55:37.070 --> 03:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
harbors for certain municipalities that
 
03:55:39.650 --> 03:55:39.660 align:start position:0%
are doing certain things and in the end
 
03:55:43.070 --> 03:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature said no to all of that
 
03:55:46.910 --> 03:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
come up to 2008 and what the legislature
 
03:55:49.969 --> 03:55:49.979 align:start position:0%
did was look at a much simpler much more
 
03:55:51.889 --> 03:55:51.899 align:start position:0%
streamlined approach to this
 
03:55:51.899 --> 03:55:53.650 align:start position:0%
streamlined approach to this
consideration

03:55:53.650 --> 03:55:53.660 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
03:55:56.269 --> 03:55:56.279 align:start position:0%
that does not look at mathematical
 
03:55:59.450 --> 03:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
formulas uh does not look at uh you know
 
03:56:01.849 --> 03:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
what proportion a municipality must have
 
03:56:04.189 --> 03:56:04.199 align:start position:0%
based on population or school children
 
03:56:05.870 --> 03:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
or whatever measure you want to come up
 
03:56:09.469 --> 03:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
with they simply said you you they the
 
03:56:12.110 --> 03:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
legislature said that municipalities
 
03:56:15.710 --> 03:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
must provide their fair share of a
 
03:56:18.170 --> 03:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
Region's need leaving it up to the
 
03:56:20.269 --> 03:56:20.279 align:start position:0%
municipality to figure out what the fair
 
03:56:22.729 --> 03:56:22.739 align:start position:0%
share is right now
 
03:56:24.410 --> 03:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
the regional planning commissions are
 
03:56:26.990 --> 03:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
working on those Regional Housing needs
 
03:56:29.030 --> 03:56:29.040 align:start position:0%
assessments which I think for the most
 
03:56:31.150 --> 03:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
part will have some sort of
 
03:56:34.490 --> 03:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
recommended fair share allocation
 
03:56:36.469 --> 03:56:36.479 align:start position:0%
so is there any teeth behind that at all
 
03:56:38.570 --> 03:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
it's just a recommendation from the
 
03:56:41.210 --> 03:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
regional planning commissions or well I
 
03:56:42.530 --> 03:56:42.540 align:start position:0%
I think they're
 
03:56:45.290 --> 03:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
it's not uh it's not they're not
 
03:56:47.809 --> 03:56:47.819 align:start position:0%
required to do that by law so it is
 
03:56:49.849 --> 03:56:49.859 align:start position:0%
purely a recommendation I think it would
 
03:56:52.910 --> 03:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
have some weight in litigation but a
 
03:56:54.590 --> 03:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
developer could propose their own
 
03:56:56.510 --> 03:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
analysis that might be contrary to what
 
03:56:58.429 --> 03:56:58.439 align:start position:0%
a regional plan commission would propose
 
03:56:58.439 --> 03:56:59.389 align:start position:0%
a regional plan commission would propose
okay

03:56:59.389 --> 03:56:59.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:57:01.490 --> 03:57:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:57:01.500 --> 03:57:02.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

03:57:02.870 --> 03:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:57:05.689 --> 03:57:05.699 align:start position:0%
um where were we okay so
 
03:57:08.450 --> 03:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
um room for change there's opportunity
 
03:57:11.510 --> 03:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
here and the zoning Atlas provides a lot
 
03:57:14.450 --> 03:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
of uh the capacity to analyze uh what
 
03:57:17.570 --> 03:57:17.580 align:start position:0%
what we might seek to do
 
03:57:19.849 --> 03:57:19.859 align:start position:0%
one thing is we don't need to flood our
 
03:57:21.889 --> 03:57:21.899 align:start position:0%
communities with new housing but there
 
03:57:25.790 --> 03:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
is opportunity for modest increases in
 
03:57:27.590 --> 03:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
housing construction that would be
 
03:57:30.769 --> 03:57:30.779 align:start position:0%
facilitated by Modest changes
 
03:57:33.050 --> 03:57:33.060 align:start position:0%
to the regulatory structure in
 
03:57:34.670 --> 03:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
particular zoning
 
03:57:38.450 --> 03:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
I think we we acknowledge uh that zoning
 
03:57:41.450 --> 03:57:41.460 align:start position:0%
barriers in particular impede economic
 
03:57:43.189 --> 03:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
growth Statewide because it the
 
03:57:45.469 --> 03:57:45.479 align:start position:0%
limitations on housing means that people
 
03:57:47.750 --> 03:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
can't move to New Hampshire to take jobs
 
03:57:50.990 --> 03:57:51.000 align:start position:0%
ask any employer I was talking this
 
03:57:53.090 --> 03:57:53.100 align:start position:0%
morning with Steve Anin who's the
 
03:57:54.170 --> 03:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire Hospital
 
03:57:57.830 --> 03:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
Association and he said every hospital
 
03:58:01.309 --> 03:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
is desperate for workers I think it's
 
03:58:05.210 --> 03:58:05.220 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Health has a thousand openings
 
03:58:07.550 --> 03:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
thousand openings that they can't fill
 
03:58:09.590 --> 03:58:09.600 align:start position:0%
and part of the reason is
 
03:58:12.410 --> 03:58:12.420 align:start position:0%
there's not enough housing even though
 
03:58:15.050 --> 03:58:15.060 align:start position:0%
places like Lebanon are really doing a
 
03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
good job in permitting new housing
 
03:58:17.399 --> 03:58:18.490 align:start position:0%
good job in permitting new housing
Construction

03:58:18.490 --> 03:58:18.500 align:start position:0%
Construction
 
03:58:21.170 --> 03:58:21.180 align:start position:0%
more needs to be done not just by the
 
03:58:23.330 --> 03:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
lebanons of the world but by the other
 
03:58:26.090 --> 03:58:26.100 align:start position:0%
communities around them too
 
03:58:28.969 --> 03:58:28.979 align:start position:0%
so the zoning Atlas data shows that
 
03:58:31.550 --> 03:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
there's a lot that can be done
 
03:58:34.189 --> 03:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
in our communities to make them more
 
03:58:36.530 --> 03:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
welcoming to housing and that's the
 
03:58:38.330 --> 03:58:38.340 align:start position:0%
bottom line and you
 
03:58:40.130 --> 03:58:40.140 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
03:58:44.870 --> 03:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:46.790 --> 03:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
so with that
 
03:58:47.990 --> 03:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
um we have a little bit of a
 
03:58:50.450 --> 03:58:50.460 align:start position:0%
demonstration for you um
 
03:58:52.849 --> 03:58:52.859 align:start position:0%
two things to show you uh the first is
 
03:58:55.370 --> 03:58:55.380 align:start position:0%
the Atlas itself so if you give me one
 
03:58:55.380 --> 03:58:56.330 align:start position:0%
the Atlas itself so if you give me one
moment

03:58:56.330 --> 03:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
moment
 
03:58:58.189 --> 03:58:58.199 align:start position:0%
um I'd actually just go directly to the
 
03:58:58.199 --> 03:58:59.750 align:start position:0%
um I'd actually just go directly to the
link

03:58:59.750 --> 03:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
link
 
03:59:03.610 --> 03:59:03.620 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to reload this as it
 
03:59:06.229 --> 03:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
one moment the internet seems to have
 
03:59:16.150 --> 03:59:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:19.610 --> 03:59:19.620 align:start position:0%
so the atlas itself will be available
 
03:59:22.250 --> 03:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
for the public and I'm just going to
 
03:59:23.689 --> 03:59:23.699 align:start position:0%
show you what it looks like so when they
 
03:59:25.490 --> 03:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
first appear there's a pop-up box that
 
03:59:27.530 --> 03:59:27.540 align:start position:0%
gives them some basic instructions about
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
how to use the atlas which I'm not going
 
03:59:30.170 --> 03:59:30.180 align:start position:0%
to go through because I'm going to
 
03:59:33.950 --> 03:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
explain that verbally so uh the initial
 
03:59:36.710 --> 03:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
view is of the entire State and it's
 
03:59:38.809 --> 03:59:38.819 align:start position:0%
color coded by um
 
03:59:42.290 --> 03:59:42.300 align:start position:0%
uh the type of use so you have primarily
 
03:59:44.090 --> 03:59:44.100 align:start position:0%
residential as Jason had mentioned which
 
03:59:46.130 --> 03:59:46.140 align:start position:0%
is colored in Orange you have mixed with
 
03:59:48.769 --> 03:59:48.779 align:start position:0%
residential so some residential can be
 
03:59:50.389 --> 03:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
built but perhaps it's commercial and
 
03:59:51.950 --> 03:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
also industrial or something like that
 
03:59:54.349 --> 03:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
and then you have non-residential which
 
03:59:58.849 --> 03:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
is purple those would be conservation
 
03:59:58.859 --> 04:00:00.729 align:start position:0%
is purple those would be conservation
um

04:00:00.729 --> 04:00:00.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:03.410 --> 04:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
and Commercial and Industrial
 
04:00:05.030 --> 04:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
and then of course you have the gray
 
04:00:07.969 --> 04:00:07.979 align:start position:0%
area uh which is um sort of permanent
 
04:00:11.269 --> 04:00:11.279 align:start position:0%
conservation or Wetlands or water
 
04:00:11.279 --> 04:00:12.590 align:start position:0%
conservation or Wetlands or water
bottles

04:00:12.590 --> 04:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
bottles
 
04:00:15.170 --> 04:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
so um what can be done with this let's
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
see let me see if I can
 
04:00:19.910 --> 04:00:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh so you see on the top on the left you
 
04:00:22.250 --> 04:00:22.260 align:start position:0%
can toggle uh for one family two family
 
04:00:24.790 --> 04:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
three family four family or five family
 
04:00:27.349 --> 04:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
so for example at the state level
 
04:00:28.929 --> 04:00:28.939 align:start position:0%
without getting into districts or
 
04:00:31.910 --> 04:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions we can toggle five family
 
04:00:33.889 --> 04:00:33.899 align:start position:0%
and you can suddenly see now
 
04:00:36.769 --> 04:00:36.779 align:start position:0%
um that the orange areas are a very
 
04:00:38.269 --> 04:00:38.279 align:start position:0%
small percentage of the state where five
 
04:00:40.969 --> 04:00:40.979 align:start position:0%
family are permitted
 
04:00:43.969 --> 04:00:43.979 align:start position:0%
also down at the bottom you can
 
04:00:45.790 --> 04:00:45.800 align:start position:0%
toggle for
 
04:00:47.870 --> 04:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
multi-family that's age restricted and
 
04:00:49.070 --> 04:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there's some communities
 
04:00:50.809 --> 04:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire that do allow
 
04:00:52.550 --> 04:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
multi-families but they're restricted to
 
04:00:55.010 --> 04:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh to elderly
 
04:00:56.750 --> 04:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
um and for some reason it's not showing
 
04:00:58.610 --> 04:00:58.620 align:start position:0%
off here but the very bottom is
 
04:01:01.490 --> 04:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing uh multi-family and
 
04:01:04.010 --> 04:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there is one area of
 
04:01:06.110 --> 04:01:06.120 align:start position:0%
here in the Hanover area
 
04:01:09.950 --> 04:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
Hancock area that allows multi-family
 
04:01:10.969 --> 04:01:10.979 align:start position:0%
but only
 
04:01:10.979 --> 04:01:12.290 align:start position:0%
but only
um

04:01:12.290 --> 04:01:12.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:14.090 --> 04:01:14.100 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing
 
04:01:15.710 --> 04:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
so maybe I should zoom out here now
 
04:01:19.450 --> 04:01:19.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:21.410 --> 04:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
I got it
 
04:01:22.910 --> 04:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you yes
 
04:01:24.530 --> 04:01:24.540 align:start position:0%
we've just learned how to use this this
 
04:01:27.349 --> 04:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
week so thank you there you go so um
 
04:01:29.870 --> 04:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
also uh what we can do so let me just uh
 
04:01:31.849 --> 04:01:31.859 align:start position:0%
refresh here
 
04:01:33.410 --> 04:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
uh you can
 
04:01:33.420 --> 04:01:37.130 align:start position:0%
uh you can
um

04:01:37.130 --> 04:01:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:38.630 --> 04:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
okay you can
 
04:01:42.229 --> 04:01:42.239 align:start position:0%
um look for a lot size so if we were to
 
04:01:44.689 --> 04:01:44.699 align:start position:0%
put in for example
 
04:01:47.870 --> 04:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
um small lot so let's say 0 to 1 acre
 
04:01:51.769 --> 04:01:51.779 align:start position:0%
and apply that we can see again how very
 
04:01:53.769 --> 04:01:53.779 align:start position:0%
smooth very few
 
04:01:56.689 --> 04:01:56.699 align:start position:0%
areas of the state permit small lot
 
04:01:58.910 --> 04:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
single-family homes
 
04:02:00.410 --> 04:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
and just to play with this a little bit
 
04:02:03.590 --> 04:02:03.600 align:start position:0%
let's see how many how much requires a
 
04:02:05.510 --> 04:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
minimum of five acres
 
04:02:07.490 --> 04:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
for a single family home so let's just
 
04:02:09.530 --> 04:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
say five to one hundred so you have to
 
04:02:11.150 --> 04:02:11.160 align:start position:0%
have a minimum five and there's actually
 
04:02:13.370 --> 04:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
some areas of the state that say that
 
04:02:15.830 --> 04:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
you need five acres in order to build a
 
04:02:17.389 --> 04:02:17.399 align:start position:0%
single family home
 
04:02:19.490 --> 04:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
and let's just play with this a little
 
04:02:22.849 --> 04:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
bit and say 20 acres for a single family
 
04:02:26.689 --> 04:02:26.699 align:start position:0%
home just for for fun here hold on
 
04:02:29.269 --> 04:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
I can't imagine there might be any areas
 
04:02:33.229 --> 04:02:33.239 align:start position:0%
of state that do that let's take a peek
 
04:02:35.150 --> 04:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
and lo and behold
 
04:02:37.309 --> 04:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
there are some areas that require 20
 
04:02:39.710 --> 04:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
acres for a single family home
 
04:02:41.630 --> 04:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
well let's click on the district here
 
04:02:42.889 --> 04:02:42.899 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to call out any
 
04:02:45.650 --> 04:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
communities publicly but
 
04:02:49.130 --> 04:02:49.140 align:start position:0%
there you have it um
 
04:02:52.729 --> 04:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
so okay so that that's another use of
 
04:02:55.490 --> 04:02:55.500 align:start position:0%
this map that is available
 
04:02:59.330 --> 04:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
now we could also go to
 
04:03:00.769 --> 04:03:00.779 align:start position:0%
we can also go to individual
 
04:03:03.110 --> 04:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions and districts and see what
 
04:03:05.689 --> 04:03:05.699 align:start position:0%
the uh the attributes are so
 
04:03:07.010 --> 04:03:07.020 align:start position:0%
um you can do that in a number of ways
 
04:03:08.450 --> 04:03:08.460 align:start position:0%
you can do it by clicking on the map or
 
04:03:09.889 --> 04:03:09.899 align:start position:0%
you can actually use the search function
 
04:03:13.070 --> 04:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
here so let's take for example just
 
04:03:15.830 --> 04:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
Groton New Hampshire
 
04:03:15.840 --> 04:03:16.969 align:start position:0%
Groton New Hampshire
see

04:03:16.969 --> 04:03:16.979 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:03:19.429 --> 04:03:19.439 align:start position:0%
and so it takes us to that District we
 
04:03:21.050 --> 04:03:21.060 align:start position:0%
can move this box a little bit out of
 
04:03:22.010 --> 04:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
the way
 
04:03:25.070 --> 04:03:25.080 align:start position:0%
and we can we can click on Groton and
 
04:03:30.010 --> 04:03:30.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:33.229 --> 04:03:33.239 align:start position:0%
there we go so now you begin to see the
 
04:03:35.870 --> 04:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
attributes of the um of the jurisdiction
 
04:03:39.050 --> 04:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
so Groton we see that 53 percent is uh
 
04:03:41.929 --> 04:03:41.939 align:start position:0%
primarily residential uh 15 uh mixed use
 
04:03:45.469 --> 04:03:45.479 align:start position:0%
there's a 32 non-buildable area it gives
 
04:03:47.210 --> 04:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
you the percentage um of the
 
04:03:48.769 --> 04:03:48.779 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction where housing is permitted
 
04:03:51.590 --> 04:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
of different types so 68 for one family
 
04:03:55.010 --> 04:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
68 for two family and it looks from this
 
04:03:56.750 --> 04:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
that three four and five family are not
 
04:03:56.760 --> 04:03:58.490 align:start position:0%
that three four and five family are not
permitted

04:03:58.490 --> 04:03:58.500 align:start position:0%
permitted
 
04:03:58.500 --> 04:03:59.990 align:start position:0%
permitted
um

04:03:59.990 --> 04:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:03.769 --> 04:04:03.779 align:start position:0%
do you want me to put hooks okay
 
04:04:03.779 --> 04:04:05.210 align:start position:0%
do you want me to put hooks okay
okay

04:04:05.210 --> 04:04:05.220 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:04:05.220 --> 04:04:05.870 align:start position:0%
okay
um

04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:04:09.969 --> 04:04:09.979 align:start position:0%
all right so let's uh let's do this here
 
04:04:13.250 --> 04:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
type in a book set because I can't just
 
04:04:16.550 --> 04:04:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:19.189 --> 04:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
okay let's see um so here we have
 
04:04:19.199 --> 04:04:21.769 align:start position:0%
okay let's see um so here we have
Hooksett

04:04:21.769 --> 04:04:21.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:26.990 --> 04:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
one second I'm still learning how to use
 
04:04:33.410 --> 04:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:33.420 --> 04:04:37.550 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:04:37.550 --> 04:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
let me do that one more time
 
04:04:39.840 --> 04:04:44.689 align:start position:0%
let me do that one more time
okay

04:04:44.689 --> 04:04:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:51.650 --> 04:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:54.410 --> 04:04:54.420 align:start position:0%
let me let me reload it so much no no
 
04:04:55.790 --> 04:04:55.800 align:start position:0%
you're not you're not I should know how
 
04:04:57.889 --> 04:04:57.899 align:start position:0%
to do this let me let me just start from
 
04:05:00.830 --> 04:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:05.750 --> 04:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:09.889 --> 04:05:09.899 align:start position:0%
Street specific or just a town okay here
 
04:05:16.510 --> 04:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:20.650 --> 04:05:20.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:31.250 --> 04:05:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
okay here we go all right so we can see
 
04:05:38.269 --> 04:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
now uh the um features of Hooksett
 
04:05:41.809 --> 04:05:41.819 align:start position:0%
let's see 34 primarily residential 26
 
04:05:44.450 --> 04:05:44.460 align:start position:0%
mixed used 11 commercial slash
 
04:05:46.910 --> 04:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
industrial there's 30 which is not
 
04:05:49.130 --> 04:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
buildable and then we can go into some
 
04:05:52.130 --> 04:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
further detail and we can see that uh
 
04:05:54.290 --> 04:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
single families allowed
 
04:05:56.450 --> 04:05:56.460 align:start position:0%
um two families allowed slash
 
04:05:58.130 --> 04:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
conditional let's go into the district
 
04:06:03.769 --> 04:06:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:05.630 --> 04:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
go back there and then you can scroll
 
04:06:08.929 --> 04:06:08.939 align:start position:0%
down there we go there you go
 
04:06:12.110 --> 04:06:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so one family is 59
 
04:06:14.349 --> 04:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
um is allowed on
 
04:06:17.830 --> 04:06:17.840 align:start position:0%

allowed on 20 now you can go that's
 
04:06:26.809 --> 04:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction and information but you can
 
04:06:28.189 --> 04:06:28.199 align:start position:0%
also go to in
 
04:06:30.950 --> 04:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
individual yeah
 
04:06:30.960 --> 04:06:33.530 align:start position:0%
individual yeah
please

04:06:33.530 --> 04:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:33.540 --> 04:06:35.269 align:start position:0%
 
remember

04:06:35.269 --> 04:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
remember
 
04:06:35.279 --> 04:06:40.370 align:start position:0%
remember
so

04:06:40.370 --> 04:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:40.380 --> 04:06:43.490 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

04:06:43.490 --> 04:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:45.830 --> 04:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
I was talking about you we had a
 
04:06:46.910 --> 04:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
conversation at lunch I got to give
 
04:06:50.750 --> 04:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:53.450 --> 04:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
that's okay so and then if you click on
 
04:06:55.250 --> 04:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
an individual District within the
 
04:06:57.170 --> 04:06:57.180 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction for example we're in
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
Hooksett District labeled medium density
 
04:07:02.570 --> 04:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
residential we can see uh particular
 
04:07:04.490 --> 04:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
details of that District
 
04:07:07.250 --> 04:07:07.260 align:start position:0%
um and that includes the trans the
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
housing treatment but also if you scroll
 
04:07:11.929 --> 04:07:11.939 align:start position:0%
down all the attributes that Jason had
 
04:07:14.030 --> 04:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier for example in this
 
04:07:16.250 --> 04:07:16.260 align:start position:0%
District the minimum lot for a single
 
04:07:20.990 --> 04:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
family is 1.13 Acres
 
04:07:23.870 --> 04:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
um and then there's uh nuances of ideal
 
04:07:25.790 --> 04:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
conditions and less than ideal
 
04:07:27.410 --> 04:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
conditions do you want to explain what
 
04:07:30.889 --> 04:07:30.899 align:start position:0%
those are sure so in in some districts
 
04:07:33.229 --> 04:07:33.239 align:start position:0%
the minimum lot size and minimum
 
04:07:34.849 --> 04:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
Frontage and maximum density for
 
04:07:37.490 --> 04:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
multi-family will vary depending on
 
04:07:41.389 --> 04:07:41.399 align:start position:0%
whether the lot has access to Water and
 
04:07:44.090 --> 04:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
Sewer or if it doesn't depending on the
 
04:07:46.550 --> 04:07:46.560 align:start position:0%
soil conditions and so we what we've
 
04:07:48.889 --> 04:07:48.899 align:start position:0%
done is we the the minimum lot size that
 
04:07:50.389 --> 04:07:50.399 align:start position:0%
we've been using in these Maps is sort
 
04:07:52.490 --> 04:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
of the average over all those conditions
 
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
but we also show in there what the
 
04:07:56.630 --> 04:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
minimum lot size would be under ideal
 
04:07:58.490 --> 04:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
conditions say hooked up to water and
 
04:08:00.590 --> 04:08:00.600 align:start position:0%
sewer and under worse conditions so not
 
04:08:02.330 --> 04:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
hooked up to water and sewer and bad
 
04:08:02.340 --> 04:08:04.070 align:start position:0%
hooked up to water and sewer and bad
soils

04:08:04.070 --> 04:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
soils
 
04:08:06.830 --> 04:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
so um all those different attributes
 
04:08:06.840 --> 04:08:07.910 align:start position:0%
so um all those different attributes
including

04:08:07.910 --> 04:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
including
 
04:08:14.570 --> 04:08:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:17.150 --> 04:08:17.160 align:start position:0%
maximum height and so on and all of
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
those attributes are uh included in this
 
04:08:23.150 --> 04:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
information in the district so so those
 
04:08:25.070 --> 04:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
are this is information you can access
 
04:08:27.290 --> 04:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
at the district level but you can again
 
04:08:29.630 --> 04:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
zoom out and get information about the
 
04:08:33.590 --> 04:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction or even the state so the
 
04:08:35.870 --> 04:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
atlas is hopefully um going to be a
 
04:08:37.849 --> 04:08:37.859 align:start position:0%
great resource for people to use to get
 
04:08:40.150 --> 04:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
information about their own communities
 
04:08:44.389 --> 04:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
their own District but also for the
 
04:08:45.530 --> 04:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
state as a whole
 
04:08:47.689 --> 04:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
so the last thing I want to show you um
 
04:08:49.309 --> 04:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
and I apologize that we fumbled with
 
04:08:51.229 --> 04:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
this a little bit it's very fresh we'll
 
04:08:53.570 --> 04:08:53.580 align:start position:0%
get better at it over the next month
 
04:08:56.330 --> 04:08:56.340 align:start position:0%
um the last thing I'd like to show you
 
04:08:56.340 --> 04:08:57.469 align:start position:0%
um the last thing I'd like to show you
is

04:08:57.469 --> 04:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:08:59.570 --> 04:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
um the story map
 
04:09:02.689 --> 04:09:02.699 align:start position:0%
so the public is going to
 
04:09:02.699 --> 04:09:04.610 align:start position:0%
so the public is going to
um

04:09:04.610 --> 04:09:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:06.349 --> 04:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
be introduced to the atlas that
 
04:09:08.410 --> 04:09:08.420 align:start position:0%
interactive Atlas in a way that's
 
04:09:10.429 --> 04:09:10.439 align:start position:0%
accessible for them
 
04:09:11.870 --> 04:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
so they will
 
04:09:14.990 --> 04:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
um arrive at a web page on the Saint
 
04:09:17.150 --> 04:09:17.160 align:start position:0%
Anselm College Center for ethics website
 
04:09:19.910 --> 04:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
that I'll be uh an introduction to New
 
04:09:21.830 --> 04:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire zoning Outlets
 
04:09:21.840 --> 04:09:23.090 align:start position:0%
Hampshire zoning Outlets
and

04:09:23.090 --> 04:09:23.100 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:25.550 --> 04:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
once there they'll be given some basic
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
information about the atlas and then
 
04:09:27.600 --> 04:09:28.910 align:start position:0%
information about the atlas and then
prompted

04:09:28.910 --> 04:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
prompted
 
04:09:33.769 --> 04:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:37.130 --> 04:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
which is loading one moment
 
04:09:39.889 --> 04:09:39.899 align:start position:0%
and the story map is going to introduce
 
04:09:44.630 --> 04:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
them to what the atlas is how to use the
 
04:09:46.969 --> 04:09:46.979 align:start position:0%
atlas and some of those static maps that
 
04:09:48.469 --> 04:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
we've shown you
 
04:09:51.290 --> 04:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
um in the findings and for some reason
 
04:09:55.910 --> 04:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:55.920 --> 04:09:59.410 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:09:59.410 --> 04:09:59.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:02.630 --> 04:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
here we go okay so this story map here
 
04:10:05.210 --> 04:10:05.220 align:start position:0%
I'll just just give you a brief
 
04:10:07.309 --> 04:10:07.319 align:start position:0%
review of it
 
04:10:09.170 --> 04:10:09.180 align:start position:0%
um it has a welcome and an introduction
 
04:10:10.969 --> 04:10:10.979 align:start position:0%
to what the story what the atlas is
 
04:10:14.570 --> 04:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
gives a little bit of a background on it
 
04:10:15.830 --> 04:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
um talks a little bit about the
 
04:10:18.590 --> 04:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
methodology of how the atlas was
 
04:10:18.600 --> 04:10:19.910 align:start position:0%
methodology of how the atlas was
developed

04:10:19.910 --> 04:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
developed
 
04:10:22.610 --> 04:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
then presents some of the Statewide
 
04:10:25.729 --> 04:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
findings that we shared with you earlier
 
04:10:29.750 --> 04:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
about single-family housing five five
 
04:10:29.760 --> 04:10:31.130 align:start position:0%
about single-family housing five five
family

04:10:31.130 --> 04:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:10:33.290 --> 04:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
small lot single family
 
04:10:35.210 --> 04:10:35.220 align:start position:0%
we're going to be adding some photos to
 
04:10:37.670 --> 04:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
this over the next week or two
 
04:10:40.550 --> 04:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
the adus that we've shown you
 
04:10:42.050 --> 04:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
then there's some additional findings
 
04:10:44.809 --> 04:10:44.819 align:start position:0%
which um if people want they could go
 
04:10:47.929 --> 04:10:47.939 align:start position:0%
into by toggling to the right so there's
 
04:10:49.610 --> 04:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
more information about small Lot 2
 
04:10:49.620 --> 04:10:50.689 align:start position:0%
more information about small Lot 2
family

04:10:50.689 --> 04:10:50.699 align:start position:0%
family
 
04:10:53.630 --> 04:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
small lot three family four family and
 
04:10:55.370 --> 04:10:55.380 align:start position:0%
five family
 
04:10:57.349 --> 04:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh in addition there's some information
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
about parking requirements for five
 
04:11:02.030 --> 04:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
family units and then there's that build
 
04:11:03.889 --> 04:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
out analysis if you will for Manchester
 
04:11:06.710 --> 04:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
and the surrounding communities that we
 
04:11:08.870 --> 04:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
discussed with you including single
 
04:11:10.309 --> 04:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
family potential in those communities
 
04:11:13.550 --> 04:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
and small Lots single family potential
 
04:11:15.410 --> 04:11:15.420 align:start position:0%
and then it'll introduce them to the
 
04:11:18.110 --> 04:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
interactive Atlas as well as conclusions
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
and next steps
 
04:11:22.309 --> 04:11:22.319 align:start position:0%
so when they arrive at the um that
 
04:11:23.929 --> 04:11:23.939 align:start position:0%
landing page for the atlas they'll be
 
04:11:26.389 --> 04:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
able to welcome to
 
04:11:28.849 --> 04:11:28.859 align:start position:0%
um access destroying that and get the
 
04:11:30.290 --> 04:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
understanding of the atlas there or they
 
04:11:32.090 --> 04:11:32.100 align:start position:0%
can click directly on the atlas if they
 
04:11:34.250 --> 04:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable already and uh and
 
04:11:36.050 --> 04:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
interact with it there'll be additional
 
04:11:38.210 --> 04:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
resources there Jason is written a
 
04:11:40.250 --> 04:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
written a methodology paper that
 
04:11:42.650 --> 04:11:42.660 align:start position:0%
explains in great detail how this Atlas
 
04:11:44.150 --> 04:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
was generated for those who really want
 
04:11:46.670 --> 04:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
to get into the weeds there'll be some
 
04:11:49.070 --> 04:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
links to our national Partners the full
 
04:11:52.070 --> 04:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
data set in CSV file will be available
 
04:11:54.650 --> 04:11:54.660 align:start position:0%
for researchers to download in the end
 
04:11:56.689 --> 04:11:56.699 align:start position:0%
we hope that this tool is available and
 
04:11:59.990 --> 04:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
made use of by um by everyone in New
 
04:12:02.389 --> 04:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire by by members of the public by
 
04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
researchers trying to understand how
 
04:12:06.229 --> 04:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
zoning impacts our communities by policy
 
04:12:07.729 --> 04:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
makers who are trying to understand what
 
04:12:09.050 --> 04:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
we can do with the community or at the
 
04:12:11.870 --> 04:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
state level to adjust our zoning to make
 
04:12:13.490 --> 04:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
it more welcoming in our communities for
 
04:12:13.500 --> 04:12:14.590 align:start position:0%
it more welcoming in our communities for
housing

04:12:14.590 --> 04:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
housing
 
04:12:17.870 --> 04:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
and and Advocates uh and in the end we'd
 
04:12:19.729 --> 04:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
like to have a healthy discourse about
 
04:12:20.990 --> 04:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
what's happening in our state around
 
04:12:23.389 --> 04:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
zoning so thank you for uh for having us
 
04:12:27.290 --> 04:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
today well I I just I want to thank you
 
04:12:29.210 --> 04:12:29.220 align:start position:0%
for all the three of you and then the
 
04:12:30.530 --> 04:12:30.540 align:start position:0%
rest of you for coming up with this I
 
04:12:31.849 --> 04:12:31.859 align:start position:0%
think this contribution to New Hampshire
 
04:12:34.070 --> 04:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
is incredible uh makes me proud to be a
 
04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
saint A's Hawk to have this kind of
 
04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
research coming out of CNAs
 
04:12:39.290 --> 04:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
um really proud so
 
04:12:40.610 --> 04:12:40.620 align:start position:0%
um thank you and I'm looking forward to
 
04:12:42.590 --> 04:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
looking at Goffstown specific but what
 
04:12:44.330 --> 04:12:44.340 align:start position:0%
are the questions that we have I'll
 
04:12:46.250 --> 04:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
start with representative Walsh thank
 
04:12:47.809 --> 04:12:47.819 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and that was May 9th you
 
04:12:49.729 --> 04:12:49.739 align:start position:0%
said it's available to everybody yes
 
04:12:49.739 --> 04:12:50.990 align:start position:0%
said it's available to everybody yes
okay

04:12:50.990 --> 04:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:12:52.010 --> 04:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
um and I've got a question that's
 
04:12:53.389 --> 04:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
probably not related to this so I'll
 
04:12:55.729 --> 04:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
wait till the end
 
04:13:02.150 --> 04:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:03.590 --> 04:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm representative hope Damon
 
04:13:05.330 --> 04:13:05.340 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County District eight so I have
 
04:13:07.729 --> 04:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
Claremont and Sunapee they're like very
 
04:13:10.429 --> 04:13:10.439 align:start position:0%
very different and seven other towns
 
04:13:14.570 --> 04:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
so my question to any of you is
 
04:13:17.630 --> 04:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
could you note
 
04:13:19.790 --> 04:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
say the top three things you think
 
04:13:23.330 --> 04:13:23.340 align:start position:0%
legislature should be addressing to move
 
04:13:25.790 --> 04:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
us towards that modest increase in
 
04:13:27.290 --> 04:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
housing production just a little
 
04:13:27.300 --> 04:13:28.429 align:start position:0%
housing production just a little
question

04:13:28.429 --> 04:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:13:30.530 --> 04:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
let Ben handle it that's a great
 
04:13:30.540 --> 04:13:35.630 align:start position:0%
let Ben handle it that's a great
question

04:13:35.630 --> 04:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:38.929 --> 04:13:38.939 align:start position:0%
I think I'll be very general in giving
 
04:13:41.990 --> 04:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
you the top three uh because there's so
 
04:13:44.210 --> 04:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
much that could be done
 
04:13:45.550 --> 04:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
um I think
 
04:13:45.560 --> 04:13:47.150 align:start position:0%
um I think
affecting

04:13:47.150 --> 04:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
affecting
 
04:13:50.689 --> 04:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
uh process at the local level
 
04:13:53.030 --> 04:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
is an important measure the legislature
 
04:13:56.210 --> 04:13:56.220 align:start position:0%
can can work on that is making it easier
 
04:13:58.250 --> 04:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
to for
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
easier more streamlined fewer barriers
 
04:14:03.469 --> 04:14:03.479 align:start position:0%
for someone to get through an
 
04:14:06.710 --> 04:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
application process now some of this was
 
04:14:09.769 --> 04:14:09.779 align:start position:0%
done by the legislature of last year in
 
04:14:12.290 --> 04:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1661 that's the that was a
 
04:14:15.170 --> 04:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
compromise Omnibus Bill that had added
 
04:14:17.870 --> 04:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
to it was called the community toolbox
 
04:14:21.910 --> 04:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill which had been in Senate Bill 400
 
04:14:24.590 --> 04:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
and it took a lot of the provisions
 
04:14:24.600 --> 04:14:25.990 align:start position:0%
and it took a lot of the provisions
there

04:14:25.990 --> 04:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:14:28.610 --> 04:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
and there are some measures in the
 
04:14:30.729 --> 04:14:30.739 align:start position:0%
legislature right now in this session
 
04:14:33.769 --> 04:14:33.779 align:start position:0%
that I think are worthy of your
 
04:14:38.150 --> 04:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
attention one is the um
 
04:14:40.790 --> 04:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
house the housing Champion designation
 
04:14:43.910 --> 04:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
program which is a Senate bill it's past
 
04:14:46.849 --> 04:14:46.859 align:start position:0%
the Senate and has then been tabled for
 
04:14:49.550 --> 04:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
the the Senate to add to the budget uh
 
04:14:51.889 --> 04:14:51.899 align:start position:0%
that was something that was part of the
 
04:14:54.830 --> 04:14:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh Community toolbox bill that was uh
 
04:14:56.330 --> 04:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
frankly left on The Cutting Room floor
 
04:14:59.450 --> 04:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 1661 but it's a it's a
 
04:15:01.729 --> 04:15:01.739 align:start position:0%
really good idea it's a voluntary uh
 
04:15:04.330 --> 04:15:04.340 align:start position:0%
program for municipalities to opt into
 
04:15:06.250 --> 04:15:06.260 align:start position:0%
that would
 
04:15:09.349 --> 04:15:09.359 align:start position:0%
indicate that they are the doors are
 
04:15:11.210 --> 04:15:11.220 align:start position:0%
open in the community
 
04:15:11.220 --> 04:15:13.370 align:start position:0%
open in the community
and

04:15:13.370 --> 04:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:15:16.370 --> 04:15:16.380 align:start position:0%
so that that's basically two different
 
04:15:17.809 --> 04:15:17.819 align:start position:0%
sorts of things
 
04:15:17.819 --> 04:15:19.010 align:start position:0%
sorts of things
um

04:15:19.010 --> 04:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:20.210 --> 04:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
I think
 
04:15:23.510 --> 04:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature should look at the sorts
 
04:15:24.769 --> 04:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
of things that I characterized as
 
04:15:26.809 --> 04:15:26.819 align:start position:0%
mandates uh you you have already done
 
04:15:28.969 --> 04:15:28.979 align:start position:0%
this with the workforce housing law and
 
04:15:31.309 --> 04:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
with the um the accessory dwelling unit
 
04:15:34.790 --> 04:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
law uh and so you have done this before
 
04:15:36.830 --> 04:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
I think there I think you should
 
04:15:39.130 --> 04:15:39.140 align:start position:0%
entertain additional
 
04:15:41.510 --> 04:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
possibilities for requirements of
 
04:15:44.389 --> 04:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
municipalities and part of that might be
 
04:15:47.210 --> 04:15:47.220 align:start position:0%
process part of that might be numerical
 
04:15:49.990 --> 04:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
standards you know dealing with
 
04:15:52.370 --> 04:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
thresholds of jurisdiction for site plan
 
04:15:55.610 --> 04:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
review or how they how municipalities
 
04:15:58.550 --> 04:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
regulate uh multi multi-unit
 
04:15:58.560 --> 04:16:00.530 align:start position:0%
regulate uh multi multi-unit
developments

04:16:00.530 --> 04:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
developments
 
04:16:03.170 --> 04:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
uh and then finally uh probably be on
 
04:16:04.370 --> 04:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
three now
 
04:16:06.830 --> 04:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
um there's there's funding
 
04:16:09.410 --> 04:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
um you know uh so I I work for New
 
04:16:11.630 --> 04:16:11.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire housing we administer on on
 
04:16:13.790 --> 04:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
the let on the state's behalf the uh
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund uh they're
 
04:16:19.070 --> 04:16:19.080 align:start position:0%
they're in the current budget before the
 
04:16:21.229 --> 04:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
house actually going be going to the
 
04:16:23.689 --> 04:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
floor of the house uh next week uh there
 
04:16:26.150 --> 04:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
is a 15 million dollar appropriation to
 
04:16:28.070 --> 04:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
the affordable housing fund a 15 million
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
dollar appropriation to invest in H
 
04:16:32.689 --> 04:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
uh there are other things that didn't
 
04:16:35.210 --> 04:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
make it through uh house finance that
 
04:16:36.710 --> 04:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
are nonetheless worthy and I think
 
04:16:39.650 --> 04:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
division one acknowledged that uh that
 
04:16:41.929 --> 04:16:41.939 align:start position:0%
these were things that were were worthy
 
04:16:41.939 --> 04:16:43.130 align:start position:0%
these were things that were were worthy
but

04:16:43.130 --> 04:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:16:44.389 --> 04:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:16:46.370 --> 04:16:46.380 align:start position:0%
house finance committee was they had
 
04:16:47.630 --> 04:16:47.640 align:start position:0%
certain numbers that they had to meet
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
and division three was uh consuming a
 
04:16:51.889 --> 04:16:51.899 align:start position:0%
lot of that
 
04:16:53.870 --> 04:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
and I think that this will come out of
 
04:16:56.150 --> 04:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
course in negotiations between you and
 
04:16:58.490 --> 04:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
the Senate so those are things that you
 
04:17:01.610 --> 04:17:01.620 align:start position:0%
could do this year and next and there
 
04:17:04.670 --> 04:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
are probably a lot of other things too
 
04:17:06.170 --> 04:17:06.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Ben
 
04:17:11.210 --> 04:17:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:11.220 --> 04:17:12.670 align:start position:0%
 
Jason

04:17:12.670 --> 04:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
Jason
 
04:17:12.680 --> 04:17:14.830 align:start position:0%
Jason
hey

04:17:14.830 --> 04:17:14.840 align:start position:0%
hey
 
04:17:18.290 --> 04:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I I just have uh
 
04:17:21.050 --> 04:17:21.060 align:start position:0%
two recommendations to add to that list
 
04:17:23.150 --> 04:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
I was interested to read the Mercedes
 
04:17:26.929 --> 04:17:26.939 align:start position:0%
paper this morning about adus and I do
 
04:17:29.570 --> 04:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
have some findings about that about uh
 
04:17:31.309 --> 04:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
how much of our land area is available
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
for we could call it California style
 
04:17:37.849 --> 04:17:37.859 align:start position:0%
adus so these would be districts where
 
04:17:39.830 --> 04:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
um attached adus are allowed by right
 
04:17:42.290 --> 04:17:42.300 align:start position:0%
without a special permit a public
 
04:17:43.750 --> 04:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
hearing process
 
04:17:46.910 --> 04:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
where detached adus are allowed in some
 
04:17:46.920 --> 04:17:47.990 align:start position:0%
where detached adus are allowed in some
fashion

04:17:47.990 --> 04:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
fashion
 
04:17:50.809 --> 04:17:50.819 align:start position:0%
where no more than one parking space is
 
04:17:53.650 --> 04:17:53.660 align:start position:0%
required for an attached Adu
 
04:17:56.210 --> 04:17:56.220 align:start position:0%
and where there's no owner occupancy
 
04:18:00.830 --> 04:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
requirement and where the attached Adu
 
04:18:03.590 --> 04:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
may be larger than the state minimum of
 
04:18:05.750 --> 04:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
750 square feet
 
04:18:09.010 --> 04:18:09.020 align:start position:0%
and or the state cap on how
 
04:18:12.290 --> 04:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
our minimum on the cap of Municipal
 
04:18:14.630 --> 04:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
regulation and I found that only 11
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
percent of the state land area was
 
04:18:17.990 --> 04:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
available for adus meaning all those
 
04:18:20.510 --> 04:18:20.520 align:start position:0%
features so that seems like an area
 
04:18:20.520 --> 04:18:22.370 align:start position:0%
features so that seems like an area
where

04:18:22.370 --> 04:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
where
 
04:18:24.769 --> 04:18:24.779 align:start position:0%
the the state statute could be amended
 
04:18:28.130 --> 04:18:28.140 align:start position:0%
to encourage further Adu development and
 
04:18:29.870 --> 04:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
then we also don't have in the zoning
 
04:18:31.130 --> 04:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
Atlas because these data are already
 
04:18:34.610 --> 04:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
available a catalog of town wide
 
04:18:34.620 --> 04:18:36.530 align:start position:0%
available a catalog of town wide
Provisions

04:18:36.530 --> 04:18:36.540 align:start position:0%
Provisions
 
04:18:40.010 --> 04:18:40.020 align:start position:0%
um the state OPD already has this
 
04:18:42.229 --> 04:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
through their Municipal survey but the
 
04:18:44.269 --> 04:18:44.279 align:start position:0%
state does authorize municipalities to
 
04:18:47.450 --> 04:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
have just a hard cap on building permits
 
04:18:50.570 --> 04:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
and even just have a complete moratorium
 
04:18:53.630 --> 04:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
on building permits for one year and
 
04:18:57.710 --> 04:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
some communities do have just a hard cap
 
04:19:00.769 --> 04:19:00.779 align:start position:0%
on on how many housing building permits
 
04:19:02.510 --> 04:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
can be issued in a year which seems like
 
04:19:05.050 --> 04:19:05.060 align:start position:0%
the the most stringent possible
 
04:19:09.349 --> 04:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:09.359 --> 04:19:11.090 align:start position:0%
 
representative

04:19:11.090 --> 04:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:19:13.729 --> 04:19:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:17.689 --> 04:19:17.699 align:start position:0%
so I understand that this Atlas is kind
 
04:19:23.530 --> 04:19:23.540 align:start position:0%
of part of a larger Atlas plan and
 
04:19:27.590 --> 04:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
Nationwide Atlas plan and I'm wondering
 
04:19:31.309 --> 04:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
um if all of the data points that you
 
04:19:34.010 --> 04:19:34.020 align:start position:0%
collected are the same data points that
 
04:19:36.110 --> 04:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
the other atlases are correct collecting
 
04:19:39.530 --> 04:19:39.540 align:start position:0%
and if you did not collect some that
 
04:19:42.010 --> 04:19:42.020 align:start position:0%
others are collecting and why
 
04:19:42.020 --> 04:19:43.969 align:start position:0%
others are collecting and why
and

04:19:43.969 --> 04:19:43.979 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:19:46.790 --> 04:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
um so that we can compare against each
 
04:19:49.729 --> 04:19:49.739 align:start position:0%
other and then also
 
04:19:49.739 --> 04:19:52.070 align:start position:0%
other and then also
um

04:19:52.070 --> 04:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:56.330 --> 04:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
is this project kind of a one-off or is
 
04:20:01.490 --> 04:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
there a hope of renewing this data or
 
04:20:05.090 --> 04:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
um let's say hypothetically I was
 
04:20:08.269 --> 04:20:08.279 align:start position:0%
interested in every time that my
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
municipality changed its zoning to ping
 
04:20:12.530 --> 04:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
you and be like hey now you want to
 
04:20:14.330 --> 04:20:14.340 align:start position:0%
update mine
 
04:20:14.340 --> 04:20:15.170 align:start position:0%
update mine
um

04:20:15.170 --> 04:20:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:18.650 --> 04:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
would is that a feature that's uh going
 
04:20:21.650 --> 04:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
to be live on the website that's
 
04:20:25.189 --> 04:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
or how would someone uh go go about
 
04:20:27.889 --> 04:20:27.899 align:start position:0%
giving you that information if you are
 
04:20:29.689 --> 04:20:29.699 align:start position:0%
the ones that going to be managing it
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
long term
 
04:20:34.130 --> 04:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
so I I excellent question I I can't
 
04:20:36.769 --> 04:20:36.779 align:start position:0%
speak for the national zoning Atlas team
 
04:20:38.929 --> 04:20:38.939 align:start position:0%
but I think what you said is exactly
 
04:20:40.670 --> 04:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
what they're thinking the envisioning
 
04:20:43.189 --> 04:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
that by having an atlas like this at
 
04:20:46.130 --> 04:20:46.140 align:start position:0%
every state well researchers and policy
 
04:20:48.769 --> 04:20:48.779 align:start position:0%
makers will be able to compare States
 
04:20:51.530 --> 04:20:51.540 align:start position:0%
and regulations to help understand uh
 
04:20:53.269 --> 04:20:53.279 align:start position:0%
what kind of zoning and land ordinances
 
04:20:56.330 --> 04:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
work and help communities flourish and
 
04:20:59.030 --> 04:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
which ones are perhaps more damaging and
 
04:21:00.290 --> 04:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
destructive so
 
04:21:01.969 --> 04:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
there may be other purposes to that
 
04:21:03.950 --> 04:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
National Atlas but that's one thing I
 
04:21:06.110 --> 04:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
think could be very clear as far as um
 
04:21:09.110 --> 04:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
the stewardship of this Atlas uh So the
 
04:21:10.729 --> 04:21:10.739 align:start position:0%
plan is for the center for ethics and
 
04:21:12.290 --> 04:21:12.300 align:start position:0%
Society in partnership with New
 
04:21:13.550 --> 04:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Housing and the office of
 
04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
Planning and Development to maintain
 
04:21:18.229 --> 04:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
this Atlas and refresh it year after
 
04:21:21.170 --> 04:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
year with a team of student interns and
 
04:21:22.969 --> 04:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
capable planners and people who
 
04:21:25.250 --> 04:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
understand land use ordinances so that
 
04:21:28.309 --> 04:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
it's uh it's a constantly accurate tool
 
04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
for our communities to use and
 
04:21:32.210 --> 04:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
researchers to use to help understand
 
04:21:34.370 --> 04:21:34.380 align:start position:0%
zoning in New Hampshire so yes an answer
 
04:21:36.729 --> 04:21:36.739 align:start position:0%
to your question we welcome
 
04:21:39.849 --> 04:21:39.859 align:start position:0%
communities and people who see any
 
04:21:42.769 --> 04:21:42.779 align:start position:0%
changes in their zoning or maybe errors
 
04:21:46.550 --> 04:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
in our current data to to reach out to
 
04:21:47.929 --> 04:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
us we have we'll have an email address
 
04:21:49.969 --> 04:21:49.979 align:start position:0%
that's promulgated to send us those
 
04:21:51.530 --> 04:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
Corrections we'll have our researchers
 
04:21:53.210 --> 04:21:53.220 align:start position:0%
double check to make sure that it's
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
accurate and then I will make those
 
04:21:56.450 --> 04:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
changes so yes actually we're going to
 
04:21:59.630 --> 04:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
be very open uh to to those kinds of
 
04:21:59.640 --> 04:22:00.410 align:start position:0%
be very open uh to to those kinds of
um

04:22:00.410 --> 04:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:03.229 --> 04:22:03.239 align:start position:0%
changes in improvements so
 
04:22:04.790 --> 04:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:22:08.990 --> 04:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
I since since it's going to be an Ever
 
04:22:11.570 --> 04:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
um changing uh
 
04:22:13.490 --> 04:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh data set
 
04:22:15.950 --> 04:22:15.960 align:start position:0%
um I guess my question is you also are
 
04:22:17.929 --> 04:22:17.939 align:start position:0%
allowing the download of the data set so
 
04:22:19.969 --> 04:22:19.979 align:start position:0%
are you also going to be like doing like
 
04:22:22.790 --> 04:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
snapshot kind of downloads of data sets
 
04:22:24.590 --> 04:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
so that you can compare year over year
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
or you know all of the or you know
 
04:22:29.389 --> 04:22:29.399 align:start position:0%
decade over decade and what policies may
 
04:22:32.210 --> 04:22:32.220 align:start position:0%
have been successful or not
 
04:22:34.670 --> 04:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
right and thank you representative
 
04:22:36.710 --> 04:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's correct we what we want to
 
04:22:40.070 --> 04:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
do is have waves of the atlas so that we
 
04:22:42.410 --> 04:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
can compare communities at the same time
 
04:22:44.929 --> 04:22:44.939 align:start position:0%
slice that's important for researchers
 
04:22:46.370 --> 04:22:46.380 align:start position:0%
and it's important to give an accurate
 
04:22:48.710 --> 04:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
picture when we're comparing communities
 
04:22:50.150 --> 04:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
to each other
 
04:22:52.729 --> 04:22:52.739 align:start position:0%
um so that you know we know okay this
 
04:22:54.710 --> 04:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
change happened then and then we can
 
04:22:57.290 --> 04:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
observe perhaps what the effects of that
 
04:22:59.210 --> 04:22:59.220 align:start position:0%
change are on say housing production and
 
04:22:59.220 --> 04:23:00.729 align:start position:0%
change are on say housing production and
affordability

04:23:00.729 --> 04:23:00.739 align:start position:0%
affordability
 
04:23:03.530 --> 04:23:03.540 align:start position:0%
as far as the
 
04:23:07.250 --> 04:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
um the fields that we have I think we'd
 
04:23:08.570 --> 04:23:08.580 align:start position:0%
like to think that we've raised the bar
 
04:23:11.330 --> 04:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
with with with our Atlas because we have
 
04:23:13.490 --> 04:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
added new Fields uh things that are
 
04:23:14.809 --> 04:23:14.819 align:start position:0%
relevant to New Hampshire we have
 
04:23:16.250 --> 04:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
everything that the other atlases have
 
04:23:18.590 --> 04:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
and then some we've added manufactured
 
04:23:20.510 --> 04:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
housing minimum frontages a number of
 
04:23:22.250 --> 04:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
other things so
 
04:23:25.370 --> 04:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
um we hope that this kind of uh raises
 
04:23:29.870 --> 04:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.790 --> 04:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
I took a research method class at Saint
 
04:23:33.410 --> 04:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
Anselm College and I can't imagine like
 
04:23:34.969 --> 04:23:34.979 align:start position:0%
this would be so cool to look at like
 
04:23:37.010 --> 04:23:37.020 align:start position:0%
longitudinal over certain number of
 
04:23:39.710 --> 04:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
years um I have a question about how
 
04:23:42.349 --> 04:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
um the New Hampshire zoning laws
 
04:23:44.510 --> 04:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
compared to other states and have you
 
04:23:46.969 --> 04:23:46.979 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to look at maybe a
 
04:23:50.090 --> 04:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
community the size of Goffstown but in
 
04:23:50.100 --> 04:23:51.170 align:start position:0%
community the size of Goffstown but in
um

04:23:51.170 --> 04:23:51.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:23:52.610 --> 04:23:52.620 align:start position:0%
like somewhere in the midwest or
 
04:23:54.769 --> 04:23:54.779 align:start position:0%
somewhere on the west coast and and how
 
04:23:57.349 --> 04:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
are those zoning ordinances different
 
04:23:59.330 --> 04:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
that's I mean I mean there's so much to
 
04:24:03.490 --> 04:24:03.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:05.510 --> 04:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
I know much more about New Hampshire
 
04:24:07.670 --> 04:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
than other states but I have looked a
 
04:24:08.929 --> 04:24:08.939 align:start position:0%
little bit about at some of these other
 
04:24:11.330 --> 04:24:11.340 align:start position:0%
places uh through the Connecticut Atlas
 
04:24:13.429 --> 04:24:13.439 align:start position:0%
and I've followed some of the state
 
04:24:14.689 --> 04:24:14.699 align:start position:0%
level reforms that have happened in
 
04:24:17.510 --> 04:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
California zoning is so different state
 
04:24:20.750 --> 04:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
to state the terms are different the uh
 
04:24:23.570 --> 04:24:23.580 align:start position:0%
the ways that they they regulate
 
04:24:25.670 --> 04:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
um housing production are are pretty
 
04:24:25.680 --> 04:24:27.050 align:start position:0%
um housing production are are pretty
different

04:24:27.050 --> 04:24:27.060 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:24:30.050 --> 04:24:30.060 align:start position:0%
um there are some constants uh minimum
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
lot size is something that almost every
 
04:24:35.090 --> 04:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction regulates even Houston
 
04:24:36.950 --> 04:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
actually technically regulates minimum
 
04:24:37.910 --> 04:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
lot size even though they don't have
 
04:24:37.920 --> 04:24:39.349 align:start position:0%
lot size even though they don't have
zoning

04:24:39.349 --> 04:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
zoning
 
04:24:41.210 --> 04:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
um you know looking at different
 
04:24:44.389 --> 04:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
treatments for the number of units in a
 
04:24:46.130 --> 04:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
structure that is something that is is
 
04:24:48.769 --> 04:24:48.779 align:start position:0%
fairly constant I will say that in more
 
04:24:51.410 --> 04:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
urban States you often have zoning
 
04:24:55.070 --> 04:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
Provisions that are specific to areas
 
04:24:57.590 --> 04:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
with Transit so we don't have that in
 
04:25:00.050 --> 04:25:00.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but in Connecticut that's
 
04:25:02.030 --> 04:25:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's important and in New York I'm
 
04:25:03.849 --> 04:25:03.859 align:start position:0%
sure it is as well well
 
04:25:07.969 --> 04:25:07.979 align:start position:0%
in general uh the the studies that I've
 
04:25:12.130 --> 04:25:12.140 align:start position:0%
seen do show that that New Hampshire has
 
04:25:14.570 --> 04:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
fairly strict regulations compared to
 
04:25:16.790 --> 04:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
other states especially in terms of
 
04:25:19.250 --> 04:25:19.260 align:start position:0%
things like lot size and maximum density
 
04:25:24.050 --> 04:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
restrictions and in much of the Midwest
 
04:25:26.410 --> 04:25:26.420 align:start position:0%
and the South and the Mountain West
 
04:25:29.870 --> 04:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
density is regulated a lot less
 
04:25:33.349 --> 04:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
I I just add to this I think there are
 
04:25:35.570 --> 04:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
also different layers of government in
 
04:25:38.149 --> 04:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
different uh portions of the country so
 
04:25:40.969 --> 04:25:40.979 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire New England frankly
 
04:25:43.370 --> 04:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
uh County government really does not
 
04:25:47.090 --> 04:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
have a land use regulatory role whereas
 
04:25:49.729 --> 04:25:49.739 align:start position:0%
it does in most of the rest of the
 
04:25:52.910 --> 04:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
country I I started as a planner in New
 
04:25:54.590 --> 04:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
York state working for a County Planning
 
04:25:56.929 --> 04:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
department and we had actual regulatory
 
04:26:00.469 --> 04:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
authority over and in addition to what
 
04:26:02.750 --> 04:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
the municipalities had and the village
 
04:26:02.760 --> 04:26:04.370 align:start position:0%
the municipalities had and the village
districts

04:26:04.370 --> 04:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
districts
 
04:26:06.649 --> 04:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
um so I I think that they're they're
 
04:26:08.630 --> 04:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
difficult to compare and I would
 
04:26:12.050 --> 04:26:12.060 align:start position:0%
contrast zoning from other types of laws
 
04:26:14.090 --> 04:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
so you're as legislators you're familiar
 
04:26:16.910 --> 04:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
with the idea of uniform laws and so
 
04:26:19.729 --> 04:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
there's a you know a councils who
 
04:26:22.070 --> 04:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
develop uniform codes the building code
 
04:26:25.969 --> 04:26:25.979 align:start position:0%
is one of them but then on Estates and
 
04:26:29.570 --> 04:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
divorce law and custody covering a wide
 
04:26:31.969 --> 04:26:31.979 align:start position:0%
range range of laws and so there is an
 
04:26:35.330 --> 04:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
attempt nationally to seek uniformity in
 
04:26:36.530 --> 04:26:36.540 align:start position:0%
many laws
 
04:26:40.070 --> 04:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
zoning is just the opposite it started
 
04:26:43.130 --> 04:26:43.140 align:start position:0%
from a uniform place in the 1920s and
 
04:26:46.309 --> 04:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
has radically diverged from state to
 
04:26:49.429 --> 04:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
state uh since that time and I I see no
 
04:26:51.590 --> 04:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
Prospect of bringing them together at
 
04:26:52.610 --> 04:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
any time
 
04:26:54.769 --> 04:26:54.779 align:start position:0%
even within the state there are some
 
04:26:57.950 --> 04:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
really unusual cases perhaps the most
 
04:27:00.649 --> 04:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
unusual zoning ordinance I found in in
 
04:27:03.070 --> 04:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire was in Whitefield where
 
04:27:05.630 --> 04:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
every development gets scored according
 
04:27:08.330 --> 04:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
to a number of points uh if it has
 
04:27:10.429 --> 04:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
attractive features that benefit the
 
04:27:12.050 --> 04:27:12.060 align:start position:0%
town that's how it's supposed to work
 
04:27:13.969 --> 04:27:13.979 align:start position:0%
and and if you score enough points it's
 
04:27:15.649 --> 04:27:15.659 align:start position:0%
allowed by right if you don't it's a
 
04:27:17.030 --> 04:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
public hearing and if you don't have
 
04:27:19.070 --> 04:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
enough for that it's it's prohibited so
 
04:27:21.170 --> 04:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
it's very unusual way of regulating
 
04:27:23.330 --> 04:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
zoning so there's really no template out
 
04:27:23.340 --> 04:27:24.469 align:start position:0%
zoning so there's really no template out
there

04:27:24.469 --> 04:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:27:27.229 --> 04:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
thank you representative McConkey
 
04:27:29.689 --> 04:27:29.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I'm not asking
 
04:27:32.030 --> 04:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
you to bring your screen back on here a
 
04:27:36.229 --> 04:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
question where possible do you identify
 
04:27:39.050 --> 04:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
Parcels on there because I believe you
 
04:27:40.729 --> 04:27:40.739 align:start position:0%
said that there was there was a street
 
04:27:44.090 --> 04:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
lookup feature and for those towns that
 
04:27:46.130 --> 04:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
have GIS or the state has already done
 
04:27:51.170 --> 04:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:53.269 --> 04:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I I think with
 
04:27:56.389 --> 04:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
the interactive Atlas you can get a
 
04:27:58.010 --> 04:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
street address
 
04:28:01.130 --> 04:28:01.140 align:start position:0%
um and find out what the zoning features
 
04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
are there and it's easy to connect the
 
04:28:06.349 --> 04:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
the zoning Atlas to the Statewide parcel
 
04:28:10.670 --> 04:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
layer we don't provide that right now as
 
04:28:12.229 --> 04:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
a something that you can download that
 
04:28:14.510 --> 04:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
would be a massive data set but you
 
04:28:17.389 --> 04:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
could certainly do that we do want to
 
04:28:19.689 --> 04:28:19.699 align:start position:0%
caution a little bit about the
 
04:28:23.349 --> 04:28:23.359 align:start position:0%
resolution of our GIS
 
04:28:26.290 --> 04:28:26.300 align:start position:0%
it's not down to the foot
 
04:28:30.290 --> 04:28:30.300 align:start position:0%
it's probably not even down to to the 10
 
04:28:33.550 --> 04:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
feet this there's a little bit of
 
04:28:36.110 --> 04:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
ambiguity there sometimes about how
 
04:28:39.769 --> 04:28:39.779 align:start position:0%
these zoning boundaries are drawn and so
 
04:28:43.010 --> 04:28:43.020 align:start position:0%
in with any GIS layer you're going to
 
04:28:45.950 --> 04:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of fuzziness in terms
 
04:28:48.349 --> 04:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
of where exactly the boundaries are but
 
04:28:51.710 --> 04:28:51.720 align:start position:0%
we we do expect that this will work at
 
04:28:53.210 --> 04:28:53.220 align:start position:0%
the parcel level that you'll be able to
 
04:28:55.670 --> 04:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
find a parcel and be able to to locate
 
04:29:01.030 --> 04:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:03.410 --> 04:29:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative walls thank you and
 
04:29:04.790 --> 04:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question and what
 
04:29:06.469 --> 04:29:06.479 align:start position:0%
is the web address we will be able to
 
04:29:09.050 --> 04:29:09.060 align:start position:0%
find this uh when it does go live yeah
 
04:29:10.969 --> 04:29:10.979 align:start position:0%
oh that's a good question
 
04:29:10.979 --> 04:29:11.530 align:start position:0%
oh that's a good question
um

04:29:11.530 --> 04:29:11.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:29:15.410 --> 04:29:15.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire NH zoning atlas.com will
 
04:29:18.050 --> 04:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
direct you there it'll be a redirect to
 
04:29:19.670 --> 04:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
the College website
 
04:29:22.010 --> 04:29:22.020 align:start position:0%
but NH zoning atlas.com that'll be live
 
04:29:23.809 --> 04:29:23.819 align:start position:0%
on the 9th and that'll be live on the
 
04:29:28.929 --> 04:29:28.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:33.469 --> 04:29:33.479 align:start position:0%
I think we're the first people to see it
 
04:29:34.910 --> 04:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
we're still working out some of the
 
04:29:36.590 --> 04:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
Kinks and there's some additional things
 
04:29:37.969 --> 04:29:37.979 align:start position:0%
we're gonna add photos and things of
 
04:29:40.189 --> 04:29:40.199 align:start position:0%
that sort of thing awesome pretty much
 
04:29:41.750 --> 04:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
the main tool
 
04:29:43.790 --> 04:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks Mr chair and uh thank you
 
04:29:45.769 --> 04:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
thank you all again this isn't about the
 
04:29:47.450 --> 04:29:47.460 align:start position:0%
atlas but I think Mr Frost might be able
 
04:29:49.309 --> 04:29:49.319 align:start position:0%
to help me
 
04:29:51.050 --> 04:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
um is there some data I know I've seen
 
04:29:53.090 --> 04:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
it I just can't find it again on
 
04:29:55.189 --> 04:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
percentages of increase in housing stock
 
04:29:58.010 --> 04:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
town by town over the last 10 20 years
 
04:30:00.469 --> 04:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
possibly oh sure can you can you tell me
 
04:30:01.790 --> 04:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
where to get it or provide it to us or
 
04:30:04.189 --> 04:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
not I it's probably easier for me to
 
04:30:05.750 --> 04:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
provide you with a couple of different
 
04:30:08.389 --> 04:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
sources one is uh the building permit
 
04:30:10.849 --> 04:30:10.859 align:start position:0%
data that is compiled by the office of
 
04:30:12.830 --> 04:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
Planning Development okay okay and then
 
04:30:14.570 --> 04:30:14.580 align:start position:0%
there's housing stock is building
 
04:30:17.389 --> 04:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
permits don't necessarily translate to
 
04:30:19.670 --> 04:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
things that get built right
 
04:30:21.590 --> 04:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
um because you know not every building
 
04:30:23.990 --> 04:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
permit results in construction but it's
 
04:30:26.450 --> 04:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
a good proxy uh and then there's also
 
04:30:28.849 --> 04:30:28.859 align:start position:0%
the American Community survey which has
 
04:30:32.330 --> 04:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
actual housing stock data which can be
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
taken down to the municipal level and we
 
04:30:35.929 --> 04:30:35.939 align:start position:0%
can get that for you
 
04:30:37.490 --> 04:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:30:40.250 --> 04:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
representative Reed thank you and I just
 
04:30:42.229 --> 04:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
had I had some logistical questions I
 
04:30:43.910 --> 04:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
think you've mostly answered in terms of
 
04:30:45.710 --> 04:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
zooming in and
 
04:30:47.689 --> 04:30:47.699 align:start position:0%
um and providing the link to us I just
 
04:30:49.969 --> 04:30:49.979 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that can you send uh
 
04:30:51.769 --> 04:30:51.779 align:start position:0%
the committee your presentation for
 
04:30:55.250 --> 04:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
today the slides and um would be very
 
04:30:57.170 --> 04:30:57.180 align:start position:0%
grateful for that and then I had a
 
04:30:58.969 --> 04:30:58.979 align:start position:0%
little bit of a disingenuous question
 
04:31:01.670 --> 04:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
did I hear a few minutes ago you say
 
04:31:04.309 --> 04:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
that towns are enabled to put a
 
04:31:07.010 --> 04:31:07.020 align:start position:0%
moratorium on development unlike for
 
04:31:09.410 --> 04:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
example not being enabled to maybe uh
 
04:31:12.110 --> 04:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
put a moratorium on rent hikes
 
04:31:12.120 --> 04:31:13.130 align:start position:0%
put a moratorium on rent hikes
just

04:31:13.130 --> 04:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:31:15.110 --> 04:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
for what I heard
 
04:31:18.290 --> 04:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
that that is correct representative
 
04:31:20.030 --> 04:31:20.040 align:start position:0%
within limits
 
04:31:21.710 --> 04:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
so there is
 
04:31:25.250 --> 04:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
um a statute this is in RSA 674 I
 
04:31:29.090 --> 04:31:29.100 align:start position:0%
believe it's RSA 67423 uh dealing with
 
04:31:31.370 --> 04:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
growth management ordinances
 
04:31:35.510 --> 04:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh and it it in fact that statute used
 
04:31:38.809 --> 04:31:38.819 align:start position:0%
to or may have been 23A it used to call
 
04:31:42.229 --> 04:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
it moratorium that was changed I think
 
04:31:46.010 --> 04:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
in 2008 uh in a recodification of those
 
04:31:46.020 --> 04:31:47.210 align:start position:0%
in 2008 uh in a recodification of those
statutes

04:31:47.210 --> 04:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
04:31:49.969 --> 04:31:49.979 align:start position:0%
and the recodification
 
04:31:54.889 --> 04:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
um attempted to embody the conclusions
 
04:31:56.630 --> 04:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
of various decisions of the New
 
04:31:58.550 --> 04:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire supreme court regarding growth
 
04:32:01.130 --> 04:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
management and I think what you have now
 
04:32:04.130 --> 04:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
in statute is an accurate representation
 
04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
of what the law is as understood by the
 
04:32:09.830 --> 04:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court because there have been no
 
04:32:13.250 --> 04:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
growth management cases litigated in New
 
04:32:17.210 --> 04:32:17.220 align:start position:0%
Hampshire since that time so yes
 
04:32:20.929 --> 04:32:20.939 align:start position:0%
but there are very tight constraints on
 
04:32:25.969 --> 04:32:25.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much I
 
04:32:30.229 --> 04:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
sincerely appreciate you coming
 
04:32:34.910 --> 04:32:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:38.149 --> 04:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
all right so moving forward I was hoping
 
04:32:39.889 --> 04:32:39.899 align:start position:0%
to have a meeting on the 14th but uh
 
04:32:41.929 --> 04:32:41.939 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs uh informed me that
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
the house Democrats will be having a
 
04:32:47.870 --> 04:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
full day caucus is that correct okay so
 
04:32:50.630 --> 04:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
um I will move forward I'm hoping to do
 
04:32:52.910 --> 04:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
maybe the 21st is there any objection to
 
04:32:55.010 --> 04:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
that Friday the 21st
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
from what I hear right here
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
okay so um representative breed I need
 
04:33:04.510 --> 04:33:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:08.810 --> 04:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
oh wait I need you to re-coordinate
 
04:33:14.269 --> 04:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.869 --> 04:33:23.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:23.879 --> 04:33:29.890 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:33:29.890 --> 04:33:29.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:29.900 --> 04:33:31.689 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:33:31.689 --> 04:33:31.699 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:33:33.890 --> 04:33:33.900 align:start position:0%
that sounds great so I'm hoping to have
 
04:33:35.990 --> 04:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
at least an hour conversation about
 
04:33:37.910 --> 04:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
possible solutions
 
04:33:39.470 --> 04:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
um that we've come up with so far and
 
04:33:40.970 --> 04:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
then any other stakeholders you'd like
 
04:33:42.289 --> 04:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
to bring in
 
04:33:44.029 --> 04:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
um and then we'll move forward from
 
04:33:46.369 --> 04:33:46.379 align:start position:0%
there if that works so um save the 21st
 
04:33:49.010 --> 04:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
in your calendar and we'll uh I'll be in
 
04:33:53.750 --> 04:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
