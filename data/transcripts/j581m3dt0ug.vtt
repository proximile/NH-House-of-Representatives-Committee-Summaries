e

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
all right it's
 
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
9:30 um so I'd like to open up the work
 
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
session on uh s SP
 
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 align:start position:0%
371 um and there's a proposed Chang so
 
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
um I'll introduce the content to the
 
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and then we can discuss it
 
00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:39.159 align:start position:0%
um last time we met on 371 there wasn't
 
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
a great deal of opposition from the
 
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to the underlying content
 
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill basically um resident
 
00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 align:start position:0%
doctors um were looking for uh or well
 
00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
actually the administration I would say
 
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
more Dartmouth was looking for an
 
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
exception to the twoe filing period for
 
00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
renewal of license um because they do it
 
00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the resident doctors
 
00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
because obviously the resident doctors
 
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
are working like 80 hours a week so
 
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
which is completely reasonable um so we
 
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
didn't really have any problem with the
 
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 align:start position:0%
the content of the underlying Bill uh
 
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
since that time I have uh had some
 
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
further discussion I've gained some more
 
00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
information um and so my my personal
 
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
position on the bill has changed um so
 
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 align:start position:0%
and I'll give you my reasons why uh in
 
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
order to Grant an exception in my
 
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
opinion from the 2-year licensing
 
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
requirement um we'd have to really prove
 
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
some sort of substantial hardship sh
 
00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 align:start position:0%
that was being caused to Dartmouth um
 
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
because really it's a bill for Dartmouth
 
00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
um either from a monetary perspective or
 
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
from a Time perspective it was either
 
00:03:39.869 --> 00:03:39.879 align:start position:0%
going to be really overburdening for
 
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 align:start position:0%
them from a time commitment or um it was
 
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
going to cost them a lot more money and
 
00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
in either case I was willing to make the
 
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
exception to the rule um on the money
 
00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 align:start position:0%
piece I learned that the fee is $50 to
 
00:03:56.429 --> 00:03:56.439 align:start position:0%
renew the license because the point of
 
00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 align:start position:0%
Licensing for each for each for each
 
00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.750 align:start position:0%
Licensing for each for each for each
individual

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
um because the point of lure is not to
 
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
make money they're not trying to turn
 
00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:06.439 align:start position:0%
profit on it if they have to do it more
 
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
frequently they'll just reduce the
 
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
license fee so if they have to
 
00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
renew you know one extra time instead of
 
00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
it being 50 for the full term it'll just
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
be 25 for the two times that they have
 
00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
to file so there's no financial hardship
 
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's going to be incurred by the
 
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
hospital for this for this to happen um
 
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
I also learned that oplc will not and
 
00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 align:start position:0%
has not well has not I mean if we tell
 
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
them they have to then they will but um
 
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 align:start position:0%
has not ever gone more than four years
 
00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:37.199 align:start position:0%
on a license so the maximum number of
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
renewals that are going to happen in
 
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
this situation are one at the 2-year
 
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
Mark with uh 450 of approximately 450
 
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
resident physicians at Dartmouth I'm
 
00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 align:start position:0%
assuming staggered that's an average of
 
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
just over a 100 people who are going to
 
00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 align:start position:0%
be looking for renewal on on an annual
 
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
basis is what basically what they're
 
00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
going to have to come up with so the
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
last question that for me I thought
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
needed to be answered was whether a Time
 
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 align:start position:0%
hardship was going to be created by the
 
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
number of things that they were going to
 
00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
have to do so I looked into the process
 
00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 align:start position:0%
I can share it with the subcommittee um
 
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
I don't know if you guys have ever had
 
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
to deal with license renewal in the
 
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
state I do for food service license so
 
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with the process that
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
director Courtney was sharing with me
 
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
where on your initial license
 
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
application you'll fill out all of your
 
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
information you'll submit it to the
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
department when you get your
 
00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:30.319 align:start position:0%
renewal basically all of the information
 
00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 align:start position:0%
is filled out for you you just have to
 
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
verify that nothing has
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
changed say nothing has changed if
 
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
nothing has changed and then in I'm not
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
sure exactly how oplc will do it but in
 
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
my case I don't have to respond if
 
00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 align:start position:0%
nothing has changed I just send in my
 
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
renewal fee and I'm done so if it takes
 
00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 align:start position:0%
5 minutes per application renewal which
 
00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
looking at the application renewal in my
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
opinion I don't think it would take
 
00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
really much more than that if that uh
 
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
depending on how oplc you know
 
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
fine-tunes that application process um
 
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
it's about an 8h hour workday for one
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
person once a year and to Grant an
 
00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
talking one one oplc staff no one person
 
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth filling out the renewal
 
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
applications about a day's worth of work
 
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
year and and as soon as you start
 
00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:25.919 align:start position:0%
granting exceptions to the rules then
 
00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to want an exception
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
for this reason or that reason so I mean
 
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'm fine I was fine and I'm I still am
 
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
fine if there was if I felt like there
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
was truly a hardship that was going to
 
00:06:37.909 --> 00:06:37.919 align:start position:0%
be put on Dartmouth we don't need to do
 
00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
that I don't think anybody has a desire
 
00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
to do that um you know but that's got to
 
00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:44.199 align:start position:0%
be balanced by being even-handed across
 
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
the board as well so I personally after
 
00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 align:start position:0%
looking into it a lot more uh closely
 
00:06:50.909 --> 00:06:50.919 align:start position:0%
could not find the financial hardship
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
because they're just going to reduce the
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
fee so that they're basically spending
 
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
the same amount of money and when I was
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
looking for the time hardship in the end
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
I couldn't find that either so so that's
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
kind of where I landed on the underlying
 
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
Bill and I'm more than happy to open it
 
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
up to the subcommittee for yeah commun
 
00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:07.919 align:start position:0%
conversation go ahead
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
Peter thanks Mr chair so the thing is um
 
00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
the this is going to be done by mail or
 
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 align:start position:0%
is it potentially going to be done
 
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
electronically no it's going to be done
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
electronically yeah so in other words it
 
00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:23.720 align:start position:0%
it'll come up on the computer or the
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
cell phone of the the in individual
 
00:07:29.869 --> 00:07:29.879 align:start position:0%
resident doctor that's affected he or
 
00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
she will put potentially push the button
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
um on their cell phone or on their
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
computer or whatever and and if if
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
there's any change he or she will make
 
00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:44.879 align:start position:0%
that change if not they'll just no
 
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
change and they're good so um it
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
probably won't be the resident physician
 
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
uh it'll be an administrator at
 
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Hitchcock even better yes but
 
00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
the way the way that it works the way
 
00:07:58.670 --> 00:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
that I've engaged with the system and it
 
00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
sounds like to the director this is what
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
they're heading towards you will receive
 
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
a paper in the mail uh that says here's
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
the information that we have on file has
 
00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:11.879 align:start position:0%
anything changed now being a residency
 
00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:13.879 align:start position:0%
more than likely nothing will have
 
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
changed um and what they do in my case
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
is they simply say if there are no
 
00:08:21.189 --> 00:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
changes to be made to the application
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
don't respond we'll just assume that
 
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
it's here and if we receive your filing
 
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
fee we're then you'll be renewed for
 
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
another another year that's how it
 
00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
happens in the food service industry
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
anyway and it sounds like this process
 
00:08:35.829 --> 00:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
will be the same so yes but it will be
 
00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
online so if you do have to make changes
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
you can you know go into the portal and
 
00:08:41.389 --> 00:08:41.399 align:start position:0%
if you're doing a 100 of these obviously
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
you get into a rhythm exactly the
 
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
staffer will be doing it at least that's
 
00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
what they're saying they could always
 
00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
push it off to the resident physician if
 
00:08:49.389 --> 00:08:49.399 align:start position:0%
they want to that's their choice they're
 
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
doing it because they're helping their
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
physician out which I appreciate because
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
those people are working extraordinarily
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
hard um so yeah so it would be a system
 
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
like that so once again where you know
 
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
maybe a hundred of these 120 of these in
 
00:09:08.509 --> 00:09:08.519 align:start position:0%
in a year um you know if it's for the
 
00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:10.480 align:start position:0%
vast majority of them if it's just the
 
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
time it takes to write a check and send
 
00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
it in the mail to ol uh to um
 
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
oplc um I just I can't find the hardship
 
00:09:22.509 --> 00:09:22.519 align:start position:0%
in that to Grant the exception
 
00:09:22.519 --> 00:09:26.269 align:start position:0%
in that to Grant the exception
personally

00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
Steve yeah yeah it's I just couldn't
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
find the burden and once again if I
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
could if I could find the burden I would
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
I would do it you know like I'm not
 
00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
trying to cause them any problems yeah I
 
00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely give me one second I'll um
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
any other comments from the committee
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
love to hear from the public if you guys
 
00:09:45.350 --> 00:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
want to testify come right up to the mic
 
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
on good morning morning morning thank
 
00:10:00.509 --> 00:10:00.519 align:start position:0%
you very much uh representative Simon
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee recognize
 
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:03.720 align:start position:0%
that it's a work session so we
 
00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak to
 
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
it we're here to speak to the bill and
 
00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:08.839 align:start position:0%
please do because we're still talking
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
about the bill so yeah great um so for
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Matthew Hood I'm
 
00:10:13.829 --> 00:10:13.839 align:start position:0%
the vice president of government
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
relations at Dartmouth Health you're
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
probably used to seeing my colleague
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
Courtney Tanner who's out of state uh
 
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
today and with me is Chelsea Nolan who's
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
the administrator of The Residency
 
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
program uh director excuse me uh of The
 
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:31.000 align:start position:0%
Residency program so has has insight
 
00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:32.519 align:start position:0%
into the actual nuts and bolts of the
 
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
operation of this program and what
 
00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
the failure to implement a variance or
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh for lack of a better word would
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
entail for Dartmouth Health excellent
 
00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:45.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for being
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
here so to some of the points that you
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
made thank you for looking into the
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
process thoroughly and from speaking it
 
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
from your experience with regards to the
 
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
food um
 
00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
industry what we have heard from the
 
00:10:59.069 --> 00:10:59.079 align:start position:0%
oplc during this process of change is
 
00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:01.240 align:start position:0%
that there would be yes the move to an
 
00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
electronic can you hear me okay oh yeah
 
00:11:05.829 --> 00:11:05.839 align:start position:0%
to an electronic system but as yet not
 
00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:08.839 align:start position:0%
in place currently what we have is a
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
paper renewal process that does not
 
00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
follow the process that you have
 
00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
identified thus far if it is going to
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
move in that direction we have not heard
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
about that from the oplc uh there's
 
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
requirement to create a new application
 
00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
from scratch with none of the
 
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
information that has been um con pre
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
previously obtained um as well there's
 
00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
requirement that the program director
 
00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:34.240 align:start position:0%
for that particular resident or fellow
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh complete a uh signatory saying that
 
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
they are still in good standing within
 
00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
their training program so we have to
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
obtain both that from the program
 
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
director as well as the application as
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
well as a $50 check and I I will make a
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
little bit of a joke here but it's true
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
residents don't know what checks are um
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
we honestly now I believe you 100% they
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't understand checks
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
and they don't understand how they get a
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
copy of avoided check um to be get to be
 
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
able to get a reimbursement so we will
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
be very hopeful that the oplc when
 
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
moving to the process of having an
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
electronic system will allow for credit
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
card or a um to be able to allow them to
 
00:12:13.230 --> 00:12:13.240 align:start position:0%
pay that in a timely fashion that has
 
00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:15.079 align:start position:0%
been a holdup for us over the last
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
number of years including this year with
 
00:12:19.189 --> 00:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
renewals being done because literally
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
they've never seen one before um so so
 
00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:24.839 align:start position:0%
just for clarification the resident is
 
00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:26.839 align:start position:0%
paying the renewal fee not the hospital
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
the resident pays the renewal fee
 
00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
because the opl will not on the board
 
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
before it would not have allowed uh dhmc
 
00:12:35.069 --> 00:12:35.079 align:start position:0%
to pay for all of the licenses that were
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
necessary and instead of check cutting
 
00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:39.720 align:start position:0%
One Singular check for each of the 120
 
00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
to 140 people per year that needed to be
 
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
renewed they'd required to have a
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
singular check go with each application
 
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
um connected to it so that they could
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
you know do their processing um then the
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
resident provides us with a um voided
 
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:56.120 align:start position:0%
check or something from their Bank
 
00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
showing that it was paid and then our
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
accounts payable office will reimburse
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
them for that fee MH uh to the point
 
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
about the cost um you're right that if
 
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:08.320 align:start position:0%
we stayed at the original level of $50
 
00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:09.680 align:start position:0%
per renewal it would be approximately
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
$9,000 a year that dhm would G dhmc
 
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
would pay which is not a significant
 
00:13:17.189 --> 00:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
amount of money and yet we'd rather not
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
pay that money if we don't have to I
 
00:13:20.829 --> 00:13:20.839 align:start position:0%
don't want you to either and put it
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
towards education and and other things
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
like that uh at least in the gme realm
 
00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
that's what we're most most concerned
 
00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:28.680 align:start position:0%
with uh we have not heard the idea that
 
00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
they would maybe decrease the fee to $25
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
or to some lesser amount what we would
 
00:13:34.269 --> 00:13:34.279 align:start position:0%
be of course very thankful for them to
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
be able to do
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
that um so just for your peace of mind
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
I've talked to the director about it
 
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:42.560 align:start position:0%
specifically and I will I mean she was
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
already in the space where they would do
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
that but I will insist that they do that
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
so great shouldn't create a a larger
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
financial burden for you or the doctors
 
00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
understand the other piece around what
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
the administrative burden would be would
 
00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
be with regards to your calculation of
 
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
approximately one day per year that be
 
00:14:00.829 --> 00:14:00.839 align:start position:0%
necessary for an administrator to do
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
this work there's a variety of
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
confounding factors that go along with
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
that which where I would disagree with
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
you as to the amount of time um one of
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
those things has to do with the number
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
of Visa holders that we have at our
 
00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
organization who need ecfmg status and
 
00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:15.759 align:start position:0%
other kinds of requirements in terms of
 
00:14:17.829 --> 00:14:17.839 align:start position:0%
upkeep of their visa to allow them to
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
continue to work at
 
00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
dhmc so we have uh very specific
 
00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:23.639 align:start position:0%
regulations we need to follow with
 
00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
regards to those processes and the
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
licensing that takes place so that is a
 
00:14:30.910 --> 00:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
more extensive process for Visa
 
00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:33.759 align:start position:0%
holders in addition uh just for
 
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
clarification you only have to do that
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
if the license is being renewed you
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
don't have to do that on a regular basis
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
regardless at the renewal time we would
 
00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
need to be providing that information to
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
the ecfmg to maintain their status as as
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
Visa holding uh resident trainees right
 
00:14:51.829 --> 00:14:51.839 align:start position:0%
so I'm saying anytime we renewed okay so
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
if it's four years then you only have to
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
do that every four years if it's every
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
two years you're going to have to do
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
that every years exactly right and also
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
to your point um earlier
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know how much everyone
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
knows about what the training process
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
looks like for residents and fellows we
 
00:15:07.269 --> 00:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
train people from 1 to 7 years depending
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
on the length of training so a
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
neurosurgeon gets seven years of
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
training and someone who is in a
 
00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:14.839 align:start position:0%
preliminary year in in surgery gets one
 
00:15:16.269 --> 00:15:16.279 align:start position:0%
and then goes on to four additional
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
years of training so we are looking at a
 
00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
difference between renewing people every
 
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
four years which most people would get
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
done within that 4-year period of time
 
00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
most residencies are 3 to 5 years long
 
00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
um and instead moving it to two or three
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
times that we would need to renew people
 
00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
Additionally the way that the board at
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
the oplc has put this forward to us is
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
that when a resident applies for their
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
license so right now people are applying
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
to start in June when they start with us
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
for our June orientation and July their
 
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
license will become effective let's say
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
if I send in my license and and the oplc
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
approves it on April 15th it will be
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
good for 2 years to April 15th of the
 
00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
following year the previous way that
 
00:16:00.749 --> 00:16:00.759 align:start position:0%
licenses were being were being done was
 
00:16:02.990 --> 00:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
that they would all expire on June 30th
 
00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:04.839 align:start position:0%
let's say of every every year or every
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
other year for people um so what we're
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
going to do is have this continual
 
00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
update and tracking of all of the
 
00:16:13.309 --> 00:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
individuals at the time that they are
 
00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:15.319 align:start position:0%
actually receiving their license as
 
00:16:16.749 --> 00:16:16.759 align:start position:0%
opposed to having a standard license
 
00:16:18.309 --> 00:16:18.319 align:start position:0%
date so to your point of whether it
 
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
takes eight hours for someone to do that
 
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
work it would definitely take them
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
longer than that but it would also be
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
spread over a period of time in order to
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
meet all of the timing um CL need needs
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
and to get each of them through because
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
we definitely do have people who begin
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
about half of our residents and fellows
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
start in July half start in June and
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
then we have people who are off cycle as
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
well all of this is just to say that
 
00:16:43.189 --> 00:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
there is some Nuance to the way in which
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
this is done in the Resident population
 
00:16:50.389 --> 00:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
finally I would also note that they are
 
00:16:53.389 --> 00:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
contracted to work at dhmc for the
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
entirety of their training if they
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
choose to leave because they want to
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
relocate to another place or they've
 
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
chosen to move to a different specialty
 
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.240 align:start position:0%
because they're not a competent
 
00:17:04.710 --> 00:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
clinician in a particular way but they
 
00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
could be in a different
 
00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
um I lost my train of thought uh if they
 
00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880 align:start position:0%
leave they're going someplace else if
 
00:17:16.789 --> 00:17:16.799 align:start position:0%
they if they have to do that
 
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
um oh sorry totally lost my train do
 
00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:21.160 align:start position:0%
something with with the license renewal
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
or their license status would change
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
or um well while chesy uh grabs for that
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
thought the only where I went where I
 
00:17:32.909 --> 00:17:32.919 align:start position:0%
thought she was going with that thought
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
is that yes residents obviously train at
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
the medical center but residents are
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
also placed throughout the state so at
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
conquered Hospital Portsmouth elsewhere
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
um at other locations so um our
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
residents truly training the workforce
 
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
for the state and and region not just
 
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
for the Lebanon Anover area I think that
 
00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:54.039 align:start position:0%
the thing we're most concerned about
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
really is the opportunity to be able to
 
00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
work directly with the oplc on a process
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
that works well for this this particular
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
group of individuals who are contracted
 
00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
to work in one place who are not
 
00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:06.360 align:start position:0%
required to provide CME like a like a
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
regular attending physician would be um
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
and who really if they leave our
 
00:18:14.669 --> 00:18:14.679 align:start position:0%
employee at dhmc and move somewhere else
 
00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
they no longer can have their training
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
license at all and so we're really tied
 
00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
to them and they're really tied to us
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
with regards to these processes and
 
00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
ensuring that they have their
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate lure in place at all times
 
00:18:30.149 --> 00:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
because if were to have a laps we would
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
immediately move them out of clinical
 
00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
work until they had that license renewed
 
00:18:36.230 --> 00:18:36.240 align:start position:0%
that is a thing that I am particularly
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
concerned about with regards to the
 
00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
resident being the responsible party
 
00:18:42.470 --> 00:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
which is what the op oplc has told us in
 
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
the past is sort of different than what
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
you've spoken about today um they really
 
00:18:49.590 --> 00:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
told us that we could no longer help in
 
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
that process um in any kind of real way
 
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
we could in the back background you know
 
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
obviously P provide reporting to
 
00:18:57.870 --> 00:18:57.880 align:start position:0%
programs and to Residents to remind them
 
00:18:59.549 --> 00:18:59.559 align:start position:0%
that their licenses due to expire and
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to need to re um have it
 
00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:06.200 align:start position:0%
reapplied um but the actual fact of
 
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
needing to have them reapply every two
 
00:19:10.029 --> 00:19:10.039 align:start position:0%
years there really isn't anything that
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
is going to change about them within
 
00:19:13.549 --> 00:19:13.559 align:start position:0%
that period of time the difference
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
between a two-year or fouryear renewal
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
is to me to me I understand it from the
 
00:19:20.149 --> 00:19:20.159 align:start position:0%
idea of having all lure across the state
 
00:19:22.149 --> 00:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
wanting to be standard and yet at the
 
00:19:24.549 --> 00:19:24.559 align:start position:0%
same time this is a group of apprentices
 
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
honestly who are contracted to work with
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
us and there is nothing that's changing
 
00:19:29.430 --> 00:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
about their stat status during that
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
2-year period of time if it did when
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
when a resident leaves early our office
 
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:37.240 align:start position:0%
communicates with the oplc to say that
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
person is no longer no longer in our
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
employee and no longer can have a
 
00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
license so the piece around two versus
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
four years to us feels arbitrary for
 
00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
sure um well um let me ask you well
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
actually any questions from the
 
00:19:52.510 --> 00:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittee before I ask a
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
question okay um I I understand that the
 
00:19:57.789 --> 00:19:57.799 align:start position:0%
status isn't really going to change from
 
00:19:59.950 --> 00:19:59.960 align:start position:0%
two to four years does that differ from
 
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
when they're a fully licensed physician
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
though because that's really not going
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
to change from 2 to four years I either
 
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
will it other than that's just when the
 
00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:08.919 align:start position:0%
state is requiring that they renew their
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
license uh I would argue that as a fully
 
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
licensed physician who is under who does
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
not have to require supervision from any
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
other individual in order to do their
 
00:20:19.830 --> 00:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
job there is risk there that they that
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
the um state is taking on with regards
 
00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:24.320 align:start position:0%
to the licensure of that individual and
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
they do require the continuing education
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
that needs to be provided to ensure that
 
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
they are continuing with the um the
 
00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
depth of inform depth of knowledge that
 
00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:36.039 align:start position:0%
they need within their specialty in
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
order to continue to do their job so
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
there's a different level of risk that
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
the state is taking on with regards to a
 
00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
full-time attending physician who can
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
leave the employee of any place they
 
00:20:49.149 --> 00:20:49.159 align:start position:0%
want and move and work anywhere in New
 
00:20:51.549 --> 00:20:51.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as opposed to a resident who
 
00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:53.799 align:start position:0%
is under supervision from an attending
 
00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
physician and who is contracted to work
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
directly at our organization great thank
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
you for the the clarification I
 
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.270 align:start position:0%
you for the the clarification I
appreciate

00:21:00.270 --> 00:21:00.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
that just checking in any questions you
 
00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:06.559 align:start position:0%
good you're good um let me think for a
 
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
second so that I can make sure I cover
 
00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
all my bases
 
00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:14.720 align:start position:0%
um so you did mention um that OPC has
 
00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:17.480 align:start position:0%
said to you that the resident Physicians
 
00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
will be responsible for their own
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
licensure renewal yes um and well first
 
00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:26.000 align:start position:0%
I wanted to clarify from a mathematical
 
00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
perspective I was saying only one more
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
license renewal that you would have
 
00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise had to do because oplc and you
 
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
can tell me if this has been different
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
from your experience said they never
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
renew for more than four year like for
 
00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
four years previously that was correct
 
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
yes right so if it was going out seven
 
00:21:41.789 --> 00:21:41.799 align:start position:0%
they still would have had to renew at 4
 
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
correct anybody four five six or one day
 
00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:47.400 align:start position:0%
day over four would be required okay um
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
and also clarification from what I was
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
saying before I was uh the mathematics
 
00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:53.000 align:start position:0%
of eight hours or a work day was just to
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
simplify obviously I didn't think that
 
00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:55.720 align:start position:0%
they were all happening on one day and
 
00:21:57.269 --> 00:21:57.279 align:start position:0%
it was just going to take one understand
 
00:21:59.110 --> 00:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
one person um
 
00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:00.919 align:start position:0%
but uh so that's falling on them to
 
00:22:04.269 --> 00:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
renew their own licenses correct um
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
which previously before the changes that
 
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
we've been making in oplc was not the
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
case you were just able to do the whole
 
00:22:11.710 --> 00:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
thing yourself correct there wasn't an
 
00:22:13.909 --> 00:22:13.919 align:start position:0%
actual we could communicate with
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
directly with the oplc and provide a
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
letter that said these individuals are
 
00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
continuing on in their training as they
 
00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:20.919 align:start position:0%
had received previously to know the
 
00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:22.760 align:start position:0%
start and end date of training as soon
 
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
as soon as the application went through
 
00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:26.159 align:start position:0%
to say yes confirmed these people are
 
00:22:27.310 --> 00:22:27.320 align:start position:0%
moving forward and they would extend
 
00:22:29.390 --> 00:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
their license so was a very simple
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
process that fell in line directly with
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
the initial application and the length
 
00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.480 align:start position:0%
of training you expect somebody to be in
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
based on the specialty in which they're
 
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
training okay and just one more
 
00:22:41.789 --> 00:22:41.799 align:start position:0%
clarification and I think I'm good uh
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
you had mentioned because you have a lot
 
00:22:45.990 --> 00:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
of um International people working for
 
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
you there was other paperwork that you
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
had to fill out during a renewal cycle
 
00:22:52.909 --> 00:22:52.919 align:start position:0%
and that goes to who the ecfmg yes can
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
you um give me the words that go with
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
the letters I actually don't know okay
 
00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:00.360 align:start position:0%
in my office who manages that knows it
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
all inside and out but I can get it for
 
00:23:05.029 --> 00:23:05.039 align:start position:0%
you okay um yeah just uh and so that's
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
outside of the state lure protocol
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's that's totally separate that's
 
00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
Federal that's Federal okay but they the
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
federal bases it off of the state
 
00:23:16.269 --> 00:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
requirements it's not that there's a
 
00:23:17.669 --> 00:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
federal license it's just that there's
 
00:23:19.269 --> 00:23:19.279 align:start position:0%
requirements with regards to Visa
 
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:21.200 align:start position:0%
holders in terms of what they can and
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
can't do when they're in training in the
 
00:23:24.990 --> 00:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
United States and so anytime there's a
 
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
change to anything that has to do with
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
them we have to contact the ecfmg to
 
00:23:29.710 --> 00:23:29.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that they are aware of that
 
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
because they're looking at their visa
 
00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
status when they go home to let's say
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
India for a two week vacation to see
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
their family and come back we have
 
00:23:38.430 --> 00:23:38.440 align:start position:0%
people who get stuck in India trying to
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
come back home so there's there's
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
requirements around any Visa holder and
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
um how they can train where they can
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
train what their license looks like Etc
 
00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:50.919 align:start position:0%
okay and your average time that you feel
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
like it takes out to do that for a
 
00:23:55.149 --> 00:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
person just average I know it's going to
 
00:23:58.510 --> 00:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
be more for some less for others but uh
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
I I I guess I'd give it an hour okay per
 
00:24:04.149 --> 00:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:06.310 --> 00:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
per thank you so much for coming in and
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
testifying appreciate that anything else
 
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
from you guys before we uh no I was just
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
going to say thank you for the
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak to the subcommittee
 
00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate that realize you don't have
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
to do that and then with respect to the
 
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
hearing you're going to hear the similar
 
00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:21.679 align:start position:0%
information I assume um but presume that
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
that's the information you're looking
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
for to inform the yes absolutely and you

10:15 um on an amendment for this bill
 
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:39.080 align:start position:0%

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%

00:25:31.789 --> 00:25:31.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:31.799 --> 00:25:33.990 align:start position:0%
 
all

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%

Courtney and ver verify some stuff so
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
that when we talk about it later this
 
00:25:48.269 --> 00:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
afternoon we have the information that
 
00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
we need there
 
00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.630 align:start position:0%
we need there
[Music]

00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think um what I'd like to do
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
is look at the amendment briefly with
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
you guys so we know what that's about
 
00:26:00.029 --> 00:26:00.039 align:start position:0%
going to committee um at the moment you
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
just want to leave it without
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation while we finish sorting
 
00:26:04.149 --> 00:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
things out we can just discuss it with
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
the full committee I think
 
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
that's I'll make that motion without
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation do I have a second Peter
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
all in favor all right we'll go without
 
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation we'll talk about it with
 
00:26:15.870 --> 00:26:15.880 align:start position:0%
the whole committee then um there's a an
 
00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
amendment SB 371 uh we'll have a public
 
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on this in a little bit but I
 
00:26:22.029 --> 00:26:22.039 align:start position:0%
just wanted the subcommittee to have a
 
00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
bit of a heads up on it um we've been
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
restructuring the different boards uh in
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
oplc as we move responsibility from the
 
00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
board to oplc for certain functions um
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
and so we hadn't done that with uh the
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
licensing and regulation of Physicians
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
and so most of this is language changing
 
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
um things moving things from the board
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
to the office like we've done with all
 
00:26:50.389 --> 00:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
the other boards um there were a couple
 
00:26:50.399 --> 00:26:51.630 align:start position:0%
the other boards um there were a couple
of

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
things in here that
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:07.389 --> 00:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
25 um we're and we may need to do a
 
00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
floor amendment to this language here as
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
well to fix it but um we wanted to make
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
sure that even in these courtesy
 
00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:15.080 align:start position:0%
licenses that can be given for 100 days
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
that the license that's held by the
 
00:27:18.909 --> 00:27:18.919 align:start position:0%
individual uh is substantially similar
 
00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
to the requirements that New Hampshire
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
has for their licensing which my
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
understanding is it's pretty much the
 
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
same across the board regardless um but
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
we want I just I felt more comfortable
 
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
having that
 
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
33 um we're just connecting the renewal
 
00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
process to 3108 which is what we've been
 
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
talking about the every two years and um
 
00:27:51.149 --> 00:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
all of the requirements that we have
 
00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:52.640 align:start position:0%
that keep it consistent with everything
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
else but instead of delineating it in
 
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
its own language we're just tying it to
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
the what we've already put
 
00:27:58.679 --> 00:28:00.590 align:start position:0%
the what we've already put
statute

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
um just to keep it
 
00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
simple and I suppose too so that if it
 
00:28:08.230 --> 00:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
changes it will change with it we don't
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.909 --> 00:28:15.919 align:start position:0%
thing I think those are the main
 
00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
ones so once again we'll have a public
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
hearing on it so you guys can hear about
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
that but uh figured we'd get that work
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
done this year so that we don't have to
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
do it in some sort of subsequent year
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
since we're knee deep in it already
 
00:28:31.029 --> 00:28:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
straightforward all right well we've got
 
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.559 align:start position:0%
a public heing in 4 minutes so I'll uh
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
adjourn the work
 
00:28:57.029 --> 00:28:57.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:57.039 --> 00:29:27.029 align:start position:0%
 
time

00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:57.029 align:start position:0%

00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:37.430 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:40.000 align:start position:0%
morning I'm opening the public hearing
 
00:32:42.389 --> 00:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill 302 and I call the
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.629 --> 00:32:55.639 align:start position:0%
rosenal good morning thank you madam
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee
 
00:33:00.750 --> 00:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
for the record I'm Sydney
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
rosenal and I represent with the honor I
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
hope Senate District 13 in nashwa I'm
 
00:33:12.509 --> 00:33:12.519 align:start position:0%
very pleased to bring you Senate Bill
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
302 which will make it easier for New
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire patients to have teleah Health
 
00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
appointments with their
 
00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
Physicians who are located in another
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
state this issue was brought to me by a
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
constituent last year his wife is being
 
00:33:36.629 --> 00:33:36.639 align:start position:0%
treated by a group of doctors in Boston
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
whom they like and know well my
 
00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
constituent sometimes has interim telea
 
00:33:48.269 --> 00:33:48.279 align:start position:0%
Health appointments on behalf of his
 
00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:52.519 align:start position:0%
wife but because the doctors practice in
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and don't have a New
 
00:33:58.190 --> 00:33:58.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire license my constituent has to
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
be physically located in Massachusetts
 
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
to talk with
 
00:34:09.149 --> 00:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
them he sometimes is able to borrow a
 
00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:12.200 align:start position:0%
room at a public library but the Wi-Fi
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
is not good and he often gets kicked out
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes he sits in a parking lot and
 
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
talks on the phone but he has to be
 
00:34:24.109 --> 00:34:24.119 align:start position:0%
physically located in
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts this just doesn't make
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
sense to me
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
technology doesn't stop at the border
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
and I as I've spoken to people at
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
oplc the medical society and at the
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and also last
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
spring I spoke with this chair of the
 
00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
Board of
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
Medicine it became clear that a simple
 
00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
very limited licensing exemption would
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
be helpful to New Hampshire
 
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
patients so this bill exempts an outof
 
00:35:07.190 --> 00:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
State physician from needing a New
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire medical
 
00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
license only when they have an
 
00:35:14.589 --> 00:35:14.599 align:start position:0%
established relationship with the
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
patient in the physician's home state of
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
Licensing and they see them in person at
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
least once a year but as often as the
 
00:35:30.589 --> 00:35:30.599 align:start position:0%
patients's condition
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
requires this way people can have video
 
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
tella health or telephone appointments
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
with their doctors who practice
 
00:35:43.990 --> 00:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
elsewhere from the comfort of home and
 
00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
not have to drive over the state border
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
and sit in a parking lot I think it's a
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
common sense bill it's very
 
00:35:57.390 --> 00:35:57.400 align:start position:0%
limited um it was very carefully crafted
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
to to be extremely narrow but I think it
 
00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
will help a lot of New Hampshire
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
patients and I hope the committee will
 
00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
find it a to pass thank you I'm happy to
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
take questions represent man
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
py thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question um what
 
00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.349 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question um what
uh

00:36:20.349 --> 00:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
this um going from the New Hampshire
 
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
Physicians dunella Health in Mass
 
00:36:29.230 --> 00:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Physicians doing tah
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
health for patients in New Hampshire is
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
there a
 
00:36:38.349 --> 00:36:38.359 align:start position:0%
reciprocity like New
 
00:36:42.309 --> 00:36:42.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Physicians seeing
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts patients just especially
 
00:36:49.349 --> 00:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
in nashwa the Border across the street I
 
00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
mean across the border and I have been
 
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:54.880 align:start position:0%
asked several times from the physicians
 
00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire they cannot
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
treat they can treat the patient when
 
00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
they come to New Hampshire hospital or
 
00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:08.560 align:start position:0%
their practice but TAA Health across the
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
border in perol L dunable is not allowed
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
so it's the similar situation have you
 
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
considered that with that yeah well in
 
00:37:21.069 --> 00:37:21.079 align:start position:0%
that situation is particularly acute
 
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
across the river from Dartmouth hedgcock
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
where 40% of the patients live in
 
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.069 align:start position:0%
where 40% of the patients live in
Vermont

00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
Vermont
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we cannot control how
 
00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
other states license their Physicians
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has not joined the
 
00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
Physicians compact they've considered it
 
00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
they haven't done it if they did it it
 
00:37:50.630 --> 00:37:50.640 align:start position:0%
would make it easier but we are only
 
00:37:56.589 --> 00:37:56.599 align:start position:0%
able to control what happens in in our
 
00:37:56.599 --> 00:37:58.510 align:start position:0%
able to control what happens in in our
borders

00:37:58.510 --> 00:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
borders
 
00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:01.319 align:start position:0%
so so we just can't do what you're
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
suggesting which a lot of Physicians
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
would like to see
 
00:38:11.550 --> 00:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
happen follow up thank you madam chair
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh the followup to is from what I
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
understand the federal licensing for
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
Physicians New Hampshire doesn't belong
 
00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.870 align:start position:0%
Physicians New Hampshire doesn't belong
to

00:38:21.870 --> 00:38:21.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:38:26.309 --> 00:38:26.319 align:start position:0%
that and so uh New Hampshire you have to
 
00:38:29.109 --> 00:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
get medical license in New Hampshire
 
00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
whether you have in other states and
 
00:38:35.589 --> 00:38:35.599 align:start position:0%
reciprocity is a cumbersome process is
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
would that make it easier just a
 
00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
question that
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
I'm asking I I think you're referring to
 
00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
the Physicians compact New Hampshire
 
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't I hope they will join it
 
00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:02.440 align:start position:0%
yeah but if if if not this could apply
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
to somebody who has a procedure out at
 
00:39:08.109 --> 00:39:08.119 align:start position:0%
the Mayo Clinic in
 
00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
Minnesota wants to have a followup
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
appointment with the physician who did
 
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
the procedure this means they wouldn't
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
have to fly out to
 
00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
Minnesota they could have a teleah
 
00:39:25.589 --> 00:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
health appointment so this is this is a
 
00:39:28.829 --> 00:39:28.839 align:start position:0%
small thing but I think it would be a
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
big thing
 
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.910 align:start position:0%
big thing
for

00:39:32.910 --> 00:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:35.960 align:start position:0%
the comfort
 
00:39:40.030 --> 00:39:40.040 align:start position:0%
and uh ease of New Hampshire's patients
 
00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:42.190 align:start position:0%
and uh ease of New Hampshire's patients
without

00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
jeopardizing health and
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
safety all right thank you other
 
00:39:49.829 --> 00:39:49.839 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Senator thank you
 
00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
good morning Madame chair members of the
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:40:07.349 --> 00:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
Jessica esand I'm the senior public
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
policy manager for the Alzheimer's
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
Association here in New Hampshire uh I
 
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
am pleased to appear today in support of
 
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 302 and thanks Senator Rosen
 
00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
Wald and the sponsors for their
 
00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:20.480 align:start position:0%
leadership on this issue um as you've
 
00:40:23.069 --> 00:40:23.079 align:start position:0%
heard uh as we all know there is a
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
healthcare Workforce shortage in New
 
00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for example affecting our
 
00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:30.200 align:start position:0%
demographic in 2021 there were just 33
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
geriatricians in New Hampshire um
 
00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
compared with the over 26,000 Granite
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
Staters living with Alzheimer's disease
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
this makes it really hard for folks to
 
00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:42.440 align:start position:0%
receive Specialized Care in state and
 
00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
has necessitated a lot of the folks that
 
00:40:47.589 --> 00:40:47.599 align:start position:0%
we serve um to establish provider
 
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
relationships over state borders
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes in
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and as you've heard uh
 
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
accessing these appointments via tella
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
Health can be difficult this is causing
 
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
again as you heard folks to take uh
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
tella Health calls in parking lots over
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
the Border or look for a quiet place in
 
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
a library which is often unreliable and
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
not necessarily private uh so by making
 
00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
this small exemption in law we really
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
feel that this would benefit and remove
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
what we see as an undue burden on not
 
00:41:19.349 --> 00:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
only the folks that we work with uh who
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
have Alzheimer's or other dementia but
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
also their family members and caregivers
 
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
who are often um a part of the logistics
 
00:41:27.670 --> 00:41:27.680 align:start position:0%
of getting them to these appointments
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
where they need to be and um are often
 
00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
juggling other life responsibilities
 
00:41:35.309 --> 00:41:35.319 align:start position:0%
employment Child Care Etc whatever they
 
00:41:38.510 --> 00:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
may be so uh this small exemption would
 
00:41:40.349 --> 00:41:40.359 align:start position:0%
allow these folks to access the
 
00:41:42.109 --> 00:41:42.119 align:start position:0%
Specialized Care they need but from the
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
privacy and comfort of their own home um
 
00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
and free up some time that could be
 
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise spent managing other other
 
00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that they have so we
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
would ask that you uh support this
 
00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'm happy to take any
 
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:59.190 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'm happy to take any
questions

00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
representative gold thank you madam
 
00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
and I apologize my mind was wandering a
 
00:42:08.109 --> 00:42:08.119 align:start position:0%
little if you already addressed this but
 
00:42:11.150 --> 00:42:11.160 align:start position:0%
my question is would this measure make
 
00:42:13.349 --> 00:42:13.359 align:start position:0%
treatment more affordable for some
 
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
patients for example the um example we
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
got about having to fly to a far away
 
00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
place where you've had treatment for
 
00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
followup I mean I would think just
 
00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
pragmatically you know the the cost
 
00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
associated with travel whether it be gas
 
00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
or mileage or airfare I I could see it
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
certainly cutting down on that in terms
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
of the the costs of treatment I wouldn't
 
00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
be speaking to that but I do think it
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
would help defay Associated costs just
 
00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.549 align:start position:0%
would help defay Associated costs just
with

00:42:39.549 --> 00:42:39.559 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
travel thank
 
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
you representative Schmidt thank you
 
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
madam chair uh I should have asked the
 
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
senator this question as well but
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps you can answer is there any
 
00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:53.800 align:start position:0%
objection to this on the part of the
 
00:42:56.549 --> 00:42:56.559 align:start position:0%
medical community or uh other
 
00:42:56.559 --> 00:42:57.910 align:start position:0%
medical community or uh other
stakeholders

00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
stakeholders
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
who would
 
00:43:05.030 --> 00:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
be in some fashion harmed by this small
 
00:43:07.430 --> 00:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
exemption which would clearly would be
 
00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
beneficial for the patients and helpful
 
00:43:13.309 --> 00:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
to the practitioners as well so is there
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
been any push back um I would defer to
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
the senator on that I have not had any
 
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
conversations indicating that but I
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
would no thank you thank you there's
 
00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:27.680 align:start position:0%

you represent mudy thank you madam chair
 
00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
quick question in terms of the P
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's patients that you referred
 
00:43:40.349 --> 00:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
to wouldn't this help them with the
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
transition of not leaving their comfort
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
zone where wherever they are because of
 
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
their state of mind and if they are in a
 
00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's care in
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they can still get their
 
00:43:59.069 --> 00:43:59.079 align:start position:0%
care from
 
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
the um or the vice versa if um they have
 
00:44:07.549 --> 00:44:07.559 align:start position:0%
moved closer to the family in New
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but they were getting care in
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts by The Physicians they can
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
continue to get not having to
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
transition everything location Care and
 
00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%

thank you for having me my name is krie

Dennis I live in Auburn I have early
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
stage early onset Alzheimer's and I am
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
here to testify in support of Bill
 
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
302 when I began noticing problems with
 
00:45:03.150 --> 00:45:03.160 align:start position:0%
my memory I brought my concerns up with
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
my primary care doctor he referred me
 
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
locally to have a cognitive test which I
 
00:45:11.349 --> 00:45:11.359 align:start position:0%
passed it would be a he told me I was
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
fine it would be a conversation I would
 
00:45:16.430 --> 00:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
have several times over that next year
 
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
during my final meeting with him
 
00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:20.359 align:start position:0%
frustrated he told me that if I had
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's I would have no idea that my
 
00:45:24.630 --> 00:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
family would bring me in because I would
 
00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
have no clue where I was
 
00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.910 align:start position:0%
have no clue where I was
anger

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
anger
 
00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
aside this doctor did not have the
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
experience or the expertise to be able
 
00:45:37.190 --> 00:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
to diagnose Alzheimer's especially early
 
00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.710 align:start position:0%
to diagnose Alzheimer's especially early
onset

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
onset
 
00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.230 align:start position:0%
onset
Alzheimer's

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
fortunately I am I worked for a company
 
00:45:45.309 --> 00:45:45.319 align:start position:0%
that had the benefits of something
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
called an expert medical
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
opinion it recommended that I go to one
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
of the research hospitals in
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I have been working with
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
Mass General Hospital for almost a year
 
00:45:59.150 --> 00:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
and because the law requires me to be in
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
the same state as my doctor I have to be
 
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts every time I speak with
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
him in one of my visits I had received a
 
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
test result over my
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
echart and uh I sent him a message and
 
00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
he wanted to clarify and explain and
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
help me to understand what that
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
diagnosis meant and the fastest way to
 
00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:24.680 align:start position:0%
do that was through a telec call um
 
00:46:26.109 --> 00:46:26.119 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it meant that I had to
 
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
drive to a parking lot in Massachusetts
 
00:46:33.150 --> 00:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
conversation driving to Boston is very
 
00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:38.200 align:start position:0%
difficult for me my husband takes time
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
off from work with each visit I had
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
eight appointments last year three of
 
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:45.160 align:start position:0%
them could have easily been tah Health
 
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
appointments this diagnosis has been
 
00:46:51.069 --> 00:46:51.079 align:start position:0%
hard and not getting to my doctors in
 
00:46:52.910 --> 00:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts for the quality care that
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
I need is not going to get any easier

302 um I've been diagnosed with young
 
00:47:46.589 --> 00:47:46.599 align:start position:0%
younger onset Alzheimer's as well um due
 
00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:48.440 align:start position:0%
to the shortage of neurologists and
 
00:47:50.589 --> 00:47:50.599 align:start position:0%
other health care providers in New
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I get medical treatment at
 
00:47:54.990 --> 00:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
Mass General Hospital memory care
 
00:47:57.309 --> 00:47:57.319 align:start position:0%
because of the uh current constraint on
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
Physicians under the current law I'm
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
required to travel to Massachusetts for
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
every appointment even tell Health to
 
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
access care this is a burden to me as
 
00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
well as my spouse who still works um I
 
00:48:11.670 --> 00:48:11.680 align:start position:0%
had to close my business and we have
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
half the income now so his job's very
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
important um for insurance and um just
 
00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
living so um in order for me to in order
 
00:48:24.270 --> 00:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
to join me he has to take time off of
 
00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
work um he he you know he could get
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
conference room and do it from work but
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
he has to take time off it's at least a
 
00:48:34.270 --> 00:48:34.280 align:start position:0%
half day um every time we have a meeting
 
00:48:37.829 --> 00:48:37.839 align:start position:0%
and um then we end up in a parking lot
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
or somewhere with poor Wi-Fi um
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's in and out um and uh it's
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
it's uncomfortable um but it's the best
 
00:48:52.710 --> 00:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
that we can do right now um we'd like to
 
00:48:57.230 --> 00:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
be spared this burden and um you know it
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
would be a big it would be one less
 
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
thing on our plate so you know having
 
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis is challenging um it would
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
be so helpful if accessing care was not
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:11.240 align:start position:0%
challenges um I respectfully ask that
 
00:49:12.829 --> 00:49:12.839 align:start position:0%
you support this
 
00:49:15.150 --> 00:49:15.160 align:start position:0%

00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
res Research Center and you have access
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%

studies yes I'm not currently I was just
 
00:50:07.950 --> 00:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
diagnosed in June last year um and it

through the Alzheimer's Association
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
getting the support and information I
 
00:50:19.710 --> 00:50:19.720 align:start position:0%
need to know that there are hopeful
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
things I can do um and it would
 
00:50:25.390 --> 00:50:25.400 align:start position:0%
definitely take away that barrier um I I
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
can't drive in Boston um everything I do
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
requires me to have somebody take me
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
there so thank you for thinking of that

beginning I think all of us have uh
 
00:51:15.549 --> 00:51:15.559 align:start position:0%
constituents who touch our hearts in
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
different ways when we go out
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
campaigning we say what are your
 
00:51:22.630 --> 00:51:22.640 align:start position:0%
concerns and they say let me tell you a
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
story this is a story
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
Ry and Caroline which are not their
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
names have been married 48 years this
 
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:34.920 align:start position:0%
week Caroline was diagnosed with
 
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's 15 years ago they were
 
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
planning to come themselves and
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
testify until uh Caroline had to be
 
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
admitted to a memory care unit in
 
00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:49.520 align:start position:0%
February and Ry is meeting with the
 
00:51:51.589 --> 00:51:51.599 align:start position:0%
doctor this morning so he asked me to
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
testify for him and said please tell my
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
story so I will
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
um prior to the pandemic there was no
 
00:52:04.829 --> 00:52:04.839 align:start position:0%
problem with a phone call during when
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
Caroline was getting her care in
 
00:52:10.829 --> 00:52:10.839 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh prior to the pandemic
 
00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:12.760 align:start position:0%
there were no problems with phone calls
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic when tele medicine
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
became a major advantage uh for people
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
who couldn't travel that was fine and
 
00:52:23.549 --> 00:52:23.559 align:start position:0%
then after the pandemic was over he was
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
told that he needed to drive to
 
00:52:27.789 --> 00:52:27.799 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts with the spotty phone
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
reception the conversations in libraries
 
00:52:33.829 --> 00:52:33.839 align:start position:0%
which are public places at the same time
 
00:52:36.510 --> 00:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
he was a fulltime caregiver which meant
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
that he had to get respit care for his
 
00:52:41.630 --> 00:52:41.640 align:start position:0%
wife so he could go and make a phone
 
00:52:43.870 --> 00:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
call for her he did not want to have to
 
00:52:46.470 --> 00:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
leave her but he did it was the only way
 
00:52:48.789 --> 00:52:48.799 align:start position:0%
he could take care of her
 
00:52:48.799 --> 00:52:51.990 align:start position:0%
he could take care of her
care

00:52:51.990 --> 00:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:56.829 --> 00:52:56.839 align:start position:0%
uh she uh
 
00:52:58.750 --> 00:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
a few months ago the reason that she is
 
00:53:01.829 --> 00:53:01.839 align:start position:0%
now in a memory care unit is that when
 
00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
they went to bed one night she was
 
00:53:05.789 --> 00:53:05.799 align:start position:0%
afraid to go to bed with him because she
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
didn't know who he
 
00:53:13.789 --> 00:53:13.799 align:start position:0%
was this is not a unique story this
 
00:53:17.030 --> 00:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
happens to many of us as we get older
 
00:53:19.270 --> 00:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
I'm the same age as they
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
are uh and I worry about this we owe it
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
to our constituents to not make their
 
00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.069 align:start position:0%
to our constituents to not make their
lives

00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
lives
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily difficult so I encourage
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
you to support Senate Bill 302 to avoid
 
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing continuing to happen
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
thanks thank
 
00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:53.960 align:start position:0%
that uh hi madam chair for the record
 
00:53:56.109 --> 00:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hood uh vice president of
 
00:53:56.119 --> 00:53:57.190 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hood uh vice president of
government

00:53:57.190 --> 00:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
relations at Dartmouth Health my writing
 
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
was a little my writing was a little
 
00:54:02.829 --> 00:54:02.839 align:start position:0%
quick so you might not doctor we we
 
00:54:06.030 --> 00:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
understand that um no no no not a
 
00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
physician uh government relations just
 
00:54:12.789 --> 00:54:12.799 align:start position:0%
to be clear so uh I'll be very brief in
 
00:54:12.799 --> 00:54:14.069 align:start position:0%
to be clear so uh I'll be very brief in
my

00:54:14.069 --> 00:54:14.079 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
testimony as you've heard tellah Health
 
00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:19.640 align:start position:0%
served an incredible role during the
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic and there was tremendous
 
00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:24.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility across state lines um and
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
touth health as was noted
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
40% of the patient care that's provided
 
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:30.799 align:start position:0%
in the medical center in Lebanon is for
 
00:54:33.390 --> 00:54:33.400 align:start position:0%
Vermont residents after the pandemic and
 
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:36.720 align:start position:0%
those flexibilities went away um we went
 
00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
back to the the state that was discussed
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
uh which is you need to be the physician
 
00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
uh in the state where the physician is
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
resident or the physician needs to be
 
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
licensed in other states we certainly
 
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
support expanded capacities via teleah
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
Health we would love reciprocity I want
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
to go on record is saying that would be
 
00:54:58.950 --> 00:54:58.960 align:start position:0%
nice to have from the state of
 
00:55:01.750 --> 00:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh in Vermont what they
 
00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
have done is they are a compact state so
 
00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
a physician could be licensed in
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
multiple states that are part of the
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
compact they also have tiers if you're
 
00:55:13.069 --> 00:55:13.079 align:start position:0%
going to do tella Health under a certain
 
00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
number of cases you got a certain lure
 
00:55:17.430 --> 00:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
if you're going to do teleah Health on a
 
00:55:20.069 --> 00:55:20.079 align:start position:0%
larger scale you get a different license
 
00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:22.400 align:start position:0%
um or you could be fully licensed in
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
that state to treat all patients so I
 
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
just wanted to provide that information
 
00:55:29.069 --> 00:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
uh certainly support the expansion of
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
coverage but would obviously love it if
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
our neighbors to the South uh were
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
similarly inclined is Vermont a compact
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
state yes okay good and for your
 
00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
information during the pandemic we New
 
00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire issued tens of thousands of
 
00:55:51.309 --> 00:55:51.319 align:start position:0%
physician licenses Pro I think to
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
everybody in Massachusetts Vermont or
 
00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
main that asked so they were they were
 
00:55:59.950 --> 00:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
like Li but only for a temporary period
 
00:56:02.150 --> 00:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
and most of them have chosen not to
 
00:56:04.829 --> 00:56:04.839 align:start position:0%
renew their licenses in New Hampshire
 
00:56:07.109 --> 00:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
and those flexibilities were uh
 
00:56:09.029 --> 00:56:09.039 align:start position:0%
capitalized upon benefited on by
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth health and other New Hampshire
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
based providers in those States Vermont
 
00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Maine okay absolutely
 
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt and the
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
Manti thank you madam chair um so we're
 
00:56:24.069 --> 00:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
going to make our decision based on
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
what's right for New Hampshire of course
 
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
but can you tell us uh how this
 
00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:33.319 align:start position:0%
situation is being handled on a national
 
00:56:35.990 --> 00:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
basis because telea health is obviously
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
expanding all over the place for obvious
 
00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:41.640 align:start position:0%
reasons so what what is it like
 
00:56:43.510 --> 00:56:43.520 align:start position:0%
nationally well as this committee well
 
00:56:46.829 --> 00:56:46.839 align:start position:0%
knows lure is a state byst state uh
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
topic so the the federal government
 
00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
currently reimburses for teleah health
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
coverage um and those that coverage
 
00:56:56.670 --> 00:56:56.680 align:start position:0%
expansion or continuation of Tal covers
 
00:56:58.349 --> 00:56:58.359 align:start position:0%
will expire and will need to be renewed
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
at the end of this year is my
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
understanding um but I don't think while
 
00:57:05.549 --> 00:57:05.559 align:start position:0%
there's been discussions on the federal
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
level I'm not aware of any legislation
 
00:57:10.510 --> 00:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
that has traction that would resolve
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
lure issues between the
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
states and it's not just doctors follow
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
so I mean I I used to live in I was born
 
00:57:23.029 --> 00:57:23.039 align:start position:0%
and raised in Illinois and in Chicago as
 
00:57:25.710 --> 00:57:25.720 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact and it's very very
 
00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:26.950 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact and it's very very
close

00:57:26.950 --> 00:57:26.960 align:start position:0%
close
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
uh to the state of Wisconsin which has
 
00:57:33.069 --> 00:57:33.079 align:start position:0%
significant population in Racine and
 
00:57:36.270 --> 00:57:36.280 align:start position:0%
kosha just across the border uh Gary
 
00:57:40.430 --> 00:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
Indiana is Right close right next to to
 
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
Illinois to the South uh also lot of
 
00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:48.039 align:start position:0%
Representative your your question so the
 
00:57:51.910 --> 00:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
thing is this is a situation where very
 
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
analogous to what we have here where we
 
00:57:56.349 --> 00:57:56.359 align:start position:0%
have a tremendous linkage between New
 
00:57:58.150 --> 00:57:58.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh but where these
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
ridiculous situations that we've heard
 
00:58:06.630 --> 00:58:06.640 align:start position:0%
from the other Witnesses having to drive
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
across and sit in a parking lot trying
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
to get a connection with their doctor to
 
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
fulfill that imaginary line that
 
00:58:17.870 --> 00:58:17.880 align:start position:0%
separates New Hampshire from
 
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:24.670 --> 00:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
case yes I would believe so
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
representative manuti thank you Madame
 
00:58:29.789 --> 00:58:29.799 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
again I'll ask you about the reciprocity
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
you brought that up so our state of
 
00:58:40.390 --> 00:58:40.400 align:start position:0%
Vermont uh do doctors are treating
 
00:58:43.109 --> 00:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
patients across the border in Vermont
 
00:58:47.589 --> 00:58:47.599 align:start position:0%
correct or the patient yes so you are
 
00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
the research center up north just like
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
Mass uh Mass generalist for New
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire south I mean New Hampshire
 
00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:00.440 align:start position:0%
South so the compact it has to be both
 
00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
ways so what is our at Avenue for
 
00:59:09.150 --> 00:59:09.160 align:start position:0%
building that compact where is how would
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
this help with the compact for New
 
00:59:14.910 --> 00:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to join we have joined the
 
00:59:17.029 --> 00:59:17.039 align:start position:0%
compact for
 
00:59:20.069 --> 00:59:20.079 align:start position:0%
Physicians it's been quite in place for
 
00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
quite a while correct it's that
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has not um uh so how do we
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
encourage our neighbors to the South to
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
join the
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
compact good question I'm sorry I don't
 
00:59:36.150 --> 00:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that to answer your I
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
mean I actually thought during the
 
00:59:39.829 --> 00:59:39.839 align:start position:0%
pandemic when there was the tremendous
 
00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
amount of flexibilities granted
 
00:59:43.430 --> 00:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
collaboration between the states that
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
that might provide a window that we
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
would see post pandemic we haven't seen
 
00:59:49.309 --> 00:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
that so it is what it is Massachusetts
 
00:59:51.309 --> 00:59:51.319 align:start position:0%
does what it want and we don't have much
 
00:59:53.789 --> 00:59:53.799 align:start position:0%
control over it right just to But to
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
answer your initial question
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
a Dartmouth Health provider that's
 
00:59:59.390 --> 00:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
licensed in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:00:00.990 --> 01:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
can treat a Vermont patient who comes to
 
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:03.240 align:start position:0%
our Medical Center if that patient wants
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
to be treated in the state of Vermont
 
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
physically or be treated by their from
 
01:00:09.549 --> 01:00:09.559 align:start position:0%
their home via tella Health our provider
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
either needs to have a license in the
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
state of Vermont or um have dual lure uh
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
now that we're past the
 
01:00:23.029 --> 01:00:23.039 align:start position:0%
pandemic all right thank you other
 
01:00:24.829 --> 01:00:24.839 align:start position:0%

is there anyone else who wishes to
 
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:37.359 align:start position:0%
302 seeing n I'll close the public
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
hearing and open the public hearing on

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.029 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:58.039 align:start position:0%

um so you'll see a lot of the same
 
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
language changes that we've been looking
 
01:01:57.910 --> 01:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
at in general changing um things from
 
01:02:01.190 --> 01:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
the board to the office where applicable
 
01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
um there were a couple of more
 
01:02:05.710 --> 01:02:05.720 align:start position:0%
substantive changes uh that I'd like to
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to page two line
 
01:02:11.349 --> 01:02:11.359 align:start position:0%
21 um where it used to say the board may
 
01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.559 align:start position:0%
it now says the office shall wave the
 
01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
exemption requirement for any applicant
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
who has satisf satisfactorily passed all
 
01:02:19.109 --> 01:02:19.119 align:start position:0%
examinations and requirements to become
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
board certified by the American Board of
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
Medical Specialists or by the American
 
01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:26.839 align:start position:0%
osteopathic Association um talking with
 
01:02:29.069 --> 01:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
the director um we couldn't come up with
 
01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
a reason why um they shouldn't
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
automatically be Exempted or a case in
 
01:02:35.549 --> 01:02:35.559 align:start position:0%
which they would not be Exempted and we
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
didn't want to leave open the
 
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
possibility for favoritism to somehow
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
show up um unnecessarily um or for
 
01:02:44.349 --> 01:02:44.359 align:start position:0%
people to be treated differently
 
01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily um so they always have
 
01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:51.319 align:start position:0%
given the exemption we didn't see why um
 
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
that word shouldn't be changed to Shell
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
but the committee should be aware of it
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
um page three three line
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
25 um courtesy licenses are given for
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
100 days um and I know that uh there'll
 
01:03:07.109 --> 01:03:07.119 align:start position:0%
be a comment about this later uh but I
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that there was
 
01:03:10.150 --> 01:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
substantially similar licensing as is
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
typical in a reciprocity statutes in
 
01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:13.559 align:start position:0%
that uh even though they're only getting
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
a 100 day license that they should still
 
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
have substantially similar uh
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
qualifications to New Hampshire's
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements and then the
 
01:03:23.069 --> 01:03:23.079 align:start position:0%
other more substantive change is just
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
down a little bit further in lines 34
 
01:03:26.309 --> 01:03:26.319 align:start position:0%
and 35
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh instead of writing in the board on a
 
01:03:30.230 --> 01:03:30.240 align:start position:0%
biannual basis for renewal of license
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
we've changed it in accordance with RSA
 
01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
310a which deals with that but it's
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
already in statute so we're referring to
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
what's already in statute um but those
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
are the main changes other than
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
primarily language changes or if I
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
forget anything I'm sure the office will
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
be happy to point it out to you and I
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.829 --> 01:03:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.839 --> 01:04:02.150 align:start position:0%
 
all

01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:12.829 --> 01:04:12.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:17.230 --> 01:04:17.240 align:start position:0%

the amendment um our strong opposition
 
01:04:40.029 --> 01:04:40.039 align:start position:0%
to striking the underlying bill is why
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
we are here um because of the challenges
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
in what the implications of a change or
 
01:04:49.950 --> 01:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
or a lack of exception for
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
residency uh trainees would require so

where our residents have Vermont
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
training licenses and to be able to
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
provide tellah Health to the previous
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%

the various clinics in our state

medical center training there are also
 
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:40.520 align:start position:0%
residents in training at Portsmith in at

Kean our concerns with regards to this
 
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
lure change that has happened with
 
01:05:51.829 --> 01:05:51.839 align:start position:0%
regards to um moving from a four-year
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
renewal to a two-year renewal for all
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
licens types in the state of New
 
01:05:55.079 --> 01:05:56.309 align:start position:0%
licens types in the state of New
Hampshire

01:05:56.309 --> 01:05:56.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:05:58.510 --> 01:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
is that for residents and fellows who
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
are essentially apprentices in training
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
for a contracted period of time under
 
01:06:05.230 --> 01:06:05.240 align:start position:0%
which their specialty requires a certain
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
number of years of training from one to
 
01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
seven years this change moving from four
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
years for Renewal to a 2-year renewal
 
01:06:14.910 --> 01:06:14.920 align:start position:0%
means that we are having to um have
 
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:16.520 align:start position:0%
those residents go through a renewal
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
process two or three times during their
 
01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.789 align:start position:0%
process two or three times during their
residency

01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:20.799 align:start position:0%
residency
 
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
training at
 
01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
present the new changes that have
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
happened at the oplc require that the
 
01:06:29.829 --> 01:06:29.839 align:start position:0%
resident themselves create that app
 
01:06:32.630 --> 01:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
compl complete that application obtain
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
the appropriate uh documentation from
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
their program director ensuring that
 
01:06:37.309 --> 01:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
they are still within good standing
 
01:06:39.269 --> 01:06:39.279 align:start position:0%
within their training program as well as
 
01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:41.799 align:start position:0%
submit a $50 check which I've spoken
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
before about which they don't really
 
01:06:45.150 --> 01:06:45.160 align:start position:0%
know what checks are any longer to be
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
honest um or a cashier check um to
 
01:06:52.589 --> 01:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
submit that to the oplc to have a
 
01:06:56.589 --> 01:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
renewal of their training license
 
01:06:59.069 --> 01:06:59.079 align:start position:0%
what we are looking for at dhmc would be
 
01:07:01.990 --> 01:07:02.000 align:start position:0%
to allow our residents and fellows and
 
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
the residents and fellows at psmith
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
conquered and treasure Medical Center to
 
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
be able to have a renewal process that
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
isn't as onerous to the resident trainee
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
who works upwards of 80 hours a week in
 
01:07:16.109 --> 01:07:16.119 align:start position:0%
their specialty
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
training previously we've been able to
 
01:07:20.549 --> 01:07:20.559 align:start position:0%
work with the oplc or the board before
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
it to provide a
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
renewal notice for all residents and
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
fellows to have that change happen in an
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
automated administrative way the changes
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
that have been made at the state level
 
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
are going to require that the resident
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
or do require now but may be moving to
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
an electronic system in which the
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
resident themselves is responsible for
 
01:07:45.309 --> 01:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
creating or completing that
 
01:07:47.069 --> 01:07:47.079 align:start position:0%
documentation and getting it to the
 
01:07:49.390 --> 01:07:49.400 align:start position:0%
board um in the appropriate amount of
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
time as you can imagine these
 
01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
individuals are highly uh stressed how a
 
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
lot of responsibilities on their plate
 
01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
and our office as well as the offices at
 
01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
our other gme um members across the
 
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:04.160 align:start position:0%
state are in support of all of the
 
01:08:06.269 --> 01:08:06.279 align:start position:0%
requirements that they have to meet with
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
regards to Medicare and Medicaid to all
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
of their um New Hampshire drug
 
01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
monitoring to flu etc etc and so we
 
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
really want to be able to continue to
 
01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
support them in that work um and not
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
have it moved to them as being respons
 
01:08:22.910 --> 01:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
the responsible party to ensure that
 
01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
their license is in place the that is
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
the request that we are hoping that we
 
01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:30.440 align:start position:0%

01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
um oplc is certainly amenable to you
 
01:09:47.789 --> 01:09:47.799 align:start position:0%
know at times curving out exceptions we
 
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
understand that it's not always sure
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
that one sit fits all but I do want to
 
01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
be careful that uh that the
 
01:09:56.189 --> 01:09:56.199 align:start position:0%
justification for an amendment to our
 
01:10:00.350 --> 01:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
licensure time frames um is not based on
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
um you know a desire to uh essentially
 
01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
not have the lcy be obligated to to go
 
01:10:09.870 --> 01:10:09.880 align:start position:0%
through the process the a professional
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
who has a license is responsible for
 
01:10:14.270 --> 01:10:14.280 align:start position:0%
maintaining the continuing competence
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
and if that is the justification any
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
leny could make that same argument um
 
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
and we feel it's very important that the
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
leny understand their obligations at the
 
01:10:28.870 --> 01:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
out set we have um many different
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
license types with many different
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
education levels you know people in high
 
01:10:34.950 --> 01:10:34.960 align:start position:0%
school attending apprenticeship programs
 
01:10:37.590 --> 01:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
people who have doctorates and the
 
01:10:39.189 --> 01:10:39.199 align:start position:0%
message is the same which is that it's
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
your responsibility to maintain your
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
license so we're happy to work on
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
language that I think would be uh
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
amendable to all parties um but I think
 
01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
we uh we would be concerned if we're
 
01:10:53.550 --> 01:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
carving out an amendment for that
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
purpose be happy to are any questions
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
you may have thank you are there
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%

testify all right seeing none I will

01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
and land
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
appeals and the Senate decided
 
01:49:32.589 --> 01:49:32.599 align:start position:0%
to make it a fiveyear term as we
 
01:49:36.790 --> 01:49:36.800 align:start position:0%
discussed but didn't actually U make an
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
amendment to do so they also changed the
 
01:49:44.950 --> 01:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
removal process
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
by citing the correct RSA that controls
 
01:49:50.950 --> 01:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
the removal process rather than
 
01:49:54.149 --> 01:49:54.159 align:start position:0%
duplicating the language so I'm going to
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
recommend to concur unless somebody on
 
01:49:59.950 --> 01:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
the committee wants to change my mind
 
01:50:02.390 --> 01:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
but it sounds like this is perfectly
 
01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
harmless it's been known to happen I
 
01:50:08.589 --> 01:50:08.599 align:start position:0%
said don't anybody do this okay it's
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's a very reasonable
 
01:50:14.589 --> 01:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
change and we we shouldn't argue with
 
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
them about it we're going to have enough
 
01:50:18.950 --> 01:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
fun arguing about some of our other
 
01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
things all right so Senate Bill 30 two
 
01:50:31.109 --> 01:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:33.589 --> 01:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
motion now you are all here you should
 
01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%

01:50:41.750 --> 01:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
right representative Schmidt moved out
 
01:50:45.189 --> 01:50:45.199 align:start position:0%
to pass and representative Gould second

for the Alzheimer patients and less
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
disruption in their in their treatment

mass hospitals in order to get the care

comments represent
 
01:55:33.390 --> 01:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
Simon sure um so as written this bill
 
01:55:35.910 --> 01:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
does replace the underlying bill um and
 
01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
the committee should probably be aware
 
01:55:40.550 --> 01:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
of of that
 
01:55:44.709 --> 01:55:44.719 align:start position:0%
um it was uh it's a bit of a tricky Bill
 
01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
uh as far as testimony was concerned we
 
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
had testimony this morning that
 
01:55:50.390 --> 01:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
conflicted with previous testimony even
 
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:52.000 align:start position:0%
from the same organization that was
 
01:55:54.430 --> 01:55:54.440 align:start position:0%
giving the testimony so did some last
 
01:55:57.629 --> 01:55:57.639 align:start position:0%
minute juggling on that um the bill
 
01:55:59.910 --> 01:55:59.920 align:start position:0%
itself would um give an exemption to the
 
01:56:01.950 --> 01:56:01.960 align:start position:0%
2-year renewal process for lure for
 
01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:04.719 align:start position:0%
Resident Physicians uh Physicians who
 
01:56:06.910 --> 01:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
are in residency uh is probably clearer
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
way to put it um I have had another
 
01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
discussion with the director from oplc
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh the way that the renewal process is
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
going to be mo happen moving forward um
 
01:56:18.669 --> 01:56:18.679 align:start position:0%
addresses many of the concerns but maybe
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
not all the concerns that Dartmouth
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock had um
 
01:56:25.109 --> 01:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
but it's a one-page renewal form it will
 
01:56:26.910 --> 01:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
be a one-page renewal form it will be
 
01:56:29.310 --> 01:56:29.320 align:start position:0%
electronic um it will have to be filled
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
out by the resident physician uh simply
 
01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
because it will be attached to an
 
01:56:36.830 --> 01:56:36.840 align:start position:0%
account specifically for that individual
 
01:56:39.229 --> 01:56:39.239 align:start position:0%
um it should take less than 5 minutes
 
01:56:41.310 --> 01:56:41.320 align:start position:0%
for the resident physici to fill out and
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
there should be an electronic form of
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
payment attached to that website so that
 
01:56:46.750 --> 01:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
they don't have to worry about going out
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
and getting checks because as we've
 
01:56:49.229 --> 01:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
heard in testimony this morning they
 
01:56:52.229 --> 01:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
don't know what those are um which
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of Truth to that um that
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
should streamline that a little bit um I
 
01:57:01.030 --> 01:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
guess I still feel and I want to assure
 
01:57:02.629 --> 01:57:02.639 align:start position:0%
everybody I did look into it uh and have
 
01:57:04.510 --> 01:57:04.520 align:start position:0%
further conversation but I still do feel
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
that if we're going to give an exemption
 
01:57:10.069 --> 01:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
for lure uh it needs to be um a little
 
01:57:12.669 --> 01:57:12.679 align:start position:0%
bit different other than you know
 
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
everybody's busy uh and I do appreciate
 
01:57:17.310 --> 01:57:17.320 align:start position:0%
that I do appreciate that um but it is
 
01:57:19.750 --> 01:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
not an onerous process um it does
 
01:57:21.709 --> 01:57:21.719 align:start position:0%
require some responsibility I understand
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
that um but not such to the effect that
 
01:57:26.790 --> 01:57:26.800 align:start position:0%
I think that it rises to the level of
 
01:57:29.149 --> 01:57:29.159 align:start position:0%
exemption from the 2-year process so
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:36.069 --> 01:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
recommendation yes I'd like to add that
 
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
in in in um addition to what
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative Simon says the um
 
01:57:44.470 --> 01:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment brings these um parts of
 
01:57:48.589 --> 01:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
Statute in compliance with um RSA I mean
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
with the house bill 655 in that it does
 
01:57:53.189 --> 01:57:53.199 align:start position:0%
delineate the responsibilities between
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%

01:59:15.390 --> 01:59:15.400 align:start position:0%
24 1610 H to house bills

representative groda
 
01:59:27.550 --> 01:59:27.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes so in the last um one of the
 
01:59:30.669 --> 01:59:30.679 align:start position:0%
tasks that the subcommittee had was to
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
compare Senate Bill 485 with House Bill
 
01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:36.750 align:start position:0%
compare Senate Bill 485 with House Bill
10

01:59:36.750 --> 01:59:36.760 align:start position:0%
10
 
01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:39.560 align:start position:0%
9585 that we passed through this
 
01:59:41.470 --> 01:59:41.480 align:start position:0%
committee and when we did that there
 
01:59:43.350 --> 01:59:43.360 align:start position:0%
were two sections that were left over
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
the digital um recognizable license and
 
01:59:50.189 --> 01:59:50.199 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
01:59:53.109 --> 01:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
um military occup ational Specialties
 
01:59:55.950 --> 01:59:55.960 align:start position:0%
could be included in this for boards
 
01:59:58.270 --> 01:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
that are not required under o that are
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
not under
 
02:00:02.589 --> 02:00:02.599 align:start position:0%
oplc and at the last right before the
 
02:00:04.270 --> 02:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
last executive session where we were
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
going to entertain that Amendment we
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
found out from both Department of
 
02:00:13.069 --> 02:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
informational technology and oplc that
 
02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
digital verif digitally verifiable
 
02:00:20.109 --> 02:00:20.119 align:start position:0%
licenses are not something that we can
 
02:00:23.790 --> 02:00:23.800 align:start position:0%
quickly Implement with out
 
02:00:26.390 --> 02:00:26.400 align:start position:0%
technology um
 
02:00:29.790 --> 02:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
Investments so the committee and I
 
02:00:32.950 --> 02:00:32.960 align:start position:0%
decided that we would take that part of
 
02:00:36.149 --> 02:00:36.159 align:start position:0%
the amendment out so really what's left
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
is what's in front of you which is
 
02:00:41.229 --> 02:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
something that can be that doesn't
 
02:00:43.229 --> 02:00:43.239 align:start position:0%
conflict with the bill that we passed in
 
02:00:46.350 --> 02:00:46.360 align:start position:0%
committee and actually adds to the
 
02:00:48.910 --> 02:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
licensing for
 
02:00:51.990 --> 02:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
veterans who have who fall under
 
02:00:57.550 --> 02:00:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:59.589 --> 02:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
oplc representative
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
Brown um I I would uh thank you madam
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
chair I would just add this brings a
 
02:01:07.589 --> 02:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
full circle the conversation we had to
 
02:01:09.030 --> 02:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
make sure
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
that those boards that aren't under
 
02:01:14.709 --> 02:01:14.719 align:start position:0%
oplc will be required to complete their
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
rulem process for a crosswalk for
 
02:01:19.950 --> 02:01:19.960 align:start position:0%
veterans and as if you remember we
 
02:01:22.149 --> 02:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
decided not to do that in 1385 because
 
02:01:26.069 --> 02:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:29.870 --> 02:01:29.880 align:start position:0%
late yeah represent Mani thank you
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
Madame chair and you know if I recollect
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
the discussion it just uh highlighted
 
02:01:41.069 --> 02:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
the weaknesses or deficiencies in our
 
02:01:43.350 --> 02:01:43.360 align:start position:0%
systems which is the basic
 
02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
infrastructure of um
 
02:01:50.510 --> 02:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
um uh software Hardware digital
 
02:01:52.350 --> 02:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
technology that's
 
02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
um currently available and as a state we
 
02:02:02.069 --> 02:02:02.079 align:start position:0%
are not there so this would if we had
 
02:02:05.390 --> 02:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
followed what the amendment immed uh the
 
02:02:10.189 --> 02:02:10.199 align:start position:0%
bill uh suggested we would not be the
 
02:02:12.910 --> 02:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
oplc and the Departments could not I
 
02:02:16.069 --> 02:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
mean boards could not comply with it so
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
that having said that I would say you
 
02:02:21.310 --> 02:02:21.320 align:start position:0%
know not take your eyes off or your foot
 
02:02:23.390 --> 02:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
bedal off of the infrastructure
 
02:02:25.910 --> 02:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
underlying infrastructure that's needed
 
02:02:30.069 --> 02:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
for 21st century so we can be compliant
 
02:02:33.910 --> 02:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
and join the rest of the world thank you
 
02:02:36.589 --> 02:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
thank you I think in in this case if we
 
02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
were to do it immediately we'd be ahead
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
of the rest of the world which is one of
 
02:02:44.510 --> 02:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we don't want to jump in
 
02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:45.510 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we don't want to jump in
on

02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%

motion thank you madam chair this bill
 
02:05:46.830 --> 02:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
primarily cleans up some language
 
02:05:52.589 --> 02:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
around two areas one is um remembering
 
02:05:55.549 --> 02:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
and not opening my laptop here uh one of
 
02:05:57.910 --> 02:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
them has to do with continuing
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
education uh that was just a change in
 
02:06:03.549 --> 02:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
procedure that had happened and so it's
 
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
important we get something in statute to
 
02:06:09.790 --> 02:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
allow OPC to follow up with physician
 
02:06:11.470 --> 02:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
assistants who choose not to continue
 
02:06:13.310 --> 02:06:13.320 align:start position:0%
some national
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
certification and there's a second part
 
02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:16.750 align:start position:0%
certification and there's a second part
to

02:06:16.750 --> 02:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
it that I would have to look up I'll
 
02:06:20.910 --> 02:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
look that up representative leus might
 
02:06:22.270 --> 02:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
be able to help
 
02:06:25.669 --> 02:06:25.679 align:start position:0%
thank you um right um I agree on the on
 
02:06:27.589 --> 02:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
the first part uh the issue is to get
 
02:06:29.709 --> 02:06:29.719 align:start position:0%
the initial licensing the Physicians
 
02:06:32.229 --> 02:06:32.239 align:start position:0%
assistants need to have uh some national
 
02:06:34.350 --> 02:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
certification they're not required to
 
02:06:37.030 --> 02:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
maintain it that certification defines
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
containing medical education
 
02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
requirements but if they choose not to
 
02:06:43.030 --> 02:06:43.040 align:start position:0%
maintain the certification they have to
 
02:06:45.310 --> 02:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
be defined somewhere and this uh has the
 
02:06:48.310 --> 02:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
board toine them uh the second part is
 
02:06:51.069 --> 02:06:51.079 align:start position:0%
that under the barbaran cosmetolog and
 
02:06:51.079 --> 02:06:52.470 align:start position:0%
that under the barbaran cosmetolog and
aesthetic

02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
aesthetic
 
02:06:54.830 --> 02:06:54.840 align:start position:0%
uh Physicians assistants that were not
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
they should have been but they were not
 
02:06:58.750 --> 02:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
included in the exemption um to if it's
 
02:07:00.350 --> 02:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
part of the medical procedure then cut
 
02:07:02.510 --> 02:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
hair so if you fall down and split your
 
02:07:04.750 --> 02:07:04.760 align:start position:0%
scalp open they're actually not breaking
 
02:07:06.430 --> 02:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
the law if they trim the hair around it
 
02:07:10.030 --> 02:07:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:14.549 --> 02:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
it the The Barbers and cosmetologists
 
02:07:17.069 --> 02:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
got and have a very broad scope of
 
02:07:19.910 --> 02:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
practice and they're V Vigilant in
 
02:07:22.149 --> 02:07:22.159 align:start position:0%
enforcing it
 
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
so okay any represent
 
02:07:28.189 --> 02:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
Manti I I don't know if I should say
 
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
that but at least it'll be a very
 
02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
expensive Barber or haircut if you're
 
02:07:34.350 --> 02:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
going to a surgeon or a physician
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
assistant yeah well that's only only
 
02:07:40.510 --> 02:07:40.520 align:start position:0%
when necessary I'm sure represent laus
 
02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
yeah and even then they're only
 
02:07:44.109 --> 02:07:44.119 align:start position:0%
permitted to do it if it's part of a
 
02:07:46.589 --> 02:07:46.599 align:start position:0%
medical procedure so you could still not
 
02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
go to them to have your haircut if
 
02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:52.480 align:start position:0%
that's all you were having done
 
02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:53.870 align:start position:0%
that's all you were having done
uh

02:07:53.870 --> 02:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:58.030 --> 02:07:58.040 align:start position:0%
yeah the uh the other thing is that this
 
02:07:59.990 --> 02:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
allows the board to define the
 
02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
continuing education requirements for
 
02:08:06.030 --> 02:08:06.040 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistance as many of the
 
02:08:10.229 --> 02:08:10.239 align:start position:0%
other boards do and it needs to be in
 
02:08:11.790 --> 02:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
they need to have the authority to do
 
02:08:13.069 --> 02:08:13.079 align:start position:0%
that because it's
 
02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
important anyone else
 
02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:18.390 align:start position:0%
important anyone else

02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:45.350 --> 02:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
um we should speak to your motion yes so
 
02:09:46.709 --> 02:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill
 
02:09:49.149 --> 02:09:49.159 align:start position:0%
600 for the uh amendment to have any
 
02:09:53.229 --> 02:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
meaning we uh mention that uh
 
02:09:55.229 --> 02:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
recently I guess in the last couple
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
years or so um there was I mean there
 
02:10:00.990 --> 02:10:01.000 align:start position:0%
was regist or registration or
 
02:10:03.510 --> 02:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
certification of pharmacy technicians
 
02:10:05.950 --> 02:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
and there was um the ability for them to
 
02:10:08.589 --> 02:10:08.599 align:start position:0%
be licensed was added and that's you
 
02:10:11.390 --> 02:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
know additional training and
 
02:10:13.589 --> 02:10:13.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility so I guess it was thought
 
02:10:16.030 --> 02:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
that um if they're going to be uh
 
02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
controlled by the Board of Pharmacy
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
there should be a pharmacy technician on
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
the board um so the underline board does
 
02:10:24.109 --> 02:10:24.119 align:start position:0%
that and I can talk to that when we get
 
02:10:27.549 --> 02:10:27.559 align:start position:0%
to the um to the bill itself um in the
 
02:10:31.109 --> 02:10:31.119 align:start position:0%
original Bill there was an error um that
 
02:10:32.669 --> 02:10:32.679 align:start position:0%
where it mentions who can be on the
 
02:10:35.270 --> 02:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
board it only listed Certified Pharmacy
 
02:10:37.390 --> 02:10:37.400 align:start position:0%
texts and it left out the licensed ones
 
02:10:37.400 --> 02:10:38.109 align:start position:0%
texts and it left out the licensed ones
which

02:10:38.109 --> 02:10:38.119 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
are uh so this uh Amendment fixes that
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
um the other thing is that the prime
 
02:10:46.709 --> 02:10:46.719 align:start position:0%
sponsor ask that we move the effective
 
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
date to January 1st of 2025 for two
 
02:10:51.950 --> 02:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
reasons which the amendment does that
 
02:10:55.470 --> 02:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
uh one is that um given the current
 
02:10:57.149 --> 02:10:57.159 align:start position:0%
membership of the board and when people
 
02:10:58.629 --> 02:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
are you know their terms are going to
 
02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
expire it kind of just lines up better
 
02:11:03.270 --> 02:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh but the other reason is that because
 
02:11:05.669 --> 02:11:05.679 align:start position:0%
uh licensing to pharmacy technicians is
 
02:11:08.149 --> 02:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
quite recent there are very few of them
 
02:11:10.189 --> 02:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
currently um there's others going
 
02:11:13.069 --> 02:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
through the process and so uh this would
 
02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
provide time for there to be more
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
licensed pharmacy technicians who could
 
02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
possibly serve on the board um and that
 
02:11:22.270 --> 02:11:22.280 align:start position:0%
that's what you mment does
 
02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:23.950 align:start position:0%
that's what you mment does
representative

02:12:29.310 --> 02:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
Amendment second second all right second
 
02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
by representative goul slightly ahead of
 
02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:34.430 align:start position:0%

Representative

02:12:34.430 --> 02:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:37.109 --> 02:12:37.119 align:start position:0%
broa representative
 
02:12:40.669 --> 02:12:40.679 align:start position:0%
lais okay in addition to what I said uh
 
02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
before this bill um as I said adds uh
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
one Pharmacy uh technician to the board
 
02:12:50.189 --> 02:12:50.199 align:start position:0%
it also adds an additional pharmacist uh
 
02:12:51.709 --> 02:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
because it's a good idea keep the number
 
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
of people on board on the board's odd to
 
02:12:54.000 --> 02:12:55.030 align:start position:0%
of people on board on the board's odd to
avoid

02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
avoid
 
02:12:58.709 --> 02:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
ties and um in addition to the what I
 
02:13:01.390 --> 02:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned before on the effective date
 
02:13:05.790 --> 02:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's really all it does okay
 
02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:06.830 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's really all it does okay
representative

02:13:06.830 --> 02:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:13:10.270 --> 02:13:10.280 align:start position:0%
gold nothing further to say okay I'd
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
like to mention that we would like to
 
02:13:14.990 --> 02:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
pass this bill because apparently the
 
02:13:17.310 --> 02:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
dep Department of Justice doesn't know
 
02:13:20.430 --> 02:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
how many me members are on the board and
 
02:13:22.430 --> 02:13:22.440 align:start position:0%
so this will CL clarify
 
02:13:25.790 --> 02:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
it we're just so helpful all right the
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
motion is ought to pass with Amendment
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%

I will like to introduce our substitute
 
02:14:24.910 --> 02:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
members and I apologize for not doing it
 
02:14:28.069 --> 02:14:28.079 align:start position:0%
sooner representative Malloy is in for
 
02:14:30.430 --> 02:14:30.440 align:start position:0%

representative
 
02:14:39.750 --> 02:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
Gard all right and on Senate Bill
 
02:14:43.629 --> 02:14:43.639 align:start position:0%
373 I'm going to move ought to
 
02:14:47.669 --> 02:14:47.679 align:start position:0%
pass is there a second a
 
02:14:51.149 --> 02:14:51.159 align:start position:0%
second okay
 
02:14:51.159 --> 02:14:54.950 align:start position:0%
second okay
right

02:14:54.950 --> 02:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
and this uh Bill changes the air leakage
 
02:15:02.510 --> 02:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
requirements from and requires the
 
02:15:05.350 --> 02:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
building code review board to make an
 
02:15:05.360 --> 02:15:06.790 align:start position:0%
building code review board to make an
amendment

02:15:06.790 --> 02:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:15:11.790 --> 02:15:11.800 align:start position:0%
to increase the number of air the
 
02:15:15.310 --> 02:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
minimum number of air changes from 3 to
 
02:15:17.709 --> 02:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
five it used to be
 
02:15:21.149 --> 02:15:21.159 align:start position:0%
seven U there are some issues with going
 
02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
it as tight as three
 
02:15:28.830 --> 02:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
and the latest version of the energy
 
02:15:33.030 --> 02:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
code has five as the minimum required so
 
02:15:36.350 --> 02:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
it is there is some science behind the
 
02:15:39.069 --> 02:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
number and there are some issues with
 
02:15:42.189 --> 02:15:42.199 align:start position:0%
overly tight homes uh
 
02:15:45.149 --> 02:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
mold U outgassing of
 
02:15:48.549 --> 02:15:48.559 align:start position:0%
materials that have caused a number of
 
02:15:51.310 --> 02:15:51.320 align:start position:0%
organizations such as the CDC to
 
02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
recommend against building homes that
 
02:15:57.589 --> 02:15:57.599 align:start position:0%
tight and I suspect a lot of that is due
 
02:16:00.149 --> 02:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
to people that don't realize they've got
 
02:16:02.589 --> 02:16:02.599 align:start position:0%
to keep their ventilation running or
 
02:16:05.109 --> 02:16:05.119 align:start position:0%
don't don't run their ventilation
 
02:16:07.030 --> 02:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
properly because they're used to opening
 
02:16:08.709 --> 02:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
the windows when they want fresh air and
 
02:16:11.709 --> 02:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
letting the house leak so it's
 
02:16:15.669 --> 02:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
a it's a change and I'm convinced the
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
building code review board did not
 
02:16:20.629 --> 02:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
consider this as thoroughly as they
 
02:16:22.629 --> 02:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
might because it was all wrapped up in
 
02:16:25.549 --> 02:16:25.559 align:start position:0%
the debate on the energy code they
 
02:16:28.030 --> 02:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't want to pick one piece of
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
the energy
 
02:16:33.309 --> 02:16:33.319 align:start position:0%
code so that's why I'm in favor of it
 
02:16:34.910 --> 02:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
representative Brown do you wish to
 
02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
comment uh thank you madam chair I would
 
02:16:40.910 --> 02:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
add there was a very reasonable
 
02:16:42.990 --> 02:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
discussion about the extra cost that
 
02:16:45.389 --> 02:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
this puts into building a home and the
 
02:16:48.750 --> 02:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
extra cost into the testing of the uh
 
02:16:50.549 --> 02:16:50.559 align:start position:0%
the amount of air exchanges if you don't
 
02:16:52.429 --> 02:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
pass you have to test again and I forget
 
02:16:55.230 --> 02:16:55.240 align:start position:0%
what that cost per test was but it was
 
02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
had a thousand after it so that's a a
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
part of I think a major piece of the
 
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
concern for the the builders was the
 
02:17:06.030 --> 02:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
cost of these uh going to staying at
 
02:17:07.309 --> 02:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
three thank
 
02:17:11.910 --> 02:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
you okay okay anyone else representative
 
02:17:15.669 --> 02:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair I will not
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
be supporting this um just for a reason
 
02:17:22.469 --> 02:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
of matter of principal as to how the
 
02:17:24.990 --> 02:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
process works we put into process how
 
02:17:26.910 --> 02:17:26.920 align:start position:0%
amendments are drafted for the building
 
02:17:29.790 --> 02:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
code review board
 
02:17:32.549 --> 02:17:32.559 align:start position:0%
um while it didn't pass the first time
 
02:17:34.790 --> 02:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
around we heard discussion amongst those
 
02:17:36.910 --> 02:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
members that were here who had testified
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
that they would be willing to work with
 
02:17:40.469 --> 02:17:40.479 align:start position:0%
the individuals to get this through in
 
02:17:43.349 --> 02:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
the proper procedures and done and I
 
02:17:45.750 --> 02:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
would hope that we would at least intrum
 
02:17:47.349 --> 02:17:47.359 align:start position:0%
study this and let it go through the
 
02:17:49.270 --> 02:17:49.280 align:start position:0%
proper procedure to be brought forward
 
02:17:51.469 --> 02:17:51.479 align:start position:0%
to this committee um the way every
 
02:17:55.349 --> 02:17:55.359 align:start position:0%
amendment is done um and the way we all
 
02:17:58.389 --> 02:17:58.399 align:start position:0%
agreed that the process should proceed
 
02:18:00.750 --> 02:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
um and I think if we inm studied this we
 
02:18:02.830 --> 02:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
can force the hand that they get back to
 
02:18:04.950 --> 02:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
the table do the right thing and not
 
02:18:07.270 --> 02:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
bring a piece of legislation forward on
 
02:18:08.790 --> 02:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
behalf of a group that didn't get what
 
02:18:11.270 --> 02:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
they wanted the first time around um for
 
02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
that reason I will not support the aop
 
02:18:14.629 --> 02:18:14.639 align:start position:0%
pass and I would hope we could intrm
 
02:18:16.549 --> 02:18:16.559 align:start position:0%
study this let them do the proper
 
02:18:19.190 --> 02:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
procedure and come back if it isn't done
 
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
I am more than willing to go forward
 
02:18:22.790 --> 02:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
with this because I was one that stood
 
02:18:25.870 --> 02:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
out and said that buildings were being
 
02:18:27.709 --> 02:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
made too tight and I agree with them but
 
02:18:29.270 --> 02:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
I just as a matter of principle that
 
02:18:30.429 --> 02:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
they should follow the appropriate
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
procedures thank you thank you
 
02:18:32.800 --> 02:18:34.469 align:start position:0%
procedures thank you thank you
representative

02:18:34.469 --> 02:18:34.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:18:36.469 --> 02:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair just because
 
02:18:38.469 --> 02:18:38.479 align:start position:0%
I can't help but debate with
 
02:18:40.669 --> 02:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
representative goolia it's too much fun
 
02:18:43.030 --> 02:18:43.040 align:start position:0%
um my argument is that this is the
 
02:18:45.429 --> 02:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
procedure um this is the this is the
 
02:18:47.709 --> 02:18:47.719 align:start position:0%
procedure uh it was decided at one point
 
02:18:49.389 --> 02:18:49.399 align:start position:0%
that the building code was just too
 
02:18:51.150 --> 02:18:51.160 align:start position:0%
expansive for this particular committee
 
02:18:53.190 --> 02:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
and the senate committee to look at uh
 
02:18:55.709 --> 02:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
in its entirety and so we have given
 
02:18:57.469 --> 02:18:57.479 align:start position:0%
power to uh the building code review
 
02:19:00.429 --> 02:19:00.439 align:start position:0%
board to um look over the code and make
 
02:19:02.509 --> 02:19:02.519 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh to the committee as to
 
02:19:05.309 --> 02:19:05.319 align:start position:0%
what ought to pass um but ultimately
 
02:19:08.589 --> 02:19:08.599 align:start position:0%
always um it is our job to ratify that
 
02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
code ultimately always it is our
 
02:19:12.750 --> 02:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility um to determine what goes
 
02:19:14.629 --> 02:19:14.639 align:start position:0%
into statute and all code does go into
 
02:19:16.030 --> 02:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
statute that's what we do when it comes
 
02:19:18.750 --> 02:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
before us every single time um this
 
02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
particular piece of the code
 
02:19:22.549 --> 02:19:22.559 align:start position:0%
was heavily debated on the in the
 
02:19:23.750 --> 02:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
building code review board most of the
 
02:19:25.389 --> 02:19:25.399 align:start position:0%
time when we get the code it's uh
 
02:19:28.349 --> 02:19:28.359 align:start position:0%
unanimous so it's it's easy um to just
 
02:19:30.709 --> 02:19:30.719 align:start position:0%
ratify those things this was not uh it
 
02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:32.240 align:start position:0%
was heavily debated they couldn't come
 
02:19:34.589 --> 02:19:34.599 align:start position:0%
to an agreement on it and so somebody's
 
02:19:36.990 --> 02:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
B us a piece of that um for our
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
consideration and as I said to uh Mr
 
02:19:40.589 --> 02:19:40.599 align:start position:0%
Sherman who's the head of the building
 
02:19:42.469 --> 02:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
code review board although it would be
 
02:19:43.870 --> 02:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
very difficult for this committee to
 
02:19:45.990 --> 02:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
wrap its head around every piece of code
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
and and do that well we can certainly
 
02:19:50.190 --> 02:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
wrap our head around a piece of code uh
 
02:19:51.950 --> 02:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
and the lications of it and make a
 
02:19:53.590 --> 02:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
decision they're still doing their job I
 
02:19:55.910 --> 02:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
feel like we're still doing our job in
 
02:19:58.309 --> 02:19:58.319 align:start position:0%
that process um and I just don't want to
 
02:20:01.270 --> 02:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
see us abdicate that or and I don't
 
02:20:02.070 --> 02:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
think this is actually what
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
representative goalie was saying so I
 
02:20:04.429 --> 02:20:04.439 align:start position:0%
don't want to put words into his mouth I
 
02:20:05.349 --> 02:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
just don't want to become a rubber
 
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
stamping agent for the building code
 
02:20:10.070 --> 02:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
review board um where we agree with what
 
02:20:11.270 --> 02:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
they agree with and disagree with what
 
02:20:13.550 --> 02:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
they disagree with uh and I'll close by
 
02:20:15.830 --> 02:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
basically saying if in the presentation
 
02:20:17.070 --> 02:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
of the building code review board to
 
02:20:18.469 --> 02:20:18.479 align:start position:0%
this committee we disagreed with
 
02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
something that they had done this is
 
02:20:22.030 --> 02:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
exactly the process that we would take
 
02:20:24.389 --> 02:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
to remedy that um we would make an
 
02:20:26.710 --> 02:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
amendment we would bring it back to
 
02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
committee we would discuss it we would
 
02:20:32.070 --> 02:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
pass it um because ultimately the um the
 
02:20:34.870 --> 02:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
process leads through the legislature so
 
02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
much and I will mention that the
 
02:20:44.349 --> 02:20:44.359 align:start position:0%
legislature has made specific technical
 
02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
changes to the State Building Code
 
02:20:51.150 --> 02:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
repeatedly um the last one I I remember
 
02:20:52.670 --> 02:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
was the ark
 
02:20:57.510 --> 02:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
fault U outlets in the electrical code
 
02:20:59.750 --> 02:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
we said they don't work for you you can
 
02:20:59.760 --> 02:21:00.750 align:start position:0%
we said they don't work for you you can
replace

02:21:00.750 --> 02:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
replace
 
02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
them uh 15 years ago we said we will not
 
02:21:06.590 --> 02:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
mandate Sprinklers and we will not let
 
02:21:09.030 --> 02:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
towns mandate sprinklers in single
 
02:21:12.870 --> 02:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
family homes because after consideration
 
02:21:15.150 --> 02:21:15.160 align:start position:0%
we decided the cost and benefits didn't
 
02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:16.510 align:start position:0%
we decided the cost and benefits didn't
balance

02:21:16.510 --> 02:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
balance
 
02:21:19.870 --> 02:21:19.880 align:start position:0%
properly uh and there have been been
 
02:21:23.190 --> 02:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
other cases but those two are are U are
 
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
firm it is our job not as representative
 
02:21:28.790 --> 02:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
Simon said not just to agree with what
 
02:21:31.270 --> 02:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
the building code review board does but
 
02:21:33.389 --> 02:21:33.399 align:start position:0%
to think about it and if
 
02:21:36.429 --> 02:21:36.439 align:start position:0%
they left a piece out or didn't make an
 
02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
amendment we we uh legislation is the
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
way to change
 
02:21:45.150 --> 02:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
it but anyway anyone
 
02:21:51.790 --> 02:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:54.670 --> 02:21:54.680 align:start position:0%
oh representative G has a
 
02:21:57.630 --> 02:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
comment Madam chair I
 
02:22:00.110 --> 02:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
wondered regarding the bill I support
 
02:22:01.590 --> 02:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
this more ventilation I don't like
 
02:22:05.590 --> 02:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
airtight houses I also though have um
 
02:22:09.710 --> 02:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
proposal to add um I'm not sure if it's
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
called an amendment or an addition to
 
02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
this bill it would be an amendment an
 
02:22:17.389 --> 02:22:17.399 align:start position:0%
amendment to take the language from
 
02:22:19.030 --> 02:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:22:22.230 --> 02:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
1252 which this um committee and the
 
02:22:24.830 --> 02:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
Full House passed but it failed in the
 
02:22:27.950 --> 02:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
Senate and added to this bill okay and
 
02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
1252 is that is to form a study
 
02:22:37.150 --> 02:22:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:40.349 --> 02:22:40.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no no my motion was off to
 
02:22:46.830 --> 02:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:50.270 --> 02:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
it is there a second to representative
 
02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:55.670 align:start position:0%
it is there a second to representative
who

02:22:55.670 --> 02:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:00.990 --> 02:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:03.790 --> 02:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
right I'm so sorry could I have a
 
02:23:07.990 --> 02:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
clarification the it's not to replace no
 
02:23:09.790 --> 02:23:09.800 align:start position:0%
this is just okay okay thank you then I
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
do second I have the the speaker and the
 
02:23:14.990 --> 02:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
clerk have
 
02:23:18.710 --> 02:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
issued uh ground rules for silly silly
 
02:23:23.309 --> 02:23:23.319 align:start position:0%
season amendments since this bill passed
 
02:23:27.710 --> 02:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
this committee we can attach it to any
 
02:23:31.429 --> 02:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
other bill in our committee if it were
 
02:23:33.790 --> 02:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
to be a floor Amendment it could be
 
02:23:36.830 --> 02:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
attached to anything at all because it's
 
02:23:40.349 --> 02:23:40.359 align:start position:0%
past the house it's re it's it is
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
Germain but any other committee can't
 
02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
pick it up it would have to be on the
 
02:23:48.630 --> 02:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
floor and I could add that this bill
 
02:23:51.190 --> 02:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
also passed the house correct that's why
 
02:23:53.910 --> 02:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's Germain okay all right thank you
 
02:23:55.670 --> 02:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
yes it has passed the house therefore
 
02:23:57.150 --> 02:23:57.160 align:start position:0%
it's Germaine to
 
02:23:59.830 --> 02:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
anything we can do it in our
 
02:24:02.590 --> 02:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
committee um it could be done as a floor
 
02:24:04.070 --> 02:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment either
 
02:24:07.710 --> 02:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
way all right representative
 
02:24:10.950 --> 02:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
Schmidt so I will not be supporting this
 
02:24:15.349 --> 02:24:15.359 align:start position:0%
motion uh and the reason is that we
 
02:24:18.790 --> 02:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
overlooked a very important fact uh when
 
02:24:21.309 --> 02:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
we heard this bill
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
okay not really right and that was that
 
02:24:27.590 --> 02:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
there were 40
 
02:24:30.510 --> 02:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
people watching
 
02:24:35.429 --> 02:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
online 40 people and uh we did not and
 
02:24:38.349 --> 02:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
we we should when the chair acknowledged
 
02:24:40.990 --> 02:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
this subsequent in discussion that we
 
02:24:44.710 --> 02:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
should pay attention to what the uh not
 
02:24:47.510 --> 02:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
everybody's going to come to conquer
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh but of the 40 people who are
 
02:24:55.349 --> 02:24:55.359 align:start position:0%
watching the vote was 38 nay and two yay
 
02:24:55.359 --> 02:24:57.349 align:start position:0%
watching the vote was 38 nay and two yay
on

02:24:57.349 --> 02:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:25:00.830 --> 02:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
this and the people who were watching
 
02:25:02.950 --> 02:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
were a number of people who were
 
02:25:05.590 --> 02:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
indigenous people members of the uh
 
02:25:08.590 --> 02:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
Native American uh commission and so
 
02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
forth uh and we we were totally blly
 
02:25:15.070 --> 02:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
unaware of that because we did not pay
 
02:25:17.429 --> 02:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
any attention to it and we need to start
 
02:25:19.110 --> 02:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
doing that this is an our our
 
02:25:21.389 --> 02:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to to reflect what the
 
02:25:24.630 --> 02:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
people who paid attention to this bill
 
02:25:29.590 --> 02:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
and voted if you will online said 38 n
 
02:25:34.670 --> 02:25:34.680 align:start position:0%
to Y so uh and representative Maguire
 
02:25:36.790 --> 02:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
and I were two of the people in
 
02:25:40.389 --> 02:25:40.399 align:start position:0%
committee who voted no on
 
02:25:44.750 --> 02:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
1252 so we made a mistake by not being
 
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%
in fully informed and this is our
 
02:25:49.830 --> 02:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity not to make the same mistake
 
02:25:49.840 --> 02:25:52.030 align:start position:0%
opportunity not to make the same mistake
again

02:25:52.030 --> 02:25:52.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
02:25:55.389 --> 02:25:55.399 align:start position:0%
Madame chair may I
 
02:25:58.429 --> 02:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
speak yes Madam representative G I'm
 
02:26:00.469 --> 02:26:00.479 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't ask you to speak to your
 
02:26:03.190 --> 02:26:03.200 align:start position:0%
your Mo your motion thank you madam
 
02:26:07.510 --> 02:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
chair uh yes this bill was something
 
02:26:11.670 --> 02:26:11.680 align:start position:0%
that um was recommended after last year
 
02:26:16.670 --> 02:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
a bill that uh that I put in for um for
 
02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
recognition of Native Americans and this
 
02:26:21.230 --> 02:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
committee heard the bill they heard the
 
02:26:23.710 --> 02:26:23.720 align:start position:0%
testimony they were aware of some
 
02:26:25.990 --> 02:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
opposition and considered all the
 
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
factors and it passed um I believe it
 
02:26:33.830 --> 02:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
was 18-2 it went to the floor and it
 
02:26:37.150 --> 02:26:37.160 align:start position:0%
passed almost unanimously on voice there
 
02:26:42.429 --> 02:26:42.439 align:start position:0%
were maybe four or five Nays so um I
 
02:26:44.110 --> 02:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
think it's something that is very
 
02:26:46.830 --> 02:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
important as I've said in the past the
 
02:26:49.710 --> 02:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
experience is that we have no study
 
02:26:52.429 --> 02:26:52.439 align:start position:0%
committee ever on record for Native
 
02:26:55.550 --> 02:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
Americans and while we can just go ahead
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
informally like we did after last year
 
02:27:03.790 --> 02:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
to form this bill um it leaves no record
 
02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
for the future for people to go back and
 
02:27:07.830 --> 02:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
look at what was the study committee's
 
02:27:10.389 --> 02:27:10.399 align:start position:0%
recommendations so I would like I would
 
02:27:13.870 --> 02:27:13.880 align:start position:0%
hope to have people's support thank
 
02:27:17.230 --> 02:27:17.240 align:start position:0%
you represent Bara you wish to speak to
 
02:27:18.510 --> 02:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
it I
 
02:27:20.670 --> 02:27:20.680 align:start position:0%
do I'd like to
 
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
correct my friend from
 
02:27:26.150 --> 02:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
do because during the Committee hearing
 
02:27:27.870 --> 02:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
and during the
 
02:27:32.030 --> 02:27:32.040 align:start position:0%
executive session he mentioned this 38-2
 
02:27:37.510 --> 02:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
Vote many times and I for one did not
 
02:27:40.070 --> 02:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
make a mistake when I supported this
 
02:27:42.790 --> 02:27:42.800 align:start position:0%
bill in the first time and the reason
 
02:27:46.030 --> 02:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
why and I was very explicit about this
 
02:27:50.230 --> 02:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
that it was my intention to pass both
 
02:27:51.790 --> 02:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
the bill that had to do with the
 
02:27:54.950 --> 02:27:54.960 align:start position:0%
commission and this study committee
 
02:27:58.349 --> 02:27:58.359 align:start position:0%
because I was not going to take sides on
 
02:28:02.590 --> 02:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
who was what when
 
02:28:04.870 --> 02:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
where so
 
02:28:08.309 --> 02:28:08.319 align:start position:0%
I am in full support of this of adding
 
02:28:10.910 --> 02:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
this and if the Senate the Senate didn't
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
agree and I'm sorry that they didn't but
 
02:28:16.550 --> 02:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
they either go together or they don't go
 
02:28:19.110 --> 02:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
at all that is the way I feel about it
 
02:28:21.269 --> 02:28:21.279 align:start position:0%
and I think that this is the best Avenue
 
02:28:25.070 --> 02:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
for us to follow thank
 
02:28:28.750 --> 02:28:28.760 align:start position:0%
you representative leus uh thank you
 
02:28:32.389 --> 02:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
madam chair um so I was uh sponsor of
 
02:28:36.469 --> 02:28:36.479 align:start position:0%
this bill and at this point I'm torn
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
um I do think it would be reasonable to
 
02:28:41.830 --> 02:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
pass this I'm a little concerned about
 
02:28:46.950 --> 02:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
complicating um 373 by adding this on
 
02:28:48.590 --> 02:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
and I've been going back and forth on
 
02:28:52.110 --> 02:28:52.120 align:start position:0%
this and I think on balance I'm I'm prob
 
02:28:56.030 --> 02:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
I'll vote for this um and uh see what
 
02:28:59.550 --> 02:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
happens thank you okay
 
02:29:02.550 --> 02:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
well I'll I'll go on to say that I'm
 
02:29:04.469 --> 02:29:04.479 align:start position:0%
also concerned with
 
02:29:07.429 --> 02:29:07.439 align:start position:0%
affecting um Senate Bill
 
02:29:10.030 --> 02:29:10.040 align:start position:0%
373 and I voted against the study
 
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
committee in the first place
 
02:29:16.590 --> 02:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
because this is within the scope anybody
 
02:29:20.870 --> 02:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
can study it what they like and this is
 
02:29:22.670 --> 02:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need any more formal
 
02:29:22.680 --> 02:29:27.950 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need any more formal
study

02:29:27.950 --> 02:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:30.870 --> 02:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
committees anyone else representative
 
02:29:34.389 --> 02:29:34.399 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair
 
02:29:38.830 --> 02:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
so um the testimony in the Senate and I
 
02:29:40.950 --> 02:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
was one of the people who testified but
 
02:29:44.790 --> 02:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
the shair of the of the Native American
 
02:29:49.349 --> 02:29:49.359 align:start position:0%
commission was there she she was online
 
02:29:51.389 --> 02:29:51.399 align:start position:0%
one of the people who voted against it
 
02:29:55.269 --> 02:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
online one of the 38 okay she was there
 
02:29:57.590 --> 02:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
and several other former or current
 
02:30:00.349 --> 02:30:00.359 align:start position:0%
members of the commission were there and
 
02:30:02.469 --> 02:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
they testified against this in the
 
02:30:04.510 --> 02:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
Senate that's one of the reasons that
 
02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
the senate committee voted
 
02:30:11.030 --> 02:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
itl and that one of the statements that
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
was made was that the study committee
 
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
that this bill would form is
 
02:30:18.269 --> 02:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
antithetical to the good order and
 
02:30:20.670 --> 02:30:20.680 align:start position:0%
discipline if you will of the
 
02:30:24.309 --> 02:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:26.750 --> 02:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
commission that was a testimony of
 
02:30:28.269 --> 02:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
people who are on the commission
 
02:30:30.670 --> 02:30:30.680 align:start position:0%
including the chair before the Senate
 
02:30:32.510 --> 02:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
that's the reason one of the reasons
 
02:30:35.110 --> 02:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
that they voted against
 
02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
so I think we're just we're asking uh
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
and and I and those are the people who
 
02:30:44.910 --> 02:30:44.920 align:start position:0%
are the experts on the indigenous
 
02:30:48.150 --> 02:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
matters and we should not uh o overrule
 
02:30:51.510 --> 02:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
them in my judgment thank you
 
02:30:53.349 --> 02:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
i' I'd like to mention that I have been
 
02:30:56.510 --> 02:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
informed that we can't actually adopt
 
02:30:58.550 --> 02:30:58.560 align:start position:0%
this until we have a formal Amendment
 
02:30:58.560 --> 02:30:59.469 align:start position:0%
this until we have a formal Amendment
which

02:30:59.469 --> 02:30:59.479 align:start position:0%
which
 
02:31:01.750 --> 02:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
will which could be obtained this
 
02:31:04.830 --> 02:31:04.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon so if we decide if we vote in
 
02:31:09.349 --> 02:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
favor of adding this we will have to do
 
02:31:12.790 --> 02:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
that vote after we get the amendment
 
02:31:15.070 --> 02:31:15.080 align:start position:0%
which should be quick since it's since
 
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
it has to be what pass the house but uh
 
02:31:19.600 --> 02:31:21.710 align:start position:0%
it has to be what pass the house but uh
another

02:31:21.710 --> 02:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
another
 
02:31:23.230 --> 02:31:23.240 align:start position:0%
Madam CH people should be aware of it
 
02:31:26.030 --> 02:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
yes can I just follow up on one more
 
02:31:28.550 --> 02:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
comment thank you I just like to say
 
02:31:31.990 --> 02:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
that um in response to uh what
 
02:31:34.950 --> 02:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
representative groa said my colleague
 
02:31:37.950 --> 02:31:37.960 align:start position:0%
from wherever she's
 
02:31:42.710 --> 02:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
from that I I um I would like to rise
 
02:31:46.389 --> 02:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
I'd like to agree that we um worked very
 
02:31:49.309 --> 02:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
hard to make this a collaborative
 
02:31:52.950 --> 02:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
project and that we um had a member of
 
02:31:55.469 --> 02:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
the commission agree to work with you
 
02:31:57.510 --> 02:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
know we all work agreed to work together
 
02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
and we did work together something
 
02:32:01.550 --> 02:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
happened I don't know what happened I
 
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to speculate I don't want to
 
02:32:06.030 --> 02:32:06.040 align:start position:0%
guess what people's purposes or motives
 
02:32:08.750 --> 02:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
were all I know is we all came together
 
02:32:11.389 --> 02:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
we all agreed on two bills being both
 
02:32:13.550 --> 02:32:13.560 align:start position:0%
passed and moving ahead and then there
 
02:32:17.269 --> 02:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
was a change on one party uh and which I
 
02:32:20.030 --> 02:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
can't understand but I really appreciate
 
02:32:22.469 --> 02:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to be able to get a
 
02:32:25.349 --> 02:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
study committee on the record because
 
02:32:27.230 --> 02:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
some of this confusion and back and
 
02:32:29.269 --> 02:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
forth just makes things difficult and
 
02:32:31.349 --> 02:32:31.359 align:start position:0%
when we can all come together officially
 
02:32:33.510 --> 02:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
under an official study committee it
 
02:32:34.990 --> 02:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
will all be on the record and there
 
02:32:37.950 --> 02:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
won't be he said she said kind of stuff
 
02:32:40.870 --> 02:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you okay anyone else
 
02:32:40.880 --> 02:32:42.269 align:start position:0%
so thank you okay anyone else
representative

02:32:42.269 --> 02:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you madam chair so I
 
02:32:48.030 --> 02:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
would be really concerned about 373
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
being derailed
 
02:32:53.389 --> 02:32:53.399 align:start position:0%
uh that's if if that passes that's a
 
02:32:56.389 --> 02:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
direct impact to the cost of
 
02:32:59.750 --> 02:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
housing that is is good for the citizens
 
02:33:03.870 --> 02:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire so I representative G
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
if is is there any way that this could
 
02:33:08.110 --> 02:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
be brought up next year it could be I'm
 
02:33:11.070 --> 02:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
sure but would that be a problem I'm I
 
02:33:14.830 --> 02:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
have a I'll reiterate that again the 373
 
02:33:16.469 --> 02:33:16.479 align:start position:0%
and and the air exchanges and the cost
 
02:33:18.710 --> 02:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
to housing is really an important thing
 
02:33:21.389 --> 02:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
we don't want to lose
 
02:33:24.030 --> 02:33:24.040 align:start position:0%

02:33:32.550 --> 02:33:32.560 align:start position:0%

02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
official vote once we get which means
 
02:33:35.920 --> 02:33:37.150 align:start position:0%
official vote once we get which means
this

02:33:37.150 --> 02:33:37.160 align:start position:0%

possible we will recess this
 
02:35:04.750 --> 02:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:09.429 --> 02:35:09.439 align:start position:0%
amendment Senate Bill 318 representative

leus uh yes as soon as I get all right
 
02:35:15.230 --> 02:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
I'd like to
 
02:35:22.269 --> 02:35:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:22.279 --> 02:35:24.590 align:start position:0%
 
I'll

02:35:24.590 --> 02:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
I'll
 
02:35:27.110 --> 02:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
second you wish to speak to your motion
 
02:35:28.349 --> 02:35:28.359 align:start position:0%
I do
 
02:35:31.590 --> 02:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
so um you know earlier in the year we
 
02:35:34.550 --> 02:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
dealt with House Bill 1271 which changed
 
02:35:37.030 --> 02:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
a number of boards to advisory made
 
02:35:39.870 --> 02:35:39.880 align:start position:0%
certain other changes um there were some
 
02:35:41.990 --> 02:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
concerns about some of those boards and
 
02:35:43.990 --> 02:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
we ended up interim studying that
 
02:35:46.830 --> 02:35:46.840 align:start position:0%
bill U the intent for creating the
 
02:35:49.830 --> 02:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
amendment on this bill was to take
 
02:35:52.030 --> 02:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
um certain things out of there the uh
 
02:35:54.590 --> 02:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing uh standards
 
02:35:56.710 --> 02:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
installation Standards Board and the
 
02:35:58.670 --> 02:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
board examiners of nursing home
 
02:36:00.349 --> 02:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
administrators and change those to
 
02:36:03.670 --> 02:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
advisory boards another thing was that
 
02:36:06.670 --> 02:36:06.680 align:start position:0%
um there's the existing advisory boards
 
02:36:08.110 --> 02:36:08.120 align:start position:0%
a massage
 
02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:10.070 align:start position:0%
a massage
therapists

02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
therapists
 
02:36:13.110 --> 02:36:13.120 align:start position:0%
um and uh actually I've got it here
 
02:36:15.469 --> 02:36:15.479 align:start position:0%
anyway there there's two other boards
 
02:36:17.349 --> 02:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
that would be combined there're already
 
02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
advisory boards and um and that was at
 
02:36:24.630 --> 02:36:24.640 align:start position:0%
the request of those two boards
 
02:36:27.950 --> 02:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
um and then and basically that was it
 
02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
and unfortunately when OS drafted the
 
02:36:34.190 --> 02:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
amendment they left significant pieces
 
02:36:35.750 --> 02:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
out of they were supposed to take those
 
02:36:36.790 --> 02:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
pieces out of
 
02:36:39.990 --> 02:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
1271 apply the P those equivalent pieces
 
02:36:42.790 --> 02:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
from the proposed amendment to 1271 and
 
02:36:45.750 --> 02:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
create this amendment out of it um
 
02:36:48.070 --> 02:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately U there were a lot of
 
02:36:51.230 --> 02:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
chunks uh that were left out and um I
 
02:36:52.710 --> 02:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
went through it and actually I would
 
02:36:56.990 --> 02:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
want to thank uh Doug osterhout from uh
 
02:36:59.710 --> 02:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
oplc who who I asked to review it and he
 
02:37:02.389 --> 02:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
found those pieces so anyway 1780 is
 
02:37:05.670 --> 02:37:05.680 align:start position:0%
what the amendment was intended to be
 
02:37:08.150 --> 02:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
and so and this replaces the entire Bill
 
02:37:09.790 --> 02:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
actually what I should say is the
 
02:37:13.630 --> 02:37:13.640 align:start position:0%
underlying Senate Bill 318 is on uh so
 
02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
the social work compact the language is
 
02:37:18.630 --> 02:37:18.640 align:start position:0%
identical to the house bill 1190 which
 
02:37:22.030 --> 02:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
has already been been um uh passed by
 
02:37:25.309 --> 02:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
the house and the Senate um and so
 
02:37:28.150 --> 02:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
passing that again would would not make
 
02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:30.110 align:start position:0%
passing that again would would not make
sense

02:37:30.110 --> 02:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
sense
 
02:37:33.469 --> 02:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
so um the two boards the uh manufactured
 
02:37:34.990 --> 02:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
housing installation board and the
 
02:37:37.030 --> 02:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
nursing home administrators board the
 
02:37:38.910 --> 02:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee went through those in a lot
 
02:37:43.110 --> 02:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
of detail and um you know looked at the
 
02:37:46.349 --> 02:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
makeup the proposed makeup of the boards
 
02:37:49.510 --> 02:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
and made changes to that um the other
 
02:37:51.950 --> 02:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
changes in here are uh there are some
 
02:37:53.070 --> 02:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
that are the
 
02:37:55.590 --> 02:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
general um cleanup of the language some
 
02:37:58.510 --> 02:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
of what was in uh HP 655 from last year
 
02:38:01.190 --> 02:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's some of that but the main point
 
02:38:03.590 --> 02:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
is to make them advisory boards and then
 
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
as I said the
 
02:38:10.230 --> 02:38:10.240 align:start position:0%
um get the names right the
 
02:38:12.630 --> 02:38:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh there's the board of massage
 
02:38:16.110 --> 02:38:16.120 align:start position:0%
therapists and then the board of U
 
02:38:18.830 --> 02:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
reflexologist yeah it's a reflexologist
 
02:38:20.590 --> 02:38:20.600 align:start position:0%
structural inter ators and Asian body
 
02:38:23.070 --> 02:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
work therapists they're combined and the
 
02:38:25.309 --> 02:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
new board will be called The Advisory
 
02:38:27.670 --> 02:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
Board of massage therapists reflexes
 
02:38:29.550 --> 02:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
structural integrators and Asian
 
02:38:31.870 --> 02:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
Bodywork therapists and again that one
 
02:38:34.309 --> 02:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
was at the request of those boards the
 
02:38:35.870 --> 02:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
other thing that I took out of the
 
02:38:38.469 --> 02:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
original Senate Bill 318 is all
 
02:38:42.150 --> 02:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
reference to um medical technician
 
02:38:45.030 --> 02:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
registration so we had um House Bill
 
02:38:47.230 --> 02:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
1410 which got rid of that because it
 
02:38:48.190 --> 02:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
was not
 
02:38:51.190 --> 02:38:51.200 align:start position:0%
working um and that went to the Senate
 
02:38:54.269 --> 02:38:54.279 align:start position:0%
and the Senate has decided that um they
 
02:38:56.750 --> 02:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
want to retrain retain registration they
 
02:38:59.590 --> 02:38:59.600 align:start position:0%
recognize the issues that we
 
02:39:02.830 --> 02:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
saw um and I as I understand it they're
 
02:39:06.910 --> 02:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
looking at um keeping uh registration
 
02:39:08.830 --> 02:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
for medical technicians but get rid of
 
02:39:11.150 --> 02:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
the board and have the rul making and
 
02:39:13.469 --> 02:39:13.479 align:start position:0%
other processes uh just directly under
 
02:39:16.269 --> 02:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
the office U of Professional Licensing
 
02:39:18.110 --> 02:39:18.120 align:start position:0%
and certification so I took it out at
 
02:39:19.950 --> 02:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
318 so it not confli with what the
 
02:39:22.950 --> 02:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
Senate appears to be doing and that's
 
02:39:27.269 --> 02:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:31.110 --> 02:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
represent I'd also like to add that you
 
02:39:34.150 --> 02:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
might all remember the amendment to um
 
02:39:35.670 --> 02:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
02:39:40.110 --> 02:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
1095 and how this the language in this
 
02:39:43.389 --> 02:39:43.399 align:start position:0%
bill is in compliance with the language
 
02:39:47.309 --> 02:39:47.319 align:start position:0%
that we have in other boards now so we
 
02:39:50.110 --> 02:39:50.120 align:start position:0%
should have most of our
 
02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:51.870 align:start position:0%
should have most of our
um

02:39:51.870 --> 02:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
statutes by the end of this
 
02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:56.750 align:start position:0%
statutes by the end of this
session

02:39:56.750 --> 02:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
session
 
02:39:59.590 --> 02:39:59.600 align:start position:0%

02:40:02.950 --> 02:40:02.960 align:start position:0%

statement uh as someone who opposed the
 
02:41:37.030 --> 02:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
original passage of House Bill
 
02:41:39.590 --> 02:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
1271 I do appreciate representative
 
02:41:42.790 --> 02:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
leakes's work to take out the items that
 
02:41:45.389 --> 02:41:45.399 align:start position:0%
were objected to and I appreciate his
 
02:41:50.910 --> 02:41:50.920 align:start position:0%

subcommittee this this was a lot of work
 
02:41:58.630 --> 02:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
getting through 1271 and everybody

I'd like to mention that we'll also make
 
02:42:08.349 --> 02:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
the infm study of 1271 a lot easier
 
02:42:10.870 --> 02:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
because we've eliminated some of
 
02:42:14.510 --> 02:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
the U non-controversial sections and
 
02:42:17.550 --> 02:42:17.560 align:start position:0%
this the interim study can concentrate
 
02:42:20.469 --> 02:42:20.479 align:start position:0%
on what the requirements are for the
 
02:42:23.349 --> 02:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
remaining boards rather than look look
 
02:42:26.550 --> 02:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
at combining the massage therapy and the
 
02:42:28.790 --> 02:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
B Asian body
 
02:42:31.150 --> 02:42:31.160 align:start position:0%
work anyone
 
02:42:34.070 --> 02:42:34.080 align:start position:0%

consent on a roll and that leaves Senate
 
02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:32.790 align:start position:0%
consent on a roll and that leaves Senate
Bill

02:44:32.790 --> 02:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
02:44:34.950 --> 02:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
440 representative
 
02:44:38.950 --> 02:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
leus I'd like to adopt amendment
 
02:44:41.950 --> 02:44:41.960 align:start position:0%
185h to Senate Bill
 
02:44:46.870 --> 02:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
440 okay is there a second I'll second
 
02:44:51.349 --> 02:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:53.990 --> 02:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
so I mean the underlying bill would
 
02:44:57.230 --> 02:44:57.240 align:start position:0%
allow um optometrists to do some
 
02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
additional procedures um there was a lot
 
02:45:03.790 --> 02:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
of concern raised about them potentially
 
02:45:07.349 --> 02:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
doing it without adequate um education
 
02:45:08.910 --> 02:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
training and all
 
02:45:12.429 --> 02:45:12.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:14.750 --> 02:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
so that was you know we had the sub the
 
02:45:16.469 --> 02:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session on it I'd like
 
02:45:18.349 --> 02:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
to thank everybody who is working on
 
02:45:18.359 --> 02:45:19.469 align:start position:0%
to thank everybody who is working on
that

02:45:19.469 --> 02:45:19.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:24.190 --> 02:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
and um so there were um some changes I
 
02:45:26.950 --> 02:45:26.960 align:start position:0%
mean the first part of this amendment is
 
02:45:29.469 --> 02:45:29.479 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of a cleanup on the uh
 
02:45:31.750 --> 02:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
language on the list of procedures are
 
02:45:34.269 --> 02:45:34.279 align:start position:0%
not permitted to do as I understand it
 
02:45:36.630 --> 02:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
this part was uh you know there was
 
02:45:38.230 --> 02:45:38.240 align:start position:0%
agreement between the optomologist and
 
02:45:40.910 --> 02:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
the optometrist that's what I heard um
 
02:45:42.790 --> 02:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
and it's just some uh more like
 
02:45:44.870 --> 02:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
technical changes to descriptions and
 
02:45:46.870 --> 02:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
names the
 
02:45:50.510 --> 02:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
substance is um on the second page
 
02:45:52.389 --> 02:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
starting at
 
02:45:54.950 --> 02:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh I'm sorry
 
02:45:58.630 --> 02:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
yeah uh yeah the starting at line
 
02:45:58.640 --> 02:46:00.349 align:start position:0%
yeah uh yeah the starting at line
22

02:46:00.349 --> 02:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
22
 
02:46:03.990 --> 02:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
and it's it's the uh what what the board
 
02:46:06.230 --> 02:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
has to do around
 
02:46:08.550 --> 02:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and it says uh they shall
 
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
have the authority to determine what
 
02:46:13.429 --> 02:46:13.439 align:start position:0%
conss of practice Optometry by person's
 
02:46:16.429 --> 02:46:16.439 align:start position:0%
license in the chapter consistent with C
 
02:46:17.910 --> 02:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
curriculum of nationally accredited
 
02:46:20.150 --> 02:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
schools but in
 
02:46:22.349 --> 02:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
particular they have they shall they
 
02:46:24.429 --> 02:46:24.439 align:start position:0%
must adopt rules uh establishing the
 
02:46:26.349 --> 02:46:26.359 align:start position:0%
credentialing credentialing
 
02:46:28.590 --> 02:46:28.600 align:start position:0%
certification which shall be uh
 
02:46:30.269 --> 02:46:30.279 align:start position:0%
fulfilled before a person may be
 
02:46:33.590 --> 02:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
certified to perform optomic procedures
 
02:46:36.190 --> 02:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
and there are given a list of things
 
02:46:39.269 --> 02:46:39.279 align:start position:0%
they must do one is identification and
 
02:46:41.429 --> 02:46:41.439 align:start position:0%
categorization of optomic procedures for
 
02:46:44.110 --> 02:46:44.120 align:start position:0%
the practice of Optometry what we heard
 
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
and both in the public hearing and in
 
02:46:47.910 --> 02:46:47.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is there's a large list of
 
02:46:50.269 --> 02:46:50.279 align:start position:0%
potential procedures
 
02:46:52.910 --> 02:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
and um so they have to group the ones
 
02:46:55.710 --> 02:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
that they want optometrist to be able to
 
02:46:59.030 --> 02:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
do um you know in categories and then
 
02:47:02.070 --> 02:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
they have to establish the criteria for
 
02:47:04.750 --> 02:47:04.760 align:start position:0%
performing such procedures with
 
02:47:06.990 --> 02:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
proficiency um that's got to include a
 
02:47:09.630 --> 02:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
minimum education training and live
 
02:47:11.590 --> 02:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
experience requirements for a person to
 
02:47:14.510 --> 02:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
perform such procedures with efficiency
 
02:47:18.190 --> 02:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
there was concern expressed about um um
 
02:47:22.309 --> 02:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
optometrist potentially only um
 
02:47:25.030 --> 02:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
practicing on in animate objects whether
 
02:47:29.710 --> 02:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
it's uh you know from animals or uh or
 
02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know synthetic uh
 
02:47:34.630 --> 02:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
simulations and um you know and so this
 
02:47:37.429 --> 02:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
requires that they actually have live
 
02:47:40.070 --> 02:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
experience requirements it also is a
 
02:47:41.910 --> 02:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
criteria it says for a proctoring
 
02:47:43.750 --> 02:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
criteria for acquiring such proct in
 
02:47:45.630 --> 02:47:45.640 align:start position:0%
other words when they're
 
02:47:48.510 --> 02:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
doing um this kind of clinical work when
 
02:47:50.670 --> 02:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
they're they're uh getting their
 
02:47:52.710 --> 02:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
practice on on live patients they're
 
02:47:54.309 --> 02:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
going to have somebody watching what
 
02:47:56.870 --> 02:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
they're doing uh presumably as part of
 
02:47:58.230 --> 02:47:58.240 align:start position:0%
the training and to make sure they're
 
02:48:00.309 --> 02:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
they're doing it correctly so the
 
02:48:02.830 --> 02:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
details on that must be done in
 
02:48:06.190 --> 02:48:06.200 align:start position:0%
rules and U
 
02:48:09.389 --> 02:48:09.399 align:start position:0%
so and then also on the next page uh
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
Roman 2 it says no optometrist shall
 
02:48:13.590 --> 02:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
practice under this section unless the
 
02:48:15.590 --> 02:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
optometrist has submitted evidence of
 
02:48:17.790 --> 02:48:17.800 align:start position:0%
satisfactory completion of all
 
02:48:19.150 --> 02:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
requirements for spefic spefic
 
02:48:21.590 --> 02:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
procedures and the office has certified
 
02:48:25.750 --> 02:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
that and um also a little below that in
 
02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
section 12 it makes it explicit that if
 
02:48:32.389 --> 02:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
a uh optomet optometrist uh performed
 
02:48:34.990 --> 02:48:35.000 align:start position:0%
any of the procedures for which they had
 
02:48:37.710 --> 02:48:37.720 align:start position:0%
not been certified as having met the uh
 
02:48:41.389 --> 02:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
requirements that would be a a a you
 
02:48:43.590 --> 02:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
know an a disciplinary offense and they
 
02:48:45.790 --> 02:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
could be sanctioned for that you know up
 
02:48:49.230 --> 02:48:49.240 align:start position:0%
to it including uh losing their license
 
02:48:54.150 --> 02:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
um and so you know we heard uh concerns
 
02:48:57.710 --> 02:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
that um you know there it wasn't clear
 
02:48:59.870 --> 02:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know how they would get the training
 
02:49:02.670 --> 02:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
and all of that and and you know that
 
02:49:07.590 --> 02:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
may be true but until there is a clear
 
02:49:09.710 --> 02:49:09.720 align:start position:0%
definition of what the education
 
02:49:11.389 --> 02:49:11.399 align:start position:0%
training requirements
 
02:49:14.790 --> 02:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
are um and that's aist process to
 
02:49:17.030 --> 02:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
rulemaking so uh anybody can be involved
 
02:49:18.910 --> 02:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
that I expect both optometrist and
 
02:49:21.030 --> 02:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists will be involved in that
 
02:49:23.750 --> 02:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
process process and we heard testimony
 
02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
from the optometrist that they intend to
 
02:49:32.670 --> 02:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
um use as a you know uh at least a guide
 
02:49:34.990 --> 02:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
or starting point for what the training
 
02:49:36.870 --> 02:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
and uh and other requirements would be
 
02:49:39.110 --> 02:49:39.120 align:start position:0%
training education all that would be
 
02:49:41.590 --> 02:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
based on what opthalmologists are
 
02:49:44.269 --> 02:49:44.279 align:start position:0%
required for those particular procedures
 
02:49:45.269 --> 02:49:45.279 align:start position:0%
I mean they wouldn't have all the
 
02:49:47.349 --> 02:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
training an opthalmologist would have
 
02:49:48.750 --> 02:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
but then again their scope would
 
02:49:50.790 --> 02:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
practice would still be dramatically
 
02:49:52.269 --> 02:49:52.279 align:start position:0%
less than that of an
 
02:49:54.870 --> 02:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
MD um and so that would be and until
 
02:49:57.469 --> 02:49:57.479 align:start position:0%
that is done until the ru making is done
 
02:49:59.630 --> 02:49:59.640 align:start position:0%
and until there are optometrists who
 
02:50:01.510 --> 02:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
have met those requirements no
 
02:50:03.110 --> 02:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
optometrist is going to be able to do
 
02:50:05.590 --> 02:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
anything they they aren't doing today
 
02:50:07.910 --> 02:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
and so this is uh not letting all the
 
02:50:10.030 --> 02:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
optometrist Loose as soon as this uh
 
02:50:12.229 --> 02:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
goes into effect to do whatever they
 
02:50:15.990 --> 02:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
want but it sets in place a process to
 
02:50:17.910 --> 02:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
Define what are the Education and
 
02:50:19.229 --> 02:50:19.239 align:start position:0%
Training requirements are going to have
 
02:50:20.630 --> 02:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
02:50:23.990 --> 02:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
including um working on live uh people
 
02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:25.389 align:start position:0%
including um working on live uh people
under

02:50:25.389 --> 02:50:25.399 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:50:27.790 --> 02:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
supervision and that's the key part of
 
02:50:30.710 --> 02:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
the bill there's um if you look in on
 
02:50:33.670 --> 02:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
page three line Sorry line
 
02:50:36.510 --> 02:50:36.520 align:start position:0%
21 um there's some technical changes
 
02:50:37.710 --> 02:50:37.720 align:start position:0%
similar to what we've done on other
 
02:50:41.229 --> 02:50:41.239 align:start position:0%
bills and um you know House Bill 655
 
02:50:43.429 --> 02:50:43.439 align:start position:0%
last year clarifying what's the
 
02:50:44.750 --> 02:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the board and what's
 
02:50:47.030 --> 02:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
the responsibility of the office and
 
02:50:48.670 --> 02:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
those changes in that section where the
 
02:50:50.349 --> 02:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
request of
 
02:50:53.990 --> 02:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:56.950 --> 02:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
um and also the
 
02:50:59.349 --> 02:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh U you know the board will Define the
 
02:51:01.550 --> 02:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
details on the requirements for uh
 
02:51:01.560 --> 02:51:02.830 align:start position:0%
details on the requirements for uh
continuing

02:51:02.830 --> 02:51:02.840 align:start position:0%
continuing
 
02:51:07.309 --> 02:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:11.110 --> 02:51:11.120 align:start position:0%
does represent Andre py thank you madam
 
02:51:14.550 --> 02:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
chair thank you uh for that detail
 
02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
explanation representative leers oh
 
02:51:19.229 --> 02:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:51:21.550 --> 02:51:21.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry do you mind letting CL finish
 
02:51:24.670 --> 02:51:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:28.309 --> 02:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
you oh I was just speaking to my second
 
02:51:33.750 --> 02:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay so um what I want to say is
 
02:51:36.910 --> 02:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
that I want everyone to understand that
 
02:51:39.630 --> 02:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
Ru making is not a
 
02:51:42.429 --> 02:51:42.439 align:start position:0%
joke it is
 
02:51:46.389 --> 02:51:46.399 align:start position:0%
totally um in it's an intense
 
02:51:50.389 --> 02:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
process and that anyone who minimizes
 
02:51:52.830 --> 02:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
rule making or thinks that this is some
 
02:51:55.550 --> 02:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly thing that op Autometrics
 
02:51:58.870 --> 02:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
are going to be able to do they're
 
02:52:02.429 --> 02:52:02.439 align:start position:0%
incorrect so I think that people should
 
02:52:05.110 --> 02:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
realize that rul making is something
 
02:52:08.030 --> 02:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
that is always happens as a result of
 
02:52:11.349 --> 02:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
legislation in things that and and it's
 
02:52:13.150 --> 02:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
very common in
 
02:52:15.550 --> 02:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
licensing and
 
02:52:20.030 --> 02:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
this committee has support Ed
 
02:52:22.469 --> 02:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
boards and they the importance that they
 
02:52:24.269 --> 02:52:24.279 align:start position:0%
have in their
 
02:52:27.070 --> 02:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
expertise and we ask them to put that
 
02:52:31.269 --> 02:52:31.279 align:start position:0%
expertise in writing through rule making
 
02:52:34.229 --> 02:52:34.239 align:start position:0%
so I don't want anyone to walk away from
 
02:52:36.469 --> 02:52:36.479 align:start position:0%
here and think
 
02:52:39.510 --> 02:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
that rule making is just going to be a
 
02:52:41.790 --> 02:52:41.800 align:start position:0%
couple of check boxes filled out and
 
02:52:43.389 --> 02:52:43.399 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the end of it it's
 
02:52:43.399 --> 02:52:44.950 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the end of it it's
serious

02:52:44.950 --> 02:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
serious
 
02:52:48.550 --> 02:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
stuff and I'm glad that it's in here and
 
02:52:50.389 --> 02:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
and I think that it's an important part
 
02:52:53.670 --> 02:52:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:56.710 --> 02:52:56.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam s sorry for jumping
 
02:53:00.990 --> 02:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
the gun um couple of things and for me
 
02:53:05.750 --> 02:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
it still I've toiled with a lot of this
 
02:53:09.670 --> 02:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh about this bill and I think um
 
02:53:14.309 --> 02:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
echoing uh representative gr's uh s
 
02:53:18.830 --> 02:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
um points that Ru making has not not
 
02:53:21.710 --> 02:53:21.720 align:start position:0%
already happened and we are not just
 
02:53:26.309 --> 02:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
adopting something that's already been
 
02:53:30.309 --> 02:53:30.319 align:start position:0%
uh you know proposed by one group or the
 
02:53:34.910 --> 02:53:34.920 align:start position:0%
other and I still very firmly believe
 
02:53:37.110 --> 02:53:37.120 align:start position:0%
this will only
 
02:53:40.510 --> 02:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
enhance the opportunity for the granite
 
02:53:44.990 --> 02:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
Staters to get preventive early
 
02:53:50.349 --> 02:53:50.359 align:start position:0%
intervention and access to I care based
 
02:53:54.229 --> 02:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
on very solid grounds of what the
 
02:53:59.550 --> 02:53:59.560 align:start position:0%
training is who's looking at it and so I
 
02:54:03.070 --> 02:54:03.080 align:start position:0%
would and it'll take a year or so to do
 
02:54:07.150 --> 02:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
the ru making and you know working
 
02:54:10.469 --> 02:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
collaboratively and I still firmly
 
02:54:13.469 --> 02:54:13.479 align:start position:0%
believe that this will remove the silos
 
02:54:17.389 --> 02:54:17.399 align:start position:0%
of SP this is my territory this is yours
 
02:54:20.950 --> 02:54:20.960 align:start position:0%
kind of thing is it will definitely
 
02:54:24.349 --> 02:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
enhance collaborative effort thank you
 
02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
and I will be supporting them
 
02:54:26.399 --> 02:54:27.590 align:start position:0%
and I will be supporting them
representative

02:54:27.590 --> 02:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:54:30.030 --> 02:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
Goldie thank you madam
 
02:54:34.070 --> 02:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
chair I will not be supporting
 
02:54:37.510 --> 02:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
this we look at what we do here when we
 
02:54:39.469 --> 02:54:39.479 align:start position:0%
do licensing and it's
 
02:54:43.030 --> 02:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:46.190 align:start position:0%
 
safety

02:54:46.190 --> 02:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:48.910 --> 02:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
and there was some discussion
 
02:54:52.030 --> 02:54:52.040 align:start position:0%
that only two schools in the country out
 
02:54:53.469 --> 02:54:53.479 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:54:57.030 --> 02:54:57.040 align:start position:0%
22 that do instructing have actual
 
02:55:00.309 --> 02:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
clinical experience
 
02:55:03.309 --> 02:55:03.319 align:start position:0%
required and specifically there was one
 
02:55:06.389 --> 02:55:06.399 align:start position:0%
here from Kentucky when it
 
02:55:10.030 --> 02:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
testified was asked what the minimum was
 
02:55:13.429 --> 02:55:13.439 align:start position:0%
that someone had to do to be considered
 
02:55:15.910 --> 02:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
proficient or the maximum and there was
 
02:55:21.469 --> 02:55:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:23.870 --> 02:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
so there's no guidance as to what
 
02:55:26.469 --> 02:55:26.479 align:start position:0%
proficiency means you can say we're
 
02:55:28.070 --> 02:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
going to put it in
 
02:55:30.510 --> 02:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
rules but there's no criteria out there
 
02:55:33.670 --> 02:55:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:37.150 --> 02:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
programs we are not the medical experts
 
02:55:40.070 --> 02:55:40.080 align:start position:0%
we had folks sitting here on this
 
02:55:42.590 --> 02:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
committee from Health and Human Services
 
02:55:44.790 --> 02:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
from the medical
 
02:55:47.429 --> 02:55:47.439 align:start position:0%
field and one of them representative
 
02:55:50.429 --> 02:55:50.439 align:start position:0%
Murphy I asked specifically last week at
 
02:55:52.229 --> 02:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
session how he felt about this bill and
 
02:55:54.750 --> 02:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
he didn't feel comfortable with it and
 
02:55:57.309 --> 02:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
Madam chair with these folks were here
 
02:55:59.830 --> 02:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
for a reason to get their input and my
 
02:56:01.349 --> 02:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
question I guess goes to representative
 
02:56:03.950 --> 02:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
leus was their input brought forward
 
02:56:05.670 --> 02:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
after the subcommittee met on how they
 
02:56:09.349 --> 02:56:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:13.510 --> 02:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
amendment black right
 
02:56:16.990 --> 02:56:17.000 align:start position:0%
um I did not talk to them specifically
 
02:56:19.349 --> 02:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't contacted however uh there
 
02:56:21.790 --> 02:56:21.800 align:start position:0%
was communication with certainly a lot
 
02:56:23.710 --> 02:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
from the opthalmologists and also the
 
02:56:26.870 --> 02:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
optometrists and I mean it's recognize
 
02:56:30.510 --> 02:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
there are limited places for or schools
 
02:56:33.110 --> 02:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
for people to get this training at this
 
02:56:36.670 --> 02:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
time um and but the concerns raised
 
02:56:38.630 --> 02:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
about that were were certainly
 
02:56:40.870 --> 02:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
recognized I think addressed in this
 
02:56:43.870 --> 02:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
amendment um you know there's going to
 
02:56:45.950 --> 02:56:45.960 align:start position:0%
be input from opthalmologist and whoever
 
02:56:47.750 --> 02:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
else is interested on the ru making and
 
02:56:48.830 --> 02:56:48.840 align:start position:0%
their char
 
02:56:53.670 --> 02:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
charged to um Define what adequate
 
02:56:55.630 --> 02:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
training is or what the proper training
 
02:56:57.950 --> 02:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
is for them to become proficient uh
 
02:56:59.670 --> 02:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
there is a requirement that was added
 
02:57:01.710 --> 02:57:01.720 align:start position:0%
partly in response to the concerns that
 
02:57:04.469 --> 02:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
were raised that it include U you know
 
02:57:07.870 --> 02:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
live practice on people under
 
02:57:11.630 --> 02:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
supervision and um and it may be that
 
02:57:13.870 --> 02:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
there are
 
02:57:17.389 --> 02:57:17.399 align:start position:0%
um you know not very many people who've
 
02:57:19.670 --> 02:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
come out of schools already maybe nobody
 
02:57:21.349 --> 02:57:21.359 align:start position:0%
who's will be able to meet the
 
02:57:24.349 --> 02:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
requirements that end up in rules but
 
02:57:26.429 --> 02:57:26.439 align:start position:0%
the uh we you know we've heard there are
 
02:57:28.229 --> 02:57:28.239 align:start position:0%
uh expansions in this because there are
 
02:57:29.870 --> 02:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
more states that are permitting some of
 
02:57:31.870 --> 02:57:31.880 align:start position:0%
these additional uh
 
02:57:34.150 --> 02:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
procedures and if somebody's had the
 
02:57:35.590 --> 02:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
training but they haven't had the live
 
02:57:37.910 --> 02:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
practice there are options there may be
 
02:57:40.510 --> 02:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to depend on rules um a
 
02:57:41.830 --> 02:57:41.840 align:start position:0%
situation where that person that
 
02:57:45.469 --> 02:57:45.479 align:start position:0%
optometrist would work closely with an
 
02:57:48.630 --> 02:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist to uh get that clinical
 
02:57:50.150 --> 02:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
practice on live people under
 
02:57:51.790 --> 02:57:51.800 align:start position:0%
supervision with that opthalmologist
 
02:57:53.070 --> 02:57:53.080 align:start position:0%
there's a number of
 
02:57:56.469 --> 02:57:56.479 align:start position:0%
possibilities and the expectation I have
 
02:57:58.710 --> 02:57:58.720 align:start position:0%
is that the number of optometrists that
 
02:58:00.070 --> 02:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
are going to be able to do these new
 
02:58:02.910 --> 02:58:02.920 align:start position:0%
things will grow slowly but as somebody
 
02:58:05.150 --> 02:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
had had said in in one of the uh
 
02:58:07.229 --> 02:58:07.239 align:start position:0%
hearings it's to some extent a chicken
 
02:58:09.790 --> 02:58:09.800 align:start position:0%
and egg problem right now a lot of the
 
02:58:11.990 --> 02:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
schools are not providing this training
 
02:58:13.790 --> 02:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
because either in the because the state
 
02:58:15.710 --> 02:58:15.720 align:start position:0%
where the school is it's not legal for
 
02:58:18.950 --> 02:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
them to do it so they can't um or
 
02:58:22.030 --> 02:58:22.040 align:start position:0%
because um a lot Most states it's not
 
02:58:25.590 --> 02:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
legal and so there's no point uh but
 
02:58:28.630 --> 02:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
there's um as we heard 12 States and if
 
02:58:29.830 --> 02:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire you know Hampshire might
 
02:58:31.950 --> 02:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
add to that where some or all of these
 
02:58:34.710 --> 02:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
procedures have become legal but it is
 
02:58:37.830 --> 02:58:37.840 align:start position:0%
it'll be a process of growth of uh the
 
02:58:39.950 --> 02:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
education or training require you know
 
02:58:43.990 --> 02:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities coming to be um and we did
 
02:58:46.269 --> 02:58:46.279 align:start position:0%
hear from the optometrists on the board
 
02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh who are actually on the board now
 
02:58:50.830 --> 02:58:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh that uh the intent at least as a
 
02:58:55.030 --> 02:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
start for the rules is the um the level
 
02:58:55.040 --> 02:58:55.830 align:start position:0%
start for the rules is the um the level
of

02:58:55.830 --> 02:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:58:58.870 --> 02:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
training and uh including uh clinical
 
02:59:00.790 --> 02:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
work required for the of the
 
02:59:03.309 --> 02:59:03.319 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist for those specific
 
02:59:05.710 --> 02:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
procedures uh but as an opthalmologist
 
02:59:07.309 --> 02:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
can do many other things on the eye and
 
02:59:09.389 --> 02:59:09.399 align:start position:0%
is fact they're MDS and they can do any
 
02:59:12.670 --> 02:59:12.680 align:start position:0%
general um uh you know procedure that U
 
02:59:15.469 --> 02:59:15.479 align:start position:0%
medical doctors can do they can under
 
02:59:17.349 --> 02:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
under the law under licensing they may
 
02:59:20.990 --> 02:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
choose not to to um but anyway I mean
 
02:59:23.870 --> 02:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
the this sets the framework in place to
 
02:59:26.110 --> 02:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
set out the rules and requirements for
 
02:59:29.550 --> 02:59:29.560 align:start position:0%
the training uh Education and Training
 
02:59:32.229 --> 02:59:32.239 align:start position:0%
and as that uh training becomes
 
02:59:34.469 --> 02:59:34.479 align:start position:0%
available um then people will be able to
 
02:59:36.030 --> 02:59:36.040 align:start position:0%
take advantage of it if and if it
 
02:59:38.269 --> 02:59:38.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't then optometrists aren't going
 
02:59:41.190 --> 02:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to do anything new uh but
 
02:59:43.150 --> 02:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
unless we allow this opportunity then
 
02:59:44.990 --> 02:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
that rest of that is not really going to
 
02:59:49.309 --> 02:59:49.319 align:start position:0%
be able to develop representative Simon
 
02:59:50.670 --> 02:59:50.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh two things
 
02:59:53.750 --> 02:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
briefly um first uh not that the debate
 
02:59:56.150 --> 02:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
hasn't had to do with the amendment um
 
02:59:59.790 --> 02:59:59.800 align:start position:0%
but uh when looking at the amendment
 
03:00:03.429 --> 03:00:03.439 align:start position:0%
my kind of uh opinion on it is
 
03:00:04.389 --> 03:00:04.399 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether you share
 
03:00:06.190 --> 03:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
representative goal's concerns the
 
03:00:07.469 --> 03:00:07.479 align:start position:0%
amendment is much better than the
 
03:00:10.309 --> 03:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
underlying bill at uh delineating those
 
03:00:11.790 --> 03:00:11.800 align:start position:0%
things and and for that reason I think
 
03:00:13.790 --> 03:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
it's worthwhile to adopt the amendment
 
03:00:15.590 --> 03:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
and perhaps debate more fully the
 
03:00:17.990 --> 03:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill uh the second thing was
 
03:00:19.469 --> 03:00:19.479 align:start position:0%
just a clarification to something that
 
03:00:21.590 --> 03:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative Lea said earlier on the
 
03:00:24.229 --> 03:00:24.239 align:start position:0%
on page one on the list of
 
03:00:24.239 --> 03:00:25.310 align:start position:0%
on page one on the list of
exclusions

03:00:25.310 --> 03:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
exclusions
 
03:00:25.320 --> 03:00:26.590 align:start position:0%
exclusions
[Music]

03:00:26.590 --> 03:00:26.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:00:28.550 --> 03:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
um I don't I don't think that it would
 
03:00:31.190 --> 03:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
be a fair um I don't think it would be
 
03:00:32.870 --> 03:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
fair to say that the opthalmologists
 
03:00:35.630 --> 03:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
were like support of the in support of
 
03:00:36.990 --> 03:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
the list they're not really in support
 
03:00:39.710 --> 03:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
of anything so um what it is is in the
 
03:00:41.229 --> 03:00:41.239 align:start position:0%
process of the conversation some things
 
03:00:42.870 --> 03:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
were said the optometrist took those
 
03:00:44.269 --> 03:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
into consideration changed some of the
 
03:00:46.670 --> 03:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
language to strengthen it to hope
 
03:00:48.429 --> 03:00:48.439 align:start position:0%
hopefully meet some of the concerns that
 
03:00:50.910 --> 03:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
the opthalmologist had uh certainly line
 
03:00:54.510 --> 03:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
29j in particular um I can attest to
 
03:00:55.750 --> 03:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
having had a conversation with an
 
03:00:57.910 --> 03:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
opthamologist that language around the
 
03:00:59.790 --> 03:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
orbit of the eye is much more acceptable
 
03:01:01.190 --> 03:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
and much more restrictive than the
 
03:01:02.790 --> 03:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
original language was so it certainly
 
03:01:05.870 --> 03:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
does take his concern into uh account
 
03:01:08.670 --> 03:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
and change it to make it stronger um but
 
03:01:10.510 --> 03:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
I still have a feeling that if I gave it
 
03:01:12.469 --> 03:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
to him he wouldn't stamp it and say
 
03:01:16.550 --> 03:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
we're for it okay representative
 
03:01:19.990 --> 03:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
Dolan thank you Madam chair um my
 
03:01:22.630 --> 03:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
comment is for the underlying Bill not
 
03:01:24.429 --> 03:01:24.439 align:start position:0%
just the amendment you want me to to
 
03:01:27.429 --> 03:01:27.439 align:start position:0%
wait if you don't mind okay
 
03:01:30.269 --> 03:01:30.279 align:start position:0%
representative Shu thank you madam chair
 
03:01:32.950 --> 03:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
um I'll make all my comments at this
 
03:01:35.830 --> 03:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
time I will be voting for the amendment
 
03:01:38.910 --> 03:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
uh as representative Simon indicated I
 
03:01:42.469 --> 03:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
feel that it does make the bill better
 
03:01:45.110 --> 03:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
and I do appreciate concerns expressed
 
03:01:49.070 --> 03:01:49.080 align:start position:0%
at the hearing about access to care
 
03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
however I don't feel that the one very
 
03:01:54.389 --> 03:01:54.399 align:start position:0%
lengthy subcommittee meeting that this
 
03:01:57.550 --> 03:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
committee held was enough to dive into
 
03:02:00.590 --> 03:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
all of the procedures involved in this
 
03:02:04.790 --> 03:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
bill and I would hope that we could
 
03:02:07.950 --> 03:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
possibly send the underlying Bill to
 
03:02:10.950 --> 03:02:10.960 align:start position:0%
interim study for this process to
 
03:02:14.110 --> 03:02:14.120 align:start position:0%
further examine these very complicated
 
03:02:16.389 --> 03:02:16.399 align:start position:0%
issues thank
 
03:02:20.830 --> 03:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
you represent ative Schmidt and then
 
03:02:23.870 --> 03:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
Brown thank you madam chair uh well I
 
03:02:25.389 --> 03:02:25.399 align:start position:0%
certainly want to commend representative
 
03:02:29.030 --> 03:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
leus for uh for all the work you've done
 
03:02:30.950 --> 03:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh and I think we are getting
 
03:02:34.950 --> 03:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
closer uh to uh what where we need to
 
03:02:39.670 --> 03:02:39.680 align:start position:0%
get to uh but um I recall several years
 
03:02:42.510 --> 03:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
ago when we were dealing with an issue
 
03:02:45.710 --> 03:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
involving the disability community and
 
03:02:47.309 --> 03:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
they came before us and very
 
03:02:47.319 --> 03:02:48.870 align:start position:0%
they came before us and very
passionately

03:02:48.870 --> 03:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
passionately
 
03:02:51.269 --> 03:02:51.279 align:start position:0%
advocated with one phrase that I've
 
03:02:53.870 --> 03:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
never forgotten and it said nothing
 
03:02:56.950 --> 03:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
about us without
 
03:02:59.590 --> 03:02:59.600 align:start position:0%
us and they said about the bill we were
 
03:03:01.229 --> 03:03:01.239 align:start position:0%
dealing with at that
 
03:03:04.429 --> 03:03:04.439 align:start position:0%
time it was something about them without
 
03:03:09.229 --> 03:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
them um and so this new amendment I
 
03:03:11.269 --> 03:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
think is is a definite
 
03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
Improvement what I'm concerned about is
 
03:03:18.070 --> 03:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
that we are legislating
 
03:03:20.830 --> 03:03:20.840 align:start position:0%
over the top of
 
03:03:25.269 --> 03:03:25.279 align:start position:0%
the HHS committee which
 
03:03:29.710 --> 03:03:29.720 align:start position:0%
has the purview of medical stuff our
 
03:03:34.469 --> 03:03:34.479 align:start position:0%
purview in portfolio is rules and
 
03:03:37.590 --> 03:03:37.600 align:start position:0%
Licensing and so forth and we are going
 
03:03:39.309 --> 03:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
in the right definitely going in the
 
03:03:42.150 --> 03:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
right direction with regard to that but
 
03:03:43.710 --> 03:03:43.720 align:start position:0%
we have some
 
03:03:46.349 --> 03:03:46.359 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists uh have they seen this I
 
03:03:48.309 --> 03:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
03:03:54.429 --> 03:03:54.439 align:start position:0%
uh but I I I think that you you said it
 
03:03:56.630 --> 03:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
a moment ago or couple of minutes ago
 
03:04:02.110 --> 03:04:02.120 align:start position:0%
represent leus that um uh that you had
 
03:04:03.790 --> 03:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
uh heard from some
 
03:04:06.309 --> 03:04:06.319 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist uh you've heard about
 
03:04:10.750 --> 03:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
some of the things uh and this gets more
 
03:04:15.429 --> 03:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
specific but uh uh I I think we have not
 
03:04:18.550 --> 03:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
had a good enough procedure or process
 
03:04:21.670 --> 03:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
yet we're getting there but I'm not
 
03:04:24.349 --> 03:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
ready to rush with somebody something
 
03:04:28.550 --> 03:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
dealing with the human eye it's one of
 
03:04:31.510 --> 03:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
our most important organs uh most
 
03:04:34.750 --> 03:04:34.760 align:start position:0%
sensitive organs and uh and I I don't
 
03:04:39.469 --> 03:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
want to do anything until we've had more
 
03:04:42.630 --> 03:04:42.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work on this amendment to
 
03:04:46.750 --> 03:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
see whether it gets there so I I I will
 
03:04:48.750 --> 03:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
support this amendment because it makes
 
03:04:51.790 --> 03:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
the the underlying Bill better that's
 
03:04:54.750 --> 03:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
for sure but will I support the uh
 
03:04:57.790 --> 03:04:57.800 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill the
 
03:05:00.670 --> 03:05:00.680 align:start position:0%
otpa not not until I've heard from the
 
03:05:03.030 --> 03:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist because we have to have a
 
03:05:06.510 --> 03:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
collaborative practice with with them as
 
03:05:09.070 --> 03:05:09.080 align:start position:0%
well as with the optom representative
 
03:05:11.750 --> 03:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
Brown and then leus um representative
 
03:05:13.590 --> 03:05:13.600 align:start position:0%
leus may go ahead of me if he wishes to
 
03:05:17.190 --> 03:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
respond to it thank you um first on on
 
03:05:19.309 --> 03:05:19.319 align:start position:0%
what Reverend Simon said I don't want to
 
03:05:22.550 --> 03:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
put words in uh the opthalmologist mouth
 
03:05:24.550 --> 03:05:24.560 align:start position:0%
actually I got that list from him after
 
03:05:25.950 --> 03:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
he talked to the opthalmologist
 
03:05:28.429 --> 03:05:28.439 align:start position:0%
optometrist probably a better way to say
 
03:05:30.990 --> 03:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
it is that uh they both thought that the
 
03:05:33.950 --> 03:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
uh the changes in this list of what they
 
03:05:35.950 --> 03:05:35.960 align:start position:0%
shall not do was an
 
03:05:38.190 --> 03:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
improvement um not that uh you know
 
03:05:39.550 --> 03:05:39.560 align:start position:0%
that's what they they wanted to see go
 
03:05:42.110 --> 03:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
into law
 
03:05:45.750 --> 03:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
um and you know passing this bill the
 
03:05:48.790 --> 03:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
amendment of the bill um isn't the end
 
03:05:51.790 --> 03:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
of the procedure I don't the question is
 
03:05:53.670 --> 03:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
what would we do if we were to do
 
03:05:56.790 --> 03:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
further work um you know you said we're
 
03:05:59.590 --> 03:05:59.600 align:start position:0%
not you know we're not medical doctors
 
03:06:01.630 --> 03:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
uh much of H of the HHS committee isn't
 
03:06:05.309 --> 03:06:05.319 align:start position:0%
either although some are um and it would
 
03:06:08.150 --> 03:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know coming up with the detailed
 
03:06:10.269 --> 03:06:10.279 align:start position:0%
rules on what procedures they may and
 
03:06:13.870 --> 03:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
may not do what procedures um what the
 
03:06:15.950 --> 03:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
training would have to be for that is I
 
03:06:17.990 --> 03:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't think within the expertise of this
 
03:06:20.750 --> 03:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
um uh Committee just like the detailed
 
03:06:22.910 --> 03:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
rules of what the electrical code should
 
03:06:25.229 --> 03:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
be is not or or what it takes to be a
 
03:06:27.110 --> 03:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
license electrician isn't what we do in
 
03:06:29.389 --> 03:06:29.399 align:start position:0%
general is we set up a
 
03:06:31.590 --> 03:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
framework um and then we leave it to
 
03:06:33.990 --> 03:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and I believe this bill does
 
03:06:35.630 --> 03:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
or the with the amendment it does a good
 
03:06:39.309 --> 03:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
job of that um you know there were some
 
03:06:42.269 --> 03:06:42.279 align:start position:0%
general kind of overarching concerns
 
03:06:44.830 --> 03:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
about optometrists doing things that
 
03:06:47.150 --> 03:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
they did not have the training for um I
 
03:06:49.630 --> 03:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't want them doing that
 
03:06:51.590 --> 03:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
and this puts in requirements including
 
03:06:53.670 --> 03:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
one that was raised quite a bit about
 
03:06:55.590 --> 03:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
you know live practice it puts that in
 
03:06:58.349 --> 03:06:58.359 align:start position:0%
as a requirement for the ru making so it
 
03:06:59.750 --> 03:06:59.760 align:start position:0%
sets a a
 
03:07:02.590 --> 03:07:02.600 align:start position:0%
framework in place for the ru making and
 
03:07:04.910 --> 03:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
that process would continue I'm sure as
 
03:07:07.510 --> 03:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
a collaborative process between the
 
03:07:10.670 --> 03:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist and the optometrist um
 
03:07:12.550 --> 03:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
and this list of what they may not do is
 
03:07:16.110 --> 03:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
just setting kind of a firewall be you
 
03:07:18.950 --> 03:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
know that even under the rulemaking and
 
03:07:21.750 --> 03:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
all that they can't go beyond this point
 
03:07:25.750 --> 03:07:25.760 align:start position:0%
um which are more uh more serious uh um
 
03:07:27.990 --> 03:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
operations so that's you know that's my
 
03:07:30.950 --> 03:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
take on it represent
 
03:07:34.269 --> 03:07:34.279 align:start position:0%
Brown uh thank you madam chair so
 
03:07:38.229 --> 03:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
originally I was very much against this
 
03:07:40.750 --> 03:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
um and then uh working through the
 
03:07:42.710 --> 03:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and and I'll thank our
 
03:07:44.670 --> 03:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
optometrist and opthalmologist because
 
03:07:46.429 --> 03:07:46.439 align:start position:0%
there was a couple of interesting
 
03:07:47.950 --> 03:07:47.960 align:start position:0%
conversations and our
 
03:07:47.960 --> 03:07:51.070 align:start position:0%
conversations and our
subcommittee

03:07:51.070 --> 03:07:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:54.110 --> 03:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
um it became really clear to me that I
 
03:07:57.510 --> 03:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
don't think that we as a
 
03:07:59.510 --> 03:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
committee addressing representative
 
03:08:03.590 --> 03:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
shu's comment I don't think that I can
 
03:08:06.150 --> 03:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
answer in seven years of surgical
 
03:08:09.190 --> 03:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
residency how many times has an
 
03:08:12.389 --> 03:08:12.399 align:start position:0%
opthalmologist practiced with a scalpel
 
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
on a live person and is that particular
 
03:08:17.790 --> 03:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
practice a general practice with a scalp
 
03:08:19.670 --> 03:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
and or a
 
03:08:22.389 --> 03:08:22.399 align:start position:0%
laser is all of that amount of time
 
03:08:25.830 --> 03:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
practice necessary to do X Y or a
 
03:08:27.710 --> 03:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
procedure that we're that they're asking
 
03:08:30.750 --> 03:08:30.760 align:start position:0%
to do we don't know that at this point
 
03:08:32.469 --> 03:08:32.479 align:start position:0%
and we certainly don't know the other
 
03:08:35.750 --> 03:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
side of that as as was already mentioned
 
03:08:37.830 --> 03:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
that there's very little live practice
 
03:08:40.469 --> 03:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
in most Optometric
 
03:08:43.910 --> 03:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
schools so how long would it take this
 
03:08:46.389 --> 03:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
committee to understand that it would
 
03:08:48.150 --> 03:08:48.160 align:start position:0%
take I I think
 
03:08:51.870 --> 03:08:51.880 align:start position:0%
and would we get a consistent answer so
 
03:08:54.590 --> 03:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
I am my originally I was against this I
 
03:08:57.510 --> 03:08:57.520 align:start position:0%
am now going to vote for it with the
 
03:08:58.830 --> 03:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
understanding from our subcommittee I
 
03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:06.389 --> 03:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
are are very much willing to make sure
 
03:09:08.630 --> 03:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
that any procedure that they're going to
 
03:09:12.550 --> 03:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
do meets at a minimum some type of
 
03:09:12.560 --> 03:09:13.870 align:start position:0%
do meets at a minimum some type of
surgical

03:09:13.870 --> 03:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
surgical
 
03:09:16.510 --> 03:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
skill General surgical skill and then
 
03:09:18.269 --> 03:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
surgical skill with the procedure in
 
03:09:20.870 --> 03:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
general or the specific procedure excuse
 
03:09:23.710 --> 03:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
me so because of that I'm going to
 
03:09:28.190 --> 03:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
support the amendment representative
 
03:09:31.710 --> 03:09:31.720 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you madam chair uh I agree
 
03:09:35.469 --> 03:09:35.479 align:start position:0%
with representative go go goola goalie
 
03:09:38.550 --> 03:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
I'll get it uh I'm not going to support
 
03:09:41.190 --> 03:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
this bill what I would like to see this
 
03:09:44.110 --> 03:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
done uh what I'd like to see happen to
 
03:09:47.550 --> 03:09:47.560 align:start position:0%
this is to go to interim study I I don't
 
03:09:50.830 --> 03:09:50.840 align:start position:0%
think any of us are completely
 
03:09:53.950 --> 03:09:53.960 align:start position:0%
100% understanding and and we there are
 
03:09:57.670 --> 03:09:57.680 align:start position:0%
no guidelines as to how many times like
 
03:10:00.110 --> 03:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
um representative Brown said how many
 
03:10:01.630 --> 03:10:01.640 align:start position:0%
times they have done a particular
 
03:10:04.389 --> 03:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
procedure did are they fast learn
 
03:10:06.429 --> 03:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
Learners are they slow
 
03:10:09.429 --> 03:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
Learners we have no guides I don't know
 
03:10:12.550 --> 03:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
how you get those but I think until we
 
03:10:14.950 --> 03:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
do we don't really have a good consensus
 
03:10:17.870 --> 03:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
as to what's going on here and
 
03:10:22.110 --> 03:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
I will vote against it represent man py
 
03:10:24.870 --> 03:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just having been
 
03:10:27.309 --> 03:10:27.319 align:start position:0%
on the subcommittee and having worked
 
03:10:31.190 --> 03:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
closely with um the subcommittee members
 
03:10:34.550 --> 03:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
I want to point out the reason I am
 
03:10:36.950 --> 03:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
looking at this as a step in the right
 
03:10:41.510 --> 03:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
direction is that both opthalmologists
 
03:10:45.429 --> 03:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
and optometrist are professionals right
 
03:10:50.429 --> 03:10:50.439 align:start position:0%
with training and both have the vote to
 
03:10:55.710 --> 03:10:55.720 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and from what I took away
 
03:11:01.630 --> 03:11:01.640 align:start position:0%
from the public hearing was that not
 
03:11:03.910 --> 03:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
optometrists are not running to hang
 
03:11:07.790 --> 03:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
their uh um name out to say I'm ready to
 
03:11:10.510 --> 03:11:10.520 align:start position:0%
do surgery they're taking the process
 
03:11:13.750 --> 03:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
also give us the opportunity to get in
 
03:11:18.150 --> 03:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
that direction because the uh procedures
 
03:11:21.070 --> 03:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
and the technology has changed and the
 
03:11:25.830 --> 03:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
education is changing so and to adapt to
 
03:11:29.030 --> 03:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
that and giving that professional
 
03:11:31.950 --> 03:11:31.960 align:start position:0%
courtesy the ru making giving them the
 
03:11:34.750 --> 03:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
direction we are not I'm not an
 
03:11:37.870 --> 03:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
apologist I don't understand the details
 
03:11:41.630 --> 03:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
of it but at least knowing that the
 
03:11:42.870 --> 03:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
board of
 
03:11:45.550 --> 03:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
optometrist the board is willing to put
 
03:11:48.349 --> 03:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
the time and effort into set that rule
 
03:11:52.550 --> 03:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
making keeping the Public Safety in mind
 
03:11:55.790 --> 03:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
and working collaboratively to get the
 
03:11:59.309 --> 03:11:59.319 align:start position:0%
help or support from the opthalmologist
 
03:12:01.349 --> 03:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
this is setting
 
03:12:06.229 --> 03:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
up that opportunity to work
 
03:12:08.190 --> 03:12:08.200 align:start position:0%
collaboratively having worked in the
 
03:12:11.229 --> 03:12:11.239 align:start position:0%
health field I feel like you know we've
 
03:12:15.429 --> 03:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
gone so much uh into the Super specialty
 
03:12:17.510 --> 03:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
and gotten to a point where the
 
03:12:20.510 --> 03:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort has to come back to
 
03:12:24.110 --> 03:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
Patient centered and with that in mind I
 
03:12:26.469 --> 03:12:26.479 align:start position:0%
think this is the step in the right
 
03:12:30.630 --> 03:12:30.640 align:start position:0%
direction we could study all we want
 
03:12:34.110 --> 03:12:34.120 align:start position:0%
and how long will it take is the thing
 
03:12:37.229 --> 03:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
so with that I will be supporting this
 
03:12:39.790 --> 03:12:39.800 align:start position:0%
and I just want to articulate that we
 
03:12:42.750 --> 03:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
are dealing with professionals and give
 
03:12:46.510 --> 03:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
that credit and respect thank you okay
 
03:12:46.520 --> 03:12:48.790 align:start position:0%
that credit and respect thank you okay
representative

03:12:48.790 --> 03:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:12:50.429 --> 03:12:50.439 align:start position:0%
thank you madam
 
03:12:53.190 --> 03:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
chair I just want to talk a little bit
 
03:12:55.910 --> 03:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
about we talk about Public Safety as we
 
03:12:55.920 --> 03:12:57.110 align:start position:0%
about we talk about Public Safety as we
go

03:12:57.110 --> 03:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
go
 
03:12:59.229 --> 03:12:59.239 align:start position:0%
forward and we've
 
03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
had a subcommittee meeting in one week
 
03:13:05.229 --> 03:13:05.239 align:start position:0%
to work on
 
03:13:09.229 --> 03:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
this this isn't an easy subject we heard
 
03:13:11.750 --> 03:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
from one of the schools that was here
 
03:13:13.389 --> 03:13:13.399 align:start position:0%
there's only two schools in the country
 
03:13:16.750 --> 03:13:16.760 align:start position:0%
that give clinical exp experience going
 
03:13:16.760 --> 03:13:18.469 align:start position:0%
that give clinical exp experience going
forward

03:13:18.469 --> 03:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
forward
 
03:13:19.990 --> 03:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the rul making
 
03:13:23.510 --> 03:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
procedure and that no optometrist is
 
03:13:26.710 --> 03:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
going to be able to come forward right
 
03:13:30.950 --> 03:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
away with the experience needed to do
 
03:13:30.960 --> 03:13:31.790 align:start position:0%
away with the experience needed to do
these

03:13:31.790 --> 03:13:31.800 align:start position:0%
these
 
03:13:35.110 --> 03:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
procedures I don't understand why we are
 
03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
pushing this through
 
03:13:40.269 --> 03:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
today and not doing the appropriate work
 
03:13:42.830 --> 03:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
and bringing these two groups together
 
03:13:44.630 --> 03:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
because I think there is some common
 
03:13:48.429 --> 03:13:48.439 align:start position:0%
ground on what procedures can be done
 
03:13:51.469 --> 03:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:54.349 --> 03:13:54.359 align:start position:0%
Manner and why we can't intrum study
 
03:13:57.590 --> 03:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
this because it's been said numerous
 
03:14:00.590 --> 03:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
times no optometrist is going out the
 
03:14:04.630 --> 03:14:04.640 align:start position:0%
door once this passes doing these
 
03:14:07.030 --> 03:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
procedures so for that reason I still
 
03:14:10.150 --> 03:14:10.160 align:start position:0%
will not vote for this hoping that we do
 
03:14:13.990 --> 03:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
the right thing do inum study really
 
03:14:16.190 --> 03:14:16.200 align:start position:0%
look at this see where the common ground
 
03:14:19.469 --> 03:14:19.479 align:start position:0%
is and not rush this through thank
 
03:14:23.429 --> 03:14:23.439 align:start position:0%
you Simon thank you madam chair just um
 
03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
appreciating uh the full debate of the
 
03:14:27.590 --> 03:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
committee as we head towards the vote I
 
03:14:30.910 --> 03:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
just want to refocus a little bit um and
 
03:14:32.870 --> 03:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody is thinking about
 
03:14:35.150 --> 03:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that the first vote will be on
 
03:14:37.150 --> 03:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
the amendment and whether or not you're
 
03:14:38.950 --> 03:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
for or against the underlying Bill if
 
03:14:42.269 --> 03:14:42.279 align:start position:0%
your concern is Public Safety you still
 
03:14:44.269 --> 03:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
want this amount this amendment so I
 
03:14:45.750 --> 03:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
don't want that to get lost in the
 
03:14:47.630 --> 03:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
shuffle of the debate of the underlying
 
03:14:50.790 --> 03:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
bill um this amendment certainly does
 
03:14:53.830 --> 03:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
improve the bill overall um regardless
 
03:14:55.590 --> 03:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
of your position so please keep that in
 
03:14:57.429 --> 03:14:57.439 align:start position:0%
consideration when you go to make your
 
03:15:01.429 --> 03:15:01.439 align:start position:0%
vote okay representative gold thank you
 
03:15:02.910 --> 03:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair I'd like to thank
 
03:15:04.710 --> 03:15:04.720 align:start position:0%
representative leus for his leadership
 
03:15:06.830 --> 03:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
on the subcommittee and all of the
 
03:15:08.630 --> 03:15:08.640 align:start position:0%
parties for coming to the meetings and
 
03:15:11.070 --> 03:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
sharing a lot of good information with
 
03:15:13.710 --> 03:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
us just like I talked about in terms of
 
03:15:15.309 --> 03:15:15.319 align:start position:0%
the Chicken and the Egg with the schools
 
03:15:17.030 --> 03:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
you can't expect schools to develop
 
03:15:19.830 --> 03:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
programs with live um results when it's
 
03:15:21.349 --> 03:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
illegal to do and when there's not a
 
03:15:22.990 --> 03:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
market for it because the states aren't
 
03:15:26.070 --> 03:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
allowing it to happen I would also say
 
03:15:29.269 --> 03:15:29.279 align:start position:0%
you can't expect a bill to come forward
 
03:15:31.269 --> 03:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
here that where all the rules and
 
03:15:33.150 --> 03:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
everything's been laid out when we
 
03:15:35.110 --> 03:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
haven't even passed a bill to allow the
 
03:15:37.870 --> 03:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
process to get started so again we're
 
03:15:40.349 --> 03:15:40.359 align:start position:0%
talking about a Chicken and the Egg and
 
03:15:42.229 --> 03:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
of course it'll be the Department of
 
03:15:44.349 --> 03:15:44.359 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services it'll that has
 
03:15:46.429 --> 03:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
to do with the medical technical
 
03:15:46.439 --> 03:15:47.429 align:start position:0%
to do with the medical technical
procedures

03:15:47.429 --> 03:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
03:15:49.309 --> 03:15:49.319 align:start position:0%
and I don't care how long we study it
 
03:15:50.990 --> 03:15:51.000 align:start position:0%
that's not what this committee's role is
 
03:15:52.309 --> 03:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
it goes beyond the scope of our
 
03:15:53.830 --> 03:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
committee to think we're going to get
 
03:15:56.229 --> 03:15:56.239 align:start position:0%
our head around what is the safety of
 
03:15:59.070 --> 03:15:59.080 align:start position:0%
medical practices but to get our head
 
03:16:01.670 --> 03:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
around how you set up licensing and how
 
03:16:04.510 --> 03:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
you set up that process of rulle making
 
03:16:06.389 --> 03:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
I think we've looked at this enough to
 
03:16:08.389 --> 03:16:08.399 align:start position:0%
be able to make that decision so I'll be
 
03:16:10.269 --> 03:16:10.279 align:start position:0%
supporting this amendment and I'll be
 
03:16:12.710 --> 03:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
supporting the underlying bill so that
 
03:16:15.750 --> 03:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
we can move ahead for the safety of
 
03:16:18.070 --> 03:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
patients so they can get into get
 
03:16:21.670 --> 03:16:21.680 align:start position:0%
surgery thank you I'd like to mention
 
03:16:24.990 --> 03:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
that the uh the governor has
 
03:16:27.870 --> 03:16:27.880 align:start position:0%
decided as of yesterday to get involved
 
03:16:30.670 --> 03:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
in this and he is encouraging the
 
03:16:32.870 --> 03:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
optometrists and the opthalmologists to
 
03:16:36.750 --> 03:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
work together uh if that were to happen
 
03:16:38.910 --> 03:16:38.920 align:start position:0%
and they come up with some revised
 
03:16:41.269 --> 03:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
language that is agreeable to both
 
03:16:44.830 --> 03:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
parties I have committed to putting it
 
03:16:46.870 --> 03:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
into a floor Amendment and bringing it
 
03:16:49.030 --> 03:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
to the house because we will be voting
 
03:16:50.389 --> 03:16:50.399 align:start position:0%
on this on the
 
03:16:54.910 --> 03:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
23rd If they don't agree come up to any
 
03:16:57.110 --> 03:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
agreement and they haven't yet because
 
03:16:59.870 --> 03:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
they haven't haven't yet met well we
 
03:17:02.150 --> 03:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
have to deal with what we have on
 
03:17:04.429 --> 03:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
hand but I just thought you should know
 
03:17:06.389 --> 03:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
that there is a possibility of a floor
 
03:17:08.670 --> 03:17:08.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment which I will be sharing with
 
03:17:10.590 --> 03:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
the committee prior as soon as I know
 
03:17:12.670 --> 03:17:12.680 align:start position:0%
what it
 
03:17:15.630 --> 03:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
is anyone else question to the chair yes
 
03:17:17.630 --> 03:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
sir so
 
03:17:19.389 --> 03:17:19.399 align:start position:0%
uh does that mean you're we are not
 
03:17:21.830 --> 03:17:21.840 align:start position:0%
going to proceed with a vote on this no
 
03:17:25.550 --> 03:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
no no no at this time or no sir it means
 
03:17:28.110 --> 03:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
that we are going to proceed with a vote
 
03:17:31.590 --> 03:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
on what we have I'm just warning you
 
03:17:34.150 --> 03:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
that the governor is meddling and if the
 
03:17:36.990 --> 03:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
optometrist and the optomologist happen
 
03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
to agree on something that they want to
 
03:17:41.670 --> 03:17:41.680 align:start position:0%
include in the bill I will be bringing
 
03:17:43.710 --> 03:17:43.720 align:start position:0%
it forth as a floor Amendment thank you
 
03:17:46.389 --> 03:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
for that clar they do not agree well
 
03:17:49.269 --> 03:17:49.279 align:start position:0%
that's where we are now but one never
 
03:17:50.750 --> 03:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
knows they
 
03:17:53.550 --> 03:17:53.560 align:start position:0%
might indeed one never
 
03:17:56.389 --> 03:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
knows anyone
 
03:17:59.429 --> 03:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
else okay the motion is to adopt
 
03:17:59.439 --> 03:18:00.950 align:start position:0%

Gould is there any you wish to speak to
 
03:19:05.630 --> 03:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:10.349 --> 03:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
the the concerns that uh we heard I
 
03:19:12.950 --> 03:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
think um were in my view addressed by
 
03:19:14.510 --> 03:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
this amendment at least to get the
 
03:19:16.229 --> 03:19:16.239 align:start position:0%
process in place uh the only thing I'll
 
03:19:19.750 --> 03:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
say again is is that um you know there
 
03:19:22.710 --> 03:19:22.720 align:start position:0%
it is setting in place an ongoing
 
03:19:24.229 --> 03:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
collaborative agreement which I'm sure
 
03:19:28.950 --> 03:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
the ru making will be and um you know I
 
03:19:32.269 --> 03:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
don't in in considering interim study I
 
03:19:32.279 --> 03:19:33.150 align:start position:0%
don't in in considering interim study I
don't

03:19:33.150 --> 03:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:19:37.070 --> 03:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
know what else we would want to do here
 
03:19:39.389 --> 03:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
um you know as as representative Brown
 
03:19:41.950 --> 03:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
uh said you know we're not qualified to
 
03:19:43.950 --> 03:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
get into the exact details that the rul
 
03:19:45.269 --> 03:19:45.279 align:start position:0%
making would involve unless we're all
 
03:19:47.550 --> 03:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
going to go to medical school first
 
03:19:50.110 --> 03:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
and I believe that's true also of HHS I
 
03:19:51.750 --> 03:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know if there's any
 
03:19:53.469 --> 03:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists on there maybe there are
 
03:19:54.870 --> 03:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
but certainly most of the committee is
 
03:19:58.189 --> 03:19:58.199 align:start position:0%
not that or MDS and so there's going to
 
03:20:01.309 --> 03:20:01.319 align:start position:0%
have to be a lot of drawn out discussion
 
03:20:03.550 --> 03:20:03.560 align:start position:0%
on the particular procedures what are
 
03:20:05.349 --> 03:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
their training requirements what are
 
03:20:06.790 --> 03:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
going to be the requirements for the
 
03:20:09.870 --> 03:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
number of live uh you know clinical
 
03:20:11.910 --> 03:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
practice uh procedures and all that sort
 
03:20:13.830 --> 03:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
of thing and I don't think an interim
 
03:20:15.189 --> 03:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
study that's something that this
 
03:20:17.590 --> 03:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
committee could do or any Committee in
 
03:20:21.389 --> 03:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
the house could do so um I'm I ask
 
03:20:24.550 --> 03:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
people to support um passing this uh
 
03:20:28.550 --> 03:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:28.560 --> 03:20:31.349 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:20:31.349 --> 03:20:31.359 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:20:36.590 --> 03:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
and unless the second person needs
 
03:20:38.990 --> 03:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
to thank you this has been going on too
 
03:20:40.790 --> 03:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
long represent do you wish to speak to
 
03:20:43.309 --> 03:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
your second uh thank you madam chair no
 
03:20:45.590 --> 03:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
I think um representative Le has said it
 
03:20:48.710 --> 03:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
well okay representative Dolan and then
 
03:20:53.229 --> 03:20:53.239 align:start position:0%
man py thank you madam chair um my my
 
03:20:55.950 --> 03:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts are that with an abundance of
 
03:20:59.070 --> 03:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
caution and Public Safety in mind with
 
03:20:59.080 --> 03:21:00.070 align:start position:0%
caution and Public Safety in mind with
eye

03:21:00.070 --> 03:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
eye
 
03:21:03.269 --> 03:21:03.279 align:start position:0%
surgery I'm in favor of restricting
 
03:21:06.670 --> 03:21:06.680 align:start position:0%
these expert surgical procedures to only
 
03:21:06.680 --> 03:21:07.990 align:start position:0%
these expert surgical procedures to only
qualified

03:21:07.990 --> 03:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
qualified
 
03:21:09.830 --> 03:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists and therefore I will not
 
03:21:13.070 --> 03:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:17.469 --> 03:21:17.479 align:start position:0%
440 VY thank you madam chair I would
 
03:21:21.710 --> 03:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
support on uh two assumptions one is
 
03:21:24.389 --> 03:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
that the ru making will happen at least
 
03:21:28.389 --> 03:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
we have set that in motion and also the
 
03:21:28.399 --> 03:21:29.830 align:start position:0%
we have set that in motion and also the
fact

03:21:29.830 --> 03:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
fact
 
03:21:33.150 --> 03:21:33.160 align:start position:0%
that if this is not you know it'll take
 
03:21:36.349 --> 03:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
a year or more for the rule making
 
03:21:41.229 --> 03:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
There's an opportunity next term to put
 
03:21:45.269 --> 03:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
another concise Bill to put more guard
 
03:21:48.389 --> 03:21:48.399 align:start position:0%
rails so at
 
03:21:50.870 --> 03:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
least get the ball
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
rolling so the collaborative effort can
 
03:21:57.750 --> 03:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
continue so with that in mind I would
 
03:22:00.990 --> 03:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
support the Bill thank you I'll be
 
03:22:04.269 --> 03:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
supporting the bill and I'll tell you I
 
03:22:05.710 --> 03:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
want to go over three things that I
 
03:22:08.870 --> 03:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
think are important number one our HHS
 
03:22:10.229 --> 03:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
colleagues did not come to the
 
03:22:13.189 --> 03:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
subcomittee meeting and that disappoints
 
03:22:15.750 --> 03:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
me because they should have been here
 
03:22:17.189 --> 03:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
and they didn't come
 
03:22:19.070 --> 03:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
because we had a robust conversation
 
03:22:20.910 --> 03:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
which which you know they could have
 
03:22:22.790 --> 03:22:22.800 align:start position:0%
helped with but they did
 
03:22:25.990 --> 03:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
not number
 
03:22:29.429 --> 03:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
two as the healthcare landscape the
 
03:22:33.349 --> 03:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:35.510 --> 03:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
changing there's going to be more and
 
03:22:38.229 --> 03:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
more of this happening where one
 
03:22:41.070 --> 03:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
profession versus another profession
 
03:22:43.070 --> 03:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
there's going to be an overlap of those
 
03:22:45.870 --> 03:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
professions we see it with nursing we
 
03:22:48.389 --> 03:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
see it with physician assistance we see
 
03:22:51.429 --> 03:22:51.439 align:start position:0%
it throughout the healthc care
 
03:22:54.150 --> 03:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
landscape this is part of
 
03:22:57.990 --> 03:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
that and that has to happen because
 
03:23:00.150 --> 03:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
there is a sweet spot within healthc
 
03:23:03.550 --> 03:23:03.560 align:start position:0%
care where someone is between 40 and 70
 
03:23:05.469 --> 03:23:05.479 align:start position:0%
right you're not chronically ill but
 
03:23:08.510 --> 03:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
you're getting older but that group of
 
03:23:09.710 --> 03:23:09.720 align:start position:0%
people is
 
03:23:12.710 --> 03:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
growing and that group of people has to
 
03:23:15.070 --> 03:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
be has to be given that health care
 
03:23:18.309 --> 03:23:18.319 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's for whatever reason
 
03:23:20.910 --> 03:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
whether it's less expensive to go to a
 
03:23:24.710 --> 03:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
mid to a lower to a midlevel
 
03:23:27.950 --> 03:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
provider there's many reasons
 
03:23:31.349 --> 03:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
Financial access is also access that's
 
03:23:33.870 --> 03:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
number three number two number three I
 
03:23:36.790 --> 03:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
really talk about myself but I spend 40
 
03:23:39.870 --> 03:23:39.880 align:start position:0%
years in business as a
 
03:23:42.670 --> 03:23:42.680 align:start position:0%
salesperson I can read a
 
03:23:45.269 --> 03:23:45.279 align:start position:0%
room and I can read
 
03:23:48.750 --> 03:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
people and and I am very good at
 
03:23:52.830 --> 03:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
negotiating and I can tell you that the
 
03:23:55.550 --> 03:23:55.560 align:start position:0%
lack of negotiation negotiation takes
 
03:23:55.560 --> 03:23:56.429 align:start position:0%
lack of negotiation negotiation takes
two

03:23:56.429 --> 03:23:56.439 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:24:00.830 --> 03:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
people two groups and really I'm
 
03:24:03.189 --> 03:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
disappointed in the negotiations that
 
03:24:05.750 --> 03:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
went on between the two of you I am very
 
03:24:09.269 --> 03:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
disappointed in that and I hope that
 
03:24:11.510 --> 03:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
within now and the next couple of weeks
 
03:24:13.349 --> 03:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
the two of you start talking and two of
 
03:24:15.030 --> 03:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
you I'm calling you groups I'm looking
 
03:24:17.150 --> 03:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
at individual people but I'm not this is
 
03:24:20.550 --> 03:24:20.560 align:start position:0%
not an individual thing it is important
 
03:24:22.469 --> 03:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
and if you choose not to not to
 
03:24:25.710 --> 03:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
negotiate or talk it's on you not on us
 
03:24:28.269 --> 03:24:28.279 align:start position:0%
that's not what we do we do what we're
 
03:24:31.870 --> 03:24:31.880 align:start position:0%
doing now this is what we do we set up
 
03:24:34.469 --> 03:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
Frameworks for people to get to work and
 
03:24:36.750 --> 03:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
if you can't figure that out and it
 
03:24:38.349 --> 03:24:38.359 align:start position:0%
can't be done in Ru making and it
 
03:24:40.269 --> 03:24:40.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't happen it won't
 
03:24:44.349 --> 03:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
happen but what we're saying is this is
 
03:24:46.870 --> 03:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
important so please
 
03:24:49.229 --> 03:24:49.239 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration thank
 
03:24:49.239 --> 03:24:52.030 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration thank
you

03:24:52.030 --> 03:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:24:55.189 --> 03:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair
 
03:24:58.510 --> 03:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
um listening to the debate during the
 
03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
amendment session and just kind of
 
03:25:03.309 --> 03:25:03.319 align:start position:0%
gauging where people were at and trying
 
03:25:05.189 --> 03:25:05.199 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to address uh the
 
03:25:07.710 --> 03:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
committee on on my thoughts on this bill
 
03:25:09.429 --> 03:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
um I've spent a lot of time talking with
 
03:25:11.389 --> 03:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
people on both sides of the issue and
 
03:25:13.150 --> 03:25:13.160 align:start position:0%
trying to get to the bottom of of where
 
03:25:15.389 --> 03:25:15.399 align:start position:0%
things are at I think uh and speaking
 
03:25:17.070 --> 03:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
privately with a lot of opthamologists
 
03:25:18.309 --> 03:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
and a lot of
 
03:25:21.309 --> 03:25:21.319 align:start position:0%
optometrists um I've kind of come to a
 
03:25:23.030 --> 03:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
few few
 
03:25:25.950 --> 03:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
conclusions one is that the title that
 
03:25:28.590 --> 03:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
somebody holds in and of itself does not
 
03:25:30.630 --> 03:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
make one one qualified to do something
 
03:25:33.790 --> 03:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
or not do something the title itself is
 
03:25:35.910 --> 03:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
connected to the level of training
 
03:25:38.710 --> 03:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
expertise experience that somebody has
 
03:25:41.229 --> 03:25:41.239 align:start position:0%
accumulated and that level of training
 
03:25:44.630 --> 03:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
expertise um and experience is directed
 
03:25:47.189 --> 03:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
towards a scope of practice
 
03:25:51.150 --> 03:25:51.160 align:start position:0%
um so in the case of an opthalmologist
 
03:25:52.910 --> 03:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
an opthalmologist has a scope of
 
03:25:55.469 --> 03:25:55.479 align:start position:0%
practice that far exceeds that of an
 
03:25:57.830 --> 03:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
optometrist and so their education far
 
03:25:59.269 --> 03:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
exceeds that of an
 
03:26:02.830 --> 03:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
optometrist um they do residency they do
 
03:26:05.550 --> 03:26:05.560 align:start position:0%
Fellowship um which allow them to expand
 
03:26:07.429 --> 03:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
on what it is that they want to
 
03:26:09.710 --> 03:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
practice now uh I've had this
 
03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
conversation with both sides uh when it
 
03:26:12.990 --> 03:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
comes to a fellowship was which is a
 
03:26:14.510 --> 03:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
specialty that an opthalmologist would
 
03:26:17.910 --> 03:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
go into um to my knowledge and nobody
 
03:26:19.830 --> 03:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
from the opthalmologist side has said
 
03:26:21.910 --> 03:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise in my conversations with them
 
03:26:23.630 --> 03:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
nobody goes into a fellowship for these
 
03:26:25.830 --> 03:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
procedures um they don't specialize in
 
03:26:27.550 --> 03:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
these procedures they specialize in
 
03:26:29.070 --> 03:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
other kinds of procedures that are much
 
03:26:32.349 --> 03:26:32.359 align:start position:0%
more complicated and complex um first
 
03:26:33.790 --> 03:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
off because I think it probably requires
 
03:26:35.790 --> 03:26:35.800 align:start position:0%
that to do it well secondly I'm sure
 
03:26:37.150 --> 03:26:37.160 align:start position:0%
money probably plays a role because
 
03:26:38.670 --> 03:26:38.680 align:start position:0%
we're human and that's just the way that
 
03:26:40.710 --> 03:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
that works that that would be motivating
 
03:26:45.110 --> 03:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
factor for me um residency yes they go
 
03:26:47.110 --> 03:26:47.120 align:start position:0%
through medical residency and it's very
 
03:26:48.910 --> 03:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
involved and it gives them a scope of
 
03:26:50.790 --> 03:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
practice far beyond the particular
 
03:26:54.189 --> 03:26:54.199 align:start position:0%
procedures that we're looking at um and
 
03:26:56.790 --> 03:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
so they're there for three or four years
 
03:26:58.389 --> 03:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
but that obviously in and of itself is
 
03:27:00.150 --> 03:27:00.160 align:start position:0%
not required for these specific
 
03:27:01.910 --> 03:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
procedures because the time spent goes
 
03:27:04.229 --> 03:27:04.239 align:start position:0%
well beyond these procedures so we're
 
03:27:06.030 --> 03:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
not making a comparison
 
03:27:08.229 --> 03:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
between what the opthamologists do for
 
03:27:10.349 --> 03:27:10.359 align:start position:0%
education and these particular
 
03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
procedures and whether or not
 
03:27:13.389 --> 03:27:13.399 align:start position:0%
optometrists can do the same thing in
 
03:27:15.550 --> 03:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
order to practice the these procedures
 
03:27:16.950 --> 03:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to do the entire time
 
03:27:19.389 --> 03:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
was drill down and find out what
 
03:27:21.510 --> 03:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
education and experience is actually
 
03:27:24.070 --> 03:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
required to do these particular
 
03:27:26.389 --> 03:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
procedures and I I will say to my
 
03:27:29.389 --> 03:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
disappointment I never got an answer to
 
03:27:31.830 --> 03:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
that from the people who were able to
 
03:27:33.910 --> 03:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
provide it I was never able to get to
 
03:27:35.910 --> 03:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
the end to the bottom of that now I
 
03:27:37.349 --> 03:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
would like to just because I followed
 
03:27:38.269 --> 03:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
the same train of thought as
 
03:27:39.950 --> 03:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative goalie uh we are in
 
03:27:41.910 --> 03:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
agreement on this point uh and I had a
 
03:27:43.070 --> 03:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
conversation with the gentleman from
 
03:27:45.510 --> 03:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
Kentucky and grilled him on it uh and he
 
03:27:47.750 --> 03:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
was uh actually pretty upset with the
 
03:27:49.110 --> 03:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
answer that he gave during committee
 
03:27:51.790 --> 03:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
that day I said yes it looked terrible
 
03:27:54.750 --> 03:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
um when he said uh well no there is no
 
03:27:56.429 --> 03:27:56.439 align:start position:0%
minimum but the answer that he followed
 
03:27:58.790 --> 03:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
up with was a good answer um and the
 
03:28:00.189 --> 03:28:00.199 align:start position:0%
answer to that question is there is no
 
03:28:01.790 --> 03:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
minimum because I believe according to
 
03:28:04.189 --> 03:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
representative Smith brought this up um
 
03:28:06.590 --> 03:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
there isn't a one- siiz fits all as far
 
03:28:08.150 --> 03:28:08.160 align:start position:0%
as how many procedures are done and
 
03:28:09.550 --> 03:28:09.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not a person is qualified or
 
03:28:11.910 --> 03:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
proficient in order to do the procedure
 
03:28:13.590 --> 03:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
right so you can throw five on there and
 
03:28:14.990 --> 03:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
five can be a minimum but that's not
 
03:28:15.830 --> 03:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
going to tell you whether or not
 
03:28:17.630 --> 03:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
somebody is proficient and therefore it
 
03:28:19.269 --> 03:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
cannot be the last step in the process
 
03:28:20.710 --> 03:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
of determining whether or not somebody
 
03:28:22.670 --> 03:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
is qualified in order to do one of these
 
03:28:24.990 --> 03:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
procedures so for somebody it might be
 
03:28:26.150 --> 03:28:26.160 align:start position:0%
five for somebody might be 10 for
 
03:28:28.389 --> 03:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
somebody it might be 20 so the second
 
03:28:31.510 --> 03:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
part of the of the process that's that's
 
03:28:34.110 --> 03:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
absolutely essential is to yes get those
 
03:28:37.070 --> 03:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
Min minimum procedures in but then put
 
03:28:39.110 --> 03:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
that person under somebody who is
 
03:28:41.070 --> 03:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
qualified who has been trained and can
 
03:28:43.189 --> 03:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
oversee the procedures to make sure that
 
03:28:44.750 --> 03:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
that person reaches a point of
 
03:28:47.189 --> 03:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
proficiency before released to practice
 
03:28:49.469 --> 03:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
on their own without that supervision
 
03:28:52.590 --> 03:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
that will be required in this
 
03:28:54.670 --> 03:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
legislation um that is completely
 
03:28:56.670 --> 03:28:56.680 align:start position:0%
essential to represent a Mana P's Point
 
03:28:58.349 --> 03:28:58.359 align:start position:0%
what I thought was was very very
 
03:29:00.269 --> 03:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
important this is going to be a slow
 
03:29:02.950 --> 03:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
moving process we're no optometrist is
 
03:29:04.349 --> 03:29:04.359 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do this for over a
 
03:29:06.870 --> 03:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
year well over a year um we're going to
 
03:29:08.229 --> 03:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
have to go through rules and then
 
03:29:10.630 --> 03:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
whatever is put into place those new
 
03:29:12.269 --> 03:29:12.279 align:start position:0%
requirements are going to have to be met
 
03:29:14.189 --> 03:29:14.199 align:start position:0%
so once again um to a comment that was
 
03:29:16.550 --> 03:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
made earlier uh yes no school at this
 
03:29:19.229 --> 03:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
particular point in time U provide all
 
03:29:21.550 --> 03:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
of the training uh for this scope of
 
03:29:24.870 --> 03:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
practice um and also uh my understanding
 
03:29:27.469 --> 03:29:27.479 align:start position:0%
is um that none of the states that have
 
03:29:31.110 --> 03:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
legalized it allow uh optometrist to
 
03:29:34.990 --> 03:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
practice it simply based on what they
 
03:29:36.630 --> 03:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
got out of their schools even if they
 
03:29:37.790 --> 03:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
went to one of the couple of schools
 
03:29:40.790 --> 03:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
that trained this way they also have had
 
03:29:42.670 --> 03:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
um obligations put in place that require
 
03:29:44.030 --> 03:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
them to work under somebody and have
 
03:29:45.790 --> 03:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
somebody sign off on their proficiency
 
03:29:48.429 --> 03:29:48.439 align:start position:0%
no nobody nobody in the state of New
 
03:29:49.950 --> 03:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will not be an exception to
 
03:29:52.229 --> 03:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
that nobody allows an optometrist to do
 
03:29:54.110 --> 03:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
this without going beyond the scope of
 
03:29:56.990 --> 03:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
just the education at the college level
 
03:29:59.670 --> 03:29:59.680 align:start position:0%
Nobody Does that everybody recognizes
 
03:30:01.990 --> 03:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
you're not 100% ready to do these they
 
03:30:04.189 --> 03:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
have been given a a foundation they've
 
03:30:06.110 --> 03:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
been given a framework and yes
 
03:30:08.389 --> 03:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
additional study is required beyond that
 
03:30:09.990 --> 03:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
in order for them to be able to practice
 
03:30:13.070 --> 03:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
and do these procedures but somewhere
 
03:30:14.910 --> 03:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps in the middle between an
 
03:30:17.309 --> 03:30:17.319 align:start position:0%
optometrist and an OP olist is a
 
03:30:19.469 --> 03:30:19.479 align:start position:0%
different space for which we don't at
 
03:30:22.110 --> 03:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
the moment have a title we don't call it
 
03:30:24.269 --> 03:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
something because it doesn't exist you
 
03:30:26.150 --> 03:30:26.160 align:start position:0%
either stop where an optometrist stop
 
03:30:28.630 --> 03:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
stops or you continue on to where an OP
 
03:30:31.070 --> 03:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
Opthomologist continues on to but that
 
03:30:32.389 --> 03:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
does not mean that there isn't a space
 
03:30:35.670 --> 03:30:35.680 align:start position:0%
in the Middle where we add educational
 
03:30:39.229 --> 03:30:39.239 align:start position:0%
requirements where we mandate that
 
03:30:41.189 --> 03:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
they I don't know what it will be
 
03:30:42.830 --> 03:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
another year worth of training whatever
 
03:30:44.710 --> 03:30:44.720 align:start position:0%
it is in order to be able to do these
 
03:30:46.670 --> 03:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
kind of from what I've been able to
 
03:30:48.670 --> 03:30:48.680 align:start position:0%
gather and somebody can clarify
 
03:30:50.670 --> 03:30:50.680 align:start position:0%
afterwards if necessary these
 
03:30:53.710 --> 03:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
intermediate procedures they are not at
 
03:30:57.870 --> 03:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
the far end of the of the scope of um
 
03:31:01.469 --> 03:31:01.479 align:start position:0%
comp complexity um and they are not at
 
03:31:03.110 --> 03:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
the lower level of an optometrist
 
03:31:05.389 --> 03:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
they're somewhere in the middle and can
 
03:31:06.950 --> 03:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
people get trained for that middle
 
03:31:08.630 --> 03:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
ground and what would we call them I
 
03:31:10.469 --> 03:31:10.479 align:start position:0%
don't know maybe they're optometrist
 
03:31:12.750 --> 03:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
with some sort of um additional
 
03:31:15.309 --> 03:31:15.319 align:start position:0%
credential tacked onto it you know that
 
03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
can be hashed out um but I don't think I
 
03:31:19.429 --> 03:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
finished my thought which is simply this
 
03:31:20.950 --> 03:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
I'll be watching rule making this is
 
03:31:22.710 --> 03:31:22.720 align:start position:0%
important and that's when the and that's
 
03:31:25.510 --> 03:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
when the people who know that part get
 
03:31:27.189 --> 03:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
involved as has been mentioned twice at
 
03:31:29.110 --> 03:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
this table already I believe we're doing
 
03:31:31.309 --> 03:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
what we do and I do think that actually
 
03:31:33.349 --> 03:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
what we do in the process has been done
 
03:31:35.590 --> 03:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
well uh I think that we've set this up
 
03:31:37.830 --> 03:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
well for success I think we've set this
 
03:31:39.870 --> 03:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
up well as far as what we can do for
 
03:31:41.990 --> 03:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
safety uh in accordance with what we do
 
03:31:44.750 --> 03:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
across the boards um that this is what
 
03:31:48.189 --> 03:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
we do if we feel or the opthalmologists
 
03:31:50.269 --> 03:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
feel or whoever can can bring it to our
 
03:31:51.830 --> 03:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
attention that whatever rules are being
 
03:31:54.510 --> 03:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
put in place the optometrist lie to us
 
03:31:56.950 --> 03:31:56.960 align:start position:0%
and they are trying to skirt under the
 
03:31:59.870 --> 03:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh the radar and you know do hack jobs
 
03:32:02.429 --> 03:32:02.439 align:start position:0%
of uh surgery on people and we look at
 
03:32:04.070 --> 03:32:04.080 align:start position:0%
the rules and like hey wait there is no
 
03:32:05.630 --> 03:32:05.640 align:start position:0%
way possible that that is going to meet
 
03:32:05.640 --> 03:32:06.510 align:start position:0%
way possible that that is going to meet
the

03:32:06.510 --> 03:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:32:08.990 --> 03:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
criteria anybody can bring me a repeal
 
03:32:11.429 --> 03:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
bill and I will put it in and we will
 
03:32:13.790 --> 03:32:13.800 align:start position:0%
got the right to do that but the fact of
 
03:32:15.189 --> 03:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
the matter is and I'll finish up with
 
03:32:17.070 --> 03:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
this Madam chair cuz talked a long time
 
03:32:18.750 --> 03:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
but if this were to go to interim study
 
03:32:20.550 --> 03:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
we would get no further
 
03:32:22.469 --> 03:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
information we would not be able to
 
03:32:24.910 --> 03:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
proceed forward any further than we do
 
03:32:27.870 --> 03:32:27.880 align:start position:0%
the only way I've asked I really have
 
03:32:29.269 --> 03:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
I've asked and I haven't gotten the
 
03:32:30.670 --> 03:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
information that I believe the members
 
03:32:32.830 --> 03:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
of this committee are looking for and
 
03:32:33.910 --> 03:32:33.920 align:start position:0%
yes it may have only been in this
 
03:32:35.710 --> 03:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
committee for a week but this has been
 
03:32:37.550 --> 03:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
going on all year long this information
 
03:32:38.990 --> 03:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
should have been readily available for
 
03:32:41.910 --> 03:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
us to just ask and get direct answers to
 
03:32:44.150 --> 03:32:44.160 align:start position:0%
those questions right away and and I've
 
03:32:45.950 --> 03:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
asked and I did not receive and what I
 
03:32:49.189 --> 03:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
did receive is in this amendment I was
 
03:32:50.950 --> 03:32:50.960 align:start position:0%
perfectly happy to play ball and and I
 
03:32:53.910 --> 03:32:53.920 align:start position:0%
didn't receive that by by pushing it on
 
03:32:56.429 --> 03:32:56.439 align:start position:0%
at least to Ru making and allowing the
 
03:32:58.269 --> 03:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
professionals to Hash it out on the
 
03:33:00.070 --> 03:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
technical level to see whether or not
 
03:33:02.429 --> 03:33:02.439 align:start position:0%
this is going to work that information
 
03:33:04.469 --> 03:33:04.479 align:start position:0%
will come out it will have to come out
 
03:33:07.429 --> 03:33:07.439 align:start position:0%
it has to come out and once it's out we
 
03:33:09.590 --> 03:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to react to that
 
03:33:11.750 --> 03:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
first through JL car and if not through
 
03:33:14.189 --> 03:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
JL car by bringing back legislation next
 
03:33:16.950 --> 03:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
year nobody wants to unqualified
 
03:33:18.870 --> 03:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
professionals practicing in the state of
 
03:33:20.990 --> 03:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire nobody wants to put
 
03:33:24.269 --> 03:33:24.279 align:start position:0%
individuals at risk and um and in order
 
03:33:25.510 --> 03:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
to figure that out Madam chair I think
 
03:33:27.389 --> 03:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
we need to push this bill forward and
 
03:33:29.110 --> 03:33:29.120 align:start position:0%
get that additional information en roll
 
03:33:31.870 --> 03:33:31.880 align:start position:0%
so I thank you for the committee's um
 
03:33:33.950 --> 03:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
patience with me as I laid all that out
 
03:33:35.070 --> 03:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
but I spent a lot of time talking to
 
03:33:37.950 --> 03:33:37.960 align:start position:0%
people representative goalie thank you
 
03:33:40.510 --> 03:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
madam chair and I'll be
 
03:33:46.150 --> 03:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
brief we've heard a couple of times now
 
03:33:48.790 --> 03:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
since we've had this amendment before us
 
03:33:50.269 --> 03:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
looking at these two
 
03:33:53.710 --> 03:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
groups asking them to continue to
 
03:33:56.389 --> 03:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
negotiate and come back with something
 
03:34:02.790 --> 03:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:05.750 --> 03:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
ready Madam chair that came from you and
 
03:34:07.189 --> 03:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
it came from the ranking member on my
 
03:34:08.590 --> 03:34:08.600 align:start position:0%
side of the
 
03:34:12.110 --> 03:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
aisle so I don't understand why we
 
03:34:15.950 --> 03:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
are going forward with this knowing that
 
03:34:18.469 --> 03:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
there's something else out there that
 
03:34:21.229 --> 03:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
could be made to make this bill
 
03:34:23.910 --> 03:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
better with these Within These two
 
03:34:27.349 --> 03:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
groups I've chaired many
 
03:34:29.750 --> 03:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittees in this house in my 24
 
03:34:29.760 --> 03:34:32.790 align:start position:0%
subcommittees in this house in my 24
years

03:34:32.790 --> 03:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:35.590 --> 03:34:35.600 align:start position:0%
here and the purpose of a subcommittee
 
03:34:37.910 --> 03:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
is to get the best product with the
 
03:34:41.110 --> 03:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
groups together not everybody wins not
 
03:34:41.120 --> 03:34:42.590 align:start position:0%
groups together not everybody wins not
everybody

03:34:42.590 --> 03:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
03:34:45.150 --> 03:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
loses getting a compromise between the
 
03:34:47.950 --> 03:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:49.309 --> 03:34:49.319 align:start position:0%
and if we have people sitting here at
 
03:34:51.030 --> 03:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
this table looking and telling you folks
 
03:34:55.870 --> 03:34:55.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:00.670 --> 03:35:00.680 align:start position:0%
out then the work hasn't been done
 
03:35:02.590 --> 03:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
completely and for me to vote on
 
03:35:05.309 --> 03:35:05.319 align:start position:0%
something that with work not done and
 
03:35:07.510 --> 03:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
saying we have time to figure this out
 
03:35:10.510 --> 03:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
in rules I I don't agree with and I I
 
03:35:12.469 --> 03:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
can't support this I've been around long
 
03:35:13.910 --> 03:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
enough me and representative Schmidt had
 
03:35:15.710 --> 03:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
this conversation last night on
 
03:35:17.950 --> 03:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work and I think one toour
 
03:35:20.469 --> 03:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on a bill this complex
 
03:35:22.389 --> 03:35:22.399 align:start position:0%
isn't enough with the short and I know
 
03:35:24.750 --> 03:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
we have a short time frame and it was
 
03:35:28.590 --> 03:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
what we had to work with but I think it
 
03:35:30.990 --> 03:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
could use a little more work and I would
 
03:35:32.790 --> 03:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
hope we would do that thank
 
03:35:36.990 --> 03:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
you okay that's that's your opinion
 
03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:40.510 align:start position:0%
you okay that's that's your opinion
representative

03:35:40.510 --> 03:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:43.150 --> 03:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
Schmidt so with
 
03:35:47.349 --> 03:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
the very strong vote that we just had on
 
03:35:50.990 --> 03:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment that that definitely
 
03:35:53.469 --> 03:35:53.479 align:start position:0%
strengthen the bill and I commend
 
03:35:56.229 --> 03:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
representative leut as I said before on
 
03:35:58.910 --> 03:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
the work he's put in and this amendment
 
03:36:01.349 --> 03:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
has definitely strengthened the bill and
 
03:36:03.910 --> 03:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
it's also made it less bad in some
 
03:36:08.309 --> 03:36:08.319 align:start position:0%
respects um same difference but um the
 
03:36:10.870 --> 03:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
one thing I think we should not do is
 
03:36:16.269 --> 03:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
have a unanimous a otpa vote because
 
03:36:19.429 --> 03:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
uh the house the house is going to go
 
03:36:24.110 --> 03:36:24.120 align:start position:0%
along uh with an unanimous vote and I
 
03:36:26.150 --> 03:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
don't think it I think representative
 
03:36:27.990 --> 03:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
Schmidt we're it's not going to be
 
03:36:30.550 --> 03:36:30.560 align:start position:0%
unanimous at least two people have
 
03:36:32.269 --> 03:36:32.279 align:start position:0%
clearly stated they are not going to
 
03:36:34.030 --> 03:36:34.040 align:start position:0%
vote for the bill and I'm going to be
 
03:36:36.150 --> 03:36:36.160 align:start position:0%
one of them thank you that makes it
 
03:36:36.160 --> 03:36:38.110 align:start position:0%
one of them thank you that makes it
four

03:36:38.110 --> 03:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
four
 
03:36:41.790 --> 03:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
okay and I will say that the I I am
 
03:36:44.110 --> 03:36:44.120 align:start position:0%
don't know that there is anything that
 
03:36:46.309 --> 03:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
could be added I'm simply saying the
 
03:36:48.870 --> 03:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
governor has asked if there is something
 
03:36:50.110 --> 03:36:50.120 align:start position:0%
that could be
 
03:36:54.070 --> 03:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
added um to your comment I'm not sure
 
03:36:56.910 --> 03:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
there is something but I will also
 
03:37:00.150 --> 03:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
mention that when they CA when it came
 
03:37:02.990 --> 03:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
to the public hearing the
 
03:37:06.070 --> 03:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
opthalmologists were all saying we get
 
03:37:08.510 --> 03:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
seven years of residency we're surgeons
 
03:37:10.990 --> 03:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
we know what we're doing and they were
 
03:37:13.269 --> 03:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
not dealing with
 
03:37:17.670 --> 03:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
the specifics of the procedures that the
 
03:37:19.950 --> 03:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
optometrist wanted to do they were
 
03:37:24.070 --> 03:37:24.080 align:start position:0%
simply saying a hard no and I think that
 
03:37:26.670 --> 03:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
if we pass this bill and start into rul
 
03:37:29.710 --> 03:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
making we will get the optomologist to
 
03:37:31.790 --> 03:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
actually look at what the requirements
 
03:37:34.630 --> 03:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
are in order to do these procedures
 
03:37:35.910 --> 03:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
safely and
 
03:37:38.229 --> 03:37:38.239 align:start position:0%
effectively and I would imagine they do
 
03:37:41.510 --> 03:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
not require 7 years of
 
03:37:44.110 --> 03:37:44.120 align:start position:0%
residency but that's my opinion we'll
 
03:37:45.990 --> 03:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
find out
 
03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:47.910 align:start position:0%
find out
anybody

03:37:47.910 --> 03:37:47.920 align:start position:0%

else okay in that case the motion is
 
03:37:53.309 --> 03:37:53.319 align:start position:0%

adding it to the um descendant Bill
 
06:19:33.910 --> 06:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
373 because the Senate chose not to pass
 
06:19:35.310 --> 06:19:35.320 align:start position:0%
um house bill
 
06:19:38.548 --> 06:19:38.558 align:start position:0%

06:19:40.868 --> 06:19:40.878 align:start position:0%

when
 
06:19:55.628 --> 06:19:55.638 align:start position:0%
1252 um yeah that's that's it does that
 
06:19:57.350 --> 06:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
and then uh has the committee take a
 
06:19:59.230 --> 06:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
look at what's going on with the
 
06:20:05.670 --> 06:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:08.270 --> 06:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
okay repres man py uh procedural
 
06:20:11.868 --> 06:20:11.878 align:start position:0%
question um Madam chair so now this
 
06:20:14.230 --> 06:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to go back to Senate
 
06:20:18.430 --> 06:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
correct oh it will go back to the Senate
 
06:20:20.788 --> 06:20:20.798 align:start position:0%
so if and they will be asked if they
 
06:20:23.590 --> 06:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
want to concur with the amendment or not
 
06:20:26.030 --> 06:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
they may choose to concur they may
 
06:20:27.948 --> 06:20:27.958 align:start position:0%
choose not to Concur and kill the whole
 
06:20:30.350 --> 06:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
bill or they may Concur and ask non-c
 
06:20:31.868 --> 06:20:31.878 align:start position:0%
Concur and ask for committee of
 
06:20:33.990 --> 06:20:34.000 align:start position:0%

06:20:36.270 --> 06:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
committee of conference will agree okay
 
06:20:36.280 --> 06:20:37.830 align:start position:0%
committee of conference will agree okay
thank

06:20:37.830 --> 06:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:20:41.310 --> 06:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
you okay represent Simon thank you madam
 
06:20:42.990 --> 06:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
chair in the spirit of trying to give
 
06:20:44.468 --> 06:20:44.478 align:start position:0%
representative g a couple seconds left
 
06:20:47.390 --> 06:20:47.400 align:start position:0%
to get back here um I can't support the
 
06:20:48.708 --> 06:20:48.718 align:start position:0%
amendment not because I'm opposed to the
 
06:20:50.628 --> 06:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
amendment I just don't see a path
 
06:20:53.390 --> 06:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
forward for it and if we send this over
 
06:20:55.708 --> 06:20:55.718 align:start position:0%
to the Senate side
 
06:20:57.708 --> 06:20:57.718 align:start position:0%
um I I just don't think that they're
 
06:20:59.030 --> 06:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
going to accept that they were pretty
 
06:21:00.910 --> 06:21:00.920 align:start position:0%
staunchly against it in the first place
 
06:21:04.190 --> 06:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
and I don't really want to have the
 
06:21:07.590 --> 06:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
underly Bill affected um by it or just
 
06:21:09.670 --> 06:21:09.680 align:start position:0%
really more likely adding another step
 
06:21:11.510 --> 06:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
to the process to arrive at the same
 
06:21:15.310 --> 06:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
conclusion so um so for that reason uh
 
06:21:16.910 --> 06:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
as much as it breaks my heart to not
 
06:21:19.190 --> 06:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
support representative gold I I will not
 
06:21:20.350 --> 06:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
be supporting the
 
06:21:23.310 --> 06:21:23.320 align:start position:0%
amendment all right any representative
 
06:21:26.230 --> 06:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
Schmidt well I'm glad to hear
 
06:21:28.868 --> 06:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
it I'm I'm glad to hear that because I
 
06:21:30.750 --> 06:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
think there's that they'll request a
 
06:21:33.990 --> 06:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
committee conference uh they'll come in
 
06:21:37.070 --> 06:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
our position will be the whole bill with
 
06:21:41.390 --> 06:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
the 1252 their their their counter will
 
06:21:45.310 --> 06:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
be drop it or the the whole thing goes
 
06:21:48.548 --> 06:21:48.558 align:start position:0%
down um and so I totally agree with the
 
06:21:51.468 --> 06:21:51.478 align:start position:0%
chair's remarks um and I would just
 
06:21:55.310 --> 06:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
counsel my colleagues uh to uh respect
 
06:21:59.270 --> 06:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we heard from um
 
06:22:01.750 --> 06:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
members of the Commission in before the
 
06:22:03.868 --> 06:22:03.878 align:start position:0%
Senate I was there and I heard them say
 
06:22:08.150 --> 06:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
it uh that this B this the the committee
 
06:22:11.510 --> 06:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
is is actually viewed by the commission
 
06:22:14.070 --> 06:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
as uh as
 
06:22:19.910 --> 06:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
a as as a salt in the gasoline sugar in
 
06:22:21.548 --> 06:22:21.558 align:start position:0%
the gas whatever you want to call it
 
06:22:23.788 --> 06:22:23.798 align:start position:0%
antithetical in other words I should
 
06:22:25.708 --> 06:22:25.718 align:start position:0%
have stuck with a big words for the
 
06:22:29.310 --> 06:22:29.320 align:start position:0%
first place uh antithetical to the
 
06:22:31.708 --> 06:22:31.718 align:start position:0%
commission that we already have that is
 
06:22:34.910 --> 06:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
functional if the they can get a a Forum
 
06:22:37.948 --> 06:22:37.958 align:start position:0%
back which is what the other bill that
 
06:22:37.958 --> 06:22:38.948 align:start position:0%
back which is what the other bill that
we

06:22:38.948 --> 06:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
we
 
06:22:43.310 --> 06:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
had had as an objective so uh in
 
06:22:46.070 --> 06:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
addition to the chair's very precient
 
06:22:49.670 --> 06:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
remark about no path forward it's it
 
06:22:52.590 --> 06:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's not a good idea in spite of
 
06:22:55.230 --> 06:22:55.240 align:start position:0%
the fact that it passed the committee
 
06:22:56.350 --> 06:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
but as I
 
06:23:00.270 --> 06:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
said 40 people were in the listening
 
06:23:03.948 --> 06:23:03.958 align:start position:0%
audience if you will and weighed in 38
 
06:23:07.548 --> 06:23:07.558 align:start position:0%
to2 against this bill against this text
 
06:23:09.390 --> 06:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
of this amendment
 
06:23:12.468 --> 06:23:12.478 align:start position:0%
so it's not really in the interest of
 
06:23:16.350 --> 06:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
the Native American commission thank
 
06:23:22.670 --> 06:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:25.628 --> 06:23:25.638 align:start position:0%
questions Brown thank you I I don't have
 
06:23:28.030 --> 06:23:28.040 align:start position:0%
my big binder with that original bill in
 
06:23:32.190 --> 06:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
it there can anyone enlighten me on what
 
06:23:34.948 --> 06:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
the concern there was some concern that
 
06:23:36.990 --> 06:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
there was inaccurate information passed
 
06:23:40.430 --> 06:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
around at the original hearing and I
 
06:23:42.310 --> 06:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
when we voted for this and I can't
 
06:23:44.430 --> 06:23:44.440 align:start position:0%
remember that if anyone I'm not asking
 
06:23:46.230 --> 06:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
you to say anyone it is inaccurate sorry
 
06:23:49.070 --> 06:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
about that but um if anyone can
 
06:23:50.910 --> 06:23:50.920 align:start position:0%
Enlighten my memory
 
06:23:53.510 --> 06:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
on why we decided to move ahead with
 
06:23:57.390 --> 06:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
this how's that representative G you you
 
06:24:01.548 --> 06:24:01.558 align:start position:0%
have an answer you said I I do um the
 
06:24:05.830 --> 06:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
concern had to do with
 
06:24:11.150 --> 06:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:14.628 --> 06:24:14.638 align:start position:0%
this oh no
 
06:24:17.670 --> 06:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
okay I'm incorrect what I thought was
 
06:24:20.750 --> 06:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
here is not in this bill so I take it
 
06:24:20.760 --> 06:24:23.310 align:start position:0%
here is not in this bill so I take it
back

06:24:23.310 --> 06:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:26.190 --> 06:24:26.200 align:start position:0%
sorry well part part of it I think was
 
06:24:30.430 --> 06:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
the the idea of of State recognition and
 
06:24:33.430 --> 06:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
what that implied because we aren't
 
06:24:35.390 --> 06:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
really sure what it does imply but it's
 
06:24:37.310 --> 06:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
different than Federal
 
06:24:40.548 --> 06:24:40.558 align:start position:0%
recognition thank you y represent laus
 
06:24:41.948 --> 06:24:41.958 align:start position:0%
yeah I believe on the state I mean
 
06:24:44.150 --> 06:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
there's repr G's back maybe she can
 
06:24:46.310 --> 06:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
answer better but my understanding is
 
06:24:49.350 --> 06:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
there are some uh federal law that will
 
06:24:52.350 --> 06:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
apply if there's State recognition so
 
06:24:53.590 --> 06:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
having the state recognition would
 
06:24:56.310 --> 06:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
affect that the other thing is um you
 
06:24:58.708 --> 06:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
know I take um represent Smith's
 
06:25:01.070 --> 06:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
comments about the commission
 
06:25:04.070 --> 06:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
but there's also I think some reason to
 
06:25:05.670 --> 06:25:05.680 align:start position:0%
believe believe that the commission had
 
06:25:08.030 --> 06:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
some functionality issues Beyond Quorum
 
06:25:10.670 --> 06:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
and so um you know I think part of the
 
06:25:13.830 --> 06:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
idea was to see if there might be some
 
06:25:15.590 --> 06:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
changes the commission either membership
 
06:25:18.350 --> 06:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
or their charge that might have um
 
06:25:21.190 --> 06:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
allowed it to work better and so I'm not
 
06:25:22.990 --> 06:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
surprised they were opposed but I don't
 
06:25:25.948 --> 06:25:25.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:29.190 --> 06:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
positive okay representative uh G and
 
06:25:32.030 --> 06:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
then M py thank you madam chair my
 
06:25:34.830 --> 06:25:34.840 align:start position:0%
apologies Glennon I took the best route
 
06:25:38.510 --> 06:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
the quickest we could to get here um
 
06:25:39.990 --> 06:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to speak a little more
 
06:25:41.910 --> 06:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
openly than I've spoken in the past I've
 
06:25:45.628 --> 06:25:45.638 align:start position:0%
worked really hard to be uh cooperative
 
06:25:48.430 --> 06:25:48.440 align:start position:0%
and um try to get through this process
 
06:25:51.510 --> 06:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
in the most productive way possible the
 
06:25:55.670 --> 06:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
reality is that as I stated earlier we
 
06:25:57.310 --> 06:25:57.320 align:start position:0%
were told that we had a representative
 
06:25:59.750 --> 06:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the commission working with us but
 
06:26:01.868 --> 06:26:01.878 align:start position:0%
then there was a change and the rest of
 
06:26:03.990 --> 06:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
the commission wouldn't honor what the
 
06:26:06.468 --> 06:26:06.478 align:start position:0%
Comm Mission member had agreed
 
06:26:10.110 --> 06:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
with there are many factors they're
 
06:26:13.110 --> 06:26:13.120 align:start position:0%
complicated but one factor I can tell
 
06:26:16.548 --> 06:26:16.558 align:start position:0%
you is that and it is a fact that a
 
06:26:19.190 --> 06:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago all of the
 
06:26:21.788 --> 06:26:21.798 align:start position:0%
recognized native all the Native
 
06:26:24.150 --> 06:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
Americans enrolled in recognized tribes
 
06:26:27.110 --> 06:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
both federal and state recognized tribes
 
06:26:30.788 --> 06:26:30.798 align:start position:0%
quit the commission at the same time in
 
06:26:33.430 --> 06:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
in a week's time and that's been a big
 
06:26:37.628 --> 06:26:37.638 align:start position:0%
part of what led to the loss of seats
 
06:26:39.990 --> 06:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
and as we all know the governor's office
 
06:26:43.948 --> 06:26:43.958 align:start position:0%
is very very slow to um to make those
 
06:26:45.990 --> 06:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
appointments to refill those
 
06:26:49.708 --> 06:26:49.718 align:start position:0%
seats of course I was blamed for those
 
06:26:51.590 --> 06:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
seats not getting filled which of course
 
06:26:53.350 --> 06:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
I had nothing to do with and I would
 
06:26:56.190 --> 06:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
only advocate for those seats to be
 
06:26:59.190 --> 06:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
filled I've advocated for the commission
 
06:27:02.150 --> 06:27:02.160 align:start position:0%
with representative Dolan's committee
 
06:27:04.830 --> 06:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
again I was blamed that that I was
 
06:27:08.628 --> 06:27:08.638 align:start position:0%
trying to kill it uh it's you know we
 
06:27:11.628 --> 06:27:11.638 align:start position:0%
cannot understand what the opposition is
 
06:27:15.150 --> 06:27:15.160 align:start position:0%
because we're not getting uh forthright
 
06:27:17.708 --> 06:27:17.718 align:start position:0%
honest answers we're not getting
 
06:27:19.750 --> 06:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
cooperation I reached out to the
 
06:27:21.548 --> 06:27:21.558 align:start position:0%
commission when I did the first bill on
 
06:27:23.548 --> 06:27:23.558 align:start position:0%
recognition and they were working with
 
06:27:27.190 --> 06:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
me until there was a a thing they wanted
 
06:27:29.788 --> 06:27:29.798 align:start position:0%
and I was trying to talk to them openly
 
06:27:31.750 --> 06:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
and honestly about why that would be a
 
06:27:34.788 --> 06:27:34.798 align:start position:0%
problem and they just quit talking to me
 
06:27:37.070 --> 06:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
so it's this lack of
 
06:27:40.070 --> 06:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
communication even when you try that's
 
06:27:44.150 --> 06:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
part of the the problems and uh the
 
06:27:47.390 --> 06:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
study committee is to give some
 
06:27:50.390 --> 06:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
legitimacy and Credence to the path to
 
06:27:53.190 --> 06:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
recognition and there are many reasons
 
06:27:55.708 --> 06:27:55.718 align:start position:0%
as has been said here why State
 
06:27:58.150 --> 06:27:58.160 align:start position:0%
recognition matters other people are
 
06:27:59.708 --> 06:27:59.718 align:start position:0%
entitled to hold a different opinion
 
06:28:01.350 --> 06:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't matter but it does
 
06:28:04.468 --> 06:28:04.478 align:start position:0%
matter and a quick example I'll give you
 
06:28:07.270 --> 06:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
is that 603 diversity just came out with
 
06:28:12.070 --> 06:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
a article totally dedicated or largely
 
06:28:14.230 --> 06:28:14.240 align:start position:0%
dedicated to the abanaki there's many
 
06:28:17.110 --> 06:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
articles in it one of them is my husband
 
06:28:19.150 --> 06:28:19.160 align:start position:0%
making his birch bark canoes under the
 
06:28:21.948 --> 06:28:21.958 align:start position:0%
birch bark article but there's another
 
06:28:23.230 --> 06:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
one written by the chair of the
 
06:28:25.708 --> 06:28:25.718 align:start position:0%
commission who is the one who opposed
 
06:28:28.468 --> 06:28:28.478 align:start position:0%
this bill where she talks
 
06:28:32.868 --> 06:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
about the abanaki and she talks about
 
06:28:34.990 --> 06:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
the Vermont tribe
 
06:28:38.430 --> 06:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
and then she talks about three groups in
 
06:28:40.390 --> 06:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who are not
 
06:28:42.868 --> 06:28:42.878 align:start position:0%
recognized so this is what we've been
 
06:28:44.948 --> 06:28:44.958 align:start position:0%
battling is that those of us who live in
 
06:28:47.270 --> 06:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who were not given a path
 
06:28:47.280 --> 06:28:48.110 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who were not given a path
to

06:28:48.110 --> 06:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:28:50.190 --> 06:28:50.200 align:start position:0%
become legal
 
06:28:52.910 --> 06:28:52.920 align:start position:0%
Indians under the federal law by
 
06:28:54.948 --> 06:28:54.958 align:start position:0%
enrolling in a recognized tribe as soon
 
06:28:58.070 --> 06:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
as Vermont recognized a tribe in order
 
06:28:59.990 --> 06:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
for any of us to sell our arts and
 
06:29:03.030 --> 06:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
crafts we would be illegal and so the
 
06:29:05.708 --> 06:29:05.718 align:start position:0%
only path to follow federal law was to
 
06:29:08.350 --> 06:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
enroll in a tribe and since that
 
06:29:12.430 --> 06:29:12.440 align:start position:0%
happened in 2011 we're now characterized
 
06:29:15.990 --> 06:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
as foreigners in our own state so these
 
06:29:18.430 --> 06:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
issues are complicated they can be very
 
06:29:21.230 --> 06:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
painful for some people they can be very
 
06:29:23.788 --> 06:29:23.798 align:start position:0%
threatening to some people who may not
 
06:29:26.670 --> 06:29:26.680 align:start position:0%
have the history and background to meet
 
06:29:29.070 --> 06:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
criteria but they then again they may
 
06:29:30.628 --> 06:29:30.638 align:start position:0%
have the history and background to meet
 
06:29:32.628 --> 06:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
the criteria and we won't know until we
 
06:29:35.788 --> 06:29:35.798 align:start position:0%
study it I think that's about all I want
 
06:29:40.030 --> 06:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
to say on it okay repres
 
06:29:42.350 --> 06:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
man I don't know if I can follow the
 
06:29:45.270 --> 06:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
suit with what you said my understanding
 
06:29:47.350 --> 06:29:47.360 align:start position:0%
was that the representation on the
 
06:29:50.468 --> 06:29:50.478 align:start position:0%
commission from all tribes was not equal
 
06:29:52.030 --> 06:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
or it was not
 
06:29:55.030 --> 06:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
represented and so
 
06:29:58.548 --> 06:29:58.558 align:start position:0%
that's that was just my simplistic mind
 
06:30:03.788 --> 06:30:03.798 align:start position:0%
understanding that unless all tribes are
 
06:30:08.190 --> 06:30:08.200 align:start position:0%
uh on at the table at on this commission
 
06:30:11.948 --> 06:30:11.958 align:start position:0%
it's really not a fruitful thing to do
 
06:30:14.628 --> 06:30:14.638 align:start position:0%
that that was my understanding I could
 
06:30:18.708 --> 06:30:18.718 align:start position:0%
be totally wrong but that was where I'm
 
06:30:20.948 --> 06:30:20.958 align:start position:0%
going anyone
 
06:30:23.910 --> 06:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
else yes thank you madam chair for
 
06:30:25.190 --> 06:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
allowing me to follow up there is one
 
06:30:29.350 --> 06:30:29.360 align:start position:0%
other piece I'll say and um my esteemed
 
06:30:32.990 --> 06:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
colleague to my left said to me on the
 
06:30:36.868 --> 06:30:36.878 align:start position:0%
way in uh just now we I really don't
 
06:30:38.190 --> 06:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
know enough
 
06:30:41.230 --> 06:30:41.240 align:start position:0%
about Native Affairs to really
 
06:30:44.150 --> 06:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
understand the issues and I said yes
 
06:30:47.708 --> 06:30:47.718 align:start position:0%
that's the problem and my husband is
 
06:30:50.350 --> 06:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
just astounded that the response to we
 
06:30:53.350 --> 06:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
don't know enough about it has been so
 
06:30:56.310 --> 06:30:56.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to kill studying it that it
 
06:30:58.430 --> 06:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
just is incongruent that the way we're
 
06:31:00.788 --> 06:31:00.798 align:start position:0%
going to learn about it is to work with
 
06:31:02.830 --> 06:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
the commission as a study committee gets
 
06:31:04.590 --> 06:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
formed invites the commission to come to
 
06:31:07.110 --> 06:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
the table everybody starts to hear open
 
06:31:09.910 --> 06:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
and honest communication
 
06:31:13.190 --> 06:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
happening then an understanding can grow
 
06:31:13.200 --> 06:31:16.590 align:start position:0%
happening then an understanding can grow
from

06:31:16.590 --> 06:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:19.628 --> 06:31:19.638 align:start position:0%

conference would we whoever that is
 
06:31:29.388 --> 06:31:29.398 align:start position:0%

didn't lose 373 I know you don't know I
 
06:31:33.230 --> 06:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
can't predict the future I don't know it
 
06:31:38.830 --> 06:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
would depend on what the Senate wanted
 
06:31:41.270 --> 06:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
and how strongly they wanted it and how
 
06:31:45.230 --> 06:31:45.240 align:start position:0%
strongly we want the other part
 
06:31:48.190 --> 06:31:48.200 align:start position:0%
okay could go either
 
06:31:51.670 --> 06:31:51.680 align:start position:0%

06:34:06.510 --> 06:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
really appreciated the Chairman's
 
06:34:09.110 --> 06:34:09.120 align:start position:0%

way but preserving air change is
 
06:34:19.070 --> 06:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
