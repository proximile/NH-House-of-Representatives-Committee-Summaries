hampshire our constitution says that the

responsibility for the creation of those
 
00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
districts is that of the legislature
 
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
the districts to be redrawn in new
 
00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%

information is more detail on belmont
 
00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:11.759 align:start position:0%
county from the house representative
 
00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
side it would be helpful for you to
 
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 align:start position:0%
comment on things that you might think
 
00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
are important for your district in
 
00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
belmont county but you can of course
 
00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
make comments on other districts also
 
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
we've done this event in every county
 
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:24.469 align:start position:0%
we've done this event in every county
and

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
my own nuggets the reason we're going
 
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
out to talk to people that live here is
 
00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
some towns naturally do business
 
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.909 align:start position:0%
some towns naturally do business
together

00:06:31.909 --> 00:06:31.919 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes like in my district without a
 
00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
four-wheel drive and eight inches of
 
00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
ground clearance you can't drive from
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
one to the other and stay in the county
 
00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 align:start position:0%
it's those nuggets that we can't get by
 
00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 align:start position:0%
looking at a map that we really want to
 
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:44.720 align:start position:0%
hear about
 
00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
there are sign up sheets for people who
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
want to talk microphone up here for you
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
to speak into and since we're recording
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's particularly important that you use
 
00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
the mic so the sound is picked up
 
00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%

strong majority of voters expressing

their preference

74 other towns in new hampshire has

similar resolutions
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
transparency and fairness are crucial
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
to restore voter confidence in our
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
election process
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
my view
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
of transparency and fairness is the
 
00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.510 align:start position:0%
of transparency and fairness is the
following

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
many hearings should be open for remote
 
00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
testimony via zoom or other technology
 
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:16.160 align:start position:0%
one-way streaming is not sufficient
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
forcing voters to come in
 
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
to indoor meetings restrict
 
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:21.029 align:start position:0%
to indoor meetings restrict

00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
and forces voters to choose between
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
their health and democratic
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
process i ask you to offer this option
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
craft maps should be available with
 
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
sufficient time for public review and
 
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:36.949 align:start position:0%
sufficient time for public review and
commentary

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
commentary
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
i want to see the math before your
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
community votes on them
 
00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
an independent non-partisan group of new
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.110 align:start position:0%
 
four

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.360 align:start position:0%
five towns within belmont county
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
qualify for their own separate
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
representatives according to their
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
constitution these towns are american
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
gilbert captain tilton and gilman
 
00:09:05.990 --> 00:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
i would respect the outcome of this
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
process to provide these towns with
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
their own representation not share those
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
other towns
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
my view of transparency and fairness is
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
the district should be competitive and
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
reflect communities of interest
 
00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
as a belmont exposure i expect the end
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
result of this process is that belmont
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
will continue to have two of their own
 
00:09:28.949 --> 00:09:28.959 align:start position:0%
state representatives
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
and continue to share our volatile
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
district with another town or city
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
at the belknap county resident
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
i would like to see less fragmentation
 
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
of our various building districts
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
don't have county is a small town and
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be powerful in so many
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
different districts
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
in the u.s conversational district
 
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
center harbor is part of district 2 and
 
00:09:54.389 --> 00:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
the rest of the county is part of
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
council three towns are in one district
 
00:10:02.069 --> 00:10:02.079 align:start position:0%
and the restaurant another
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
you have a choice ensuring democracy can
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
be done in a fair and open process
 
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
i hope you choose this option and avoid
 
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
the pitfalls and controversy that were
 
00:10:30.389 --> 00:10:30.399 align:start position:0%
associated with the process of 2011.
 
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:33.120 align:start position:0%
in closing thank you for listening
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
i look forward to the opportunity to
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
provide feedback on the draft maps and
 
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:38.240 align:start position:0%
another similar session and i hope you
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
will be sharing information about the
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
next steps in the process soon
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
next we have
 
00:10:52.160 --> 00:11:10.830 align:start position:0%
next we have
audio

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:10.840 align:start position:0%

good evening are members of the
 
00:11:16.389 --> 00:11:16.399 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee my name is
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
claudia ferber and i'm the new hampshire
 
00:11:20.069 --> 00:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
registered voter when you die from the
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
time of government
 
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
today i have questions from the canadian
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
and ask them to think about how the
 
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
district will affect my community
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
and ensure that voters and villains tend
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
to get their representation
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
first why doesn't the town family can
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
have an exclusive seat in the enhanced
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
staples of representatives
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
the constitution said the town of city
 
00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
must have a population of more than
 
00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:46.720 align:start position:0%
three thousand four hundred and
 
00:11:48.630 --> 00:11:48.640 align:start position:0%
forty-four people to have these students
 
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.310 align:start position:0%
forty-four people to have these students
succeed

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
succeed
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
wilmington meets this threshold
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
according to the 20-20 year census
 
00:11:58.470 --> 00:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
met this threshold in 2010
 
00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
because of the 2010 redistricting
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
elington and alton shared two seats from
 
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
the state house of representatives and
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
launched material seat when called team
 
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.150 align:start position:0%
launched material seat when called team
honestly

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
honestly
 
00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
did you know that killington kept the
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
war in carnival for 35 years
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
in march in 2021
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
asking for an exclusive seat
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
and a fair transparent and non-partisan
 
00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:25.200 align:start position:0%
redistricting process
 
00:12:27.509 --> 00:12:27.519 align:start position:0%
hopefully you read the letter the march
 
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
15 letter sentence different speaker
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
packard and senate president morris from
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
the town of gilmington's selectmen
 
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
who also serves as the new hampshire
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
state senate chaplain
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
vincent the academy and evan connell
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
the selectmen asked on behalf of the
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
hillington voters for an exclusive seat
 
00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
in a fair transparent and nonpartisan
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
redistricting process
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
and most importantly they emphasized
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
without gerrymandering
 
00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:00.160 align:start position:0%
why does billington share to see
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
metropolitan and run for tyrio's secret
 
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:04.240 align:start position:0%
final step
 
00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
other than sharing land owners
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
billington does not share any municipal
 
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.110 align:start position:0%
billington does not share any municipal
services

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
our tax base is quite different
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
one has to ask was this german mandarin
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
in billington did you know that we had
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
our own district in the past
 
00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
until the
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
until the end of the 1960s and then
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
again for a period in the 1970s
 
00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:32.720 align:start position:0%
at that time george b ross jr who
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
resides still in bennington represented
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
wilmington and served 14 years in the
 
00:13:39.389 --> 00:13:39.399 align:start position:0%
house and was speaker of the house from
 
00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
1975 to 1980.
 
00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
in 2010 as previously stated he district
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
and changed things hillington and alton
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
became one district sharing the two
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
house seats
 
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:53.600 align:start position:0%
and one cultural secret also in
 
00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.670 align:start position:0%
and one cultural secret also in
birmingham

00:13:55.670 --> 00:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
birmingham
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
and next we look at
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
why does belmont county have three new

belmont county in less than one hour
 
00:14:10.389 --> 00:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
currently belmont county has towns and
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
cities divided into three districts
 
00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:16.160 align:start position:0%
with towns and cities from grafton

stratford and merrimack counties
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
this does not make sense

gilmington is currently in district six
 
00:14:26.069 --> 00:14:26.079 align:start position:0%
and she is a new hampshire state senator
 
00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
with new durham farmington rochester

alton and boston
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
the only commonality is that often in

durham have a common land boundary
 
00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
i ask you as the committee to consider
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
my following request
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
redistrict so wilmington and alton each
 
00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
has an exclusive seat in the new
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire house of representatives
 
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:51.279 align:start position:0%
redistrict the new hampshire state
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
senate seat so that billington's
 
00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.550 align:start position:0%
senate seat so that billington's
representation

00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
is in a district with only towns within
 
00:14:59.350 --> 00:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
belmont county
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
and third scheduled public hearings
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%

redistricting now
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
my last request is to ensure that this
 
00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:10.150 align:start position:0%
my last request is to ensure that this

00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%

these 10-year lifespan

filmington has a very different place

all of us

since we must educate ourselves we can
 
00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
take pride in that purchase because it

is where our children are future

but the situation is this

with the same service of education
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%

average payer of shoes or a discount

that paid much less money

i feel differently about this situation
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
as a result of gilmanton and similarly

the policies of the state get taxes
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
so we are very likely to have different

views on this subject
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
it is a disease of the current political
 
00:20:41.909 --> 00:20:41.919 align:start position:0%
climate that we can look at something
 
00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:43.360 align:start position:0%

00:20:54.789 --> 00:20:54.799 align:start position:0%

after that
 
00:20:58.710 --> 00:20:58.720 align:start position:0%

i just like to make sure that the
 
00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee have a little
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
step back a little bit in history
 
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
when i first ran
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
in 2016
 
00:22:52.549 --> 00:22:52.559 align:start position:0%
there was no party primary
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
and there were two representatives from
 
00:22:55.679 --> 00:22:56.789 align:start position:0%
and there were two representatives from
meredith

00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
meredith
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
and two representatives from guilford
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
were elected and one of those
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
representatives from narrative became
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
00:23:06.549 --> 00:23:06.559 align:start position:0%
of the county delegation
 
00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
17 and 18 we had two for meredith and
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
two from gilbert
 
00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:18.400 align:start position:0%
the next biennium
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
the election was
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
from meredith and two from guilford
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
because i've grown fourth candidates
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
i don't recall whether there was a
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
partner primer and i wasn't involved in
 
00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
that right as i took time off
 
00:23:36.230 --> 00:23:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.029 --> 00:23:41.039 align:start position:0%
around the 2020 for the 2012 miami
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
we had the primary the party primary
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
and we ended up with
 
00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
three representatives from guilford and
 
00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
one for meredith although there was
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
there was a candidate from an additional
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
candidate for meredith who did not make
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
it past the primary
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
so over each biennium there's been a
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
back and forth
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
between two people from there or one
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
people from there whatever and back and
 
00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
i wasn't going to come to the meeting
 
00:24:14.789 --> 00:24:14.799 align:start position:0%
because i i trust
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
the members of this committee to do
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
their duty under the constitution
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:22.720 align:start position:0%
redistricting is and has been since the
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
beginning of our republic
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
a political matter
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
and is to be decided by the legislatures
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
and i'm assuming that you know your duty
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
and you will do today
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
that being said
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
uh i had been contacted by one person
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
from meredith
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
who was vehement that i needed to
 
00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:45.360 align:start position:0%
advocate that narrative should have its
 
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
own exclusive representative
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
and i indicated that i thought that the
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
committee would do its duty under the
 
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.830 align:start position:0%
committee would do its duty under the
constitution

00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
what however that works out with the
 
00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.830 align:start position:0%
what however that works out with the
redistricting

00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:58.549 align:start position:0%
redistricting
it

00:24:58.549 --> 00:24:58.559 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
so happens that while i live in
 
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.269 align:start position:0%
so happens that while i live in
guildford

00:25:01.269 --> 00:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
guildford
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
i do represent the people in narrative
 
00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
and i've carried the votes in narrative
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
several times
 
00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
i have been touched on a number of
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
occasions the town manager in narrative
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
and we have discussed
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
how to deal with the donor town issue on
 
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
school funding where meredith is a donor
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
town and doesn't like it so i'm trying
 
00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.549 align:start position:0%
town and doesn't like it so i'm trying
to

00:25:24.549 --> 00:25:24.559 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:25:24.559 --> 00:25:25.830 align:start position:0%
to
represent

00:25:25.830 --> 00:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
the people of both towns in my district
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
we have four reps i think they all do
 
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:31.909 align:start position:0%
we have four reps i think they all do
that

00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
i think that the multi-town districts
 
00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
are just a fact of life because of the
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
limitations of the number of reps we
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
have available
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
and i just urge you to
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
keep that in mind and do your duty as
 
00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
you see it under the constitution under
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
the court cases i don't see any problem
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
with multi-town districts uh belmont
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
county i think he's very well
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
represented and all the towns are well
 
00:26:00.870 --> 00:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:26.810 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:26.810 --> 00:26:32.070 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
good evening i want to thank
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
both the senate representatives and the
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
representatives from the house
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
very very important
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
and i'm very pleased that we're
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
able to
 
00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:53.120 align:start position:0%
share with you our concerns and our
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
hopes with regard to resistance
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
let me say at the outset i i am a county
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner i am not here as a county
 
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.510 align:start position:0%
commissioner i am not here as a county
professional

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:03.520 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
i'm here as a
 
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:12.420 align:start position:0%
i'm here as a
[Music]

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:12.430 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:25.290 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.290 --> 00:27:30.789 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:27:30.789 --> 00:27:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:33.029 --> 00:27:33.039 align:start position:0%
i think in this context
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
has two very important components
 
00:27:38.970 --> 00:27:38.980 align:start position:0%
one is
 
00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:41.909 align:start position:0%
one is
[Music]

00:27:41.909 --> 00:27:41.919 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.789 align:start position:0%
 
the vote

00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
the vote
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
major thing
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
i think is really reflecting
 
00:27:54.710 --> 00:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
a lot in the
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
way in which
 
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
our house of representatives has been
 
00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.830 align:start position:0%
our house of representatives has been
structured

00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
structured
 
00:28:02.389 --> 00:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
i mean 400 representatives stationed
 
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
well no
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
is unusual
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
and i think it does indicate a
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
commitment to localized representation
 
00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:15.890 align:start position:0%
to the extent that it can be basically
 
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.190 align:start position:0%
to the extent that it can be basically
[Music]

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:18.070 align:start position:0%
[Music]
and

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
divide 400 into the census number and
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
give them the magic number to be huge
 
00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
for guidance in instructing
 
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
the house districts
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
it's not a guarantee it's going to be
 
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.310 align:start position:0%
it's not a guarantee it's going to be
344

00:28:37.310 --> 00:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
344
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
344 across the board
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
the constitution itself will be supreme
 
00:28:45.669 --> 00:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
court cases indicate that reasonable
 
00:28:45.679 --> 00:28:47.830 align:start position:0%
court cases indicate that reasonable
aviation

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:47.840 align:start position:0%
aviation
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
is allowed
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
now let me make one suggestion about
 
00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
walnut county
 
00:28:56.230 --> 00:28:56.240 align:start position:0%
belmont county has the fewest
 
00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.990 align:start position:0%
belmont county has the fewest
municipalities

00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:00.960 align:start position:0%
of any county in the state
 
00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
one city and 10 towns
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
and 18 representatives
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
so you've got a little bit easier task
 
00:29:14.389 --> 00:29:14.399 align:start position:0%
to work on with regard to velvet county
 
00:29:14.399 --> 00:29:15.909 align:start position:0%
to work on with regard to velvet county
and

00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
i think the whole idea of condemnation
 
00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.750 align:start position:0%
i think the whole idea of condemnation
districts

00:29:21.750 --> 00:29:21.760 align:start position:0%

00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
is potentially
 
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.630 align:start position:0%
is potentially
dangerous

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:26.040 align:start position:0%
and let
 
00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:31.750 align:start position:0%
and let

in 2000
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
the legislature saw fit to create
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
district 5
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
in delhi county four towns
 
00:29:44.070 --> 00:29:44.080 align:start position:0%
seven representatives

population of the county
 
00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
now the idea of localized
 
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:57.510 align:start position:0%
now the idea of localized
representation

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:29:59.830 --> 00:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
so i got shocked with that
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
in 2008
 
00:30:04.230 --> 00:30:04.240 align:start position:0%

the current situation
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
i'm very sympathetic with the

position being taken by the people

if you look at

if you look at

belmont
 
00:30:58.630 --> 00:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
county if you look at uh alton
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at filmington and if you
 
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:04.640 align:start position:0%
look at barnsley all of them have the
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
magic number all over at three four four

four
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
however millington
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
is somewhat
 
00:31:15.110 --> 00:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
slightly over
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that you give serious
 
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.509 align:start position:0%
i would suggest that you give serious
thought

00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:25.519 align:start position:0%
thought
 
00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
to giving one seat
 
00:31:30.630 --> 00:31:30.640 align:start position:0%
to call them one seat
 
00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.990 align:start position:0%
to call them one seat
again

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
and a combination
 
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:37.830 align:start position:0%
and a combination
to

00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.669 align:start position:0%
to
barnstead

00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
barnstead
 
00:31:41.029 --> 00:31:41.039 align:start position:0%
and all
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
they do share in a hospital
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
they also share a superintendent of
 
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:47.190 align:start position:0%
they also share a superintendent of
schools

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
now tax structure is different
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
barnstead does not have frontage on
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
plate one of the sockets all i know
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
the kind of impact that they can make
 
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
on the tax structure
 
00:32:03.029 --> 00:32:03.039 align:start position:0%
but there is a commonality of interest
 
00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:04.470 align:start position:0%
but there is a commonality of interest
there

00:32:04.470 --> 00:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i think that that is fair to all
 
00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
concerns i mean i think that
 
00:32:14.549 --> 00:32:14.559 align:start position:0%
alton deserves a separate representative
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
barnstead deserves a separate
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative and gilbert who deserves
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
a separate representation
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
and certainly barnstead and all of them
 
00:32:26.470 --> 00:32:26.480 align:start position:0%
are in close proximity and they do have
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
the commonality of interest that i
 
00:32:28.399 --> 00:32:29.350 align:start position:0%
the commonality of interest that i
mentioned

00:32:29.350 --> 00:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
so to me that is a very clear solution
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
to redistricting in that area
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
now when it comes to guild
 
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:53.650 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:55.110 align:start position:0%

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
situation that i described earlier is
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
going to occur and we may end up with
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
four in the same town
 
00:33:01.919 --> 00:33:02.950 align:start position:0%
four in the same town
yet

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
but uh the
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
three to one is
 
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
in my
 
00:33:10.870 --> 00:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
mind and
 
00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.830 align:start position:0%
mind and
here

00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
quite clearly milford
 
00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:15.160 align:start position:0%
meets the threshold
 
00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:17.269 align:start position:0%
meets the threshold
[Music]

00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
america is
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
three percent on the threshold
 
00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:26.149 align:start position:0%
three percent on the threshold
yeah

00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
or two representatives
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
when they're minus the magic number by
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
three percent
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
i mean i think including them is a
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable deviation from the standard i
 
00:33:41.909 --> 00:33:41.919 align:start position:0%
would urge you to create
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
separate districts for the two
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
and give each one to two representatives
 
00:33:49.509 --> 00:33:49.519 align:start position:0%
that they deserve
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
now the other
 
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
suggestion that i would urge you to
 
00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.549 align:start position:0%
suggestion that i would urge you to
consider

00:33:54.549 --> 00:33:54.559 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
the city of laconia
 
00:33:59.430 --> 00:33:59.440 align:start position:0%
is two percent short
 
00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:02.240 align:start position:0%
of hitting the number of them just by
 
00:34:05.029 --> 00:34:05.039 align:start position:0%
five representatives
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
the city of laconia
 
00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:08.869 align:start position:0%
the city of laconia
is

00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
i think makes up 26
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
of the population of delta county
 
00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:16.960 align:start position:0%
and also
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
representatives would make up 26 of the
 
00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:21.109 align:start position:0%
representatives would make up 26 of the
delegation

00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
i mean that strikes me as a
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
pretty strong
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
argument in favor of giving laconia
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
an additional representative
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
and i would add to that
 
00:34:37.349 --> 00:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
laconia the city of latonia has got some
 
00:34:40.069 --> 00:34:40.079 align:start position:0%
issues some problems
 
00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:41.919 align:start position:0%
above and beyond
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
the issues of problems that
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
of the towns including my town
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important that laconia
 
00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.430 align:start position:0%
i think it's very important that laconia
have

00:34:51.430 --> 00:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
a strong
 
00:34:54.079 --> 00:34:55.990 align:start position:0%
a strong
viable

00:34:55.990 --> 00:34:56.000 align:start position:0%

00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
in concord
 
00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.510 align:start position:0%
in concord
and

00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
be given the full number of
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
representatives that could be reasonably
 
00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:05.910 align:start position:0%
representatives that could be reasonably
uh

00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
given and deleted by are called
 
00:35:12.069 --> 00:35:12.079 align:start position:0%
by the population situation
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
the other thing i would mention to you
 
00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:15.570 align:start position:0%
the other thing i would mention to you
is

00:35:15.570 --> 00:35:15.580 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:23.610 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh by about a couple of
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
uh census periods
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
i've shared representatives and have two
 
00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.790 align:start position:0%
i've shared representatives and have two
representatives

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh philippines clearly meets the
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%

yet
 
00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
and san martin is off the number by
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
about 12
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
so it's not quite the
 
00:35:56.069 --> 00:35:56.079 align:start position:0%
swipe deviation that i talked about
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
i i think if you if you really want to
 
00:36:09.750 --> 00:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
give a faith to localized representation
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a big leap
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
to give each of those towns their own
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
separate representatives
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
i hope i have not uh carried us too far
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
into the weeds i apologize for
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
the journey this sort of
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you again for the
 
00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
share the concerns and ideas with you
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
and i do hope after you come up with
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
your preliminary maps
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
i know that it's a burden for all of
 
00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:42.230 align:start position:0%
i know that it's a burden for all of
them

00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
but it would be very very nice for us to
 
00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:47.599 align:start position:0%
have the same opportunity to discuss
 
00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
those preliminary maps when they're
 
00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.589 align:start position:0%
those preliminary maps when they're
actually

00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
put together
 
00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:56.540 align:start position:0%
with that let me thank you again
 
00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:09.750 align:start position:0%
with that let me thank you again

just for the duration of my remarks um i
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
actually do some written testimony which
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
deals with a plan for redistributing
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
belmont county i'd get a very there is
 
00:37:55.030 --> 00:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
some fairly nice
 
00:37:57.270 --> 00:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
software that the committee has but it
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
is not to the best of my knowledge been
 
00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:01.839 align:start position:0%
available republic 10 years ago
 
00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:03.520 align:start position:0%
the software eventually was made
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
available probably was actually quite
 
00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
quite user friendly so that part of the
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:38:14.550 --> 00:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know whether
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
it is to me the 2020 software is
 
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
probably similar but it has not been
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
made public and uh of course also
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
freezing one first issue of these
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
meetings we're having to meet with no
 
00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
plan to comment on and it certainly
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
would be nice to have a hearing or some
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
sort of process
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
when when a plan is finally
 
00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
finally publicized for the public and
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
legislators to comment on john last time
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
last time the plan was presented right
 
00:38:41.910 --> 00:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
before the deadline for what they call
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
the retained bills
 
00:38:46.069 --> 00:38:46.079 align:start position:0%
and was basically presented as a
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
favorite favorite complete and he went
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
very long
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
session with the chairman of the
 
00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:51.829 align:start position:0%
session with the chairman of the
community

00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:38:54.150 --> 00:38:54.160 align:start position:0%
each of the districts um
 
00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:56.880 align:start position:0%
and then that was the end of the meeting
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
that was that was uh
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
mercy from enfield who actually he must
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
have done was not gerrymandering too
 
00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
badly because he actually lost his
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
re-election bid
 
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
first of all for the
 
00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
council of the district 2 is a bad joke
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
i think of the valinsky built because of
 
00:39:20.630 --> 00:39:20.640 align:start position:0%
a very high profile um
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
counselor who
 
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:23.839 align:start position:0%
represented us for most of the last 10
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
years he also called the van ostern bell
 
00:39:28.390 --> 00:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
for the warmington belt and there's
 
00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.150 align:start position:0%
for the warmington belt and there's
obviously

00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
no logical reason why statistics should
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
have been drawn that way
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
so i hope
 
00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
the committee will find a more
 
00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.790 align:start position:0%
the committee will find a more
reasonable

00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
reasonable plan there's a pretty good
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
one here in this handout from
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
the mapathon but that's for them to talk
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
about um
 
00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
the senate district if you take
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
um the nomad counties uh ten thousand
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
people over
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh what it takes to senate district so
 
00:39:57.030 --> 00:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
it'll be probably fairly simple to
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
take two towns totaling ten thousand
 
00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
of the district and then you have a nice
 
00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.790 align:start position:0%
of the district and then you have a nice
uh

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
when they still get this just the right
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
size um percent that throws off the
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:11.829 --> 00:40:11.839 align:start position:0%
that's how it goes probably done very
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
simply just eyeballing it by uh putting
 
00:40:14.319 --> 00:40:15.190 align:start position:0%
simply just eyeballing it by uh putting
leaving

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
alternate bar instead of the district
 
00:40:18.309 --> 00:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
exchange where they are down and putting
 
00:40:20.309 --> 00:40:20.319 align:start position:0%
wrestling counting or anticipated so
 
00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
that's actually really simple i don't
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
worry the effects coping on all the
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
other districts
 
00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.069 align:start position:0%
other districts
so

00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
my main objective current plan on our
 
00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
state constitution specifies that state
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
representative suffered continuous the
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
current plan was put together in 2012 as
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
others have accommodated includes a
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
district which fails to meet even that
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
simple requirement
 
00:40:44.630 --> 00:40:44.640 align:start position:0%
go for the emeritus foundation way out
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
in middle lakeland
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
yet as
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
as you know they're in one state rep
 
00:40:51.109 --> 00:40:51.119 align:start position:0%
district so
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
that doesn't meet down i don't think
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
that really meets any rational
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
definition of contiguous we have a
 
00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
similar situation in
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
stratford county we have two districts
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
which means
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
deep in the woods and actually one of
 
00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
the two towns is
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
utero which borders uh
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
down that county
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
and uh yes theoretically actually
 
00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
theoretically the law doesn't actually
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
prohibit us from drawing the state up
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
just to the county lines but that's a
 
00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:19.920 align:start position:0%
very bad idea because the state
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
represents the beach county are also the
 
00:41:23.130 --> 00:41:23.140 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies
 
00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.349 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies
[Music]

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:26.800 align:start position:0%
which is something all the reps know and
 
00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.829 align:start position:0%
which is something all the reps know and
probably

00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
probably
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
um so anyway so definitely that district
 
00:41:31.910 --> 00:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
that should never have been drawn that
 
00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:32.300 align:start position:0%
that should never have been drawn that
way

00:41:32.300 --> 00:41:32.310 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:33.430 align:start position:0%

article 11 part 7 the same one which
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
specifies the constitution also states
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
in part with the population of the town
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
reward according to the last federal
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
census has been a reasonable deviation
 
00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
of the ideal population for one of our
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
representatives the town reward shall
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
have its own district of one or more
 
00:41:52.309 --> 00:41:52.319 align:start position:0%
representative seats and that i'm not
 
00:41:53.349 --> 00:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
going to be the whole thing and then it
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
goes on about
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
and they'll put excess populations by
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
three at large or for ontario districts
 
00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
conforming to acceptable deviations
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
so we meet legislation as we the
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
legislators we decide whether it's
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable acceptable
 
00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:09.680 align:start position:0%
we do have to take federal voting rights
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
law into account include the principle
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
of one person one vote
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
now in 2012 the political decision was
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
made it was actually
 
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
i was around i was in the legislatures
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
kind of unclear exactly who made it but
 
00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
someone made the decision
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
that they could vary by more than 10
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
which is plus or minus five percent and
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
that was uh supposedly justified by
 
00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
something voting rights along which is
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
actually now obsolete it was a
 
00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
it was a safe harbor provision for
 
00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:39.910 align:start position:0%
it was a safe harbor provision for
districts

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:42:43.030 --> 00:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
um petitions for basically for majority
 
00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
minority district districts have a large
 
00:42:47.349 --> 00:42:47.359 align:start position:0%
number of racial minorities
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has i think
 
00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:50.309 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has i think
no

00:42:50.309 --> 00:42:50.319 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
majority of minority districts um i
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
guess it would be possible to draw one
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
in manchester or nassau but not the work
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%

more than that um
 
00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:14.069 align:start position:0%
more than that um
uh

00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
since we hit we're a small state with a
 
00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
large legislature and i was kind of
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
horrified by making even larger i think
 
00:43:23.190 --> 00:43:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's already um almost unworthy and
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
large as it is and certainly we had a
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
hard time recovering from the pandemic
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
just because of the large number of
 
00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
members we have made things more
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
difficult than smaller bodies such as
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
the state senator most other
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
state legislation
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
um also state regime districts
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
because traditionally they can't cross
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
county lines that certainly not advise
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
you to start across the county lines
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
it's just going to create more problems
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
and we're down the city where it's can't
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
be split into
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
now an extra neighborhood vermont is
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
also a small state with a
 
00:43:55.270 --> 00:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
large legislature in fact um
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's about the same ratio of residents
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
to state reps over there as it is on our
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
side of connecticut river
 
00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
they got away 10 years ago the plan
 
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
where state draft cities varied by 20
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
plus and minus ten even though they have
 
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
fewer restrictions
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
you can split towns vermont but for my
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
legislation allowed to split towns in
 
00:44:15.990 --> 00:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
two which
 
00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:18.640 align:start position:0%
you guys um can't
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
anyway first part of the joint
 
00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:33.230 align:start position:0%
anyway first part of the joint

18.498 representatives out of four
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
hundredths um
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
they actually one time in new hampshire
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
needs to deal with that problem by
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
having talents only have representatives
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
part of the ten year cycle but that's
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
not allowed anymore
 
00:44:50.069 --> 00:44:50.079 align:start position:0%
on the other hand we don't have to worry
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
about the ward boundaries it's just a
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
rather small city
 
00:44:55.589 --> 00:44:55.599 align:start position:0%
it's just barely big enough for five
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
representatives but has six wards so
 
00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
there's really not
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
many supposed values some things you can
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
splitting it apart and sticking with
 
00:45:07.510 --> 00:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
other channels to make the numbers work
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
better but you know there's very there's
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
you know basically it's pretty easy
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
just give the county a five district to
 
00:45:18.069 --> 00:45:18.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
and i created the plan
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
actually if we have 18 reps actually
 
00:45:22.950 --> 00:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
that our new number is not three
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
thousand four hundred and forty floors

for the lean ideal ratio meredith if you
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
have two reps it's three point three
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
percent below the rational
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm not the person that saved it you
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
give it a five year district two percent
 
00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.910 align:start position:0%
give it a five year district two percent

[Music]
 
00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:04.720 align:start position:0%
if you give it two reps the deviation is
 
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:06.630 align:start position:0%
if you give it two reps the deviation is
11.8

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:06.640 align:start position:0%
11.8
 
00:46:08.950 --> 00:46:08.960 align:start position:0%
and that was probably why meredith and
 
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:10.319 align:start position:0%
joshua were put together to make the
 
00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
numbers work better
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
belmont would get two drafts of plus six
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
um sanfordton is a big problem because
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's uh it shares a long long slight
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
land boundary with uh
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
with new hampton but there's only only
 
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
roads that connectivity number three and
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
the interstate so i stuck it in until 10
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
and then it gives you two reps and it's
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
one point four percent over the ideal
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
ratio you'll pretend i gave it one rep
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
fourteen point five three percent over
 
00:46:38.710 --> 00:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
the ratio and
 
00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
finally i did stick alton and barnstead
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
together the three rep district which of
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
course you could have
 
00:46:45.030 --> 00:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't want to have one for
 
00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:46.880 align:start position:0%
each town and then the florida and that
 
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:49.000 align:start position:0%
would be some other deviation but it's
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
4.6 so that's
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
that plan um
 
00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:54.640 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's probably not the
 
00:46:55.589 --> 00:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
plan that's
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily the only good plan
 
00:47:00.150 --> 00:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
or ideal plan but
 
00:47:02.550 --> 00:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
um it would pass muster with with the
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%

10 years ago so that plus or minus 5
 
00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.710 align:start position:0%
10 years ago so that plus or minus 5
basically

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
didn't even apply 10 years ago 20 years
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
ago applies even less now you
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
don't have to
 
00:47:22.549 --> 00:47:22.559 align:start position:0%
other considerations
 
00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
you are allowed to consider those and of

we are legally allowed to do it because

the last in the last cycle of
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
representatives that we can only look at
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
the numbers and we can ignore everything
 
00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:40.100 align:start position:0%
the numbers and we can ignore everything
else

00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:40.110 align:start position:0%

and the other thing is like other things
 
00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
i'd like to tell you i told you this is
 
00:47:52.549 --> 00:47:52.559 align:start position:0%
traffic county as i hope
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
first of all it would be nice to have
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
some sort of here or some type of
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
process where
 
00:47:58.630 --> 00:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
you can actually comment
 
00:47:58.640 --> 00:47:59.750 align:start position:0%
you can actually comment
formally

00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
formally
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%

registered committee's

hearings with the representatives on the
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%

committee so i hope i hope we can do
that

00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
somebody people are probably aren't
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
drawing up plans because the software
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
has been as i know it has been obtained
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
people have been working on it that no
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
plans have been publicized
 
00:48:24.309 --> 00:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
i also can get a little bit earlier like
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:48:27.030 --> 00:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
we were only a few weeks before the
 
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
final deadline and that's
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's not so much a big problem
 
00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:32.839 align:start position:0%
for state reps but some of us were
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
probably baffled by the state senate
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
candidates executive council candidates
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
last time they had no idea where the
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
district lines were going to be drawn a
 
00:48:43.190 --> 00:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
lot were drawn in places very different
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
from where they've been in the previous
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
10-year cycle and probably different
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
certainly in district 2 adopted anybody
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
i doubt that anybody was really
 
00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
expecting them to draw a little about
 
00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
one or two times wide all the way across
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
the state from pinchatella to ramos that
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
was probably a total surprise
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
everyone who wasn't
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
everybody except the people who actually
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
drew up the plans so i'd like i think
 
00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
it'd be fair to get just done a little
 
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
bit earlier
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
and also uh
 
00:49:11.589 --> 00:49:11.599 align:start position:0%
there's probably going to be legal
 
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
challenges with any plan we draw and i
 
00:49:16.230 --> 00:49:16.240 align:start position:0%
know we hate lust and we think it's a
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
terrible thing that law says but there's
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
going to be some and it might be
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
it might be a good idea to give those a
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
little bit more time to play out so now
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things the federal court
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
decisions was because with plus and
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
minus 5 they
 
00:49:32.710 --> 00:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
the as i recall they expressed some
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
doubt about whether they thought that
 
00:49:35.829 --> 00:49:35.839 align:start position:0%
was unnecessarily restrictive but there
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
wasn't really time to
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
fight that particular issue out and
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
there was um
 
00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
it was within our curve you decide what
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
was reasonable so basically
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
they disoriented they thought we made an
 
00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.870 align:start position:0%
they disoriented they thought we made an
unreasonable

00:49:48.870 --> 00:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
unreasonable
 
00:49:49.990 --> 00:49:50.000 align:start position:0%
determination where the reasonable
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
deviation was so that's uh
 
00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
so anyway that's why we say good luck
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
with the plan it's a pretty it's a
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
pretty difficult task and no one's going
 
00:49:58.630 --> 00:49:58.640 align:start position:0%
to be pleased with the result no matter
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
i hope you do a better job than we did
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
10 years ago which was not
 
00:50:08.069 --> 00:50:08.079 align:start position:0%
you know pretty ugly so hopefully better
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
this time
 
00:50:10.079 --> 00:50:12.350 align:start position:0%
this time
thanks

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:12.360 align:start position:0%

by providing my credentials as an expert

all 70 of my summers in the lakes region
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
working hart's turkey farm in the 1960s

in the

where we raised our family

of course my little girl cousins still
 
00:51:12.549 --> 00:51:12.559 align:start position:0%
call me the connecticut cousin because
 
00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
my father was from connecticut and that

my work
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
and volunteer activities have brought me
 
00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
to most of the towns in the lakes region
 
00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:28.720 align:start position:0%
i know this area
 
00:51:31.030 --> 00:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
very well
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
my local knowledge is pertinent because
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
decisions are being made that affect the

rights of our citizens

the lines which are drawn connecting
 
00:51:41.430 --> 00:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
communities need to be executed with a
 
00:51:43.190 --> 00:51:43.200 align:start position:0%
clear understanding
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
of local conditions
 
00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:47.280 align:start position:0%
from europe
 
00:51:50.069 --> 00:51:50.079 align:start position:0%
all new england seems the same and the

difference between rhode island and
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
vermont are all invisible
 
00:51:56.549 --> 00:51:56.559 align:start position:0%
the entire lakes region may seem the
 
00:51:58.710 --> 00:51:58.720 align:start position:0%
same from outside the region
 
00:52:00.630 --> 00:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
but it's not
 
00:52:02.549 --> 00:52:02.559 align:start position:0%
the beauty and intent of new hampshire's
 
00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:04.720 align:start position:0%
massive house of representatives
 
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:08.000 align:start position:0%

position
 
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
when communities who do not share common
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
interests and girls are combined into
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
one legislative district as with
 
00:52:21.030 --> 00:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
meredith milford
 
00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
both communities are disenfranchised
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
and i know that that is neither the
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
intent nor the purpose of this

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
although american gilbert may appear
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
similar from afar and share common
 
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:36.559 align:start position:0%
boundaries some are inevitable from

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
they are unrelated in all the important

they are unrelated in all the important
ways

00:52:42.549 --> 00:52:42.559 align:start position:0%
ways
 
00:52:43.829 --> 00:52:43.839 align:start position:0%
when meredith had his own
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
representatives they were known in the
 
00:52:45.359 --> 00:52:46.549 align:start position:0%
representatives they were known in the
community

00:52:46.549 --> 00:52:46.559 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
we would run into them at the dump the
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
post office and the borrowed hearts
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
they shot at the local stores
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
new kids at the local schools belonged
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
to the local service clubs
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
they were part of the community
 
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that's true for guilford too
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
although i don't know because even
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
though i have friends in real time
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
and have done business in guilford
 
00:53:13.829 --> 00:53:13.839 align:start position:0%
i don't see how they
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
and that is the problem of the current
 
00:53:15.599 --> 00:53:17.349 align:start position:0%
and that is the problem of the current
configuration

00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:17.359 align:start position:0%
configuration
 
00:53:19.670 --> 00:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
the geography which includes lakes and
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
mountains affects the travel problems
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
and there's no natural connection

between meredith and guilford
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
none although that location in the
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%

00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%

00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
right now meredith is underrepresented
 
00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:48.640 align:start position:0%
but the same could happen to guildford
 
00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
and it's interesting because i
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
understand we have
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
somebody from guilford who's
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
representing meredith who spoke earlier
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
and i had i got him i was on the
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
elevator with him i asked him to put a
 
00:54:00.790 --> 00:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
mask on actually we didn't
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
but i had no idea who he was and i am an

late surgery
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
so i encourage you to repair this
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%

arrangement of voting districts which

in 2011
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
decisions were made by three politicians
 
00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
and held in secret behind closed doors
 
00:58:22.870 --> 00:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
public meetings were held after very

the public to see
 
00:58:30.309 --> 00:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
our state legislators were only allowed
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
to view the maps a few days before
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%

districts
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
meredith needs to have our district and
 
01:00:30.390 --> 01:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
representatives reinstated
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
as it was prior to 11 2011
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
making it once again comply correctly
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
within the constitution

um so good evening is the chair um
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
members of the special committee
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
my name is steve merrill and i've lived
 
01:01:32.069 --> 01:01:32.079 align:start position:0%
in meredith for the past 20 years
 
01:01:33.910 --> 01:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'm here to express my concern for the
 
01:01:35.910 --> 01:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
future of ourselves
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
over the past decades
 
01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280 align:start position:0%
i've witnessed the deterioration of
 
01:01:41.349 --> 01:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
norms and the decay of our four
 
01:01:41.359 --> 01:01:43.030 align:start position:0%
norms and the decay of our four
institutions

01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
institutions
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
a deterioration which has accelerated
 
01:01:47.109 --> 01:01:47.119 align:start position:0%
over the past decade
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
a theory of deterioration that began in
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
our nation's capital but has somehow
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
liked to operate state why did we let
 
01:01:55.029 --> 01:01:55.039 align:start position:0%
that happen
 
01:01:57.029 --> 01:01:57.039 align:start position:0%
a deterioration that if left unchecked
 
01:01:59.109 --> 01:01:59.119 align:start position:0%
could undermine the very foundation of
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
certainly one significant influence on
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
this insidious decay has been a partisan
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
guarantee which has grown more and more
 
01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:12.160 align:start position:0%
powerful with the information technology
 
01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.510 align:start position:0%
powerful with the information technology
revolution

01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
revolution
 
01:02:15.670 --> 01:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
over the past 30 years
 
01:02:17.829 --> 01:02:17.839 align:start position:0%
flying computing technology
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
combined with modern data analytics
 
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:22.400 align:start position:0%
enable politicians to leverage voter
 
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
against the will of the people
 
01:02:32.069 --> 01:02:32.079 align:start position:0%
just as facebook google
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
apple can predict which ads you're
 
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:35.200 align:start position:0%
likely to
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
to click on
 
01:02:39.029 --> 01:02:39.039 align:start position:0%
voter analytics to predict how groups of
 
01:02:42.789 --> 01:02:42.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
in 2010 a waiver of republicans swept
 
01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
into our state and boldly asserted their
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
authority over our voting system
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
the germany during that result left one
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
party with an unfair advantage in the
 
01:02:53.839 --> 01:02:54.870 align:start position:0%
party with an unfair advantage in the
election

01:02:54.870 --> 01:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:02:57.910 --> 01:02:57.920 align:start position:0%
elections for the ensuing decades
 
01:03:00.470 --> 01:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
to achieve this goal legislators chose
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
to sacrifice the independence of merit
 
01:03:05.029 --> 01:03:05.039 align:start position:0%
and marrying other towns
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
by taking away their representatives
 
01:03:11.029 --> 01:03:11.039 align:start position:0%
though meredith leans republican or
 
01:03:11.039 --> 01:03:12.069 align:start position:0%
though meredith leans republican or
rather

01:03:12.069 --> 01:03:12.079 align:start position:0%
rather
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
in because of this fact
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
we were
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
combined gilbert to form a district with
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
four representatives
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
never mind that the only order we shared
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
was across the lake and have nothing in
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
common share no institutions no dump no
 
01:03:28.230 --> 01:03:28.240 align:start position:0%
no schools nothing
 
01:03:30.549 --> 01:03:30.559 align:start position:0%
the obvious reason was to increase the
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
house uh increase the number of house
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
seats where there are next today
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
and it worked
 
01:03:38.470 --> 01:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
and so to the gentleman the
 
01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
representative who spoke before me yes
 
01:03:42.309 --> 01:03:42.319 align:start position:0%
there have been representatives from
 
01:03:42.319 --> 01:03:43.750 align:start position:0%
there have been representatives from
meredith

01:03:43.750 --> 01:03:43.760 align:start position:0%
meredith
 
01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:44.950 align:start position:0%
meredith
that

01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
have won but they're always republican
 
01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
because an independent or a democrat is
 
01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
unknown in guildford for obvious reasons
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
we don't share anything in congress
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
nobody wouldn't know them yet but
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.589 --> 01:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
the results of the 2010 gerrymandering
 
01:04:11.829 --> 01:04:11.839 align:start position:0%
also had a profound impact on our state
 
01:04:11.839 --> 01:04:13.029 align:start position:0%
also had a profound impact on our state
senate

01:04:13.029 --> 01:04:13.039 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:15.920 align:start position:0%
from 2010 to 2020 republicans controlled
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
the state senate for eight of the 10
 
01:04:21.029 --> 01:04:21.039 align:start position:0%
years in spite of losing the total vote
 
01:04:22.470 --> 01:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
over that period
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
that is the combined vote of all 24
 
01:04:28.549 --> 01:04:28.559 align:start position:0%
districts by about 1.6
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
the democrats needed a wave
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
of their own to take the chamber for
 
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
just two of those 10 years
 
01:04:37.910 --> 01:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
in 2018 democrats won the total vote
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
count for those 24 seats by 8
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
but only won 14 of the 24 seats
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
in 2012
 
01:04:50.870 --> 01:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
the totals were 51-49 for the democrats
 
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
yet the republicans maintained control
 
01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
of the chamber 13-11.
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
in 2014 the tally was 50.3 to 49.7 so
 
01:05:02.470 --> 01:05:02.480 align:start position:0%
pretty close republicans again
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
maintained control this time picking up
 
01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
a seat 14-10.
 
01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.190 align:start position:0%
a seat 14-10.
um

01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:11.109 --> 01:05:11.119 align:start position:0%
you heard that right democrats won more
 
01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:14.319 align:start position:0%
votes but lost the elections in 12 14
 
01:05:15.990 --> 01:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
and 16.
 
01:05:18.069 --> 01:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry in 16 the founder of what
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
publicly finally won the vote so the
 
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:28.970 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:35.190 align:start position:0%

01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
percent margin how fair is that
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
we have an evenly divided state
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
and yet 16 of uh of 24 state senate
 
01:05:46.950 --> 01:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
districts were controlled by a single
 
01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.309 align:start position:0%

for the entire decade that's all
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
10 years one party controlled 16 of the
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
24. we never flipped because of the
 
01:05:58.710 --> 01:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
journey the packing of votes into a
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
certain distance
 
01:06:02.390 --> 01:06:02.400 align:start position:0%

about our

citizen government
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
that we have so many representatives
 
01:07:23.029 --> 01:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
people know who the representatives are
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
i know i did
 
01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:27.119 align:start position:0%
when i lived in farmington for 29 years
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
we had
 
01:07:31.029 --> 01:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
the population there right now is six
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
thousand nine hundred and thirty people
 
01:07:38.309 --> 01:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
we had two representatives and
 
01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:41.200 align:start position:0%
i saw people that subscribed earlier
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
town meeting that ball games at the bank
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
at community events there were people
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
that i knew
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
so when i had a question about what was
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
going on or wanted to give input it was
 
01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:54.640 align:start position:0%
really easy you could sometimes just do
 
01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:57.110 align:start position:0%
really easy you could sometimes just do
it

01:07:57.110 --> 01:07:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:59.750 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:07:59.750 --> 01:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
i it took me a little bit to catch on
 
01:08:02.799 --> 01:08:03.589 align:start position:0%
i it took me a little bit to catch on
but

01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
i'm shocked
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
and all the years lived in gillington
 
01:08:09.750 --> 01:08:09.760 align:start position:0%
behind zero
 
01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
zero representatives from dungeon
 
01:08:15.190 --> 01:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
there's not a single person that i came
 
01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.390 align:start position:0%
there's not a single person that i came
across

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
across
 
01:08:17.590 --> 01:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
get to know
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
and have those kind of conversations so
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
they can't get to know me what do i care
 
01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
about and i can't get to know them so we
 
01:08:26.950 --> 01:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
can have those dialogues back and forth
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
so i
 
01:08:31.829 --> 01:08:31.839 align:start position:0%
as other people have requested
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
would request that
 
01:08:35.829 --> 01:08:35.839 align:start position:0%
you restore the spirit and the
 
01:08:39.590 --> 01:08:39.600 align:start position:0%
functionality of our citizen legislature
 
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
i would like to once again
 
01:08:45.189 --> 01:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
have that experience i had no idea how
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
lucky i was
 
01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.390 align:start position:0%
lucky i was
gone

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:48.400 align:start position:0%
gone
 
01:08:50.390 --> 01:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
and thank you very much
 
01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for providing me an
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
opportunity for community input i am
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative sally fellows my district
 
01:09:23.910 --> 01:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
is in grafton it includes holding this
 
01:09:25.669 --> 01:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
hebron implement
 
01:09:28.149 --> 01:09:28.159 align:start position:0%
there are three things i respectfully
 
01:09:30.070 --> 01:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
ask you to consider
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
i have a suggestion that you might find
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
helpful and trying to keep all districts
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
within the 5 deviation limit
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
this is most likely to be useful in
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
counties with small populations where
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
the perfect seed allocation which is a
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
two-digit decimal number
 
01:09:51.269 --> 01:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
includes a fraction close to one half
 
01:09:53.669 --> 01:09:53.679 align:start position:0%
for example grafton county
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
when the population of 91
 
01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:58.630 align:start position:0%
when the population of 91
118

01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
118
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
has a perfect allocation
 
01:10:00.719 --> 01:10:02.110 align:start position:0%
has a perfect allocation
of

01:10:02.110 --> 01:10:02.120 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.550 align:start position:0%
of
[Music]

01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
while i was able to successfully map
 
01:10:11.270 --> 01:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
27 seats which is our current allocation
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
graphing with just a few adjustments to
 
01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:14.709 align:start position:0%
graphing with just a few adjustments to
the

01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:16.390 --> 01:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
current configuration
 
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
i couldn't map 26 seats even when using
 
01:10:23.350 --> 01:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
three or four floaters and still keep
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
within the five percent deviation from a
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
what i discovered was that only three
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
seats were below the state target the
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
other 23 were over
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
the only only one district was outside
 
01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
of the five percent wage and that one
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
was over by 5.47
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
so i'm wondering why so like lopsided
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
with 324
 
01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:56.830 align:start position:0%
with 324
23

01:10:56.830 --> 01:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
23
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
over since grafton's allocation of 26
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
seats is nearly half a percentage below
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
there are 1
 
01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.950 align:start position:0%
there are 1
574

01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
574
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
extra people
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
that must be squished
 
01:11:18.870 --> 01:11:18.880 align:start position:0%
into the 26 seats
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
that's an average of 61 extra people
 
01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.270 align:start position:0%
that's an average of 61 extra people
or

01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.830 align:start position:0%
or
1.7

01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
1.7
 
01:11:27.590 --> 01:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
of the target
 
01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
for each seat
 
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
if that excess were evenly distributed
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
across all the seats
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
each would have a deviation of plus 1.76
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
the deviation
 
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
of that magnitude is more than one third
 
01:11:47.189 --> 01:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
of the way to the maximum allowable
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
deviation of 5
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
so i think that's the key
 
01:11:52.630 --> 01:11:52.640 align:start position:0%
you know when you have
 
01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:56.239 align:start position:0%
a district whose percentage is is close
 
01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
to an extra pass you have a lot of extra
 
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
seats that you
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
people that you have to deal with and
 
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
trying to get that within five percent
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
is very difficult
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
my suggestion is to develop county maps
 
01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
based on the state average target of
 
01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
244 people received
 
01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.110 align:start position:0%
244 people received
but

01:12:17.110 --> 01:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
if a few seats are a bit outside that 5
 
01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:21.669 align:start position:0%
if a few seats are a bit outside that 5
limit

01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
limit
 
01:12:24.870 --> 01:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
test the deviation using the target
 
01:12:27.590 --> 01:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
that is the county population
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
divided by the number of county seats
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:38.630 --> 01:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
if all the seats are within within the
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
five percent i suggest
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
my second request and you've heard this
 
01:12:51.189 --> 01:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
one before
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
is that after preparing draft maps
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
please provide a second opportunity for
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
community input it's the people who live
 
01:13:01.350 --> 01:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
in each town who know which other towns
 
01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
are part of their community this is
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
particularly important for grafton
 
01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
county because it does not have a
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
representative on the right
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
and lastly
 
01:13:16.470 --> 01:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
it seems to be generally accepted that
 
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:18.640 align:start position:0%
public schools are an important element
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
of shared interest
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
my third request is that instead of
 
01:13:25.910 --> 01:13:25.920 align:start position:0%
using saus as the school link that you
 
01:13:28.709 --> 01:13:28.719 align:start position:0%
use high school of attendance for each
 
01:13:28.719 --> 01:13:29.669 align:start position:0%
use high school of attendance for each
town

01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
town
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
the only common denominator that all
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
saus provides is shared by sau staff
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
some sauss don't include any high
 
01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:40.310 align:start position:0%
some sauss don't include any high
schools

01:13:40.310 --> 01:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
and some have districts that use
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
two different high schools
 
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire department of education
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
publishes two high school lists but
 
01:13:52.870 --> 01:13:52.880 align:start position:0%
neither of these have all the towns by
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
the high school that they
 
01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.990 align:start position:0%
the high school that they
attend

01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
attend
 
01:13:58.229 --> 01:13:58.239 align:start position:0%
i've developed a spreadsheet of that and
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
i can provide you with that spreadsheet
 
01:14:02.950 --> 01:14:02.960 align:start position:0%
which you can easily sort by town or by
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
high school if you wish to use it
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:28.709 --> 01:14:28.719 align:start position:0%
again on that oh
 
01:14:31.669 --> 01:14:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh okay so uh
 
01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:38.550 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:41.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
speaking but oh listening to people i
 
01:14:50.130 --> 01:14:50.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
i had the honor to serve this county as
 
01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
the first economic developer
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
when the newly formed fellow county
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
economic development council was formed
 
01:15:06.390 --> 01:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
in 1992.
 
01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
we became a model of regional
 
01:15:10.149 --> 01:15:10.159 align:start position:0%

01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:11.840 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
a lot had to do with ray burton who
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
represented this area
 
01:15:19.110 --> 01:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
and wanted to see what we had created as
 
01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:21.520 align:start position:0%
accounting take part elsewhere in the
 
01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:23.350 align:start position:0%
accounting take part elsewhere in the
state

01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
i returned to new hampshire after
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
serving for a brief period of time in
 
01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
the civil war position in vermont
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
in 1992
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
we had unemployment in this region of
 
01:15:34.159 --> 01:15:36.830 align:start position:0%
we had unemployment in this region of
11.5

01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
11.5
 
01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
officially and closer to 17 and a half
 
01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
percent unofficially belknap county had
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
a challenge what i quickly learned is
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
that the olympian municipalities were
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
exceedingly different in their needs
 
01:15:53.910 --> 01:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
and visions as a delegation
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
there were differences
 
01:15:57.910 --> 01:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
but we were able to work together
 
01:15:59.910 --> 01:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of all
 
01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
what i found helpful is i worked to
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
develop programs and initiatives as
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
representatives would share local
 
01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:08.229 align:start position:0%
representatives would share local
perspectives

01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
perspectives
 
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
they would understood their community
 
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.110 align:start position:0%
they would understood their community
needs

01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:16:14.070 --> 01:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
i doubt the reps from guildford
 
01:16:15.669 --> 01:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
could elaborate on the issues of
 
01:16:15.679 --> 01:16:17.030 align:start position:0%
could elaborate on the issues of
narrative

01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
narrative
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
or vice versa i spend a lot of time i
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
live in guilford but i spent a lot of
 
01:16:23.270 --> 01:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
time volunteering
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
in meredith i've been for a long time
 
01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.669 align:start position:0%
in meredith i've been for a long time
um

01:16:27.669 --> 01:16:27.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
there are real differences between my
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
town when i was working what
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
tilting needed and what sanborn sanford
 
01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.910 align:start position:0%
tilting needed and what sanborn sanford
wanted

01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
yet the rewarding part of all of this is
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
when the delegation truly represented
 
01:16:47.189 --> 01:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
their talents we were able to come
 
01:16:49.350 --> 01:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
together and we did some very great
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
things together we were the best wired
 
01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.030 align:start position:0%
things together we were the best wired
county

01:16:53.030 --> 01:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
county
 
01:16:56.630 --> 01:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
the state found in 1996.
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
we also put together municipal services
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
and the reason i feel we did this folks
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
is the fact that
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
every town had
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
a representative that really understood
 
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
their people and if there was a problem
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
i could take them to the company or i
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
could take them to the uh
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
non-profit organization in need of
 
01:17:17.430 --> 01:17:17.440 align:start position:0%
health and
 
01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like to see us return to that and
 
01:17:22.550 --> 01:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
that they each have their own voice
 
01:17:24.950 --> 01:17:24.960 align:start position:0%
and a person who really cares on them
 
01:17:27.430 --> 01:17:27.440 align:start position:0%
so please consider that
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
we have a great state
 
01:17:32.550 --> 01:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
and we are different uh i spent a lot of
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
time in vermont
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
but they're much closer closer to being
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
very similar of course i worked for a
 
01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:47.090 align:start position:0%

hearing in contact or do one online so
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
that people can indeed offer testimony

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:01.270 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:20:03.990 --> 01:20:04.000 align:start position:0%

hampshire and the voters of donald trump

01:20:34.950 --> 01:20:34.960 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
it will be up to you as committee
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
members to be
 
01:20:42.709 --> 01:20:42.719 align:start position:0%
as non-partisan as the voters have been
 
01:20:44.310 --> 01:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
you have a choice
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
the choice is made sometimes in the past
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
have been less than non-partisan
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
no one can make you think about them it
 
01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
will be up to you to do the right thing
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
and i have confidence that you will know
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
what the right thing is and you will do
 
01:21:26.390 --> 01:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm here because i think that we
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
just have a big impact on the strength
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
and resiliency of our towns and
 
01:21:35.510 --> 01:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
countries and state
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
and a foundation of those
 
01:21:39.910 --> 01:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
characteristics is diversity
 
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:42.880 align:start position:0%
luckily recently retired but i worked
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
for several large corporations
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
where we thought diversity was really
 
01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
important and a couple of reasons were
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
it gave us
 
01:21:52.629 --> 01:21:52.639 align:start position:0%
a water challenge
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
so we could get really good employees
 
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
and that broader output also gave us
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
people with lots of different ideas
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
which helped us
 
01:22:03.030 --> 01:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
produce better products
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
and make our businesses more resilient
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
i think the same thing applies to
 
01:22:07.679 --> 01:22:20.110 align:start position:0%
i think the same thing applies to
politics

01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.030 --> 01:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
disenfranchising half of the people in
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
our state who could be bringing ideas
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
and energy
 
01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.070 align:start position:0%
and energy
and

01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:31.040 align:start position:0%
into our political process and giving us
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
better voter participation
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
and better
 
01:22:36.950 --> 01:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
candidates as a result
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
um you have you that the
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire business discipline
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
committee have a big responsibility
 
01:22:48.149 --> 01:22:48.159 align:start position:0%
you'll be deciding how valued the voters
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire feel
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
over the next 10 years by being more
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
inclusive you can make new hampshire
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
stronger and more resilient

sitting there and he said they call me

adam
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
and i said why would you want to call me
 
01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.270 align:start position:0%
and i said why would you want to call me
adam

01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
adam
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
he said well he said my last name that's
 
01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:10.750 align:start position:0%

14 letters of nobody

[Music]
 
01:24:14.709 --> 01:24:14.719 align:start position:0%
and i said well everything about me my
 
01:24:20.310 --> 01:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
i wasn't gonna wasn't saying anything
 
01:24:25.110 --> 01:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
tonight but i haven't seen anybody
 
01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:26.070 align:start position:0%
tonight but i haven't seen anybody
here

01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
laconia uh has
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
an unusual problem uh
 
01:24:34.149 --> 01:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
every person or phony is represented by
 
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
four representatives
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
so that means that uh
 
01:24:40.550 --> 01:24:40.560 align:start position:0%
there are something in the vicinity of
 
01:24:42.870 --> 01:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh 16 800
 
01:24:44.950 --> 01:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
voters who all have the same
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
you have four representatives
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
and there's no different agent
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
that wasn't always the way i my first
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
time i served in the legislature was in
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
197 71
 
01:24:58.709 --> 01:24:58.719 align:start position:0%
and i represented war ii divided by wars
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
you don't have to do it that way but it
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem right that the people in
 
01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:04.149 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem right that the people in
europe

01:25:04.149 --> 01:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
europe
 
01:25:07.350 --> 01:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
have 16 871
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
people representing no matter where they
 
01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:10.390 align:start position:0%
people representing no matter where they
live

01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
live
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:18.470 align:start position:0%
but um
[Music]

01:25:18.470 --> 01:25:18.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
but if you add
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
that population to 16 871
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
23 25 23 000 or so people
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
perform forming one representative this
 
01:25:35.189 --> 01:25:35.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a lot of sense
 
01:25:35.199 --> 01:25:36.070 align:start position:0%
doesn't make a lot of sense
um

01:25:36.070 --> 01:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
so i think that the
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee on a good hard look at how the
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
representation in the city of colleen is
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
constructed i realize it's difficult in
 
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
the city i've got a lot of different
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
factors involved
 
01:25:50.470 --> 01:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
particularly with city awards
 
01:25:53.350 --> 01:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
um but the words are there and
 
01:25:54.870 --> 01:25:54.880 align:start position:0%
we're not allowed to change the world
 
01:25:57.270 --> 01:25:57.280 align:start position:0%
lines in order to reduce it but
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh i would hope that the committee would
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
take a serious look
 
01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.229 align:start position:0%
take a serious look
at

01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
a forming district where
 
01:26:06.310 --> 01:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
not quite so many people
 
01:26:08.550 --> 01:26:08.560 align:start position:0%
have the same representative
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:53.990 --> 01:26:54.000 align:start position:0%

01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
resident of america for 30 years
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
i've been a resident in new hampshire
 
01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
for 40 years is what i'm fond of saying
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
is i'm from new hampshire
 
01:27:40.870 --> 01:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
but my parents are from massachusetts
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
i moved to new hampshire as soon as i
 
01:27:44.149 --> 01:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
could i grew up massachusetts but i
 
01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
always consider myself from new
 
01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire i have i came here when i was
 
01:27:49.350 --> 01:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
a kid i've always considered this to be
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
my home
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
last while i became far more attuned to
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
how things work
 
01:27:56.790 --> 01:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
there and i'm not here to talk about
 
01:27:58.470 --> 01:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
what's happening in lithuania or what's
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
happening at alton i'm not here to say
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
that you guys are not doing your job
 
01:28:07.990 --> 01:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
intent for the residents of new
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire or you would not be running
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
and working like this for two years for
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
two hundred dollars let's face it you
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
guys don't get paid
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
you're doing this because you have the
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
best interest of the residents of the
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire and i'm not here
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
to tell you how to do your job
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
but when she ran for for the house i
 
01:28:28.149 --> 01:28:28.159 align:start position:0%
realized that
 
01:28:30.390 --> 01:28:30.400 align:start position:0%
something just really didn't seem right
 
01:28:31.830 --> 01:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
with the way guilford america's put
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
together i'm not a republican i'm not a
 
01:28:35.510 --> 01:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
democrat i'm not going to talk about
 
01:28:36.790 --> 01:28:36.800 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering i'm not going to talk
 
01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
about somebody doing something and
 
01:28:40.229 --> 01:28:40.239 align:start position:0%
compared with one party over the other
 
01:28:42.229 --> 01:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not here to talk about politics i'm
 
01:28:43.990 --> 01:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
here to talk about the town
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
the town of meredith and i read this and
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
i tried to fact-check it and i couldn't
 
01:28:49.270 --> 01:28:49.280 align:start position:0%
really fact-check it that
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
was we've had our own representative
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
for 150 years i think it's more like 227
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
years the town of america was
 
01:28:59.910 --> 01:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
incorporated in 1768 the house was
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
incorporated in 1784.
 
01:29:04.790 --> 01:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
we had a representative from 1784 to
 
01:29:07.070 --> 01:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
2011 to the fifth night to figure that's
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
227 years of the town of meredith had
 
01:29:11.590 --> 01:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
its own representation
 
01:29:14.470 --> 01:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
somehow we got tossed in with guilford
 
01:29:16.070 --> 01:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
i don't know why i've asked a bunch of
 
01:29:18.390 --> 01:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
people nobody knows why
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
if i was a cynic i would think that
 
01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:21.199 align:start position:0%
something furry is happening to put
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
those two towns together but i'm not
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
here to complain or say that anybody did
 
01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
anything without the best intent of mine
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
um the fact is as we've all heard the
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
town of mary and the town of guilford
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%

rep
 
01:29:41.430 --> 01:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
to get to a common border they had a
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
paddle canoes out into the middle of
 
01:29:45.350 --> 01:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
lakewood to get to a point
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
where the two towns met
 
01:29:49.430 --> 01:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
in addition to that if you actually
 
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to drive
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
mario killford it's a 12 mile drive now
 
01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:55.600 align:start position:0%
in the summertime when we have all the
 
01:29:57.270 --> 01:29:57.280 align:start position:0%
several residents here and all the
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
tourists here that can be a half an hour
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
or more
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
to get to two towns that have been
 
01:30:03.430 --> 01:30:03.440 align:start position:0%
combined together
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
for some unknown reason
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
in addition to that
 
01:30:09.430 --> 01:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
they don't share any municipal
 
01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:10.709 align:start position:0%
they don't share any municipal
operations

01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
operations
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
they don't share any programs they don't
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
share any sports teams
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
they don't have any common commercial or
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
healthcare interests
 
01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:19.270 align:start position:0%
healthcare interests
so

01:30:19.270 --> 01:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
how we ended up combining those two
 
01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
towns with really kind of a question as
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
to what the motive was
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
if you were actually to look at towns
 
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
that actually had a common interest
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
guilford and wilmington actually share
 
01:30:34.149 --> 01:30:34.159 align:start position:0%
a common interest but i'm not proposing
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
that we combine guilford and gillington
 
01:30:38.870 --> 01:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
or any other combination
 
01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:41.679 align:start position:0%
and with due respect to representative
 
01:30:43.590 --> 01:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
silver's comment
 
01:30:45.830 --> 01:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
we have a very easy solution
 
01:30:48.149 --> 01:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
for meredith and gilbert we don't need
 
01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
to blow up beyond the current number of
 
01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
representatives and i'm sure this same
 
01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.830 align:start position:0%
representatives and i'm sure this same
instance

01:30:53.830 --> 01:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
occurs in other places
 
01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
but i'm only going to talk about
 
01:30:57.910 --> 01:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
american guild we have four
 
01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.430 align:start position:0%
american guild we have four
representatives

01:30:59.430 --> 01:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
and we have approximately the same
 
01:31:04.709 --> 01:31:04.719 align:start position:0%
population in the two towns now an
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
interesting thing also is that
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
if you would look at the property
 
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
valuations because let's face it that's
 
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
how we found ourselves there's three
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
property evaluations that let's take a
 
01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:14.870 align:start position:0%
property evaluations that let's take a
month

01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:31:16.790 --> 01:31:16.800 align:start position:0%
the town of meredith has 2.3 billion
 
01:31:19.110 --> 01:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
dollars in evaluative home valuations we
 
01:31:21.189 --> 01:31:21.199 align:start position:0%
ranked 19th in the state
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
town guilford has 2.1 billion they're
 
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:25.280 align:start position:0%
ranked 22nd in the state we each
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
contribute approximately 32 million
 
01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
dollars to stakeholders
 
01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
we contribute roughly the same amount of
 
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
money we have roughly the same property
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
tax valuation we have roughly the same
 
01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.830 align:start position:0%
tax valuation we have roughly the same
population

01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:31:40.149 --> 01:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's asking a lot for the
 
01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
amount of money that we present to the
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
state on a yearly basis to say hey let's
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
take those four break it into two give
 
01:31:48.229 --> 01:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
them their
 
01:31:50.229 --> 01:31:50.239 align:start position:0%
representatives like the town of earth
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
has had for 227 years
 
01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:54.639 align:start position:0%
and you don't have to blow anything up
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
all you have to do is take before we
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:06.149 --> 01:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
why do we want to say okay we want to do
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
something different than they decided to
 
01:32:09.510 --> 01:32:09.520 align:start position:0%
do in 2010 which now we continue to
 
01:32:12.229 --> 01:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
figure out why they did it
 
01:32:12.239 --> 01:32:13.110 align:start position:0%
figure out why they did it
it's

01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
in a non-cannon to school anybody on the
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
same constitution you guys know it
 
01:32:17.910 --> 01:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
better than anybody that's on the side
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
of the team
 
01:32:21.189 --> 01:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
but if you look at the way it is right
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
now as representative silver said we
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
have three from guildford one for
 
01:32:27.590 --> 01:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
meredith if something was to come to the
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
state that would harm meredith and
 
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
benefit guildford
 
01:32:33.110 --> 01:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
guess how that's going to go
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
it's not going to go towards america
 
01:32:36.229 --> 01:32:36.239 align:start position:0%
it's going to go towards guilford
 
01:32:38.709 --> 01:32:38.719 align:start position:0%
we should not be ever setting up a
 
01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
situation where we can disadvantage one
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
town over the other if we don't have to
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
and this is a case where we clearly
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to
 
01:32:49.990 --> 01:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
i am strongly urging every member of
 
01:32:51.669 --> 01:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
this committee i don't care what you do
 
01:32:59.990 --> 01:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:01.990 --> 01:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's representative of our population
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
it's representative of our tax base it's
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
representative of the amount of money we
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.430 --> 01:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's all i'm asking for i appreciate
 
01:33:14.790 --> 01:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
the time you guys are giving us tonight
 
01:33:16.550 --> 01:33:16.560 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the time that you guys are
 
01:33:18.950 --> 01:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
putting into this tonight and i am sure
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
that you are moving forward with the
 
01:33:23.270 --> 01:33:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
everybody in the state of new hampshire
 
01:33:26.550 --> 01:33:26.560 align:start position:0%

01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%

um initiative
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
so i promised my voters i will bring
 
01:34:50.070 --> 01:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
that to you and ask that you please do
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
that and knowing that i know you all
 
01:34:53.109 --> 01:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
being my third term in the house i'm
 
01:34:54.470 --> 01:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
sure you will do
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
that as well
 
01:34:57.590 --> 01:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
um but one other thing i will speak
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
about i serve two towns they say the
 
01:35:02.229 --> 01:35:02.239 align:start position:0%
town of san fran and the town of tilton
 
01:35:02.239 --> 01:35:03.270 align:start position:0%
town of san fran and the town of tilton
um

01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:05.270 --> 01:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
if you look at your your demographic map
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
there you'll see that they have 3 900 as
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
well within 3 44
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
needed and above the deviation mark so
 
01:35:15.830 --> 01:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
i'm going to do something that most
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
politicians mostly always speak against
 
01:35:19.030 --> 01:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
my self-interest
 
01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to say i've asked you to
 
01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
please put a record
 
01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
um and use the overage that's until they
 
01:35:26.870 --> 01:35:26.880 align:start position:0%
cover the town of salmon create a float
 
01:35:28.229 --> 01:35:28.239 align:start position:0%
between the towns of children and
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
sandwiches the reason i think this is
 
01:35:31.830 --> 01:35:31.840 align:start position:0%
still a good move is that the towns of
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
tilton sanderson share a lot of
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
communities and interests we share high
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
school we share a middle school we share
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
borders on the lake uh our the main
 
01:35:40.159 --> 01:35:46.830 align:start position:0%

01:35:46.830 --> 01:35:46.840 align:start position:0%

redistricting and we with our partners
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
assembled the macrophage coalition in
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
which over 250 people have now
 
01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:48.149 align:start position:0%
which over 250 people have now
volunteered

01:42:48.149 --> 01:42:48.159 align:start position:0%
volunteered
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
we helped 74 towns around the state from
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
red towns like all franklin londonderry
 
01:42:56.950 --> 01:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
and ridge to blue towns like lebanon
 
01:42:59.990 --> 01:43:00.000 align:start position:0%
lebanon durham and keane and every color
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
in between
 
01:43:03.550 --> 01:43:03.560 align:start position:0%
those 74 towns represented
 
01:43:06.390 --> 01:43:06.400 align:start position:0%
561 000 granite staters
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
with only five losses
 
01:43:11.109 --> 01:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
it was only the that's
 
01:43:13.510 --> 01:43:13.520 align:start position:0%
beyond the 704
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
with only five losses it was only
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
available time in the pandemic that kept
 
01:43:19.590 --> 01:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
that number from being a super majority
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire voters
 
01:43:24.390 --> 01:43:24.400 align:start position:0%
they varied slightly in language but
 
01:43:26.950 --> 01:43:26.960 align:start position:0%
those cities and towns were asking for a
 
01:43:29.350 --> 01:43:29.360 align:start position:0%
fair non-partisan and transparent
 
01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.550 align:start position:0%
fair non-partisan and transparent
process

01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:43:32.070 --> 01:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
you can nitpick about it being a
 
01:43:34.149 --> 01:43:34.159 align:start position:0%
non-bonding resolution
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
but tell that to the voters who braved
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
the pandemic to come off the photon
 
01:43:40.709 --> 01:43:40.719 align:start position:0%
making it clear they wanted fair mass
 
01:43:43.669 --> 01:43:43.679 align:start position:0%
and i'd say they took it very seriously
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
in may the mapathon coalition began to
 
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:47.840 align:start position:0%
work surveying new hampshire cities and
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
towns for communities of interest data
 
01:43:52.149 --> 01:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
what we didn't get through surveys we
 
01:43:54.310 --> 01:43:54.320 align:start position:0%
followed up by phone calls to counter
 
01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
administrators this yielded a list of 60
 
01:43:58.709 --> 01:43:58.719 align:start position:0%
communities of interest
 
01:44:00.870 --> 01:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
um which the larger map of the
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
participants whittled down to fire
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
the all-volunteer mapping and technical
 
01:44:07.510 --> 01:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
team was formed as a subset to this
 
01:44:10.470 --> 01:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
larger group and comprised of engineers
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
data analysts software specialists and
 
01:44:16.950 --> 01:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:19.189 --> 01:44:19.199 align:start position:0%
taking that criteria our mapping and
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
technical team assembled community of
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%
interest maps from the state of new
 
01:44:25.590 --> 01:44:25.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire's department of education
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
department of environmental services
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:44:32.149 --> 01:44:32.159 align:start position:0%
and federal and academic sources this
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
helped us to create the overlays that
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
you see on our maps of the regional high
 
01:44:38.229 --> 01:44:38.239 align:start position:0%
schools healthcare regions regional
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
planning districts
 
01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh shared municipal water and sewer
 
01:44:44.950 --> 01:44:44.960 align:start position:0%
shared police and fire and a couple of
 
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
them excuse me a couple of others
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that these
 
01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
overlays can be used with anyone's maps
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
as they are available through the ask
 
01:44:57.350 --> 01:44:57.360 align:start position:0%
in addition to the overlays members of
 
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
the mapathon mapping and tech team
 
01:45:02.229 --> 01:45:02.239 align:start position:0%
created analysis tools which can test
 
01:45:04.870 --> 01:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
our maps and the maps of others to see
 
01:45:06.149 --> 01:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
with where
 
01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
there are weaknesses mistakes or
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
intentional uh manipulation
 
01:45:13.189 --> 01:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
like joel and by mr joel anderson's
 
01:45:15.669 --> 01:45:15.679 align:start position:0%
software one of our team members phil
 
01:45:17.590 --> 01:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
hatcher developed a computer software
 
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
tool which makes mapping suggestions
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
based on new hampshire and u.s
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional mandates and other
 
01:45:24.239 --> 01:45:25.430 align:start position:0%
constitutional mandates and other
factors

01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
factors
 
01:45:27.270 --> 01:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
this has been a useful tool which has
 
01:45:29.109 --> 01:45:29.119 align:start position:0%
already made some suggestions that we
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
hadn't thought of
 
01:45:33.189 --> 01:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
while our maps are not perfect
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
as my colleague john cross discussed
 
01:45:37.270 --> 01:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
last night
 
01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:38.390 align:start position:0%
last night
the

01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
communities of interest
 
01:45:42.830 --> 01:45:42.840 align:start position:0%
can be implemented and retain
 
01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
um excuse me i lost my weight here
 
01:45:48.229 --> 01:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
as my colleague
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
john cross
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
discussed last night we've proven that
 
01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
communities of interest can be
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
implemented to retain high schools
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
shared water systems healthcare regions
 
01:46:00.550 --> 01:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
and regional planning etc some of which
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
you've heard asked for in these hearings
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
this community of interest data along
 
01:46:06.550 --> 01:46:06.560 align:start position:0%
with our maps and supporting
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
documentation is readily accessible to
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
the committee to both communities
 
01:46:13.109 --> 01:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
tonight i'd like to take one more step
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
and make a proposition in consultation
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
with the mapathon mapping and technical
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
team earlier today we are offering our
 
01:46:22.870 --> 01:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
services to the two committees
 
01:46:24.310 --> 01:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
the house special committee is up
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
against a tight demo
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
our house maps are nearing completion as
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
close as we can get to them
 
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.189 align:start position:0%
close as we can get to them
without

01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:46:32.709 --> 01:46:32.719 align:start position:0%
the completed
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
redistricted city words
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
we can work with you side by side
 
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
and joining your policy and
 
01:46:42.070 --> 01:46:42.080 align:start position:0%
constitutional expertise with our
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
technical expertise
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
i have confidence that we uh can help
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
this house special committee meet its
 
01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.109 align:start position:0%
this house special committee meet its
deadlines

01:46:49.109 --> 01:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
deadlines
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh allow for a seven-day review period
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
and produce a worthy product
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
while our dra 2020 software had a
 
01:47:00.070 --> 01:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
limitation of being able to show for
 
01:47:02.070 --> 01:47:02.080 align:start position:0%
period districts this problem has now
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:08.629 --> 01:47:08.639 align:start position:0%
dra software allows for the manipulation
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
excuse me manipulation implementation of
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
many useful tools including overlays
 
01:47:16.629 --> 01:47:16.639 align:start position:0%
additional data sets and other tools not
 
01:47:19.270 --> 01:47:19.280 align:start position:0%
available in mr anderson's software
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
while the senate has more time to create
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
senate and executive council maps we
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
have proposals ready to analyze which
 
01:47:29.430 --> 01:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
improve competitiveness and compactness
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
while being sensitive to communities of
 
01:47:33.270 --> 01:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
communities of interest
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire has a long tradition of
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer contributions to developing
 
01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:40.080 align:start position:0%
legislation i'm hoping that the house
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
and senate committee will give out our
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
serious offer of technical support
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
consideration and together we can share
 
01:47:49.669 --> 01:47:49.679 align:start position:0%
maps that we can all be proud of at
 
01:47:52.390 --> 01:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
future narratives
 
01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and service to
 
01:47:56.709 --> 01:47:56.719 align:start position:0%

01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
fair nonpartisan and transparent process
 
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
and for logging all of these miles to
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
listen to the input of your constituents
