00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor The Honorable Rosemary rung
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
resources thank you Mr chair and it's

to um be here today to introduce House
Bill

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 align:start position:0%
332 um as many of you know I have been
 
00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 align:start position:0%
um addressing issues around
 
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:04.680 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms for the last
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
several years and we've been successful
 
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 align:start position:0%
getting some passed into law um and I
 
00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 align:start position:0%
want to dispel the
 
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
expectation that we can solve the issue
 
00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
of cyanobacteria blooms or that we can
 
00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
or state government can fix it state
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
government cannot solve this problem um
 
00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
it alone it's going to take a
 
00:06:28.749 --> 00:06:28.759 align:start position:0%
partnership with local individuals and
 
00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
local communi
 
00:06:32.749 --> 00:06:32.759 align:start position:0%
and that's the impetus for bringing this
 
00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.390 align:start position:0%
and that's the impetus for bringing this
bill

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
forward um we need to harness the power
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
of local folks who are directly impacted
 
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
by toxic blooms in their backyard and
 
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:43.990 align:start position:0%
by toxic blooms in their backyard and
their

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
neighborhood however it's not that easy
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
as most New Hampshire Lakes reside in
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
more than one
 
00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
municipality so if one town passes a
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
lake protective ordinance it is far less
 
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 align:start position:0%
effective than if the other
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities pass the same this bill
 
00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
empowers voters in those communities if
 
00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
they want to establish a village
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
District to specifically protect and
 
00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 align:start position:0%
mitigate and remediate surface waters
 
00:07:17.749 --> 00:07:17.759 align:start position:0%
that they that are there first I want to
 
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
thank the honorable Dan Wolf who's here
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
um who first sponsored this bill last
 
00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
year as a resident of Newbury which is
 
00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
one of the communities bordering Lake
 
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
centi Dan recognized the need to allow
 
00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
local communities to come
 
00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:37.759 align:start position:0%
together to solve a shared problem HB
 
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
332 is identical to his 2024 Bill hb1
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
1250 it passed the municipal and
 
00:07:48.189 --> 00:07:48.199 align:start position:0%
government committee last year but it
 
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
died in the house the in fact the ought
 
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
to pass vote failed by one vote New
 
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire statute already allows for the
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
establishment of Village districts in
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
RSA 5 to colon 1 for 14 reasons
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
including and this is among some of them
 
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
extinguishing of fires the planting of
 
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
trees construction maintenance and
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
sewage of waste treatment sidewalks and
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
Roads recreational promotion and even
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
control of
 
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:23.240 align:start position:0%
pollen insects and pests and more HB 332
 
00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
would simply add a 15th reason to
 
00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
protect and M and remediate surface
 
00:08:34.509 --> 00:08:34.519 align:start position:0%
waters why is this important each year
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
more New Hampshire Lakes suffer from
 
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
toxic cyano bacteria Blooms from Lake
 
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:43.760 align:start position:0%
winnipauk to babus Lake which is in my
 
00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
town and we it's straddles Amherst as
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
well babus lake is not the economic
 
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
Powerhouse of lake wiip pasak or other
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
lakes in the state but it is important
 
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
to the residents who live there HB
 
00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
332 would allow the towns of marac and
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
Amherst to form a village District to
 
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
protect babusek Lake but only if their
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
voters approve to
 
00:09:17.069 --> 00:09:17.079 align:start position:0%
remediate the conditions that led to
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
these blooms by enacting ordinances
 
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800 align:start position:0%
raising revenue for treatment and
 
00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
whatever else is necessary to mitigate
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
blooms rather than waiting for the state
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
to do it HB 330 two is the ultimate
 
00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
expression of local
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
control local voters get to decide if
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
they want this control maybe they vote
 
00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:42.120 align:start position:0%
not to establish the district maybe no
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
one petitions to have that come before
 
00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
the voters but if they do District
 
00:09:51.389 --> 00:09:51.399 align:start position:0%
voters may not decide to do anything but
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
the important thing is that they are the
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
ones not the state who can take control
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
to improve the quality of surface water
 
00:10:03.509 --> 00:10:03.519 align:start position:0%
in their Community please support the
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
passage of HB
 
00:10:09.069 --> 00:10:09.079 align:start position:0%
332 to add this important consideration
 
00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:11.959 align:start position:0%
to the rsas and to the other 14 reasons
 
00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
Village districts can be formed um thank
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
you for your attention I'd be happy to
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for the
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
representative yes representative
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
Don nice to see you thank you Mr chair
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
um when you're looking at this specific
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
bill is this for any New Hampshire town
 
00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
to be able to enact so for example I
 
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
live on canaby lake and so canab is
 
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:40.519 align:start position:0%
split by Windam Windham and Salem is
 
00:10:42.350 --> 00:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
that what you're looking to say any town
 
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
can enact this or just in your community
 
00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
you're looking oh no any Town any any
 
00:10:49.509 --> 00:10:49.519 align:start position:0%
Town um maram and and also you don't
 
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
even need multiple towns for instance in
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
miramac we have a village District that
 
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
provides Municipal Water not even to the
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
whole town to to most of the residents
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
but if the voters of Salem and wind him
 
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
decide that they want to um have a
 
00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:08.120 align:start position:0%
village District just looking at
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
remediating that surface water of canaby
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
Lake they can choose to um you know they
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
would have a town meeting an ability to
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
vote on a warrant article to approve the
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
district and then there is a process
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
already in the rsas where they would
 
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:27.680 align:start position:0%
then appoint or elect Commissioners to
 
00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
make decisions and they would have an
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
annual meeting so for instance in the
 
00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
mayor ma Village District which is our
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
water Municipal Water provider they have
 
00:11:38.389 --> 00:11:38.399 align:start position:0%
an annual meeting every year um just
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
like a town meeting would do and where
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
um Commissioners are elected we vote on
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
the budget we vote on any Capital
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
expenditures or Bond issues so it's
 
00:11:52.509 --> 00:11:52.519 align:start position:0%
really a subset of uh one or more
 
00:11:54.949 --> 00:11:54.959 align:start position:0%
municipalities but it's established to
 
00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
serve a specific
 
00:11:59.069 --> 00:11:59.079 align:start position:0%
purpose I hope that answered your
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
question question representative thank
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
00:12:10.069 --> 00:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
Taylor thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
for taking the question how would this
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
work on Interstate Waters I have a
 
00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
Province Lake in Wakefield Effingham and
 
00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
Bonfield main it would only apply to
 
00:12:22.269 --> 00:12:22.279 align:start position:0%
those communities it would only be an
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
option to those communities that are in
 
00:12:27.189 --> 00:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so there according to the
 
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
RSA you wouldn't be able B to have other
 
00:12:34.189 --> 00:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
states communities form a district with
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire Community would only be
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative Derby thank you Mr
 
00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:55.839 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
00:12:58.389 --> 00:12:58.399 align:start position:0%
representative Rong um can you describe
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
um some uh policies that you think might
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
benefit um where cyan and bacteria
 
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
mitigation might benefit from uh a this
 
00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:13.480 align:start position:0%
type of um board this type of uh
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
committee okay no thank you um well one
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
in particular is um and I'll use babusa
 
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:21.880 align:start position:0%
Lake as another example it has been a
 
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
chronically impaired lake with
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria blooms um but it's very
 
00:13:28.189 --> 00:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
small it doesn't have the economic
 
00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:32.120 align:start position:0%
engine of Lake but it's very likely
 
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
going to need an in-lake treatment to um
 
00:13:39.150 --> 00:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
really stop the blooming at least for
 
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
the duration of the the the
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of the Alum
 
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
treatment those treatments can run into
 
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.040 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars um a a
 
00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
lake that I'm very familiar with lake
 
00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
kisaka in molten burough I think it cost
 
00:13:57.310 --> 00:13:57.320 align:start position:0%
upward of $500,000 for the lake
 
00:13:59.749 --> 00:13:59.759 align:start position:0%
treatment this is an expenditure of
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
money that is very unlikely going to
 
00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:04.240 align:start position:0%
come from the state for babusek Lake
 
00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:07.240 align:start position:0%
there are bigger fish to fry more
 
00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
economically um important Lakes like
 
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.880 align:start position:0%
Lake wiip pasak um lakes that Supply
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
Municipal drinking water that are
 
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
probably going to be higher on the list
 
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
for an an investment of an in late
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
treatment than babus Lake would but the
 
00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
residents around that Lake if they are
 
00:14:27.069 --> 00:14:27.079 align:start position:0%
in a district a village District they
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
may elect to raise the reeven to do the
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
inl treatment themselves um they may
 
00:14:36.069 --> 00:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
vote to raise revenue that might match
 
00:14:38.829 --> 00:14:38.839 align:start position:0%
State grant for the in Lake treatment
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
but it could also be something minor as
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
they may require septic you know
 
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
Shoreline septic systems to be pumped
 
00:14:47.949 --> 00:14:47.959 align:start position:0%
every 3 years that's already occurred in
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
some communities um so it really depends
 
00:14:53.389 --> 00:14:53.399 align:start position:0%
on what the specific needs of that Lake
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
are and where the um um the the source
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
of the Nitro nen phosphorus is coming
 
00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:05.000 align:start position:0%
from and the expense of uh remediating
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
that um would fall on the district um in
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
in lie of the state another example is
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
um rebuilding a culvert you could be
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
something really is I don't want to say
 
00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:19.240 align:start position:0%
it's simple but it's in the scheme of
 
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
things it's a simple remediation project
 
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
um that's something that the district
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
could elect to do if it helps um prevent
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
runoff of surface water that is adding
 
00:15:32.949 --> 00:15:32.959 align:start position:0%
nitrogen and phosphorus to the lake they
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
may even raise money just to fund a
 
00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.160 align:start position:0%
watershed management plan that would
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
identify all of these projects but it
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
takes away the Reliance on the state and
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
state funding to address concerns of
 
00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
quality any other questions
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
representative n thank you Mr chair
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question thanks
 
00:15:59.230 --> 00:15:59.240 align:start position:0%
for being here um is there a process I'm
 
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:00.440 align:start position:0%
sort of thinking ahead of the question
 
00:16:02.189 --> 00:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
of someone opposing this is there a
 
00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:04.240 align:start position:0%
process for disbanding this District if
 
00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go well what is the what are
 
00:16:09.389 --> 00:16:09.399 align:start position:0%
the sort of risks of this it's uh by
 
00:16:11.550 --> 00:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
vote it's the same process as forming
 
00:16:14.749 --> 00:16:14.759 align:start position:0%
one y okay by warrant article sorry uh
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
yeah it would be a warrant article of
 
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
the towns to disband the district okay
 
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:18.590 align:start position:0%
the towns to disband the district okay
thank

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
V thank you Mr chair
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
representative Rong it's good to hear
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
see you here today um just basically
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at the word
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
remediation on line four does that
 
00:16:37.710 --> 00:16:37.720 align:start position:0%
include all the Technologies or methods
 
00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.990 align:start position:0%
include all the Technologies or methods
that

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
a town or and this District would
 
00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.710 align:start position:0%
a town or and this District would
provide

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
provide
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
a oh it's um under one oh okay
 
00:17:01.470 --> 00:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
oh uh protection and
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
Remediation so I'm sorry representative
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
could you repeat your question yes so um
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
the protection and Remediation of
 
00:17:10.309 --> 00:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
surface water quality within the
 
00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:12.280 align:start position:0%
district when we're talking about
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
protection and Remediation are we
 
00:17:17.390 --> 00:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
covering we're covering prevention as
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
well as Technologies such as what was
 
00:17:24.549 --> 00:17:24.559 align:start position:0%
used at late kosaka where they actually
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
attacked a bloom that was already in
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
forc yeah so it it really it's really as
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
it says whatever's necessary to restore
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
that late quality or to prevent
 
00:17:40.029 --> 00:17:40.039 align:start position:0%
contamination it really just empowers
 
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
that District to make the decisions and
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
Supply the funding or seek funding um
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.870 --> 00:17:51.880 align:start position:0%
that thank you for taking my question
 
00:17:55.909 --> 00:17:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
question seeing none thank you for your
 
00:18:00.669 --> 00:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you one other comment I
 
00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
forgot to make Mr chair if you'll allow
 
00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
me um whatever the district decides to
 
00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
do it still has to comply with state law
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
so for instance if a district decides to
 
00:18:11.950 --> 00:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
do an in-lake treatment they still would
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
have to seek a surface water discharge
 
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
permit so it it doesn't exempt them from
 
00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
complying with uh laws already in place
 
00:18:23.430 --> 00:18:23.440 align:start position:0%
um at the state level it just allows the
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
district to it's mainly making the
 
00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
decision and moving forward with
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
implementing that project
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank
 
00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:35.520 align:start position:0%

go thanks for taking the time to uh hear
my

00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
testimony um I'm here today to in
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
opposition to making it possible for
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
petitioners to get Village districts
 
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
form for Lakes I have two primary
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this first off I'm sure the
 
00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
folks in support have excellent
 
00:19:11.669 --> 00:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
intentions to protect Monitor and
 
00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
enforce the state's Lakeshore
 
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:16.240 align:start position:0%
development requirements however this is
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
already under the purview of New
 
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:20.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees and each Town zoning and
 
00:19:20.919 --> 00:19:22.789 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees and each Town zoning and
building

00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
officials um all currently do an
 
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:27.400 align:start position:0%
excellent job especially here in the
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
Lake sunap Region where I'm from and of
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
course other citizens living on or near
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
our Lakes are sure to point out any
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
violations of sh land protection to the
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
towns and
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
de secondly Village districts are a bad
 
00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
idea in general I currently live within
 
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
the extremely gerrymandered boundaries
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
of the Springfield New London water
 
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
Precinct this was formed decades ago to
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
provide uh potable water in accordance
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
with section
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
52.1 paragraph D the supply of water for
 
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
domestic and fire purposes which may
 
00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
include the protection of the sources of
 
00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
Supply focus on that a minute if the
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
village District decided to get the
 
00:20:18.029 --> 00:20:18.039 align:start position:0%
domestic water from any Lake they could
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
prevent folks from swimming or boating
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
Lake here in this Village District the
 
00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:27.280 align:start position:0%
water supply is Wells on Colby point in
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
the middle of little Lake onip so no
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
restrictions currently on swimming in
 
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
this Lake now the interesting part this
 
00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
Village District raises over 2third of
 
00:20:40.549 --> 00:20:40.559 align:start position:0%
their annual
 
00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
revenue by taxing properties within the
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
district and just onethird from actual
 
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
water usage charges if a property is in
 
00:20:53.909 --> 00:20:53.919 align:start position:0%
the districts they annually pay a tax
 
00:20:56.750 --> 00:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
based upon the value of their property
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
this year it was A110 per ,000 of assess
 
00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:03.640 align:start position:0%
value so a $1 million house which is
 
00:21:07.029 --> 00:21:07.039 align:start position:0%
very common in the lake snipy area um
 
00:21:10.190 --> 00:21:10.200 align:start position:0%
would pay nearly $1,100 a year which is
 
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
collected by the town and then
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
distributed to the water
 
00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
Precinct there are currently two large
 
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
Parcels of land in New London that are
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
slated to be developed for affordable
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
housing and Senior Housing and have been
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
paying that annual tax for decades to
 
00:21:28.029 --> 00:21:28.039 align:start position:0%
the Village district and now the village
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
W not even provide water lines or
 
00:21:32.510 --> 00:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
domestic water to these developments
 
00:21:34.789 --> 00:21:34.799 align:start position:0%
citing a shortage of well
 
00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
capacity and of course the groundwater
 
00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
in New London's Central business
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
district is contaminated by posos so
 
00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
private on-site Wells are out of the
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
question finally there are developed
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
properties within the district that have
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
private Wells yet those folks are
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
required to pay annual taxes to the
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
precinct as well in their 23 1/3 us
 
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:00.110 align:start position:0%
precinct as well in their 23 1/3 us
Revenue

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
collection set up and properties without
 
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
water Connections in the district can
 
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
never get
 
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
out or change the boundaries because the
 
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:12.200 align:start position:0%
select board in both towns would have to
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
agree to it and of course there are
 
00:22:16.269 --> 00:22:16.279 align:start position:0%
always politics
 
00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:18.919 align:start position:0%
between the folks that are running the
 
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:21.640 align:start position:0%
district and the select boards elected
 
00:22:24.070 --> 00:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
officials and this is very prevalent in
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
New London and Springfield in summary
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
the establishment of Village District
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
dists for the protection and Remediation
 
00:22:33.029 --> 00:22:33.039 align:start position:0%
of surface waters within the district is
 
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
a bad idea and just another major tax to
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
properties within whatever District
 
00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:41.320 align:start position:0%
boundaries are drawn by those power
 
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:43.840 align:start position:0%
Brokers that can tax the heck out of
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:51.950 --> 00:22:51.960 align:start position:0%
perpetuity and any questions any
 
00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%

uh I hope to get to know uh the new
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives um on the
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
committee I am Andrea Laro the president
 
00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
and policy advocate of New Hampshire
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
Lakes as many of you know we are a
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
Statewide nonprofit organization our
 
00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
mission is to restore and preserve the
 
00:24:04.029 --> 00:24:04.039 align:start position:0%
health of all of New Hampshire's Lakes
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
we uh work with Lake Associations
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the state on ways to um
 
00:24:11.549 --> 00:24:11.559 align:start position:0%
restore and and improve the health of
 
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
our Lakes for everyone to enjoy we are
 
00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:16.120 align:start position:0%
here in support of this bill I know you
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
have a long day ahead of you so I am not
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
going to reiterate all the excellent
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
points that representative Rong has
 
00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.549 align:start position:0%
points that representative Rong has
already

00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:27.200 align:start position:0%
presented um what I will just a couple
 
00:24:29.149 --> 00:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
of things I wanted to share and and I
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
think this might address some of what
 
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
representative veale was asking about
 
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
I've heard from a some a few folks that
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
um the wording here might be a little
 
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:41.799 align:start position:0%
bit vague for the protection and
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
Remediation of surface water quality of
 
00:24:46.029 --> 00:24:46.039 align:start position:0%
course as an aquatic biologist I know
 
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:47.440 align:start position:0%
what that means and most of the people
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
behind me know what that means too um
 
00:24:54.029 --> 00:24:54.039 align:start position:0%
but if if that is of concern to you um a
 
00:24:56.669 --> 00:24:56.679 align:start position:0%
potential suggestion to uh reward that
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
to Encompass you know all the tools and
 
00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:01.600 align:start position:0%
technology that are currently used uh
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
for this purpose would be something like
 
00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh for the protection and restoration of
 
00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:08.480 align:start position:0%
surface water quality through Watershed
 
00:25:11.190 --> 00:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
and Lake management uh Watershed and
 
00:25:13.149 --> 00:25:13.159 align:start position:0%
Lake management is is fairly well
 
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
defined um within the Department of
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services with various
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
programs and um some statutes related to
 
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
that as well so if you're concerned
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
about it being a little vague you know
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
tweaking it in that way might bring some
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
clarity uh the other thing I I passed so
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
you have a testimony uh letter from us I
 
00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
see that we have about 150 Lake
 
00:25:36.149 --> 00:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
Association folks signed in in support
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
of this bill and and many explanations
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
of why they think this would benefit
 
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
their Community again this would be a
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
voluntary enabling and may not be the
 
00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
right thing for all communities but they
 
00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
would have that opportunity to vote the
 
00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:52.159 align:start position:0%
other thing I um shared with you is a uh
 
00:25:54.029 --> 00:25:54.039 align:start position:0%
testimony letter written from Jack
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
cutner he is from the Save Lake ctie
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
shed and he called me frantically this
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
morning he really wanted to come and
 
00:26:04.789 --> 00:26:04.799 align:start position:0%
testify in front of you and he worked
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
very closely with representative wolf
 
00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:09.559 align:start position:0%
last year on this bill um you can't make
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
this up he's down in cabridge and his
 
00:26:14.310 --> 00:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
garage is frozen shut uh so he's not
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
able to be here but um he quickly wrote
 
00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:18.760 align:start position:0%
this up and um wanted me to give it to
 
00:26:20.389 --> 00:26:20.399 align:start position:0%
you and I'm not going to regurgitate the
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
whole thing for you other than I if you
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
please I wanted to just share um one or
 
00:26:26.830 --> 00:26:26.840 align:start position:0%
two sentences here to really capture why
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
this would be of interest and benefit a
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
Lake Community as a
 
00:26:36.549 --> 00:26:36.559 align:start position:0%
whole um he said who in town government
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
has the expertise and accountability to
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
address these issues these issues of
 
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
protecting the lake ultimately this
 
00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility falls on Town select
 
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520 align:start position:0%
boards whose members are elected
 
00:26:48.389 --> 00:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
volunteers that change annually and who
 
00:26:50.389 --> 00:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
have very have large variety of issues
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%
to deal with it's very difficult for
 
00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:54.039 align:start position:0%
these boards to fully understand the
 
00:26:56.149 --> 00:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
threats to water quality and to
 
00:26:58.430 --> 00:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
prioritize action in the context of of
 
00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.430 align:start position:0%
prioritize action in the context of of
other

00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
challenges um so what he's saying is
 
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
this Village District could have um
 
00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:07.720 align:start position:0%
subject matter expertise um of folks um
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that that know um you know
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
how what needs to be done um in addition
 
00:27:15.149 --> 00:27:15.159 align:start position:0%
I'd like to add this District could be
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
available um could receive Grant funds
 
00:27:22.029 --> 00:27:22.039 align:start position:0%
um and other technical assistance um so
 
00:27:23.789 --> 00:27:23.799 align:start position:0%
with that we urge you to support this
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions at
 
00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
this time
 
00:27:28.799 --> 00:27:30.870 align:start position:0%
this time
any

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any thank you for
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.990 --> 00:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
much speaking in opposition Chris
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
Norwood representing the Realtors three
 
00:27:47.149 --> 00:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
Norwood thank you Mr chair members of
 
00:27:51.509 --> 00:27:51.519 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Chris Norwood
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
I'm the 20125 vice chair of the New
 
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:56.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of Realtors and uh
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
speaking in opposition of the uh bill as
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
presented today um and I will kind of
 
00:28:05.389 --> 00:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
conclude my uh with I will start with my
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
conclusion which is I think that uh
 
00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps a study bill of Village
 
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
districts is more appropriate similar to
 
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh the bill that was um voted on
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh there was an ought to pass
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
on a similar study bill for zoning and I
 
00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
I apologize I don't have the um uh the
 
00:28:26.590 --> 00:28:26.600 align:start position:0%
bill number my my testimony is such that
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
certainly the Realtors care about uh the
 
00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
quality of lakes it behooves us to and
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
important to our clients to keep the ca
 
00:28:36.509 --> 00:28:36.519 align:start position:0%
bacteria blooms away from our lakes and
 
00:28:38.509 --> 00:28:38.519 align:start position:0%
I appreciate representative rang's
 
00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:40.240 align:start position:0%
testimony certainly I actually grew up
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
swimming in Lake uh babusek Lake um the
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
concern we have is with the New
 
00:28:47.789 --> 00:28:47.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Village districts in
 
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
particular so in some of our research
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
and this is by no means conclusive there
 
00:28:55.149 --> 00:28:55.159 align:start position:0%
are 91 Village districts in the state of
 
00:28:57.430 --> 00:28:57.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh according to uh an
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
Excel file downloaded from NH
 
00:29:03.669 --> 00:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
economy um the power that's vested in
 
00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:06.799 align:start position:0%
them I'm going to read section 52 colon
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
3 Roman numeral 2 The District shall
 
00:29:13.509 --> 00:29:13.519 align:start position:0%
thereupon be a body corporate in politic
 
00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
and shall have all the power in relation
 
00:29:17.549 --> 00:29:17.559 align:start position:0%
to the objects for which it was
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
established that towns have or may have
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
in relation to like objects and that
 
00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
they are necessary for accomplishments
 
00:29:26.789 --> 00:29:26.799 align:start position:0%
of its purpose and as the sponsor
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are about 14 purposes
 
00:29:30.789 --> 00:29:30.799 align:start position:0%
for which Village districts can be
 
00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:33.320 align:start position:0%
formed the realtor's concern is some of
 
00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:36.919 align:start position:0%
these Village districts which the they
 
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
they've expanded in scope beyond for the
 
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
original reasons that they were formed
 
00:29:42.789 --> 00:29:42.799 align:start position:0%
and I'll give you two
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
examples um the lighting District in
 
00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:51.559 align:start position:0%
karge has some Powers relating to zoning
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
and Zoning enforcement and that can be
 
00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
further uh researched because there's
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
currently uh or there was a Supreme
 
00:29:59.909 --> 00:29:59.919 align:start position:0%
Court case the New Hampshire Supreme
 
00:30:03.149 --> 00:30:03.159 align:start position:0%
Court case where um the karge lighting
 
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
Precinct was in a a lawsuit with one of
 
00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
the the members of the property owners
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
within its
 
00:30:13.990 --> 00:30:14.000 align:start position:0%
boundaries um that was up in Conway in
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
Northampton there's uh little borsh head
 
00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
which is another Village District um
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
according to their website they were
 
00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:21.559 align:start position:0%
established in
 
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:24.760 align:start position:0%
1905 and they have again according to
 
00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
their website zoning
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh planning Board review essentially
 
00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
they have expanded the powers in our
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
opinion beyond what it was originally
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
established for again according to its
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
own website little borsh head in
 
00:30:41.789 --> 00:30:41.799 align:start position:0%
Northampton was established originally
 
00:30:41.799 --> 00:30:43.149 align:start position:0%
Northampton was established originally
for

00:30:43.149 --> 00:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:47.480 align:start position:0%
water um we have no concerns over um
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
trying to improve the quality of our
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
Lakes but again according to New
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy's website of the 91
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
existing Village districts nine of them
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
have Planning and Zoning Authority and
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
that seems to us Realtors as beyond the
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
original scope for which that they were
 
00:31:07.669 --> 00:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
intended again Village karge lighting
 
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
District presumably hearkens back to the
 
00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
days when there was you know oil lamps
 
00:31:15.549 --> 00:31:15.559 align:start position:0%
uh lining the streets or something of
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
that nature um and why they have
 
00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:20.080 align:start position:0%
Planning and Zoning Authority I we just
 
00:31:21.990 --> 00:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
don't know and so the concern that we
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
have is the the expansion of the village
 
00:31:27.149 --> 00:31:27.159 align:start position:0%
districts again uh if there is perhaps a
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
study bill they could look into the
 
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
village districts and to understand why
 
00:31:33.149 --> 00:31:33.159 align:start position:0%
some of these Village districts going
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
back to the 1800s all the way till today
 
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
have expanded in their scope and
 
00:31:39.549 --> 00:31:39.559 align:start position:0%
Authority we think that that would be uh
 
00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable and uh I will entertain any
 
00:31:43.389 --> 00:31:43.399 align:start position:0%
questions but thank you very much for
 
00:31:47.389 --> 00:31:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.870 --> 00:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
you speaking in support of the bill
 
00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.629 --> 00:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
Association is that work okay there we
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
go I'm Elizabeth Harper I'm the
 
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
executive director of the lake sopee
 
00:32:23.159 --> 00:32:24.230 align:start position:0%
executive director of the lake sopee
protective

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
protective
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
Association um our mission is to
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
preserve and enhance the environmental
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the lake sopy Watershed um
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
so we work with all of the towns in our
 
00:32:37.629 --> 00:32:37.639 align:start position:0%
Watershed there are um over five
 
00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are trying to work
 
00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
together to maintain water quality in
 
00:32:44.549 --> 00:32:44.559 align:start position:0%
our area we have hundreds of members
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
that are interested in working
 
00:32:48.389 --> 00:32:48.399 align:start position:0%
collaboratively to try to improve water
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
quality um with the record number of
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
cyano blooms across the state um the
 
00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
capacity at the state level to address
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
the needs of all of the lakes and ponds
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
um in our state uh is stretched and
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
being able to address these issues at
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
both the local level and the state level
 
00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
and doing that in collaboration I think
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
is going to be necessary to address the
 
00:33:13.269 --> 00:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
problems that we are seeing currently
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
and that are likely to increase over
 
00:33:17.710 --> 00:33:17.720 align:start position:0%
time we're in support of this bill
 
00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:20.360 align:start position:0%
because it provides a mechanism for
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
those municipalities that have really
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
limited resources and expertise in these
 
00:33:27.389 --> 00:33:27.399 align:start position:0%
areas to work together in a way that's
 
00:33:30.269 --> 00:33:30.279 align:start position:0%
efficient and effective um so that we
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
can can try to address these issues
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
we've been working on septic regulations
 
00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
with towns and having to do it with a
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
really peacemeal
 
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:40.360 align:start position:0%
approach um something like the village
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
districts would make that collaboration
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
and efficient use of resources um much
 
00:33:48.389 --> 00:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
more effective um those are some of the
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
main points that I wanted to bring up
 
00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:51.519 align:start position:0%
we've also been working with um
 
00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
collaborators in New London um just
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
because that issue of groundwater
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
contamination came up I just want to
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
emphasize that um that is a a big issue
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
in New London it's not the problem is
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
not because of a village District um
 
00:34:10.629 --> 00:34:10.639 align:start position:0%
that's not the root issue um that
 
00:34:12.349 --> 00:34:12.359 align:start position:0%
groundwater contamination happened
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
decades ago it's a big issue um but to
 
00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:17.480 align:start position:0%
say that that's the result of this I I
 
00:34:20.750 --> 00:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
don't think is accurate um so I think
 
00:34:23.310 --> 00:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
most of the other um key points have
 
00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:25.919 align:start position:0%
been made by Andrea lamro and uh
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
representative rung so I'll um stop my
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
comments there but I would be happy to
 
00:34:32.990 --> 00:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
take any questions any questions
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
representative Donnelly thank you for
 
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:39.839 align:start position:0%
taking thank you Mr chair um so have
 
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
you seen or or thought that this may
 
00:34:45.069 --> 00:34:45.079 align:start position:0%
have actually have any limitations for
 
00:34:47.470 --> 00:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
the rest of the state with using Lake
 
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
lakel uh cipe and is there any
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
restrictions have you seen with where
 
00:34:53.950 --> 00:34:53.960 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden you're less people
 
00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:56.280 align:start position:0%
across the state or even people coming
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
up to visit for just the day
 
00:35:01.430 --> 00:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
this would create restrictions no not at
 
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
all I I don't see any way that this
 
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
would limit the use of of lakes for
 
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
recreation I think on the contrary you
 
00:35:12.030 --> 00:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
know I think everyone in our community
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
understands what an important economic
 
00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
driver our Lakes are and I think that's
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
really at the root of why we've been
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
able to get really widespread community
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
support for initiatives like this um
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
because every I mean our economy depends
 
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
on lakes being high quality as soon as
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
we have massive cyano blooms that's a
 
00:35:33.870 --> 00:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
problem for everyone in our region and
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
they want to be able to work together um
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
to solve this issue so it's absolutely
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
the idea that it would prevent boating
 
00:35:42.950 --> 00:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
or swimming is I I think
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive I think it's
 
00:35:46.670 --> 00:35:46.680 align:start position:0%
specifically so that we can have lakes
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
where boating and tourism and swimming
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
are possible thank you thank
 
00:35:58.349 --> 00:35:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you for your testimony
 
00:36:02.069 --> 00:36:02.079 align:start position:0%
I don't have any more pink cards is
 
00:36:04.829 --> 00:36:04.839 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wishes to speak on
 
00:36:04.839 --> 00:36:06.790 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who wishes to speak on
HB

00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
332 could be M representative will Dan I
 
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
have a pink card for 334 for you did you
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:28.109 --> 00:36:28.119 align:start position:0%
bill okay
 
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
so we'll change the number and take your
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
seat Mr Wolf welcome back to

resources thank you maybe I should go to
 
00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:38.309 align:start position:0%
resources thank you maybe I should go to
Education

00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
First um speaking in support speaking in
 
00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
support thank you and thank the
 
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
committee for listening to me um this is
 
00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:51.319 align:start position:0%
the same bill that was brought forth
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
last year it passed the committee I
 
00:36:57.309 --> 00:36:57.319 align:start position:0%
believe it was 12 to 4 it got shot down
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
in in the house by one
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
vote this is not a control bill it is a
 
00:37:08.589 --> 00:37:08.599 align:start position:0%
local control local assistance bill that
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
would put the ability to
 
00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
coordinate environmental rules and
 
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
regulations together Newbury is part of
 
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
a village District on Lake Todd the lake
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
Todd Village District
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
which has a dam at the end of it and so
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
there's an ability for those people that
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
live on Lake Todd to maintain the dam
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
and tax themselves
 
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
Etc but when you have multiple towns
 
00:37:40.790 --> 00:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
within a district you don't have
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
uniformity of Regulation the setback in
 
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
Newbury may be 250 ft it may be um 200
 
00:37:52.430 --> 00:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
feet in New London Springfield will have
 
00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:55.640 align:start position:0%
a different one this gives a mandate to
 
00:37:58.109 --> 00:37:58.119 align:start position:0%
one legal entity
 
00:38:03.309 --> 00:38:03.319 align:start position:0%
to coordinate all sorts of Environmental
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
Protections it will provide for
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
consistent regulation for the towns
 
00:38:08.430 --> 00:38:08.440 align:start position:0%
within the
 
00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:11.680 align:start position:0%
Watershed and consistent enforcement
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
with the rules and
 
00:38:16.030 --> 00:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
regulations it'll offer the ability to
 
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
have prevention and planning for future
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
and as somebody said last year on the
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
floor of the house it does not provide
 
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:29.400 align:start position:0%
for any new taxes it is up to the
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
members of that Village
 
00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:35.720 align:start position:0%
District to decide what they want it is
 
00:38:39.309 --> 00:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
the epitome of local control if we want
 
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
to protect our watershed this is a
 
00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:44.480 align:start position:0%
method for doing
 
00:38:48.309 --> 00:38:48.319 align:start position:0%
it this bill does not form a village
 
00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:51.280 align:start position:0%
District this is only enabling
 
00:38:54.589 --> 00:38:54.599 align:start position:0%
legislation from here it goes forward to
 
00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:56.839 align:start position:0%
writing the rules and regulations of the
 
00:38:59.950 --> 00:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
district to the procedures that will be
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
employed to whether they want to allow
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
taxing whether they want to somebody
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned the lights in
 
00:39:13.069 --> 00:39:13.079 align:start position:0%
kir it has to be all approved and it can
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
be modified this time or later on but
 
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:22.280 align:start position:0%
this is an enabling bill that allows
 
00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
those in that those communities that
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
front on a Village District to enforce
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
actions on themselves if you're not in
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
the village District doesn't matter you
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to enforce it I'm
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
asking you to prove this and if need be
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
modifications to my friend Steve Wolf
 
00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
the the concerns in there maybe they
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
should be addressed but now is the
 
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:57.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to attack those
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
various regulations that exist and I'm
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
open for questions happy to answer any
 
00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.109 align:start position:0%
open for questions happy to answer any
of

00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.030 --> 00:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
them representative Darby thank you Mr
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
chair um thank you honorable uh well for
 
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh for testifying can you um uh talk
 
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
about the concerns that were raised
 
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
earlier of the water districts usurping
 
00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:25.400 align:start position:0%
uh zoning control from the local
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
municipality I think yes
 
00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.160 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
whatever the town that approves The
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
Village District wants in there they can
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
put in there but if they don't want
 
00:40:42.589 --> 00:40:42.599 align:start position:0%
zoning in there it they don't have the
 
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
right to do it if they don't want to
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
have uh Street Lighting in there they
 
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
don't have to do it it's a local control
 
00:40:54.910 --> 00:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
that whatever the town wants they're
 
00:40:58.470 --> 00:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
designating a village District to handle
 
00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:01.839 align:start position:0%
a situation as we have in our Lake Todd
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
Village District it's taken the the work
 
00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:08.119 align:start position:0%
of the selectman and the commissioners
 
00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
of the lake Todd Village District
 
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:14.960 align:start position:0%
can a tax them because the town said
 
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
they could they can repair the desert
 
00:41:20.430 --> 00:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
Dam excuse me and if there need to be a
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
draw down they can do it it does not
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
involve the rest of the town so I know
 
00:41:31.150 --> 00:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
don't think you have to put what
 
00:41:36.910 --> 00:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.270 --> 00:41:39.280 align:start position:0%

that one I did there's nobody here one
 
00:43:18.790 --> 00:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
after that there's nobody here I don't

even see the sponsor
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
here which is why I'd like to make them
 
00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know I don't know I don't
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
know I'm looking at the list this I know

thank you Mr chair um honorable members
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
of and colleagues of the resources uh
 
00:49:38.789 --> 00:49:38.799 align:start position:0%
committee um I apologize in advance if
 
00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:40.720 align:start position:0%
my comments are a little bit ad hoc I
 
00:49:41.750 --> 00:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
didn't realize I was going to be
 
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
speaking on this bill today but I um as
 
00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
a reminder this is this we this
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
committee saw this bill in the last term
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
I believe the last session um and it
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
passed um out of the out of this
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
committee um we heard last year that the
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh uh State development
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
plan has not been actively updated um
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
recently and there was um the sponsor
 
00:50:08.990 --> 00:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
had suggested that it was in uh in need
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
of an update in particular this bill um
 
00:50:17.589 --> 00:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
talks about adding in um support for uh
 
00:50:21.150 --> 00:50:21.160 align:start position:0%
recognizing the uh environmental needs
 
00:50:23.349 --> 00:50:23.359 align:start position:0%
of to add environmental needs to the
 
00:50:26.069 --> 00:50:26.079 align:start position:0%
state development plan and also um to
 
00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
recognize environmental threats um I
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
have a couple of comments about those um
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
first the um uh Recreation um generates
 
00:50:40.309 --> 00:50:40.319 align:start position:0%
over 325 million in tax revenue to the
 
00:50:44.910 --> 00:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
state every year um uh I meant to say um
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
tourism generates over 325 uh million
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
and outdoor recreation in particular uh
 
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
generate adds 3.9 billion to the New
 
00:50:55.990 --> 00:50:56.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy that's as of um a
 
00:50:57.510 --> 00:50:57.520 align:start position:0%
report that came came out at the end of
 
00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:58.230 align:start position:0%
report that came came out at the end of
last

00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:51:01.950 --> 00:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
year a 2022 study indicates that for
 
00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
every dollar that's invested in tourism
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
um we receive 12 um over $12 in tax
 
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
revenue so it's a very good investment
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
to the state clearly protecting the
 
00:51:14.030 --> 00:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
environment and uh water is essential to
 
00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:15.799 align:start position:0%
attracting visitors to the Lake Region
 
00:51:18.670 --> 00:51:18.680 align:start position:0%
and the mountains and the um ocean front
 
00:51:21.829 --> 00:51:21.839 align:start position:0%
and of course our beautiful um
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
forests um so this should be uh part of
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
the uh State development plan secondly
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
as this committee is very familiar with
 
00:51:32.589 --> 00:51:32.599 align:start position:0%
pasas is pervasive pervasive across the
 
00:51:34.670 --> 00:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
state particularly in the southern part
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
of the state but um has been detected um
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
as we just heard uh throughout the state
 
00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
and and impacts Water Supplies
 
00:51:42.990 --> 00:51:43.000 align:start position:0%
everywhere therefore Environmental
 
00:51:47.589 --> 00:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
Protection um in order to uh M uh make
 
00:51:50.109 --> 00:51:50.119 align:start position:0%
sure that we have the resources the um
 
00:51:52.030 --> 00:51:52.040 align:start position:0%
clean resources water and air that we
 
00:51:55.430 --> 00:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
need both for our residents and um of
 
00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:57.160 align:start position:0%
course for a tourism industry
 
00:52:00.349 --> 00:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
is critical in um and should be part of
 
00:52:03.789 --> 00:52:03.799 align:start position:0%
um the uh the state development plan and
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
so um and this should not we should not
 
00:52:12.109 --> 00:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
be reactive to the uh those threats um
 
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
and that's really what the second
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
section um paragraph 14 sub paragraph 14
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
talks about is um monitoring those
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
environmental threat so that we don't
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
have to be reactive I'll point out that
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
in addition to pasas um uh there's been
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
uh significant uh contamination with
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
mtpe throughout the state that has
 
00:52:36.470 --> 00:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
costed uh you know the state and um and
 
00:52:39.549 --> 00:52:39.559 align:start position:0%
uh uh well users throughout the state
 
00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:42.160 align:start position:0%
lots of lots of consternation and we
 
00:52:44.670 --> 00:52:44.680 align:start position:0%
want to avoid situations um such as
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
exist in um in Maine where pasas is
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
really um
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh significantly polluted Farmland even
 
00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
to the point where as as an Outdoorsman
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh you can't even hunt on some of those
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
lands anymore because the the pasas
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
contamination is so impacted based on uh
 
00:53:07.109 --> 00:53:07.119 align:start position:0%
uh the sludge the pasas and the sludge
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
that was spread as
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
fertilizer 90% of our W of uh
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
communities uh Community Water Supplies
 
00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
have tested positive for uh pasas and
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
108 have exceeded um the uh pasas
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
mcls um and 46% of New Hampshire's on is
 
00:53:28.430 --> 00:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
on uh private Wells so being proactive
 
00:53:31.710 --> 00:53:31.720 align:start position:0%
with monitoring and um evaluating
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
threats to our public water uh affects
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
everyone in the state and can't be
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
handled at only a u municipality level
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
um so thank you very much uh for um you
 
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
know considering this bill I will remind
 
00:53:48.510 --> 00:53:48.520 align:start position:0%
you again that um the it passed on a
 
00:53:51.069 --> 00:53:51.079 align:start position:0%
bipartisan um basis last year out of
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
this committee and of course happy to
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
00:53:55.990 --> 00:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for the
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
represent representative nav thank you
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for pitch hitting you
 
00:54:03.069 --> 00:54:03.079 align:start position:0%
did a great job um how often is the
 
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
comprehensive State development plan
 
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
updated my understanding from testimony
 
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
last year is it supposed to be updated I
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
think on a 10-year basis but has not
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
been and when um um when there was a
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
search for one of these it was actually
 
00:54:21.710 --> 00:54:21.720 align:start position:0%
even hard to find it because it has not
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
been recently updated I I don't have
 
00:54:26.589 --> 00:54:26.599 align:start position:0%
those numbers in front of me and I I I
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
don't have the my notes from last year
 
00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
but I can uh get back to you with that
 
00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
information representative ghoul welcome
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh for taking my question
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh you talked mainly about water are
 
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
there any other things that are in there
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
that would be looked at besides just
 
00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:49.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question
 
00:54:54.829 --> 00:54:54.839 align:start position:0%
representative gold um so the second SE
 
00:54:57.349 --> 00:54:57.359 align:start position:0%
the sub paragraph 14 talks about
 
00:54:59.710 --> 00:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
environmental threats um I talked a lot
 
00:55:01.670 --> 00:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
about um water because that's what we
 
00:55:03.349 --> 00:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
talk about in this committee but it does
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
specifically um call out uh waste
 
00:55:08.430 --> 00:55:08.440 align:start position:0%
disposal and so impacts from landfills
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
for example um as well as chemical and
 
00:55:11.359 --> 00:55:12.750 align:start position:0%
for example um as well as chemical and
biological

00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:12.760 align:start position:0%
biological
 
00:55:16.349 --> 00:55:16.359 align:start position:0%
contamination um I'd say that on the um
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
the natural resource of um um support or
 
00:55:24.789 --> 00:55:24.799 align:start position:0%
um inclusion in this development plan um
 
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
it talks about lakes rivers EST Aries
 
00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
forests Wetlands shorelands uh Coastal
 
00:55:31.029 --> 00:55:31.039 align:start position:0%
marshlands so it is it's very
 
00:55:33.950 --> 00:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
comprehensive I I really focused on the
 
00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
parts um uh apologetically that are most
 
00:55:39.789 --> 00:55:39.799 align:start position:0%
impactful to me and and that I was going
 
00:55:44.710 --> 00:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:47.480 align:start position:0%
about anybody else for a question for
 
00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:48.349 align:start position:0%
about anybody else for a question for
the

short uh we in support of it for all of
 
00:56:38.029 --> 00:56:38.039 align:start position:0%
the reasons that representative Darby so
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
nicely laid out um ensuring the state
 
00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
has a coordinated plan to guide All
 
00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
State agencies will help Regional and
 
00:56:49.589 --> 00:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
state agencies work together to restore
 
00:56:51.029 --> 00:56:51.039 align:start position:0%
and preserve the health of New
 
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:52.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's lakes and rivers so they can
 
00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
maintain a healthy balance looking
 
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
forward to the future
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh we you have all learned here the
 
00:57:01.670 --> 00:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
threats our Lakes are facing and we we
 
00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
don't know what threats they'll be
 
00:57:05.789 --> 00:57:05.799 align:start position:0%
facing in the future so having um that
 
00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:08.960 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the plan um my
 
00:57:10.270 --> 00:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the plan has not
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
been updated for quite some time um but
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
there may be some interest in updating
 
00:57:17.710 --> 00:57:17.720 align:start position:0%
the plan um but first um at least last
 
00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:19.760 align:start position:0%
year the sponsor wanted to get this
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
added to the plan so that when the plan
 
00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
is next updated hopefully soon uh the
 
00:57:27.789 --> 00:57:27.799 align:start position:0%
threats to um these the provisions of
 
00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:30.240 align:start position:0%
the bill would be included so I know
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
that was brief but uhu respecting your
 
00:57:34.270 --> 00:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
time any
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%

00:57:39.950 --> 00:57:39.960 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you again
 
00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.309 align:start position:0%

you and the last card I have Elizabeth
 
00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
Harper Lake sopy protective Association
 
00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
bill hi I'm Elizabeth Harper from the
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
lake sopy protective Association
 
00:57:59.230 --> 00:57:59.240 align:start position:0%
um and we're here in support of
 
00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
334 um primarily because we think it's
 
00:58:03.789 --> 00:58:03.799 align:start position:0%
important to have a proactive approach
 
00:58:05.990 --> 00:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
to protecting our natural resources
 
00:58:09.230 --> 00:58:09.240 align:start position:0%
they're fundamental to our economy uh
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
and we know from a lot of experience
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
that it's much less expensive to
 
00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
proactively protect those resources
 
00:58:19.190 --> 00:58:19.200 align:start position:0%
trying to remediate later um is
 
00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
extremely costly um so for for many
 
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:24.880 align:start position:0%
reasons um it makes sense that a
 
00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
proactive approach would be incorporated
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
into the state development
 
00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:33.319 align:start position:0%

Patrol good morning Mr chairman
 
01:32:42.109 --> 01:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the resources
 
01:32:44.430 --> 01:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Tim Dunley and I'm
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
here this morning representing the
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
department of safety Marine
 
01:32:50.430 --> 01:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
Patrol we uh we are in support of this
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
bill that you have before you today and
 
01:32:54.030 --> 01:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
if I could just take a quick quick
 
01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:55.960 align:start position:0%
moment to describe to you the issue that
 
01:32:58.990 --> 01:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
has arisen uh new New Hampshire Law
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
requires on seven of our uh Inland
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
bodies of water uh there are uh if you
 
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
wish to uh place a moing uh in the water
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
to house your boat overnight long term
 
01:33:15.229 --> 01:33:15.239 align:start position:0%
uh you are required to have a permit
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
Lake oopy in this case happens to be one
 
01:33:19.709 --> 01:33:19.719 align:start position:0%
of them uh Lake wiip all our larger
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
Lakes winaki winam Squam Newfound sunpi
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
oapi bow and Pleasant Lake in
 
01:33:28.830 --> 01:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
Deerfield we are seeing a phenomena
 
01:33:31.229 --> 01:33:31.239 align:start position:0%
where uh boats are
 
01:33:36.669 --> 01:33:36.679 align:start position:0%
employing devices uh from their uh boats
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
that allow them to be stored uh without
 
01:33:43.149 --> 01:33:43.159 align:start position:0%
employing anchors or the use of a moing
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
and as a result this Niche device is not
 
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
fitting into the definition of a moing
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
and therefore they are slipping through
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
a loophole in the definition
 
01:33:55.590 --> 01:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
essentially these
 
01:33:57.550 --> 01:33:57.560 align:start position:0%
devices uh which you'll see in the
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
language is referred to as spuds which
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh are basically piles that are uh in
 
01:34:05.350 --> 01:34:05.360 align:start position:0%
collars mounted to the sides of maybe
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
barges or pontoon boats that are dropped
 
01:34:09.550 --> 01:34:09.560 align:start position:0%
into the water typically with a cable
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
system on all four corners and it holds
 
01:34:14.510 --> 01:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
the boat in place we're also seeing
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
devices known as SE legs which is a a
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
brand name uh particularly on pontoon
 
01:34:23.030 --> 01:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
boats where basically aluminum stilts
 
01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
are bolted to the bottom of the
 
01:34:30.109 --> 01:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
pontoons and with a hydraulic system
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
deploy these legs that lift the pontoon
 
01:34:35.470 --> 01:34:35.480 align:start position:0%
boat up and out of the water along the
 
01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:37.109 align:start position:0%
boat up and out of the water along the
water's

01:34:37.109 --> 01:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
water's
 
01:34:40.270 --> 01:34:40.280 align:start position:0%
edge and folks are using these when they
 
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
do not have a permit or are not able to
 
01:34:45.149 --> 01:34:45.159 align:start position:0%
get a permit under the conditions that
 
01:34:47.270 --> 01:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
the moing laws require and they're
 
01:34:50.750 --> 01:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
leaving their boats on station uh and
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
right now it's legal because of the
 
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:54.320 align:start position:0%
loophole in the definition
 
01:34:57.790 --> 01:34:57.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would simply close that
 
01:35:01.510 --> 01:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
loophole many times particularly with um
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
property owner associations Lake
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
Associations condo
 
01:35:08.790 --> 01:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
associations back property owners who
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
may live a mile away but have Beach
 
01:35:15.590 --> 01:35:15.600 align:start position:0%
rights um are oftentimes by definition
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
are not able to get a moing they're not
 
01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
assure front property owner and in the
 
01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
case of maybe a condo association the
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
condo may have a 100 units
 
01:35:25.669 --> 01:35:25.679 align:start position:0%
but governor and Council have only
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
approved them for say 20 Moorings based
 
01:35:30.750 --> 01:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
on the width of their Frontage so folks
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
are employing these devices to avoid
 
01:35:35.709 --> 01:35:35.719 align:start position:0%
getting the moing permit and still be
 
01:35:38.830 --> 01:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
able to have their boat on our public
 
01:35:42.109 --> 01:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
Waters we have a problem on um Pleasant
 
01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
Lake in New London where people are
 
01:35:47.229 --> 01:35:47.239 align:start position:0%
crossing town property the town library
 
01:35:48.830 --> 01:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
and have Moorings in the lake in front
 
01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
of other people's Shor Frontage but
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
because they can access the public water
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
without trespassing passing we we can't
 
01:35:58.470 --> 01:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
do anything about it so this build comes
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
before you we are in support uh there is
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
one unintended consequence in the
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
current language and I've spoken with
 
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
representative Smith um as well as the
 
01:36:11.070 --> 01:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
Marine construction industry uh they the
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
barges and the work that they do from
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
their their platforms for their
 
01:36:17.750 --> 01:36:17.760 align:start position:0%
excavators and cranes and so on do
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
employ the use of the term spuds in the
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
definition and so uh we would suggest
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
that perhaps this uh Bill be amended to
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
exempt those Marine construction folks
 
01:36:32.590 --> 01:36:32.600 align:start position:0%
who are engaged in trade and are on a
 
01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
job site with the land a short front
 
01:36:36.350 --> 01:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
property owners's permission to be
 
01:36:40.950 --> 01:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
exempt from uh this this bill I'm happy
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
and would be welcome to entertain any
 
01:36:44.830 --> 01:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
questions you may
 
01:36:49.030 --> 01:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:52.149 --> 01:36:52.159 align:start position:0%
captain representative Derby thank you
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I thank you Captain Den leave
 
01:36:58.189 --> 01:36:58.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I want to
 
01:36:59.790 --> 01:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand this bill
 
01:37:03.149 --> 01:37:03.159 align:start position:0%
correctly um section one of the bill uh
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
extends the definition of appears to
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
extend the definition of moing to
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
include uh spuds and lifts and um and
 
01:37:16.510 --> 01:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
then um section two um says that uh you
 
01:37:19.669 --> 01:37:19.679 align:start position:0%
can't use spuds or lifts um in lie of a
 
01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
permitted moing so what I think I'm
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
interpreting this to be is that you can
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
use spuds and lifts but you need a more
 
01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
in permit to do
 
01:37:32.189 --> 01:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
that that's correct and and uh it is
 
01:37:35.790 --> 01:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
very obvious to uh boers and and uh
 
01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:36.790 align:start position:0%
very obvious to uh boers and and uh

Patrol when a person is using these
 
01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
types of devices on a sandbar for the
 
01:37:43.629 --> 01:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
day uh to go swimming instead of
 
01:37:46.149 --> 01:37:46.159 align:start position:0%
deploying an anchor that's an obvious
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
different intent and use of these
 
01:37:50.390 --> 01:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
devices it's the fact that they are
 
01:37:53.629 --> 01:37:53.639 align:start position:0%
leaving them on a routine basis over
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
night for the night
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
unoccupied um and in some cases for the
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
entire season uh that that we're looking
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
01:38:07.870 --> 01:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
prohibit H up thank you Mr chair um
 
01:38:09.709 --> 01:38:09.719 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking my
 
01:38:09.719 --> 01:38:11.229 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking my
question

01:38:11.229 --> 01:38:11.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
um you just pointed out the the concern
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
that I've heard among some fishermen uh
 
01:38:18.910 --> 01:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
bass fishermen that use um sometimes
 
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
they call them spuds sometimes they call
 
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
them um some other things but they
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
basically are the same thing they
 
01:38:26.790 --> 01:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
basically plant the device I don't in
 
01:38:29.589 --> 01:38:29.599 align:start position:0%
reading the text of the RSA I don't see
 
01:38:32.870 --> 01:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
anywhere where a moing is for overnight
 
01:38:36.109 --> 01:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
and so um I wonder if there needs to be
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
some clarification that this doesn't
 
01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
affect those categories that you just
 
01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
described which are um you know people
 
01:38:45.910 --> 01:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
more you know people effectively
 
01:38:47.350 --> 01:38:47.360 align:start position:0%
anchoring for the day but using these
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
devices to anchor for the day or in
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
particular fishermen that are just like
 
01:38:53.149 --> 01:38:53.159 align:start position:0%
setting up outside of you know show you
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
know sh or something like
 
01:38:57.430 --> 01:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question I I
 
01:39:02.149 --> 01:39:02.159 align:start position:0%
think a simple um uh use of the term
 
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
occupied uh would make all the
 
01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
difference in the world uh and and
 
01:39:09.270 --> 01:39:09.280 align:start position:0%
Define if you want to Define occupied as
 
01:39:12.390 --> 01:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
as uh the boat's owner uh or occupants
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
being within a certain distance of the
 
01:39:17.669 --> 01:39:17.679 align:start position:0%
boat whatever we may come up with um
 
01:39:19.870 --> 01:39:19.880 align:start position:0%
certainly clears that up uh there are
 
01:39:22.750 --> 01:39:22.760 align:start position:0%
there are laws already um on our books
 
01:39:26.109 --> 01:39:26.119 align:start position:0%
that prohibit overnight Ming uh and and
 
01:39:29.470 --> 01:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:32.109 --> 01:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
devices any
 
01:39:34.750 --> 01:39:34.760 align:start position:0%
questions I have one Captain you
 
01:39:36.910 --> 01:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned a perhaps an amendment to
 
01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
exempt Marine construction I know when
 
01:39:42.350 --> 01:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
we deal with the do they always want an
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
exception for any state Vehicles doing
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
any work and if what if they're out
 
01:39:49.390 --> 01:39:49.400 align:start position:0%
there working on dams or something
 
01:39:52.589 --> 01:39:52.599 align:start position:0%
should that um Amendment include some
 
01:39:55.750 --> 01:39:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:58.070 --> 01:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
State Mr chairman absolutely that would
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
be fine um we we've done that with uh
 
01:40:03.149 --> 01:40:03.159 align:start position:0%
seasonal platforms that came before this
 
01:40:05.470 --> 01:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
committee a couple of years ago where uh
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
we Exempted folks who were engaged in in
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
Marine construction uh Bridge work even
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
doing biological studies and surveys uh
 
01:40:16.629 --> 01:40:16.639 align:start position:0%
of our water conditions so that
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
certainly uh goes beyond the intent of
 
01:40:22.270 --> 01:40:22.280 align:start position:0%
of this bill uh and perhaps even
 
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
mentioning so that that there is no
 
01:40:27.550 --> 01:40:27.560 align:start position:0%
confusion although the permitting uh
 
01:40:30.270 --> 01:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
requirements are different uh we may
 
01:40:33.550 --> 01:40:33.560 align:start position:0%
want to say instead of um public Waters
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
mention Inland Waters because as we know
 
01:40:37.589 --> 01:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
the Sea Coast and Moorings a whole
 
01:40:39.550 --> 01:40:39.560 align:start position:0%
different a whole different game uh on
 
01:40:40.950 --> 01:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
our Coastal
 
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
Waters thank you anyone else have any
 
01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Captain appreciate

01:41:07.629 --> 01:41:07.639 align:start position:0%
for taking my comments um Judith Ericson
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
my husband and I are part of a family
 
01:41:13.550 --> 01:41:13.560 align:start position:0%
trust that owns property at 60 de Cove
 
01:41:17.589 --> 01:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
Road o New Hampshire and our neighbors
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
the buzzells are also joining us in my
 
01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
comments uh r2d s have an easement in
 
01:41:28.229 --> 01:41:28.239 align:start position:0%
favor of people behind us who
 
01:41:30.669 --> 01:41:30.679 align:start position:0%
historically came to the camp before the
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
houses were sold individually and so
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
they have an easement of 8 feet to the
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
beach this does not qualify them for a
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
moing but one of the people behind us
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
has been using the integral Boat Lifts
 
01:41:47.589 --> 01:41:47.599 align:start position:0%
to park his boat for the entire season
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
in front of the
 
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
easement he knows he can't get a moing
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
permit but he is happy to tell you how
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
smart he is uh in getting around the
 
01:41:56.639 --> 01:41:57.510 align:start position:0%
smart he is uh in getting around the
moing

01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
moing
 
01:42:02.589 --> 01:42:02.599 align:start position:0%
laws so our concern is that he has also
 
01:42:04.669 --> 01:42:04.679 align:start position:0%
stated his intent to acquire more
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
property and park more boats there we
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
also observe that there's a
 
01:42:13.870 --> 01:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
proliferation of boats on sea legs
 
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
around Lake
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
oapi you know when someone has one moing
 
01:42:21.709 --> 01:42:21.719 align:start position:0%
you can tell pretty easily that they've
 
01:42:23.950 --> 01:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
got another one outside of the
 
01:42:26.109 --> 01:42:26.119 align:start position:0%
regulations but there's a lot of condo
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
associations and it's in those areas we
 
01:42:31.589 --> 01:42:31.599 align:start position:0%
see a lot of proliferation of boats on
 
01:42:31.599 --> 01:42:32.790 align:start position:0%
see a lot of proliferation of boats on
sea

01:42:32.790 --> 01:42:32.800 align:start position:0%
sea
 
01:42:35.950 --> 01:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
legs you know seven Moorings 10 Moorings
 
01:42:38.350 --> 01:42:38.360 align:start position:0%
who's counting it's hard to enforce
 
01:42:42.510 --> 01:42:42.520 align:start position:0%
that we're also concerned that we know
 
01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
our neighbors have been historically
 
01:42:46.629 --> 01:42:46.639 align:start position:0%
renting out their docks and their
 
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
Moorings and contrary contrary to the
 
01:42:51.950 --> 01:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
regulations partly because the property
 
01:42:54.310 --> 01:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
taxes on beach FR property are really
 
01:42:57.430 --> 01:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
high and so we fully expect that people
 
01:43:00.910 --> 01:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
would try to offset their property taxes
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
by either renting their docks or in this
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
case renting their beach access because
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
really as long as you have access as the
 
01:43:13.149 --> 01:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
St state policeman said in the case of
 
01:43:15.870 --> 01:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
the library C Crossing anyone could put
 
01:43:18.310 --> 01:43:18.320 align:start position:0%
a boat on sea Lakes anywhere in the
 
01:43:20.350 --> 01:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
water so long as they can walk through
 
01:43:25.030 --> 01:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
the water to some access and so if
 
01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
people decide to allow that access and
 
01:43:30.669 --> 01:43:30.679 align:start position:0%
the this situation is not covered by the
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
moing law then really any number of
 
01:43:35.550 --> 01:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
boats could be anywhere and that's our
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
concern so we don't in any way want to
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
hamper Fisher people fishing at all
 
01:43:46.510 --> 01:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
that's not our problem our problem is
 
01:43:48.990 --> 01:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
with the boats that we see consistently
 
01:43:52.629 --> 01:43:52.639 align:start position:0%
parked for the entire season on sea legs
 
01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
next to the shore sometimes in front of
 
01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
other people's property um and that's
 
01:44:01.709 --> 01:44:01.719 align:start position:0%
the situation we would like to have more
 
01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
uh fully captured in the moing laws
 
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
which is the intent of the law is to
 
01:44:10.870 --> 01:44:10.880 align:start position:0%
regulate and limit the number of boats
 
01:44:13.109 --> 01:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
and to keep it safe and the more boats
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
there are the more traffic and
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
collisions there's likely to be so we
 
01:44:21.070 --> 01:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
support a change in the law to include
 
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
this situation as a moing so that it can
 
01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:26.189 align:start position:0%
this situation as a moing so that it can
be

01:44:26.189 --> 01:44:26.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
regulated thank you very much thank you
 
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
any questions for our

industry um we saw this bill and had
 
01:45:17.589 --> 01:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
talked to Marine patrols didn't have any
 
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
concerns about it but we did get a
 
01:45:22.030 --> 01:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
concern as as um Captain Dunley said
 
01:45:23.790 --> 01:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
from our marine contract contractor U
 
01:45:25.589 --> 01:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
members uh one of the members couldn't
 
01:45:27.149 --> 01:45:27.159 align:start position:0%
be here today so he asked me just to
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
bring up we'd love to see the amendment
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
that's being talked about um when
 
01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
they're doing work on someone's property
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
they use these spuds for their barges to
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
bring out the various equipment and um
 
01:45:41.229 --> 01:45:41.239 align:start position:0%
expertise that they need to make those
 
01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
fixes and they feel that this would
 
01:45:45.229 --> 01:45:45.239 align:start position:0%
potentially um prohibit that and that
 
01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
would be a concern for them so if
 
01:45:49.149 --> 01:45:49.159 align:start position:0%
there's a way to make sure that we're
 
01:45:51.870 --> 01:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
carving out that commercial application
 
01:45:53.950 --> 01:45:53.960 align:start position:0%
um we would ask that be
 
01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
considered thank you thank you Jody any
 
01:45:59.390 --> 01:45:59.400 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
01:46:05.229 --> 01:46:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
you and if I could ask Captain Don Levy
 
01:46:09.790 --> 01:46:09.800 align:start position:0%
since you're still hear a question who
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
do you think's going to be submitting
 
01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:12.310 align:start position:0%

you good afternoon it is uh after 1
 
03:03:13.150 --> 03:03:13.160 align:start position:0%
o'clock I'm going to call uh the hearing
 
03:03:19.110 --> 03:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
on HB 422 FN to order and uh our Prime
 
03:03:20.790 --> 03:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
sponsors here with us again
 
03:03:20.800 --> 03:03:26.429 align:start position:0%
sponsors here with us again

03:03:26.429 --> 03:03:26.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:29.229 --> 03:03:29.239 align:start position:0%
Ron thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
03:03:32.190 --> 03:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
committee and um just for the record my
 
03:03:33.910 --> 03:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
name is Rosemary rang I represent
 
03:03:36.429 --> 03:03:36.439 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 12 which is the town of
 
03:03:41.309 --> 03:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
miramac and this may be a jinx but HB
 
03:03:44.790 --> 03:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
422 is essentially a housekeeping bill
 
03:03:48.630 --> 03:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
um back in 1991 when the Shoreline water
 
03:03:50.910 --> 03:03:50.920 align:start position:0%
quality protection act was put into
 
03:03:53.750 --> 03:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
statute it called for a
 
03:03:58.910 --> 03:03:58.920 align:start position:0%
$5,000 um fines and
 
03:04:01.790 --> 03:04:01.800 align:start position:0%
it understanding um and observing what I
 
03:04:04.790 --> 03:04:04.800 align:start position:0%
do in The Lakes Region when I'm there um
 
03:04:07.950 --> 03:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
$5,000 really isn't a deterrent um
 
03:04:10.590 --> 03:04:10.600 align:start position:0%
people spend that on the drawer pools
 
03:04:14.790 --> 03:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
for their kitchen so um I went into the
 
03:04:17.309 --> 03:04:17.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor Statistics has a CPI
 
03:04:17.319 --> 03:04:18.469 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor Statistics has a CPI
calcul

03:04:18.469 --> 03:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
calcul
 
03:04:21.710 --> 03:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
to um find out what that 5,000 would be
 
03:04:24.830 --> 03:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
in today's dollars and it comes out back
 
03:04:26.790 --> 03:04:26.800 align:start position:0%
in November when I ran the calculation
 
03:04:31.389 --> 03:04:31.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:35.830 --> 03:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
$1,796 so when I was drafting this
 
03:04:38.510 --> 03:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
legislation I rounded that up to
 
03:04:42.110 --> 03:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
15,000 and it still gives um Superior
 
03:04:44.469 --> 03:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
Court Dees they don't have to go that
 
03:04:46.349 --> 03:04:46.359 align:start position:0%
high it's just raising the ceiling of
 
03:04:48.469 --> 03:04:48.479 align:start position:0%
where they can go
 
03:04:52.429 --> 03:04:52.439 align:start position:0%
and as I mentioned in the the um uh as
 
03:04:54.590 --> 03:04:54.600 align:start position:0%
I've mentioned before a lot of times
 
03:04:56.870 --> 03:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
this this types of legislation it's not
 
03:05:01.110 --> 03:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
an um one of the purposes of it is also
 
03:05:03.269 --> 03:05:03.279 align:start position:0%
just to drive a culture of Lake
 
03:05:05.750 --> 03:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
stewardship so when people see wow this
 
03:05:09.870 --> 03:05:09.880 align:start position:0%
is a $155,000 fine um or I I can't do
 
03:05:13.229 --> 03:05:13.239 align:start position:0%
this anymore it is it creates a a
 
03:05:15.190 --> 03:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
culture where people are going to take
 
03:05:17.910 --> 03:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
more individual responsibility um for
 
03:05:20.229 --> 03:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
their behaviors around lakes and if they
 
03:05:22.870 --> 03:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
know that wow I could get hit for
 
03:05:25.950 --> 03:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
$15,000 if I do this it's it's a
 
03:05:28.070 --> 03:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
stronger deterrent than 5,000 is and
 
03:05:30.269 --> 03:05:30.279 align:start position:0%
that's really what this is doing it's
 
03:05:33.469 --> 03:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
really trying to draw a line in the sand
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
that violating the shoreline water
 
03:05:40.110 --> 03:05:40.120 align:start position:0%
quality protection act is not something
 
03:05:43.590 --> 03:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
that is going to be facilitated or
 
03:05:45.830 --> 03:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
acceptable to the state that it's
 
03:05:48.190 --> 03:05:48.200 align:start position:0%
important enough to comply
 
03:05:50.510 --> 03:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
that if you don't comply there's going
 
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
to be a lot of negative repercussions
 
03:05:55.429 --> 03:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
and one of them is that you're a risk of
 
03:05:58.349 --> 03:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:01.110 --> 03:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
$155,000 so I'd be happy to take any
 
03:06:03.030 --> 03:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
questions any questions for the
 
03:06:10.790 --> 03:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:13.190 --> 03:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
ghoul okay sorry about that thank you
 
03:06:15.590 --> 03:06:15.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and uh somebody
 
03:06:17.630 --> 03:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
asked me actually to ask you this type
 
03:06:21.269 --> 03:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
the question uh maybe the person does
 
03:06:24.389 --> 03:06:24.399 align:start position:0%
not know you know the laws involved here
 
03:06:27.269 --> 03:06:27.279 align:start position:0%
but for example if there were leaves
 
03:06:29.710 --> 03:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
near the border of the
 
03:06:33.269 --> 03:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
water or the person put in a rock to put
 
03:06:35.990 --> 03:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
a so that Turtles can go on the Rock and
 
03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:37.269 align:start position:0%
a so that Turtles can go on the Rock and
and

03:06:37.269 --> 03:06:37.279 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:06:40.429 --> 03:06:40.439 align:start position:0%
sunbathe um if say you had a neighbor
 
03:06:42.110 --> 03:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
that didn't like you very much and they
 
03:06:44.550 --> 03:06:44.560 align:start position:0%
said oh you know they're doing something
 
03:06:46.750 --> 03:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
is something like that applicable to all
 
03:06:48.870 --> 03:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
these laws or
 
03:06:51.630 --> 03:06:51.640 align:start position:0%
not yeah I I'd have to review the
 
03:06:53.670 --> 03:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
shoreline water quality protection act I
 
03:06:55.550 --> 03:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
know that we have a there is someone
 
03:06:57.830 --> 03:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
here from Dees Darlene Force who could
 
03:06:59.469 --> 03:06:59.479 align:start position:0%
probably she's here to answer any
 
03:07:01.349 --> 03:07:01.359 align:start position:0%
questions if anyone has so she could
 
03:07:06.349 --> 03:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
probably address that um but as far as
 
03:07:08.950 --> 03:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
you know having that that neighbor
 
03:07:12.030 --> 03:07:12.040 align:start position:0%
interaction I know that if there is I
 
03:07:14.070 --> 03:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
know many people that live on lakes and
 
03:07:17.229 --> 03:07:17.239 align:start position:0%
if they were seeing a neighbor starting
 
03:07:20.229 --> 03:07:20.239 align:start position:0%
up a chainsaw to clearcut their their
 
03:07:22.070 --> 03:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
boundary with the wad their
 
03:07:24.070 --> 03:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
Shoreline they would say did you know
 
03:07:26.750 --> 03:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
that's against the law and and you could
 
03:07:29.030 --> 03:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
be finded just an Administration find up
 
03:07:31.389 --> 03:07:31.399 align:start position:0%
to $155,000 that person may not even
 
03:07:34.830 --> 03:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
know but it does like I said establish
 
03:07:37.750 --> 03:07:37.760 align:start position:0%
that culture it gives Lake stewards an
 
03:07:40.870 --> 03:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to reiterate to their
 
03:07:44.670 --> 03:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
neighbors that um there's penalties for
 
03:07:48.670 --> 03:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
violating that act um and I think
 
03:07:51.590 --> 03:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
$155,000 gets people's attention more
 
03:07:55.469 --> 03:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
than in today's dollars than $5,000 does
 
03:07:56.389 --> 03:07:56.399 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that answers your
 
03:07:58.269 --> 03:07:58.279 align:start position:0%
question but there's different things in
 
03:08:00.750 --> 03:08:00.760 align:start position:0%
the shoreline protection act and and as
 
03:08:00.760 --> 03:08:02.110 align:start position:0%
the shoreline protection act and and as
I

03:08:02.110 --> 03:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:08:05.910 --> 03:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
said I would expect that if Dees was
 
03:08:08.670 --> 03:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
called on a complaint like that they
 
03:08:10.950 --> 03:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
would exercise good judgment on what's
 
03:08:14.510 --> 03:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
valid this isn't um compulsory on the
 
03:08:16.309 --> 03:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
part of the department or the courts to
 
03:08:18.030 --> 03:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
issue it they still could they could
 
03:08:21.030 --> 03:08:21.040 align:start position:0%
wave a fine um but it does give them
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
latitude to go higher than the existing
 
03:08:27.190 --> 03:08:27.200 align:start position:0%
um fine limit does thank you thank you
 
03:08:31.229 --> 03:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question any other
 
03:08:34.550 --> 03:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative thank you Mr
 
03:08:37.830 --> 03:08:37.840 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you have there been
 
03:08:41.229 --> 03:08:41.239 align:start position:0%
violations in the past where people just
 
03:08:44.309 --> 03:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
wanted it like it was worth pay a000
 
03:08:53.550 --> 03:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:56.830 --> 03:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
um I would I would ask Miss Force to
 
03:08:59.510 --> 03:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
address that but anecdotally I do know
 
03:09:03.670 --> 03:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
of one situation where um a a lake
 
03:09:06.389 --> 03:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
resident he was allowed to build his own
 
03:09:08.349 --> 03:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
septic system design and build his own
 
03:09:12.830 --> 03:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
septic system um and we've last term we
 
03:09:15.070 --> 03:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
actually changed the law to disallow
 
03:09:17.590 --> 03:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
people from doing that you know that had
 
03:09:20.990 --> 03:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
to be approved by Dees and it was
 
03:09:23.269 --> 03:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
draining on his neighbor's property but
 
03:09:27.150 --> 03:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
it that neighbor spent tens of thousands
 
03:09:29.790 --> 03:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
of dollars on legal fees and finally
 
03:09:32.630 --> 03:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
after a few years Dees came in and did
 
03:09:36.590 --> 03:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
fine um and under that current law he
 
03:09:39.190 --> 03:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
was allowed to do that I think I forget
 
03:09:42.550 --> 03:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
what it was um representative you
 
03:09:45.830 --> 03:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
remember we we used to allow licensed
 
03:09:48.469 --> 03:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
contractors to be B to design and build
 
03:09:51.389 --> 03:09:51.399 align:start position:0%
their own septic systems and oh you had
 
03:09:54.389 --> 03:09:54.399 align:start position:0%
to be a New Hampshire resident and that
 
03:09:57.469 --> 03:09:57.479 align:start position:0%
went away but when it was still in force
 
03:09:59.990 --> 03:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
this person definitely flaunted it and
 
03:10:02.710 --> 03:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
he did get he did get fined but it took
 
03:10:04.229 --> 03:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
a while and it took a lot of money on
 
03:10:06.590 --> 03:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
the part of the neighbor in private
 
03:10:06.600 --> 03:10:08.349 align:start position:0%
the part of the neighbor in private
legal

03:10:08.349 --> 03:10:08.359 align:start position:0%
legal
 
03:10:11.590 --> 03:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
fees yeah thank you for the question
 
03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:12.429 align:start position:0%
fees yeah thank you for the question

and support the bill Elizabeth Harper
 
03:10:23.389 --> 03:10:23.399 align:start position:0%
Lake sopy protective
 
03:10:26.990 --> 03:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:29.510 --> 03:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
minute hi my name is Elizabeth Harper
 
03:10:30.910 --> 03:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
I'm the executive director of the lake
 
03:10:33.550 --> 03:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
sopy protective Association uh and our
 
03:10:35.190 --> 03:10:35.200 align:start position:0%
mission as an organization is to
 
03:10:36.710 --> 03:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
preserve and enhance the environmental
 
03:10:39.790 --> 03:10:39.800 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the Lake sopy Region um the
 
03:10:41.870 --> 03:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
sh Shoreland water quality protection
 
03:10:44.269 --> 03:10:44.279 align:start position:0%
act is an incredibly important tool in
 
03:10:46.309 --> 03:10:46.319 align:start position:0%
protecting water quality for lakes ponds
 
03:10:47.910 --> 03:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
and streams
 
03:10:50.630 --> 03:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
um I I think representative DuPont's
 
03:10:52.750 --> 03:10:52.760 align:start position:0%
question was a good one and I can tell
 
03:10:55.389 --> 03:10:55.399 align:start position:0%
many stories of sort of how these
 
03:10:57.710 --> 03:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
penalties are perceived in in our
 
03:11:00.469 --> 03:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
Watershed and in our Lakes um I've heard
 
03:11:03.910 --> 03:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
contractors and homeowners refer to this
 
03:11:06.870 --> 03:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
type of a fine of $5,000 as the cost of
 
03:11:09.950 --> 03:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
doing business um I've had people with
 
03:11:12.389 --> 03:11:12.399 align:start position:0%
very good intentions who are even
 
03:11:14.030 --> 03:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
members of our organization and want to
 
03:11:15.950 --> 03:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
do the best for water quality who have
 
03:11:18.070 --> 03:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
said well if you want to cut down more
 
03:11:20.429 --> 03:11:20.439 align:start position:0%
trees you just have to pay a fee right
 
03:11:22.229 --> 03:11:22.239 align:start position:0%
so so they don't understand that it's
 
03:11:24.150 --> 03:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
illegal and that they're actually being
 
03:11:28.030 --> 03:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
fined because something's illegal so um
 
03:11:30.190 --> 03:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
adding more teeth to this by increasing
 
03:11:32.030 --> 03:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
the penalty makes it so much easier for
 
03:11:34.389 --> 03:11:34.399 align:start position:0%
us to educate the public and everyone
 
03:11:36.309 --> 03:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
that we're working with homeowners
 
03:11:38.429 --> 03:11:38.439 align:start position:0%
contractors zoning board planning board
 
03:11:40.830 --> 03:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
members um about the fact that this is
 
03:11:43.110 --> 03:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
really important and to have the backing
 
03:11:45.309 --> 03:11:45.319 align:start position:0%
of the state to say yes there are fines
 
03:11:47.429 --> 03:11:47.439 align:start position:0%
and this is a penalty it's not just a
 
03:11:49.590 --> 03:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
fee that you can pay if you want to cut
 
03:11:52.510 --> 03:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
more trees down um I think is very
 
03:11:56.790 --> 03:11:56.800 align:start position:0%
important um so we're in support of hb4
 
03:11:59.349 --> 03:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
22 um to increase the
 
03:12:02.349 --> 03:12:02.359 align:start position:0%
penalties any questions for the
 
03:12:05.030 --> 03:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
speaker seeing none thank you very much
 
03:12:09.750 --> 03:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
thank you also in favor Andrea Laro New
 
03:12:19.710 --> 03:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:21.750 --> 03:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh nice to see you all
 
03:12:24.070 --> 03:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
again I'm Andrea Laro president and
 
03:12:26.510 --> 03:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
policy advocate of New Hampshire Lakes
 
03:12:28.710 --> 03:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
um as you've heard our mission is to
 
03:12:29.990 --> 03:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
restore and preserve the health of our
 
03:12:32.030 --> 03:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
Lakes we're here to speak in support of
 
03:12:35.030 --> 03:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
this bill um I would we are in support
 
03:12:36.510 --> 03:12:36.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill for all the reasons that
 
03:12:38.670 --> 03:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
representative rang and and Elizabeth
 
03:12:43.550 --> 03:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
Harper uh just shared with you and I um
 
03:12:46.269 --> 03:12:46.279 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out that this would
 
03:12:47.990 --> 03:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
just enable the Department of
 
03:12:51.710 --> 03:12:51.720 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services to fine up to
 
03:12:54.469 --> 03:12:54.479 align:start position:0%
$515,000 uh we understand and appreciate
 
03:12:56.590 --> 03:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
that the department really doesn't like
 
03:12:59.590 --> 03:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
to fine folks they really like to do an
 
03:13:02.630 --> 03:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
education first approach um and my
 
03:13:04.429 --> 03:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the department
 
03:13:06.870 --> 03:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
would work very closely with someone who
 
03:13:09.070 --> 03:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
um violated the law because maybe they
 
03:13:11.030 --> 03:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
didn't know work with that person to
 
03:13:12.710 --> 03:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
help uh correct the problem without
 
03:13:14.550 --> 03:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
finding my understanding is that it
 
03:13:16.830 --> 03:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to the department to
 
03:13:21.110 --> 03:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
have potentially an an increased fine to
 
03:13:24.469 --> 03:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
um work with those folks who um don't
 
03:13:27.590 --> 03:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
cooperate with the Department um we and
 
03:13:30.309 --> 03:13:30.319 align:start position:0%
so in in some we do think that providing
 
03:13:33.070 --> 03:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
the department with the ability to raise
 
03:13:36.870 --> 03:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
doing an increased fine would serve as a
 
03:13:39.590 --> 03:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
deterrent uh to more folks to knowingly
 
03:13:43.429 --> 03:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
violate the law and to re reiterate what
 
03:13:45.229 --> 03:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth Harper said we are aware
 
03:13:48.349 --> 03:13:48.359 align:start position:0%
Statewide of organiz a reporting to us
 
03:13:51.750 --> 03:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
instances in which um folks may not be
 
03:13:54.269 --> 03:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
deterred um because they think it's just
 
03:13:56.550 --> 03:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
a a fee they might get assessed for
 
03:13:58.469 --> 03:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
doing something not in compliance with
 
03:14:01.550 --> 03:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
the act so with that we urge you to
 
03:14:05.910 --> 03:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
support this um housekeeping Bill any
 
03:14:08.150 --> 03:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
questions any
 
03:14:10.309 --> 03:14:10.319 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you again
 
03:14:17.389 --> 03:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:19.229 --> 03:14:19.239 align:start position:0%
I don't see that you filled out a pink
 
03:14:20.830 --> 03:14:20.840 align:start position:0%
card did you want to speak or you just
 
03:14:23.790 --> 03:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:26.670 --> 03:14:26.680 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any early
 
03:14:28.670 --> 03:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
enforced Dees I'm the Department's not
 
03:14:30.389 --> 03:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
taking a formal position but we were
 
03:14:33.590 --> 03:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions if anybody had
 
03:14:36.429 --> 03:14:36.439 align:start position:0%
them do anyone have a
 
03:14:39.710 --> 03:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
question representative Darby thank you
 
03:14:39.720 --> 03:14:41.070 align:start position:0%
question representative Darby thank you
Mr

03:14:41.070 --> 03:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
03:14:45.349 --> 03:14:45.359 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:14:49.389 --> 03:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
um sorry and my questions um can you
 
03:14:52.750 --> 03:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
give me examples of how frequent or can
 
03:14:54.349 --> 03:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
you let me know how frequently the
 
03:14:58.229 --> 03:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
department currently um uh issues
 
03:15:00.790 --> 03:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
penalties or fines I guess for violating
 
03:15:02.349 --> 03:15:02.359 align:start position:0%
their Shoreline protection act as
 
03:15:04.910 --> 03:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to uh working with the homeowner
 
03:15:08.750 --> 03:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:11.670 --> 03:15:11.680 align:start position:0%
situation uh the last time that I'm
 
03:15:15.229 --> 03:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
aware of us imposing a Shoreland fine
 
03:15:18.510 --> 03:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
was in fact in 2013 this body helped us
 
03:15:21.309 --> 03:15:21.319 align:start position:0%
to correct a flaw in our fine Authority
 
03:15:25.269 --> 03:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
last year that modification to the
 
03:15:27.309 --> 03:15:27.319 align:start position:0%
statute which will allow us to find
 
03:15:30.550 --> 03:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
people again went into effect on January
 
03:15:33.110 --> 03:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
1st so we haven't exactly had a lot of
 
03:15:37.110 --> 03:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
opportunity um but it is because finding
 
03:15:39.269 --> 03:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
someone does not actually achieve an
 
03:15:40.790 --> 03:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
environmental outcome it does not
 
03:15:43.469 --> 03:15:43.479 align:start position:0%
improve water quality as we testified
 
03:15:47.469 --> 03:15:47.479 align:start position:0%
last year our purpose for fines
 
03:15:49.990 --> 03:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
is leverage when we have someone who is
 
03:15:52.750 --> 03:15:52.760 align:start position:0%
not compliant frequently it
 
03:15:56.110 --> 03:15:56.120 align:start position:0%
is if you do not comply this would be
 
03:15:58.309 --> 03:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
the fine the fine is held in
 
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
abeyance that would be the standard
 
03:16:02.110 --> 03:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
policy for the way the department
 
03:16:04.510 --> 03:16:04.520 align:start position:0%
typically uses findes and other programs
 
03:16:10.790 --> 03:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:13.349 --> 03:16:13.359 align:start position:0%
anything representative
 
03:16:15.510 --> 03:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
Taylor thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:16:17.750 --> 03:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
for taking the question does this have
 
03:16:22.830 --> 03:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:24.870 --> 03:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
Dees I'm not sure what you mean by
 
03:16:27.910 --> 03:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
restoration cost to Dees uh that
 
03:16:32.870 --> 03:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
mentions a party not uh uh conforming to
 
03:16:35.510 --> 03:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
do restoration they may be fined so I
 
03:16:37.469 --> 03:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
assume that Dees would go ahead with
 
03:16:39.830 --> 03:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
those Restorations and seek restitution
 
03:16:42.469 --> 03:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
am I mistaken Dees does not have the
 
03:16:44.510 --> 03:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
capacity to conduct the restoration
 
03:16:46.670 --> 03:16:46.680 align:start position:0%
ourselves we would typically require
 
03:16:49.389 --> 03:16:49.399 align:start position:0%
that the person who committed the
 
03:16:53.189 --> 03:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
violation completes the res sub submits
 
03:16:55.550 --> 03:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
a restoration plan for approval and then
 
03:16:58.229 --> 03:16:58.239 align:start position:0%
completes that restoration where fines
 
03:17:00.950 --> 03:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
would become a factor is if they refuse
 
03:17:03.189 --> 03:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
to submit a restoration plan or refuse
 
03:17:06.389 --> 03:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
to engage in res uh in restoration or if
 
03:17:08.150 --> 03:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
the Damage Done is
 
03:17:10.510 --> 03:17:10.520 align:start position:0%
irreparable so it doesn't affect any
 
03:17:12.510 --> 03:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
cost on restoration to
 
03:17:15.469 --> 03:17:15.479 align:start position:0%
us thank you thank you representative
 
03:17:15.479 --> 03:17:17.309 align:start position:0%
us thank you thank you representative
donelly

03:17:17.309 --> 03:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
donelly
 
03:17:20.990 --> 03:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair you just mentioned
 
03:17:24.429 --> 03:17:24.439 align:start position:0%
that in it was back in 2013 was the last
 
03:17:24.439 --> 03:17:25.550 align:start position:0%
that in it was back in 2013 was the last
time

03:17:25.550 --> 03:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:17:29.150 --> 03:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
you gave a fine out for
 
03:17:32.670 --> 03:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
$5,000 uh 2013 was the last time we find
 
03:17:35.189 --> 03:17:35.199 align:start position:0%
anyone anything in
 
03:17:38.950 --> 03:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
Shoreland so I guess my question is do
 
03:17:43.150 --> 03:17:43.160 align:start position:0%
you feel that increasing this will
 
03:17:48.030 --> 03:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
enable you to find more people
 
03:17:50.950 --> 03:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
it will not make any difference in our
 
03:17:53.990 --> 03:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
ability to find people it's just a
 
03:17:55.910 --> 03:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
matter of the size of the leverage that
 
03:17:59.309 --> 03:17:59.319 align:start position:0%
we can bring to B in the future when our
 
03:18:01.670 --> 03:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
ability to if it becomes necessary to
 
03:18:04.830 --> 03:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
use that leverage it's a bigger
 
03:18:08.429 --> 03:18:08.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:12.349 --> 03:18:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:14.910 --> 03:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
questions hearing none I'll go back to
 
03:18:16.790 --> 03:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative Darby thank you again
 
03:18:19.309 --> 03:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
again Mr chair thank you Miss forest for
 
03:18:20.990 --> 03:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
the question taking my question you
 
03:18:23.670 --> 03:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um the cases I think I
 
03:18:27.510 --> 03:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
understood the cases where um DS would
 
03:18:32.870 --> 03:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
um find is um if the if the owner uh
 
03:18:34.790 --> 03:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
refused to perform the restoration or if
 
03:18:37.389 --> 03:18:37.399 align:start position:0%
the damage was irreparable so can you
 
03:18:39.790 --> 03:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
describe an example of the irreparable
 
03:18:42.150 --> 03:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
damage that where where there would be a
 
03:18:42.160 --> 03:18:50.189 align:start position:0%
damage that where where there would be a
fine

03:18:50.189 --> 03:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:51.710 --> 03:18:51.720 align:start position:0%
which is a little bit difficult because
 
03:18:56.110 --> 03:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
we do have some Active cases so I'll
 
03:18:56.120 --> 03:18:57.710 align:start position:0%
we do have some Active cases so I'll
generalize

03:18:57.710 --> 03:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
generalize
 
03:19:00.110 --> 03:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
um where you are dealing for instance
 
03:19:01.389 --> 03:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
with steep
 
03:19:01.399 --> 03:19:03.110 align:start position:0%
with steep
slopes

03:19:03.110 --> 03:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
slopes
 
03:19:04.910 --> 03:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
and an
 
03:19:04.920 --> 03:19:06.070 align:start position:0%
and an
[Music]

03:19:06.070 --> 03:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:19:09.030 --> 03:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
individual who had the ability to retain
 
03:19:11.950 --> 03:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
Woodland buffer and who had a permit for
 
03:19:15.030 --> 03:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
a limited amount of clearing to replace
 
03:19:17.870 --> 03:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
and rebuild a home might say exceed
 
03:19:17.880 --> 03:19:19.469 align:start position:0%
and rebuild a home might say exceed
their

03:19:19.469 --> 03:19:19.479 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:19:22.590 --> 03:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
clearance um not maintain proper
 
03:19:24.950 --> 03:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
construction or stabilization practices
 
03:19:27.070 --> 03:19:27.080 align:start position:0%
lose control of their slopes Wipe Out
 
03:19:28.910 --> 03:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
the entire lot work through the cease
 
03:19:31.510 --> 03:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
and desist orderorder for eight
 
03:19:31.520 --> 03:19:35.030 align:start position:0%
and desist orderorder for eight
months

03:19:35.030 --> 03:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:35.040 --> 03:19:36.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:19:36.910 --> 03:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:39.830 --> 03:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
and possibly violate the consent
 
03:19:43.510 --> 03:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
agreement a year later would be a nice
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have the extra leverage
 
03:19:45.600 --> 03:19:47.469 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have the extra leverage
to

03:19:47.469 --> 03:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:19:49.429 --> 03:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
say this could become costly if you
 
03:19:54.349 --> 03:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:57.070 --> 03:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
behavior anyone
 
03:20:00.229 --> 03:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
else thank you appreciate you
 
03:20:02.790 --> 03:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
testifying I have no more pin cards is
 
03:20:06.670 --> 03:20:06.680 align:start position:0%
there anyone else to testify on HB 422
 
03:20:09.870 --> 03:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
FN seeing none I'll close this hearing
 
03:20:13.150 --> 03:20:13.160 align:start position:0%

03:47:29.070 --> 03:47:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's about 1:46 I'm going to open the
 
03:47:31.630 --> 03:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
03:47:34.630 --> 03:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
449 requiring water districts to provide
 
03:47:37.269 --> 03:47:37.279 align:start position:0%
a water filtration system to residential
 
03:47:40.550 --> 03:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
customers in certain cases and I call on
 
03:47:43.189 --> 03:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor representative Maguire
 
03:47:45.229 --> 03:47:45.239 align:start position:0%
who's going to talk to us today thank
 
03:47:46.950 --> 03:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman members of the committee
 
03:47:49.349 --> 03:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Dan Maguire I
 
03:47:51.870 --> 03:47:51.880 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Epsom and this
 
03:47:55.269 --> 03:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
bill is result of situation we have in
 
03:47:57.990 --> 03:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
Epsom but I didn't write it just for
 
03:48:01.030 --> 03:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
Epsom because uh I wrote it in a in a
 
03:48:04.030 --> 03:48:04.040 align:start position:0%
more General way because I can't imagine
 
03:48:04.040 --> 03:48:04.910 align:start position:0%
more General way because I can't imagine
that

03:48:04.910 --> 03:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:48:08.189 --> 03:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
somehow you know the other
 
03:48:11.349 --> 03:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
250 um communities in the state there
 
03:48:14.269 --> 03:48:14.279 align:start position:0%
might be someone who finds themselves in
 
03:48:17.110 --> 03:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
in a similar situation and would could
 
03:48:20.149 --> 03:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
make use of this so here's our so I'll
 
03:48:21.510 --> 03:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
have to tell the story of what's going
 
03:48:26.630 --> 03:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
on so um gen epsom's about 5,000 people
 
03:48:29.229 --> 03:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
which means we have maybe
 
03:48:34.149 --> 03:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
2,200 households and of those 300 are on
 
03:48:36.630 --> 03:48:36.640 align:start position:0%
a water district and the rest all have
 
03:48:39.349 --> 03:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
individual Wells so very small part of
 
03:48:42.870 --> 03:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
the town maybe 15% or so or in this
 
03:48:45.110 --> 03:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
water district and it tends to the
 
03:48:48.830 --> 03:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
smaller more compact area of town and
 
03:48:52.110 --> 03:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
this particular water district has uh
 
03:48:55.910 --> 03:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
two Wells that they pump water from one
 
03:48:59.990 --> 03:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
is next to Route four so um and and I
 
03:49:02.149 --> 03:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
don't know what they have 50,000 cars a
 
03:49:05.469 --> 03:49:05.479 align:start position:0%
day or something no problems at all the
 
03:49:09.189 --> 03:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
other well is next to our school and and
 
03:49:12.110 --> 03:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
it's been testing um a little too high
 
03:49:12.120 --> 03:49:13.110 align:start position:0%
it's been testing um a little too high
for

03:49:13.110 --> 03:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:49:17.550 --> 03:49:17.560 align:start position:0%
pasas so um it it apparently the the um
 
03:49:21.510 --> 03:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
limit on P is 12 parts per trillion and
 
03:49:23.269 --> 03:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
this well is right around there
 
03:49:25.070 --> 03:49:25.080 align:start position:0%
something in the so it's been failing
 
03:49:29.110 --> 03:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
the past test um and when I asked
 
03:49:32.030 --> 03:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
Dees why is the one near the busy road
 
03:49:33.870 --> 03:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
no problem and the one near the school
 
03:49:35.630 --> 03:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
when there's never been any industrial
 
03:49:38.389 --> 03:49:38.399 align:start position:0%
activity failing for past they said well
 
03:49:40.990 --> 03:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
we we really don't know maybe they wax
 
03:49:43.830 --> 03:49:43.840 align:start position:0%
their floors too much you know in the
 
03:49:48.630 --> 03:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
school so um so that's one problem and
 
03:49:50.510 --> 03:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
um and so the question is what to do
 
03:49:54.830 --> 03:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
about it and um
 
03:49:58.189 --> 03:49:58.199 align:start position:0%
basically um Dees there's there's a
 
03:50:00.990 --> 03:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
slightly there's a slight complication
 
03:50:04.550 --> 03:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
because um this particular well and its
 
03:50:08.229 --> 03:50:08.239 align:start position:0%
wellhouse doesn't have room for the P
 
03:50:12.630 --> 03:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
filter FF filter um would cost roughly a
 
03:50:15.750 --> 03:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
million dollars and it's pretty s able
 
03:50:18.510 --> 03:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
and so and the other problem is this
 
03:50:22.030 --> 03:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
particular well is in an area where 20
 
03:50:24.950 --> 03:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
years ago we had a flood and the flood
 
03:50:28.710 --> 03:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
caused the river to change and rather
 
03:50:31.590 --> 03:50:31.600 align:start position:0%
than put a dam in to put the river where
 
03:50:33.950 --> 03:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
it used to be the river was allowed to
 
03:50:36.070 --> 03:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
meander somewhere else and the ne
 
03:50:38.950 --> 03:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
consequence is this well is now in a
 
03:50:42.269 --> 03:50:42.279 align:start position:0%
flood plane okay that it it it didn't
 
03:50:47.030 --> 03:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
used to be in but but it is now and um
 
03:50:49.550 --> 03:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
so it's not it shouldn't that should be
 
03:50:52.229 --> 03:50:52.239 align:start position:0%
fixed too right I mean the the wellhouse
 
03:50:54.269 --> 03:50:54.279 align:start position:0%
the pump house for this well should
 
03:50:56.189 --> 03:50:56.199 align:start position:0%
needs to be moved elsewhere because it's
 
03:51:00.590 --> 03:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
in a flood plane so um the ne so the
 
03:51:03.870 --> 03:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
proposal um from Dees to the to the to
 
03:51:08.670 --> 03:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
the water district is um build yourself
 
03:51:10.950 --> 03:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
a new pump house up the hill somewhere
 
03:51:15.349 --> 03:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
else reroute the pipes to the pump house
 
03:51:18.070 --> 03:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
and back to your water system put make
 
03:51:20.189 --> 03:51:20.199 align:start position:0%
the make the pump house big enough to
 
03:51:24.030 --> 03:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
have all the P filtering bottom line $6
 
03:51:28.830 --> 03:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
million okay um well $6 million for for
 
03:51:31.750 --> 03:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
300 customers that's a lot of money
 
03:51:35.189 --> 03:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
right that's 20,000 a piece um and and
 
03:51:39.110 --> 03:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
what Dees says is we'll lend you the $6
 
03:51:42.590 --> 03:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
million 30-year mortgage low interest
 
03:51:47.469 --> 03:51:47.479 align:start position:0%
Etc and we will forgive 60% of that loan
 
03:51:49.070 --> 03:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
because we got Federal money we got
 
03:51:51.830 --> 03:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
State money we got various things and so
 
03:51:54.349 --> 03:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
your cost for this is only 2 and A5
 
03:51:58.149 --> 03:51:58.159 align:start position:0%
million so that's not bad right and but
 
03:52:00.630 --> 03:52:00.640 align:start position:0%
if you look if you work out the numbers
 
03:52:02.469 --> 03:52:02.479 align:start position:0%
the people in this particular water
 
03:52:05.110 --> 03:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
district normal their normal water bill
 
03:52:08.870 --> 03:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
today is roughly $100 a quarter and that
 
03:52:11.349 --> 03:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
would go to something between $200 and
 
03:52:13.990 --> 03:52:14.000 align:start position:0%
$250 a quarter right so we're talking
 
03:52:16.910 --> 03:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
about more than a 100% increase in their
 
03:52:20.349 --> 03:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
water bills and they're understandably
 
03:52:22.149 --> 03:52:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh not happy about
 
03:52:26.110 --> 03:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
that um and so what the purpose of this
 
03:52:29.590 --> 03:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
bill is to give them an alternative
 
03:52:32.550 --> 03:52:32.560 align:start position:0%
because when you when I asked Dees so so
 
03:52:35.269 --> 03:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
the way this works is they would have to
 
03:52:36.990 --> 03:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
borrow the Six Million they would have
 
03:52:39.830 --> 03:52:39.840 align:start position:0%
to vote to borrow the $6 million right
 
03:52:42.349 --> 03:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
so the the people who were in this water
 
03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
district they have an elected board and
 
03:52:46.510 --> 03:52:46.520 align:start position:0%
that sort of stuff so they have annual
 
03:52:49.750 --> 03:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
votes so so the board will propose to
 
03:52:52.349 --> 03:52:52.359 align:start position:0%
them let's borrow the money and here's
 
03:52:54.590 --> 03:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
the consequences and so on but the
 
03:52:57.389 --> 03:52:57.399 align:start position:0%
question is what happens if they vote no
 
03:52:58.790 --> 03:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
right because now you've got a
 
03:53:02.790 --> 03:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
non-complying system with the pasas uh
 
03:53:05.309 --> 03:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
not quite meeting the pasas requirements
 
03:53:07.670 --> 03:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
and it's in the flood planing and so
 
03:53:09.990 --> 03:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
according to De what happens in that
 
03:53:13.469 --> 03:53:13.479 align:start position:0%
case is they shut down the system they
 
03:53:15.870 --> 03:53:15.880 align:start position:0%
basically take the system system away
 
03:53:18.070 --> 03:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
from the elected board give it to
 
03:53:20.349 --> 03:53:20.359 align:start position:0%
somebody else the somebody else will
 
03:53:23.349 --> 03:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
borrow the money and and then charge the
 
03:53:26.030 --> 03:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
people for the $6 million you know the
 
03:53:28.710 --> 03:53:28.720 align:start position:0%
same deal but but it would happen so
 
03:53:31.149 --> 03:53:31.159 align:start position:0%
basically they're given a vote but it
 
03:53:33.110 --> 03:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter which way you vote
 
03:53:35.429 --> 03:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day it's going
 
03:53:38.429 --> 03:53:38.439 align:start position:0%
to happen the way the way Dees wants it
 
03:53:40.149 --> 03:53:40.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's the state of the law today
 
03:53:42.870 --> 03:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
as I understand it so this bill is to
 
03:53:45.269 --> 03:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
give them an alternative so
 
03:53:48.550 --> 03:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
what's expensive about this partly is
 
03:53:51.070 --> 03:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
moving the wellhouse out of the flood
 
03:53:54.910 --> 03:53:54.920 align:start position:0%
plane um and that may or may not be
 
03:53:57.149 --> 03:53:57.159 align:start position:0%
urgent right it doesn't it's been in
 
03:54:01.670 --> 03:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
this same spot for decades and working
 
03:54:05.110 --> 03:54:05.120 align:start position:0%
okay and all that but the also the P
 
03:54:09.550 --> 03:54:09.560 align:start position:0%
issue and um and the problem is it's
 
03:54:14.389 --> 03:54:14.399 align:start position:0%
it's expensive to to uh reduce every
 
03:54:17.910 --> 03:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
drop of water coming out of this well to
 
03:54:20.429 --> 03:54:20.439 align:start position:0%
12 Parts less than 12 parts per trillion
 
03:54:25.309 --> 03:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
of pasas right so so and and it's only
 
03:54:28.149 --> 03:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
crucial for what you drink right it's
 
03:54:30.389 --> 03:54:30.399 align:start position:0%
it's what you drink that counts you
 
03:54:32.670 --> 03:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
could wash your car with it as is you
 
03:54:34.950 --> 03:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
could you know wash your clothes your
 
03:54:37.830 --> 03:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
body water your lawn all this sort of
 
03:54:40.830 --> 03:54:40.840 align:start position:0%
stuff with the water as it is perfectly
 
03:54:43.469 --> 03:54:43.479 align:start position:0%
fine so what the bill says is if you
 
03:54:46.269 --> 03:54:46.279 align:start position:0%
find yourself the situation where your
 
03:54:49.070 --> 03:54:49.080 align:start position:0%
water is not portable right so you can't
 
03:54:53.269 --> 03:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
drink it but it's otherwise okay and you
 
03:54:58.149 --> 03:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
vote not to you not to accept a a fixed
 
03:55:00.710 --> 03:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
solution proposed by
 
03:55:04.030 --> 03:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
Dees then you'll have an alternative
 
03:55:08.110 --> 03:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
which is that you buy everyone in your
 
03:55:09.389 --> 03:55:09.399 align:start position:0%
all of your
 
03:55:13.670 --> 03:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
customers a um a filter for their
 
03:55:16.389 --> 03:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
kitchen right for their drinking water
 
03:55:20.030 --> 03:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
and their cooking water that would solve
 
03:55:23.349 --> 03:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
the problem for that water so so we
 
03:55:26.510 --> 03:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
estimate in this case that that instead
 
03:55:30.750 --> 03:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
of a $6 million cost the the cost of3
 
03:55:33.550 --> 03:55:33.560 align:start position:0%
such filters that would only be good
 
03:55:36.229 --> 03:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
enough for drinking water and not for
 
03:55:38.790 --> 03:55:38.800 align:start position:0%
every drop of water that would be under
 
03:55:41.510 --> 03:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
a million dollars so it'd be much more
 
03:55:44.830 --> 03:55:44.840 align:start position:0%
cost effective and so at least
 
03:55:47.990 --> 03:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
the the the point is um if the bill
 
03:55:51.070 --> 03:55:51.080 align:start position:0%
passes at least they have a choice right
 
03:55:52.349 --> 03:55:52.359 align:start position:0%
they can get the
 
03:55:56.469 --> 03:55:56.479 align:start position:0%
fullblown $6 million solution or they
 
03:55:58.670 --> 03:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
can get this other solution and I don't
 
03:56:01.750 --> 03:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
think that this solution U with the with
 
03:56:05.070 --> 03:56:05.080 align:start position:0%
the individual filters is so horrible
 
03:56:07.070 --> 03:56:07.080 align:start position:0%
because it's exactly what I have at my
 
03:56:10.710 --> 03:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
house and have had for close to 20 years
 
03:56:13.070 --> 03:56:13.080 align:start position:0%
right because the water that I get from
 
03:56:14.950 --> 03:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
I have an individual weal but the water
 
03:56:18.590 --> 03:56:18.600 align:start position:0%
that comes up from it is not it doesn't
 
03:56:21.510 --> 03:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
meet drinking water standards as as they
 
03:56:24.790 --> 03:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
exist today and so I have a I have a
 
03:56:28.110 --> 03:56:28.120 align:start position:0%
water softener that keeps my my Plumbing
 
03:56:30.870 --> 03:56:30.880 align:start position:0%
fixtures from looking orange but I also
 
03:56:33.110 --> 03:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
have a drinking water filter in my
 
03:56:35.950 --> 03:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
kitchen because I I you know I don't
 
03:56:38.110 --> 03:56:38.120 align:start position:0%
want as much arsenic or whatever it is
 
03:56:40.309 --> 03:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
that's that's in the water so so this is
 
03:56:44.510 --> 03:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
a common sort of situation that that
 
03:56:46.910 --> 03:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
I've lived with for you know like I said
 
03:56:49.469 --> 03:56:49.479 align:start position:0%
close to 20 years I'm sure many many
 
03:56:51.349 --> 03:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
other people do the same thing anybody
 
03:56:54.550 --> 03:56:54.560 align:start position:0%
who has an individual well has to have
 
03:56:57.189 --> 03:56:57.199 align:start position:0%
uh you know drinking water filters so um
 
03:56:58.550 --> 03:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
so that's all we're asking we're say
 
03:57:00.750 --> 03:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
sort of saying let's give them an
 
03:57:03.349 --> 03:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
alternative because the costs as you
 
03:57:05.950 --> 03:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
know over time these these these
 
03:57:07.870 --> 03:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
requirements are getting stricter and
 
03:57:10.269 --> 03:57:10.279 align:start position:0%
stricter and guess what the cost of that
 
03:57:13.110 --> 03:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
goes up and up and and eventually you
 
03:57:15.590 --> 03:57:15.600 align:start position:0%
know it gets Una affordable so I'm happy
 
03:57:19.710 --> 03:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
to answer questions representative na Mr
 
03:57:21.229 --> 03:57:21.239 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my town has past I
 
03:57:25.349 --> 03:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
have a past filtration system in my
 
03:57:28.469 --> 03:57:28.479 align:start position:0%
house so um my question to you is yeah
 
03:57:30.030 --> 03:57:30.040 align:start position:0%
if you make this requirement that the
 
03:57:31.950 --> 03:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
water district has to put this
 
03:57:33.630 --> 03:57:33.640 align:start position:0%
filtration system in the house but
 
03:57:34.750 --> 03:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement that the
 
03:57:37.189 --> 03:57:37.199 align:start position:0%
filtration system is serviced from that
 
03:57:40.429 --> 03:57:40.439 align:start position:0%
point forward aren't you sort of taking
 
03:57:42.469 --> 03:57:42.479 align:start position:0%
away the water system from those 300
 
03:57:45.110 --> 03:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
houses because in a year it's on them to
 
03:57:46.750 --> 03:57:46.760 align:start position:0%
test if they're if they have P pass if
 
03:57:49.670 --> 03:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
the filtration system still working if
 
03:57:52.149 --> 03:57:52.159 align:start position:0%
and if they don't service it ever
 
03:57:53.309 --> 03:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee about their water
 
03:57:55.070 --> 03:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
quality so you've sort of made your
 
03:57:57.510 --> 03:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
water district defunct I understand
 
03:57:59.990 --> 03:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
through this thank you for the question
 
03:58:02.790 --> 03:58:02.800 align:start position:0%
so um I'm going to ask you a question in
 
03:58:04.670 --> 03:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
a moment because I I'm curious how much
 
03:58:08.510 --> 03:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
you paid for your home system but anyway
 
03:58:12.229 --> 03:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
um here's the the here's the thing um a
 
03:58:16.269 --> 03:58:16.279 align:start position:0%
water system for a house house uh
 
03:58:20.550 --> 03:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
consists somewhere of a well a pump who
 
03:58:22.870 --> 03:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
gives you pressure and some kind of
 
03:58:27.630 --> 03:58:27.640 align:start position:0%
filter right and so um what this bill is
 
03:58:30.469 --> 03:58:30.479 align:start position:0%
sort of saying is it's
 
03:58:35.950 --> 03:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
okay if all that stuff isn't necessarily
 
03:58:39.229 --> 03:58:39.239 align:start position:0%
of industrial size and part of owned by
 
03:58:42.990 --> 03:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
the Water District right it's okay if
 
03:58:45.269 --> 03:58:45.279 align:start position:0%
what The Water District is providing you
 
03:58:48.590 --> 03:58:48.600 align:start position:0%
with is pretty good water but not
 
03:58:51.189 --> 03:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
absolutely perfect water right not
 
03:58:53.349 --> 03:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
drinkable water necessarily but it's
 
03:58:55.189 --> 03:58:55.199 align:start position:0%
it's good you know I mean like I said
 
03:58:59.550 --> 03:58:59.560 align:start position:0%
you can use it for 90 95% of the uses so
 
03:58:59.560 --> 03:59:01.149 align:start position:0%
you can use it for 90 95% of the uses so
so

03:59:01.149 --> 03:59:01.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
um and and so the people that have this
 
03:59:06.590 --> 03:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
system and would have to maintain it
 
03:59:08.950 --> 03:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
themselves would be in the like I said
 
03:59:11.510 --> 03:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
exactly the same situation I'm in and
 
03:59:15.429 --> 03:59:15.439 align:start position:0%
most of my town is in um so I don't I I
 
03:59:18.590 --> 03:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
just think yes they're not getting the
 
03:59:21.389 --> 03:59:21.399 align:start position:0%
exact same service they are now right
 
03:59:24.429 --> 03:59:24.439 align:start position:0%
but they're getting pretty close to it
 
03:59:24.439 --> 03:59:26.349 align:start position:0%
but they're getting pretty close to it
and

03:59:26.349 --> 03:59:26.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:59:29.229 --> 03:59:29.239 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that's
 
03:59:32.469 --> 03:59:32.479 align:start position:0%
unreasonable follow thank you so I guess
 
03:59:34.229 --> 03:59:34.239 align:start position:0%
my question back to you is is it okay
 
03:59:35.670 --> 03:59:35.680 align:start position:0%
because what are the laws around a water
 
03:59:37.110 --> 03:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
district and what are water district is
 
03:59:38.590 --> 03:59:38.600 align:start position:0%
providing is it okay for them to be
 
03:59:41.149 --> 03:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
providing water that is essentially
 
03:59:44.429 --> 03:59:44.439 align:start position:0%
nonpotable well it would be passing them
 
03:59:46.870 --> 03:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
I believe right so that's what this says
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
this says that's okay right so this
 
03:59:52.950 --> 03:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
would be part of our law Etc so I I
 
03:59:55.790 --> 03:59:55.800 align:start position:0%
think it is are you saying if if you're
 
03:59:56.950 --> 03:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
if you're
 
04:00:00.429 --> 04:00:00.439 align:start position:0%
asking is there some other area of law
 
04:00:03.070 --> 04:00:03.080 align:start position:0%
that this bill should also change right
 
04:00:05.910 --> 04:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
that says except for
 
04:00:09.790 --> 04:00:09.800 align:start position:0%
RSA whatever it is 31 Golding
 
04:00:13.269 --> 04:00:13.279 align:start position:0%
139 um I don't think so I mean the
 
04:00:16.030 --> 04:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
drafter didn't find such a section so
 
04:00:17.830 --> 04:00:17.840 align:start position:0%
but maybe you're right I don't know so
 
04:00:21.149 --> 04:00:21.159 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm sorry do you mind one more we
 
04:00:23.349 --> 04:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
have to move on so so I guess I'm just
 
04:00:25.510 --> 04:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
so maybe that that is missing because it
 
04:00:27.750 --> 04:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to me that this legislation
 
04:00:29.510 --> 04:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
gives you the right to now offer people
 
04:00:31.469 --> 04:00:31.479 align:start position:0%
a lower quality of water and that seems
 
04:00:32.830 --> 04:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
like what you're you're going to have a
 
04:00:35.229 --> 04:00:35.239 align:start position:0%
water district that provides water that
 
04:00:38.389 --> 04:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
is potentially not passing Dees
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
standards and I don't see that in here I
 
04:00:42.990 --> 04:00:43.000 align:start position:0%
I see that you're going to provide a
 
04:00:45.389 --> 04:00:45.399 align:start position:0%
filtration do option to have inhome
 
04:00:47.630 --> 04:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
filtration systems rather than a water
 
04:00:49.670 --> 04:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
district filtration system that is not
 
04:00:51.349 --> 04:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
then service going
 
04:00:54.990 --> 04:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
forward yeah again thank you for the
 
04:00:57.750 --> 04:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
question but but I think this does say
 
04:01:02.269 --> 04:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
that the situation is okay and um if it
 
04:01:04.790 --> 04:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
isn't then you know I'll work on an
 
04:01:08.990 --> 04:01:09.000 align:start position:0%
amendment or or something but um but my
 
04:01:09.000 --> 04:01:11.070 align:start position:0%
amendment or or something but um but my
point

04:01:11.070 --> 04:01:11.080 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:01:15.269 --> 04:01:15.279 align:start position:0%
is it's we're we're trying overall to
 
04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
get people to drink drinking water at a
 
04:01:21.630 --> 04:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable cost right I
 
04:01:24.189 --> 04:01:24.199 align:start position:0%
mean you can't people don't have
 
04:01:26.870 --> 04:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
unlimited amounts of money so they they
 
04:01:29.550 --> 04:01:29.560 align:start position:0%
they need to get water obviously they
 
04:01:33.870 --> 04:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
need to get water to drink obviously but
 
04:01:36.469 --> 04:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
but the overall cost ought to be as
 
04:01:41.110 --> 04:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable as possible right um and and
 
04:01:43.550 --> 04:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
my experience with my own home system is
 
04:01:46.469 --> 04:01:46.479 align:start position:0%
I do have to maintain it myself I do
 
04:01:48.750 --> 04:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
regularly have to change filters and
 
04:01:51.750 --> 04:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
clean it and things like that but but
 
04:01:54.349 --> 04:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's at least with my filter it's
 
04:01:56.510 --> 04:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
fairly obvious when I have to because
 
04:01:58.630 --> 04:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
the the flow rate of water gets lower
 
04:02:01.030 --> 04:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
and lower and you have to do it or you
 
04:02:03.510 --> 04:02:03.520 align:start position:0%
can do it just on an annual basis but
 
04:02:06.389 --> 04:02:06.399 align:start position:0%
but it's it's perfectly doable it's like
 
04:02:08.309 --> 04:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
maintaining anything else in your house
 
04:02:10.510 --> 04:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
right I mean you got you got the water
 
04:02:14.030 --> 04:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
heaters you got furnaces you got etc etc
 
04:02:16.070 --> 04:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
lots of systems in a house that need
 
04:02:18.710 --> 04:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance so I don't think it's
 
04:02:21.189 --> 04:02:21.199 align:start position:0%
unreasonable representative we have a
 
04:02:23.590 --> 04:02:23.600 align:start position:0%
speaker the next speakers from uh Dees
 
04:02:25.110 --> 04:02:25.120 align:start position:0%
and I think he might be able to address
 
04:02:27.229 --> 04:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
your question specifically
 
04:02:27.239 --> 04:02:28.670 align:start position:0%
your question specifically
representative

04:02:28.670 --> 04:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:02:31.349 --> 04:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
Ryan thank you for one at a time one
 
04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
04:02:37.149 --> 04:02:37.159 align:start position:0%
um do you water your garden with the
 
04:02:41.630 --> 04:02:41.640 align:start position:0%
nonfiltered water yes but my I
 
04:02:45.269 --> 04:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
don't um so first of all well the water
 
04:02:48.750 --> 04:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
that comes into my house is goes through
 
04:02:53.110 --> 04:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
a a pretty serious um um what is it
 
04:02:56.189 --> 04:02:56.199 align:start position:0%
called water softener right so the stuff
 
04:02:59.389 --> 04:02:59.399 align:start position:0%
that comes into my house is heavy iron
 
04:03:01.630 --> 04:03:01.640 align:start position:0%
and other stuff so it would be orange
 
04:03:03.950 --> 04:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
and all that but that is the water that
 
04:03:06.630 --> 04:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
goes to hoses and and things like that
 
04:03:10.269 --> 04:03:10.279 align:start position:0%
so um you know I mean there's just it's
 
04:03:12.229 --> 04:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
the characteristic of the of the
 
04:03:14.950 --> 04:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
groundwater that's what it is
 
04:03:18.149 --> 04:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
um but I personally am not a gardener
 
04:03:20.429 --> 04:03:20.439 align:start position:0%
much of a gardener so you know I mean I
 
04:03:23.510 --> 04:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
don't I'm not growing tomatoes or
 
04:03:26.750 --> 04:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
whatever you had a followup thank you um
 
04:03:29.550 --> 04:03:29.560 align:start position:0%
a a totally unrelated question what what
 
04:03:31.750 --> 04:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
do you propose would happen if there's
 
04:03:33.830 --> 04:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
new construction in your
 
04:03:36.910 --> 04:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
town um do they are they going to have
 
04:03:40.229 --> 04:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
to be provided with um a filtration
 
04:03:42.750 --> 04:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
system in their house or yes how do we
 
04:03:44.070 --> 04:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
deal with this in the future down the
 
04:03:46.790 --> 04:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
road yes thank you for the question so
 
04:03:49.630 --> 04:03:49.640 align:start position:0%
there's there's this area of town is all
 
04:03:53.870 --> 04:03:53.880 align:start position:0%
built up so it's it's essentially um
 
04:03:55.630 --> 04:03:55.640 align:start position:0%
unlikely that there will be many new
 
04:03:57.910 --> 04:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
customers coming onto this particular
 
04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
water system Unless somehow it was
 
04:04:04.469 --> 04:04:04.479 align:start position:0%
extended somewhere else but um and so it
 
04:04:06.950 --> 04:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
would be a s similar
 
04:04:09.830 --> 04:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
situation to again somebody building a
 
04:04:12.110 --> 04:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
house right somebody building a house
 
04:04:14.070 --> 04:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
has to test their water has to to put in
 
04:04:16.910 --> 04:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
a system that that works for it and so
 
04:04:20.510 --> 04:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
on right so so again the the people who
 
04:04:23.030 --> 04:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
would hook up to this system would say
 
04:04:26.429 --> 04:04:26.439 align:start position:0%
oh you know this this water and and part
 
04:04:28.830 --> 04:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill I think says they have to
 
04:04:31.389 --> 04:04:31.399 align:start position:0%
tell you that the water is not drinkable
 
04:04:35.510 --> 04:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
on a fairly frequent basis and so um
 
04:04:37.309 --> 04:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
anybody who built a new house that
 
04:04:39.309 --> 04:04:39.319 align:start position:0%
happened to be connected to the system
 
04:04:42.389 --> 04:04:42.399 align:start position:0%
would know that yes I'm I'm I need to
 
04:04:47.469 --> 04:04:47.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:50.550 --> 04:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
house U representative Taylor then
 
04:04:52.550 --> 04:04:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
04:04:54.189 --> 04:04:54.199 align:start position:0%
thanks you for taking the question
 
04:04:55.269 --> 04:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen with the high
 
04:04:58.070 --> 04:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
school and other uh nearby town home
 
04:04:59.910 --> 04:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
facilities yes thank you for the
 
04:05:01.910 --> 04:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
question so uh it's not a high school
 
04:05:05.269 --> 04:05:05.279 align:start position:0%
it's a elementary school but yeah and
 
04:05:07.269 --> 04:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
there are some businesses the way I
 
04:05:10.070 --> 04:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
wrote the Bill is for commercial and
 
04:05:10.080 --> 04:05:11.710 align:start position:0%
wrote the Bill is for commercial and
Municipal

04:05:11.710 --> 04:05:11.720 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
04:05:14.269 --> 04:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
facilities it's up to them
 
04:05:19.189 --> 04:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
to um to add whatever filtration or
 
04:05:21.070 --> 04:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
other solutions they want right they
 
04:05:23.510 --> 04:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
could go to bottled water they could
 
04:05:26.670 --> 04:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
they could go to um individual filters
 
04:05:28.550 --> 04:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
they could go to a a filter for their
 
04:05:32.429 --> 04:05:32.439 align:start position:0%
whole facility but I put I put this on
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
them rather than on the Water District
 
04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
because I think in general um a
 
04:05:42.309 --> 04:05:42.319 align:start position:0%
municipal or commercial activity has has
 
04:05:44.550 --> 04:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
uh maybe a better m maintenance plan and
 
04:05:48.990 --> 04:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
better resources to do this kind of
 
04:05:52.229 --> 04:05:52.239 align:start position:0%
thing representative Dave thank you Mr
 
04:05:54.309 --> 04:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
chair thank you representative for
 
04:05:56.550 --> 04:05:56.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if these systems
 
04:05:56.560 --> 04:05:57.429 align:start position:0%
taking my question so if these systems
are

04:05:57.429 --> 04:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:05:59.630 --> 04:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
mandated what would happen if somebody
 
04:06:01.790 --> 04:06:01.800 align:start position:0%
in town refuses to put a system in is
 
04:06:04.990 --> 04:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
there a penalty is there what would what
 
04:06:06.389 --> 04:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
would happen yeah thank you for the
 
04:06:10.149 --> 04:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
question so I think no I think you would
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
not be forcing somebody to do it I don't
 
04:06:15.830 --> 04:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
know that I wrote it
 
04:06:19.950 --> 04:06:19.960 align:start position:0%
um perfectly in that for that scenario I
 
04:06:22.070 --> 04:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
think I said that the water system will
 
04:06:24.590 --> 04:06:24.600 align:start position:0%
give them the system but you know maybe
 
04:06:26.710 --> 04:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
they somebody won't let them in they
 
04:06:28.950 --> 04:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
drop it off and it's there you know now
 
04:06:31.349 --> 04:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
it's their problem so it's the same sort
 
04:06:34.389 --> 04:06:34.399 align:start position:0%
of thing as if somebody built a house
 
04:06:36.830 --> 04:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
and dug a well and just started drinking
 
04:06:38.990 --> 04:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
the water and never put in a filter
 
04:06:41.870 --> 04:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
right I mean you know that it's on them
 
04:06:41.880 --> 04:06:44.030 align:start position:0%
right I mean you know that it's on them
basically

04:06:44.030 --> 04:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:06:49.030 --> 04:06:49.040 align:start position:0%
yep one one more thank you uh so so when
 
04:06:51.309 --> 04:06:51.319 align:start position:0%
you when you test for Radon which I know
 
04:06:53.670 --> 04:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
is totally separate it it's very
 
04:06:57.229 --> 04:06:57.239 align:start position:0%
important that it's uh below a certain
 
04:06:59.309 --> 04:06:59.319 align:start position:0%
number of curries per liter so
 
04:07:01.189 --> 04:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
when you take a shower that that gets
 
04:07:04.110 --> 04:07:04.120 align:start position:0%
emitted into the atmosphere would this
 
04:07:05.750 --> 04:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
would you need that for your shower as
 
04:07:07.630 --> 04:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
well that
 
04:07:10.309 --> 04:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
filter yeah I'm I'm not qualified to
 
04:07:15.590 --> 04:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:17.670 --> 04:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
before we go around for a second
 
04:07:18.750 --> 04:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
question from some of the
 
04:07:21.309 --> 04:07:21.319 align:start position:0%
representatives I I had one question for
 
04:07:23.309 --> 04:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
you you did mention in the beginning you
 
04:07:25.910 --> 04:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
didn't make this specific to your town
 
04:07:28.389 --> 04:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
in your District you made this to the
 
04:07:31.309 --> 04:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
entire State just wanted to make sure I
 
04:07:33.389 --> 04:07:33.399 align:start position:0%
was clear on that yes it's it's written
 
04:07:36.389 --> 04:07:36.399 align:start position:0%
in in a general way any water district
 
04:07:37.830 --> 04:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
well they would have to have a water
 
04:07:40.790 --> 04:07:40.800 align:start position:0%
district right but it's any water
 
04:07:42.189 --> 04:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
district but it could be any water
 
04:07:44.790 --> 04:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
district that decides to do this yes
 
04:07:46.269 --> 04:07:46.279 align:start position:0%
first representative neb then
 
04:07:48.830 --> 04:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative Darby okay thank you for
 
04:07:50.550 --> 04:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question again and this is
 
04:07:52.030 --> 04:07:52.040 align:start position:0%
sort of I think I've wrapped my head
 
04:07:53.469 --> 04:07:53.479 align:start position:0%
around what you're trying to do so bear
 
04:07:55.630 --> 04:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
with me if I so you're essentially would
 
04:07:58.349 --> 04:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
like to create a bifurcated path for
 
04:08:00.710 --> 04:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
water for your water district where you
 
04:08:02.950 --> 04:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
are providing non-potable water as a
 
04:08:04.670 --> 04:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
water district people are now
 
04:08:06.990 --> 04:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
responsible essentially once the
 
04:08:08.630 --> 04:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
filtration system is installed for their
 
04:08:10.670 --> 04:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
own portable water yes is that what
 
04:08:12.990 --> 04:08:13.000 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do here okay and follow
 
04:08:13.000 --> 04:08:13.990 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do here okay and follow
up

04:08:13.990 --> 04:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
up
 
04:08:15.870 --> 04:08:15.880 align:start position:0%
it's quick does have you talked to your
 
04:08:17.269 --> 04:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
water district about this I mean is this
 
04:08:18.710 --> 04:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
something that they're supportive of or
 
04:08:21.590 --> 04:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
do you have any sense of that yes I the
 
04:08:24.349 --> 04:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
reason I'm I'm here is I was contacted
 
04:08:27.269 --> 04:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
by the water district and they said $6
 
04:08:29.710 --> 04:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
million you know it's
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
like and and and bills doubling and all
 
04:08:35.109 --> 04:08:35.119 align:start position:0%
this sort of stuff right so can isn't
 
04:08:37.389 --> 04:08:37.399 align:start position:0%
there some kind of alternative and and
 
04:08:39.189 --> 04:08:39.199 align:start position:0%
at first I mean I'll tell you what they
 
04:08:41.830 --> 04:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
want right they want somebody else to
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
pay the $6 million right right I mean
 
04:08:45.910 --> 04:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
what would you expect right but you know
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
cuz I'm on the finance committee can't
 
04:08:50.389 --> 04:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
you find us more money you know that
 
04:08:52.269 --> 04:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
sort of thing and and the problem is we
 
04:08:55.389 --> 04:08:55.399 align:start position:0%
don't have more money so this is an
 
04:08:59.950 --> 04:08:59.960 align:start position:0%
alternative that that again it's it's it
 
04:09:01.389 --> 04:09:01.399 align:start position:0%
creates an
 
04:09:04.349 --> 04:09:04.359 align:start position:0%
alternative but but where right now
 
04:09:07.149 --> 04:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
there is none basically you have to
 
04:09:10.670 --> 04:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
spend the you know the Cadillac version
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
you know when maybe you want you know
 
04:09:15.349 --> 04:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
the Hyundai version or something yeah so
 
04:09:15.359 --> 04:09:17.389 align:start position:0%
the Hyundai version or something yeah so
representative

04:09:17.389 --> 04:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:09:19.750 --> 04:09:19.760 align:start position:0%
Derby thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:09:21.109 --> 04:09:21.119 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire for taking my
 
04:09:23.630 --> 04:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
question looking at the water district
 
04:09:25.389 --> 04:09:25.399 align:start position:0%
statutes you know there's an elected
 
04:09:27.349 --> 04:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
Board of Commissioners and then it says
 
04:09:30.590 --> 04:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
that the the municipalities um and
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
there's a set of criteria that they can
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
control um what what they can actually
 
04:09:37.469 --> 04:09:37.479 align:start position:0%
charge to the water district and then
 
04:09:39.269 --> 04:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
that the municipality is responsible for
 
04:09:42.790 --> 04:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
budgeting one of the uh one of the
 
04:09:45.670 --> 04:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
things given to the um authorities given
 
04:09:47.309 --> 04:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
to the Commissioners is the ability for
 
04:09:50.309 --> 04:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
direction of the of the water district
 
04:09:52.510 --> 04:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
why can't they propose this as the
 
04:09:54.149 --> 04:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
warrant article rather than having to
 
04:09:57.309 --> 04:09:57.319 align:start position:0%
have a statute for it yes thank you for
 
04:10:01.389 --> 04:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
the question again um just my
 
04:10:03.349 --> 04:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
understanding from talking to Dees and
 
04:10:04.830 --> 04:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they're here you can talk to
 
04:10:10.389 --> 04:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
them yourself is that if my town refuses
 
04:10:13.830 --> 04:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
the the solution that they offer then
 
04:10:16.469 --> 04:10:16.479 align:start position:0%
they will simply shut down the water
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
district for having for not meeting
 
04:10:22.469 --> 04:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
standards right and so and and therefore
 
04:10:24.550 --> 04:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
give it to somebody else who will create
 
04:10:26.309 --> 04:10:26.319 align:start position:0%
the standard you know will follow the
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
standards so we do need something to say
 
04:10:33.389 --> 04:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
it's okay to be a little short of the
 
04:10:36.269 --> 04:10:36.279 align:start position:0%
standards right at that point at the
 
04:10:38.269 --> 04:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
point at which your water enters your
 
04:10:41.349 --> 04:10:41.359 align:start position:0%
house but but you're not going to be shy
 
04:10:42.950 --> 04:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
of the standards at the point you're
 
04:10:46.389 --> 04:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
drinking the glass right so that's the
 
04:10:50.349 --> 04:10:50.359 align:start position:0%
whole point of it Senator Ryan thank you
 
04:10:53.790 --> 04:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
for thank you for taking my question the
 
04:10:55.550 --> 04:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
water dist is the water district
 
04:10:57.670 --> 04:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for providing portable water
 
04:10:59.309 --> 04:10:59.319 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:11:01.550 --> 04:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
school yes thank you for the question
 
04:11:03.429 --> 04:11:03.439 align:start position:0%
yes the water district does provide
 
04:11:06.030 --> 04:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
water to the school current you know
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
again right now they're drinking 12
 
04:11:11.630 --> 04:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
parts per trillion pasas right because
 
04:11:13.870 --> 04:11:13.880 align:start position:0%
it's the wells right there
 
04:11:19.030 --> 04:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
The Situation's in flux but um and and
 
04:11:21.189 --> 04:11:21.199 align:start position:0%
by this bill it would then become the
 
04:11:23.229 --> 04:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
school essentially the water would be
 
04:11:27.149 --> 04:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
unchanged right the water that's going
 
04:11:28.830 --> 04:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
into the school would be the same water
 
04:11:31.750 --> 04:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
it is now but but it would be up to the
 
04:11:36.429 --> 04:11:36.439 align:start position:0%
school to fix it right for themselves
 
04:11:39.070 --> 04:11:39.080 align:start position:0%
rather than the water district fixing it
 
04:11:43.990 --> 04:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
if you see what I mean thank you
 
04:11:46.189 --> 04:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
go again to representative Davis then
 
04:11:48.550 --> 04:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
back to representative Taylor thank you
 
04:11:51.389 --> 04:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
04:11:54.870 --> 04:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
mcguyer uh so so being new on this
 
04:11:56.510 --> 04:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
committee forgive me if this is a silly
 
04:11:59.070 --> 04:11:59.080 align:start position:0%
question but the cost of this is just to
 
04:12:01.309 --> 04:12:01.319 align:start position:0%
the people inside the water district if
 
04:12:02.710 --> 04:12:02.720 align:start position:0%
you have a private well and you're
 
04:12:05.189 --> 04:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
outside of that area you don't have the
 
04:12:07.710 --> 04:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
burden of this yes thank you for the
 
04:12:10.269 --> 04:12:10.279 align:start position:0%
question but the answer is yes in in
 
04:12:12.710 --> 04:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
every case it's only the water district
 
04:12:14.670 --> 04:12:14.680 align:start position:0%
it's never the town that's going to pay
 
04:12:16.630 --> 04:12:16.640 align:start position:0%
or anything like that it's the people
 
04:12:18.990 --> 04:12:19.000 align:start position:0%
who are in the water are customers of
 
04:12:22.630 --> 04:12:22.640 align:start position:0%
the water district so if for example
 
04:12:24.229 --> 04:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
they went with you know and they could
 
04:12:26.990 --> 04:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
vote to decide we want the $6 million
 
04:12:29.990 --> 04:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
solution right and in that case because
 
04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
the school is one of the customers of
 
04:12:35.630 --> 04:12:35.640 align:start position:0%
this water their water bill is going to
 
04:12:38.189 --> 04:12:38.199 align:start position:0%
double and so therefore the taxpayers of
 
04:12:40.950 --> 04:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
the whole town would pay more for that
 
04:12:44.030 --> 04:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
portion right so so
 
04:12:47.790 --> 04:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
um only in that sense do people outside
 
04:12:50.590 --> 04:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
the water district pay right but you
 
04:12:53.070 --> 04:12:53.080 align:start position:0%
know that that's it should be
 
04:12:56.630 --> 04:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
understandable thank you representative
 
04:12:58.830 --> 04:12:58.840 align:start position:0%
Taylor thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:13:00.590 --> 04:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
for taking a question when will this
 
04:13:03.109 --> 04:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
vote take place I thank you for the
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
question I think it's in March as part
 
04:13:10.229 --> 04:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:12.510 --> 04:13:12.520 align:start position:0%
elections let see any hands from the
 
04:13:12.520 --> 04:13:14.269 align:start position:0%
elections let see any hands from the
representative

04:13:14.269 --> 04:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:13:16.950 --> 04:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
news she coming back to the well for the
 
04:13:20.950 --> 04:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:23.710 --> 04:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
think one more thank you Mr chair you
 
04:13:26.030 --> 04:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
still didn't answer my question I'm
 
04:13:27.349 --> 04:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
gonna let the chair decide whether I can
 
04:13:30.429 --> 04:13:30.439 align:start position:0%
answer the question that's not right
 
04:13:32.830 --> 04:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
sorry I paid almost $5,000 but Dees paid
 
04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
for most of it um I I feel like if this
 
04:13:38.910 --> 04:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
bill was to go forward the phrase the
 
04:13:41.309 --> 04:13:41.319 align:start position:0%
legislative body needs to be clarified
 
04:13:43.349 --> 04:13:43.359 align:start position:0%
that it's the district's legislative
 
04:13:44.510 --> 04:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
because when I first read it I thought
 
04:13:46.870 --> 04:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
it meant the state I don't know if any
 
04:13:49.590 --> 04:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
if that's the issue anyone else had but
 
04:13:52.429 --> 04:13:52.439 align:start position:0%
I just put that out
 
04:13:55.109 --> 04:13:55.119 align:start position:0%
there yeah again that's thanks for the
 
04:13:56.630 --> 04:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
question but that's the way it was
 
04:13:59.349 --> 04:13:59.359 align:start position:0%
drafted and I think it's proper but I
 
04:14:01.670 --> 04:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
could be
 
04:14:03.830 --> 04:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
wrong and I'm not going to take any more
 
04:14:05.630 --> 04:14:05.640 align:start position:0%
questions for representative thank you
 
04:14:07.590 --> 04:14:07.600 align:start position:0%

04:14:08.830 --> 04:14:08.840 align:start position:0%

04:14:40.269 --> 04:14:40.279 align:start position:0%
groundwater Bureau at Dees and we're
 
04:14:44.910 --> 04:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
here to testify on House Bill 44 9 um
 
04:14:46.550 --> 04:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
one of the tasks of the bureau that I
 
04:14:48.710 --> 04:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
administrate is to regulate public water
 
04:14:50.510 --> 04:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
systems in the state and the govering
 
04:14:53.469 --> 04:14:53.479 align:start position:0%
statutes uh really two sets um there's a
 
04:14:55.630 --> 04:14:55.640 align:start position:0%
federal Safe Drinking Water Act and then
 
04:14:57.910 --> 04:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
there's a state Safe Drinking Water Act
 
04:14:59.590 --> 04:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
I would say the federal Safe Drinking
 
04:15:01.710 --> 04:15:01.720 align:start position:0%
Water Act drives probably about 90% of
 
04:15:03.790 --> 04:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
what we do with the state tweaking maybe
 
04:15:05.109 --> 04:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
the other
 
04:15:08.149 --> 04:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
10% um with represent Maguire is trying
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
to do it is to to be commended he's
 
04:15:12.550 --> 04:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
trying to solve a very expensive problem
 
04:15:15.429 --> 04:15:15.439 align:start position:0%
for people f um now that EPA now has a
 
04:15:17.229 --> 04:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
standard of four parts of trillion that
 
04:15:19.630 --> 04:15:19.640 align:start position:0%
we'll be enforcing in the future years
 
04:15:21.189 --> 04:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
we could have up to half a billion
 
04:15:23.189 --> 04:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
dollars in cost for Public Water Systems
 
04:15:25.510 --> 04:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
across the state to comply you know
 
04:15:27.429 --> 04:15:27.439 align:start position:0%
simply stated one in six people will be
 
04:15:29.510 --> 04:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
drinking water over that standard in our
 
04:15:32.790 --> 04:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
state and so it is a big cost
 
04:15:36.149 --> 04:15:36.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the bill um House Bill 449
 
04:15:38.349 --> 04:15:38.359 align:start position:0%
is not possible due to the federal Safe
 
04:15:40.830 --> 04:15:40.840 align:start position:0%
Drinking Water Act um they have very
 
04:15:43.109 --> 04:15:43.119 align:start position:0%
specific requirements on drinking water
 
04:15:45.510 --> 04:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
quality standards for each end user be
 
04:15:48.510 --> 04:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
it a business school or a Home the water
 
04:15:50.429 --> 04:15:50.439 align:start position:0%
has to meet drinking water standards for
 
04:15:52.790 --> 04:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
all those entities it has to be tested
 
04:15:55.309 --> 04:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis the treatment systems
 
04:15:57.309 --> 04:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
have to be maintained and overseen by
 
04:16:00.910 --> 04:16:00.920 align:start position:0%
certified operators and so it it's just
 
04:16:02.429 --> 04:16:02.439 align:start position:0%
not possible because it would violate
 
04:16:05.469 --> 04:16:05.479 align:start position:0%
the federal uh statutes that we
 
04:16:07.830 --> 04:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
administer also our state statutes right
 
04:16:09.269 --> 04:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
now don't really have Provisions for
 
04:16:13.469 --> 04:16:13.479 align:start position:0%
this either I will say I caveat that um
 
04:16:16.389 --> 04:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
epa's Safe Drinking Water Act does allow
 
04:16:18.389 --> 04:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
what they call point of use filter sort
 
04:16:19.870 --> 04:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
of what representative McGuire is
 
04:16:22.950 --> 04:16:22.960 align:start position:0%
talking about um but there are some very
 
04:16:24.870 --> 04:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
strict standards that makes it so can
 
04:16:26.990 --> 04:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
almost never be complied with
 
04:16:29.790 --> 04:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
essentially every user of a water system
 
04:16:32.429 --> 04:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
has to S sign an legal agreement that
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
the water system can enter their
 
04:16:37.510 --> 04:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
facility maintain the filter install the
 
04:16:40.389 --> 04:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
filter test the filter a couple times a
 
04:16:42.670 --> 04:16:42.680 align:start position:0%
year and if one person that's part of
 
04:16:45.229 --> 04:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
that system doesn't agree that's not an
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
option also although that filter may be
 
04:16:50.429 --> 04:16:50.439 align:start position:0%
relatively inexpensive even if you
 
04:16:52.750 --> 04:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
multiply by a factor of 100 or 300
 
04:16:55.189 --> 04:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
initially think about past where you
 
04:16:58.750 --> 04:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
have to test twice a year for $2 to $500
 
04:17:01.149 --> 04:17:01.159 align:start position:0%
a sample again needing to get into
 
04:17:03.630 --> 04:17:03.640 align:start position:0%
everyone's home so these point of use
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
regulations which New Hampshire is one
 
04:17:08.590 --> 04:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
of the only few that have even adopted
 
04:17:10.229 --> 04:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
across the states and I referenced it in
 
04:17:13.830 --> 04:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
the letter um it's um EMV DW 720 3 are
 
04:17:15.349 --> 04:17:15.359 align:start position:0%
only really good when you have really
 
04:17:18.550 --> 04:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
small water systems like a 20 unit condo
 
04:17:22.229 --> 04:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
or a 15 unit mobile home park and where
 
04:17:24.550 --> 04:17:24.560 align:start position:0%
there can be bylaws that mandates anyone
 
04:17:26.189 --> 04:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
living there allows access to the
 
04:17:28.269 --> 04:17:28.279 align:start position:0%
building because again if that falls
 
04:17:29.750 --> 04:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
apart all a sudden you fall out of
 
04:17:31.070 --> 04:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
compliance and you're back to where you
 
04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
were needing to put in centralized
 
04:17:36.309 --> 04:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
treatment um represent mgu is right the
 
04:17:38.630 --> 04:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
costs are high right now um but Water
 
04:17:40.710 --> 04:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
Systems would be very smart to move
 
04:17:43.590 --> 04:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
right now because um there's a lot of
 
04:17:45.030 --> 04:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness from the federal
 
04:17:46.510 --> 04:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
government that will not be here in two
 
04:17:48.750 --> 04:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
or three years so the time is now to
 
04:17:50.469 --> 04:17:50.479 align:start position:0%
make these improvements even if they are
 
04:17:53.149 --> 04:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
costly in the case of epson um he makes
 
04:17:54.630 --> 04:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
a good point you know doubling the rate
 
04:17:57.990 --> 04:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
from $400 a year to $800 a year is a big
 
04:18:00.870 --> 04:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
change but 400 is really low water rate
 
04:18:02.830 --> 04:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
to begin with and I'm not trying to
 
04:18:05.070 --> 04:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
sound unsympathetic I know it's a big
 
04:18:08.229 --> 04:18:08.239 align:start position:0%
jolt but a water rate to $800 a year is
 
04:18:10.510 --> 04:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
Not Unusual or unreasonable across the
 
04:18:12.990 --> 04:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
state to have safe drinking water it's a
 
04:18:14.389 --> 04:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
lot cheaper than most people's annual
 
04:18:17.670 --> 04:18:17.680 align:start position:0%
cell phone bills as far as the concept
 
04:18:19.870 --> 04:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
of getting everyone off on the right
 
04:18:22.389 --> 04:18:22.399 align:start position:0%
foot and having a filter installed as if
 
04:18:24.389 --> 04:18:24.399 align:start position:0%
you're a private well owner and then
 
04:18:27.269 --> 04:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
leaving it to the end user to maintain
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
that's problematic because experience
 
04:18:30.870 --> 04:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
shows with private well users these
 
04:18:32.790 --> 04:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
filters get quickly abandoned they don't
 
04:18:34.510 --> 04:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
get tested because of the hundreds of
 
04:18:37.109 --> 04:18:37.119 align:start position:0%
dollars and the logistics they don't
 
04:18:38.870 --> 04:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
have vendors come out and service them
 
04:18:40.670 --> 04:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
because it's expensive and inconvenient
 
04:18:43.349 --> 04:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
or people forget about it in some
 
04:18:47.030 --> 04:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
it's just it is implausible I guess the
 
04:18:48.710 --> 04:18:48.720 align:start position:0%
last thing to mention that if it were
 
04:18:51.630 --> 04:18:51.640 align:start position:0%
not for the federal MCL for past it
 
04:18:53.469 --> 04:18:53.479 align:start position:0%
might have been possible to change state
 
04:18:56.269 --> 04:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
law to allow this to be a remedy for
 
04:18:57.790 --> 04:18:57.800 align:start position:0%
something we only have a state standard
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
for but that's not the case with past
 
04:19:01.229 --> 04:19:01.239 align:start position:0%
anymore we have a federal standard so
 
04:19:03.109 --> 04:19:03.119 align:start position:0%
it's not an option but that change would
 
04:19:05.030 --> 04:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
need to occur in the Safe Drinking Water
 
04:19:07.469 --> 04:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
Act I wouldn't recommend it I don't
 
04:19:09.750 --> 04:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
think we think it's a good idea but as
 
04:19:11.389 --> 04:19:11.399 align:start position:0%
it's proposed now it affect just water
 
04:19:12.710 --> 04:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
districts and there's lots of different
 
04:19:13.910 --> 04:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
Water Systems out there there's water
 
04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
district there's Municipal systems
 
04:19:17.830 --> 04:19:17.840 align:start position:0%
there's private homeowner associations
 
04:19:21.030 --> 04:19:21.040 align:start position:0%
there you know all told there's 2500
 
04:19:22.750 --> 04:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
different Water Systems to state that
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
fall into different types of categories
 
04:19:27.950 --> 04:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
so the language would have to um change
 
04:19:29.109 --> 04:19:29.119 align:start position:0%
I guess a couple other things we point
 
04:19:30.910 --> 04:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
out in our letter that would want to be
 
04:19:32.950 --> 04:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
addressed and if this was was even
 
04:19:34.590 --> 04:19:34.600 align:start position:0%
possible but again it's not because it's
 
04:19:36.590 --> 04:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
regulated at the federal level is who
 
04:19:39.590 --> 04:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
installs the filter systems is important
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
um the bills talked about the filter
 
04:19:44.429 --> 04:19:44.439 align:start position:0%
system providing two gallons a day that
 
04:19:45.950 --> 04:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
might be enough for drinking water but
 
04:19:47.510 --> 04:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't talk about the capacity of
 
04:19:49.030 --> 04:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
the filter how long it needs to last
 
04:19:50.189 --> 04:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
that could be a little refrigerator
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
filter that lasts 30 days where you
 
04:19:54.630 --> 04:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
clearly want something that would last
 
04:19:57.349 --> 04:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
much longer than that and so for all
 
04:19:58.710 --> 04:19:58.720 align:start position:0%
those reasons and even the public
 
04:20:00.109 --> 04:20:00.119 align:start position:0%
notification requirements in here which
 
04:20:01.750 --> 04:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
are redundant with we're already done
 
04:20:03.710 --> 04:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
under the Safe Drinking Water Act um I
 
04:20:04.910 --> 04:20:04.920 align:start position:0%
think you just want to consider those
 
04:20:06.030 --> 04:20:06.040 align:start position:0%
things but again we don't take a
 
04:20:07.070 --> 04:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
position because it's not going to
 
04:20:09.349 --> 04:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
modify how we regulate water systems but
 
04:20:10.469 --> 04:20:10.479 align:start position:0%
I just want to let you know some of the
 
04:20:12.710 --> 04:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies and I don't think it'll
 
04:20:14.550 --> 04:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
achieve the intended objective of
 
04:20:16.309 --> 04:20:16.319 align:start position:0%
complying uh with the Safe Drinking
 
04:20:18.070 --> 04:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
Water Act and avoiding the $6 million in
 
04:20:18.080 --> 04:20:19.389 align:start position:0%
Water Act and avoiding the $6 million in
treatment

04:20:19.389 --> 04:20:19.399 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
04:20:21.830 --> 04:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
costs thank you any
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
questions representative Donnelly then
 
04:20:27.750 --> 04:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative Derby thank you chair
 
04:20:30.469 --> 04:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:20:33.790 --> 04:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at this and saying who
 
04:20:36.309 --> 04:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
enacts whether or not this happens is it
 
04:20:40.030 --> 04:20:40.040 align:start position:0%
the is it the the town or is it the
 
04:20:42.149 --> 04:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
person in the home that says we wanted
 
04:20:44.590 --> 04:20:44.600 align:start position:0%
this I'm I'm unclear if this did pass if
 
04:20:47.710 --> 04:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
this went through who says I get to
 
04:20:49.990 --> 04:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
choose whether or not we are going to
 
04:20:53.149 --> 04:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
either do a entire system that takes
 
04:20:55.149 --> 04:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
care of all these Wells versus oh we're
 
04:20:58.630 --> 04:20:58.640 align:start position:0%
going to give everyone um a filter who
 
04:21:00.149 --> 04:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
makes that
 
04:21:02.870 --> 04:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
decision how they comply with the ACT
 
04:21:05.349 --> 04:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
ultimately is the water system's choice
 
04:21:07.389 --> 04:21:07.399 align:start position:0%
but they can't choose an option that
 
04:21:09.389 --> 04:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
doesn't comply with state and federal
 
04:21:12.229 --> 04:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
law and so Dees if that was proposed to
 
04:21:14.309 --> 04:21:14.319 align:start position:0%
us as a corrective action plan to put in
 
04:21:16.790 --> 04:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
300 separate filters with no long-term
 
04:21:18.750 --> 04:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
plan no legal agreements no testing
 
04:21:21.710 --> 04:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
plans we would say that's insufficient
 
04:21:22.990 --> 04:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
and you're still in
 
04:21:25.389 --> 04:21:25.399 align:start position:0%
violation and to go to representative
 
04:21:27.229 --> 04:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
McGuire's point about what happens if
 
04:21:29.309 --> 04:21:29.319 align:start position:0%
you don't comply um since I've been at
 
04:21:30.750 --> 04:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
the state for almost two and a half
 
04:21:32.510 --> 04:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
decades at this point and I've only seen
 
04:21:34.550 --> 04:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
us take receivership one time for a
 
04:21:37.309 --> 04:21:37.319 align:start position:0%
water system you can talk to the
 
04:21:38.870 --> 04:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
industry we work really hard with the
 
04:21:41.070 --> 04:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
Water Systems to get cooperation it
 
04:21:43.309 --> 04:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
might take a year two years figure out
 
04:21:46.149 --> 04:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
creative funding packages But ultimately
 
04:21:48.109 --> 04:21:48.119 align:start position:0%
a new well that's not contaminated
 
04:21:50.830 --> 04:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
connection to another system nearby or
 
04:21:52.109 --> 04:21:52.119 align:start position:0%
that treatment system away from the
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
flood plane would be the options um that
 
04:21:59.429 --> 04:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
pursue thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
04:22:05.109 --> 04:22:05.119 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um when you say
 
04:22:07.389 --> 04:22:07.399 align:start position:0%
that the passage of this law would not
 
04:22:10.550 --> 04:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
affect um how you regulate Water Systems
 
04:22:13.070 --> 04:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
which I think was what you said um
 
04:22:15.309 --> 04:22:15.319 align:start position:0%
what do what does that mean um what does
 
04:22:17.630 --> 04:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
it mean in terms of what how it would
 
04:22:20.910 --> 04:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
apply to um you know Epsom who's trying
 
04:22:23.990 --> 04:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
to mitigate this and would it still
 
04:22:27.229 --> 04:22:27.239 align:start position:0%
result in for example taking
 
04:22:29.750 --> 04:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
receivership so what would happen if
 
04:22:32.550 --> 04:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
this passed is we would be separate of
 
04:22:34.389 --> 04:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
all all this all these Provisions is in
 
04:22:36.349 --> 04:22:36.359 align:start position:0%
a water district statute and we would
 
04:22:39.149 --> 04:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
continue to administer RSA 45 and then
 
04:22:41.790 --> 04:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and
 
04:22:44.109 --> 04:22:44.119 align:start position:0%
so there be
 
04:22:46.510 --> 04:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
a series of enforcement steps ultimately
 
04:22:49.349 --> 04:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
going to the Attorney General's office
 
04:22:52.109 --> 04:22:52.119 align:start position:0%
with fines levied that could be enforced
 
04:22:54.830 --> 04:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
by courts that the race payers would pay
 
04:22:57.030 --> 04:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
and then if still nothing happened
 
04:22:58.630 --> 04:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
receivership could happen but again as
 
04:23:00.910 --> 04:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
I've at the state fines are very rare I
 
04:23:02.950 --> 04:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
mean I it's like once every three or
 
04:23:05.469 --> 04:23:05.479 align:start position:0%
four years out of 2 200 Water Systems I
 
04:23:08.070 --> 04:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
think we actually f a water system
 
04:23:09.910 --> 04:23:09.920 align:start position:0%
because the rate payers get educated
 
04:23:11.309 --> 04:23:11.319 align:start position:0%
over time and will support the
 
04:23:13.550 --> 04:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
investment in C Drinking Water Act
 
04:23:16.590 --> 04:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to penalties over time um and
 
04:23:18.990 --> 04:23:19.000 align:start position:0%
again receivership is really hardly on
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
the table it's once and 25 years that
 
04:23:25.349 --> 04:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of it very
 
04:23:28.109 --> 04:23:28.119 align:start position:0%
briefly very briefly one follow thank
 
04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair um just to help
 
04:23:34.149 --> 04:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
me sort of do some research um what are
 
04:23:37.630 --> 04:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
this this this section of the statute I
 
04:23:40.630 --> 04:23:40.640 align:start position:0%
should look at for um you know where you
 
04:23:43.269 --> 04:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
have to uh comply with it and and
 
04:23:46.030 --> 04:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
ultimately potentially take receivership
 
04:23:47.950 --> 04:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
um you know I understand how rare that
 
04:23:49.550 --> 04:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
is but can you just point me to that
 
04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
statue I can email you the exact
 
04:23:54.510 --> 04:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
provision in the Safe Drinking Water Act
 
04:23:56.149 --> 04:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much answer your question
 
04:23:57.469 --> 04:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
about the point of compliance for the
 
04:23:59.189 --> 04:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
Safe Drinking Water Act it's the point
 
04:24:01.149 --> 04:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
of entry of water into the water
 
04:24:02.990 --> 04:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
distribution system so if you have a
 
04:24:04.309 --> 04:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
well on this side and a well on this
 
04:24:05.550 --> 04:24:05.560 align:start position:0%
side of the system and separate
 
04:24:07.790 --> 04:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
treatment systems you're sampling right
 
04:24:09.109 --> 04:24:09.119 align:start position:0%
the water right as it goes into the
 
04:24:10.510 --> 04:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
distribution system and that's where the
 
04:24:12.469 --> 04:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
point of compliance is measured under
 
04:24:15.550 --> 04:24:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:18.670 --> 04:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
Act representative Davis thank you Mr
 
04:24:21.229 --> 04:24:21.239 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:24:22.830 --> 04:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
so there seems like a lot of moving
 
04:24:24.630 --> 04:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
Parts here if every home has a
 
04:24:27.349 --> 04:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
filtration system is is there any
 
04:24:30.030 --> 04:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for cross-contamination if
 
04:24:31.750 --> 04:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
if somebody doesn't maintain their
 
04:24:34.189 --> 04:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
system and their water falls below the
 
04:24:36.870 --> 04:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
standard to siphoning for it to siphon
 
04:24:38.710 --> 04:24:38.720 align:start position:0%
back into the rest of the system
 
04:24:41.030 --> 04:24:41.040 align:start position:0%
contaminating other homes is that a
 
04:24:41.040 --> 04:24:43.510 align:start position:0%
contaminating other homes is that a
possibility

04:24:43.510 --> 04:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
04:24:44.950 --> 04:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
it's a possibility because you often
 
04:24:46.910 --> 04:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
don't have backflow prevention
 
04:24:49.469 --> 04:24:49.479 align:start position:0%
protection on homes more of a concern
 
04:24:51.309 --> 04:24:51.319 align:start position:0%
probably be of an UNM system
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
unmaintained system is that it would be
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
building up with the contaminants you're
 
04:24:57.149 --> 04:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
removing and if it gets the capacity it
 
04:24:58.950 --> 04:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
starts releasing them and flakes so
 
04:25:00.950 --> 04:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
you'll also release large doses of the
 
04:25:03.189 --> 04:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
very thing you were trying to treat it
 
04:25:05.790 --> 04:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
also becomes a bed for bacteria if it's
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
not replaced at some frequency even if
 
04:25:09.389 --> 04:25:09.399 align:start position:0%
the water met standards coming from
 
04:25:10.750 --> 04:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
sister it's a breeding ground for
 
04:25:13.670 --> 04:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
bacteria if left alone too long one of
 
04:25:17.149 --> 04:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
the treatment options for pest is carbon
 
04:25:19.550 --> 04:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
carbon removes radon very well you can
 
04:25:22.229 --> 04:25:22.239 align:start position:0%
create a radioactive field in your home
 
04:25:24.389 --> 04:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
if you're not replacing that carbon
 
04:25:27.990 --> 04:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
frequently enough and so maintenance is
 
04:25:29.550 --> 04:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
really important I mean just to that
 
04:25:31.990 --> 04:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
point we have radiation detectors at our
 
04:25:33.229 --> 04:25:33.239 align:start position:0%
land Solid Waste
 
04:25:35.630 --> 04:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
landfills and sometimes they go off and
 
04:25:37.349 --> 04:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
it's almost always a water filter
 
04:25:39.870 --> 04:25:39.880 align:start position:0%
inadvertently taking out Rong no one did
 
04:25:42.309 --> 04:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
anything wrong but it it's what it does
 
04:25:44.990 --> 04:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot that can go wrong and
 
04:25:47.189 --> 04:25:47.199 align:start position:0%
it the water treatment system is the one
 
04:25:49.469 --> 04:25:49.479 align:start position:0%
thing that can connect your clean water
 
04:25:51.670 --> 04:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
drinking water to your Wastewater system
 
04:25:53.830 --> 04:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
directly because you often have back
 
04:25:56.109 --> 04:25:56.119 align:start position:0%
washer what have you and again in the
 
04:25:58.750 --> 04:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
state and this is describing or letter
 
04:26:00.830 --> 04:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
there's no real standards for who can
 
04:26:02.469 --> 04:26:02.479 align:start position:0%
install a treatment system in the state
 
04:26:03.590 --> 04:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
you have to be licensed to be a plumber
 
04:26:05.109 --> 04:26:05.119 align:start position:0%
you have to be licensed to be a pump
 
04:26:06.269 --> 04:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
installer you have to license to be
 
04:26:07.269 --> 04:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
drill well but the one thing that
 
04:26:08.830 --> 04:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
changes water quality you don't need a
 
04:26:10.950 --> 04:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
license for and so if you don't have the
 
04:26:12.630 --> 04:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
right air gap when you're putting in
 
04:26:14.149 --> 04:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
that treatment system between waste
 
04:26:16.590 --> 04:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
water and and the Clean Water um yeah
 
04:26:21.910 --> 04:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:25.149 --> 04:26:25.159 align:start position:0%
you no other questions for Mr
 
04:26:28.269 --> 04:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
Karan seeing none thank you Mr Karan
 
04:26:31.109 --> 04:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so I'll call I don't see
 
04:26:32.750 --> 04:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
anybody else I don't have any other pink
 
04:26:35.229 --> 04:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
cards is there anyone else to testify on
 
04:26:35.239 --> 04:26:36.870 align:start position:0%

seeing nobody approaching the speaker
 
04:26:47.469 --> 04:26:47.479 align:start position:0%
table I'll declare HB 449 hearing closed
 
04:26:50.830 --> 04:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
and at 2:30 we'll open HB 513 relative
 
04:26:53.309 --> 04:26:53.319 align:start position:0%
to snowmobiles and Trail connectors

04:33:21.510 --> 04:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
and I have been in discussion out here
 
04:33:25.470 --> 04:33:25.480 align:start position:0%
with u uh
 
04:33:28.269 --> 04:33:28.279 align:start position:0%

David rodrigue of
do

04:33:29.830 --> 04:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:33:34.750 --> 04:33:34.760 align:start position:0%
and the club had followed all the
 
04:33:39.310 --> 04:33:39.320 align:start position:0%
regulations in trying to resolve this
 
04:33:43.150 --> 04:33:43.160 align:start position:0%
and uh we we
 
04:33:46.510 --> 04:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
feel that in discussion with the do that
 
04:33:49.830 --> 04:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
maybe an amendment to this
 
04:33:54.310 --> 04:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
bill would resolve the entire issue
 
04:33:55.830 --> 04:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
because of maybe the way it's
 
04:34:00.750 --> 04:34:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:04.949 --> 04:34:04.959 align:start position:0%

F the club was just mostly concerned
 
04:34:41.320 --> 04:34:42.830 align:start position:0%
F the club was just mostly concerned
about

04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:34:45.150 --> 04:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
they've done all the work to get to the
 
04:34:49.189 --> 04:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
stage where it would have moved forward
 
04:34:50.390 --> 04:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
and they don't want to have to go back
 
04:34:52.590 --> 04:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
through all the measurements all it
 
04:34:55.070 --> 04:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
takes time for them they have to hire
 
04:34:57.470 --> 04:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
people to get the exact measurements and
 
04:35:01.109 --> 04:35:01.119 align:start position:0%
things that the application calls for
 
04:35:03.070 --> 04:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
and they had it approved once and then a
 
04:35:07.109 --> 04:35:07.119 align:start position:0%
private property owner uh said you can't
 
04:35:10.310 --> 04:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
go across this Trail anymore this land
 
04:35:12.349 --> 04:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
and so they were looking for a way to
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
get onto the RightWay and they didn't
 
04:35:16.470 --> 04:35:16.480 align:start position:0%
want to have to measure the whole Trail
 
04:35:21.269 --> 04:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
again so it's words that were the do is
 
04:35:24.551 --> 04:35:24.561 align:start position:0%
concerned about how it's interpreted but
 
04:35:26.910 --> 04:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
David has expressed the do has expressed
 
04:35:31.429 --> 04:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
they can adjust and work with putting an
 
04:35:33.150 --> 04:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
amendment here that they would be happy
 
04:35:36.150 --> 04:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire uh Snowmobile
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
Association that went to their meeting
 
04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
last night in
 
04:35:43.709 --> 04:35:43.719 align:start position:0%
Tilton is fully in support of uh
 
04:35:46.590 --> 04:35:46.600 align:start position:0%
correcting this uh and getting this done
 
04:35:49.390 --> 04:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
and anything the committee can do any uh
 
04:35:50.830 --> 04:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
amendments that would be added would
 
04:35:56.189 --> 04:35:56.199 align:start position:0%
would be uh uh much appreciated and
 
04:36:00.029 --> 04:36:00.039 align:start position:0%
um that's all I have on this
 
04:36:03.189 --> 04:36:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh the bill was just it was a new
 
04:36:07.189 --> 04:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
portion it was the on page
 
04:36:08.910 --> 04:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
two the
 
04:36:11.750 --> 04:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
amendment or the sub paragraph that was
 
04:36:15.830 --> 04:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
inserted was to uh in our thinking in
 
04:36:15.840 --> 04:36:16.629 align:start position:0%
inserted was to uh in our thinking in
the

04:36:16.629 --> 04:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:16.639 --> 04:36:18.949 align:start position:0%
the
beginning

04:36:18.949 --> 04:36:18.959 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
04:36:21.590 --> 04:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh this
 
04:36:24.869 --> 04:36:24.879 align:start position:0%
disconnection uh uh was going to give
 
04:36:28.230 --> 04:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
the dot more of a a way
 
04:36:30.910 --> 04:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
to correct this without having to go
 
04:36:33.869 --> 04:36:33.879 align:start position:0%
through the entire process of doing all
 
04:36:37.629 --> 04:36:37.639 align:start position:0%
the paperwork again so um if you have
 
04:36:39.551 --> 04:36:39.561 align:start position:0%
any questions fine but I think the do
 
04:36:42.910 --> 04:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
team might be able to
 
04:36:46.629 --> 04:36:46.639 align:start position:0%
answer ways to handle this so
 
04:36:48.510 --> 04:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
representative just a heads up uh we're
 
04:36:50.789 --> 04:36:50.799 align:start position:0%

04:37:50.070 --> 04:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to to reemphasize my
 
04:37:51.830 --> 04:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
support for this bill and trying to
 
04:37:53.990 --> 04:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
represent repres sham shamberg who
 
04:37:55.709 --> 04:37:55.719 align:start position:0%
approached me I think partly because I'm
 
04:37:58.029 --> 04:37:58.039 align:start position:0%
also on the the house Public Works and
 
04:38:00.670 --> 04:38:00.680 align:start position:0%
highways committee and do is one of the
 
04:38:03.150 --> 04:38:03.160 align:start position:0%
state agencies we work with the most and
 
04:38:05.551 --> 04:38:05.561 align:start position:0%
I've always found them to be very
 
04:38:08.269 --> 04:38:08.279 align:start position:0%
helpful and very flexible to try to work
 
04:38:10.070 --> 04:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
with people provided they are legally
 
04:38:12.551 --> 04:38:12.561 align:start position:0%
able to do it but this situation they
 
04:38:15.869 --> 04:38:15.879 align:start position:0%
need some help from us uh in order to
 
04:38:18.070 --> 04:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
solve this problem and I think if we
 
04:38:19.910 --> 04:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
solve this problem we're going to help
 
04:38:22.949 --> 04:38:22.959 align:start position:0%
the snowm bill industry which will also
 
04:38:25.230 --> 04:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
help this the tourist in Industry
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
especially in the winter and I know I'm
 
04:38:29.429 --> 04:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
come from Sullivan County by the way I'm
 
04:38:31.150 --> 04:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
sorry didn't neglect to say I'm from
 
04:38:32.990 --> 04:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County district 6 which
 
04:38:35.230 --> 04:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
comprises the communities of Claremont
 
04:38:38.670 --> 04:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
and Cy Claremont a small city of 13,000
 
04:38:42.510 --> 04:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
croin about 800 people uh Sullivan
 
04:38:44.990 --> 04:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
County altogether is maybe 45,000 one of
 
04:38:47.869 --> 04:38:47.879 align:start position:0%
our smaller counties very rural so
 
04:38:50.590 --> 04:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of tour you know as I said
 
04:38:53.189 --> 04:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
they there's a lot of wooded area we
 
04:38:54.510 --> 04:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
have a lot of
 
04:38:57.709 --> 04:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
snowmobilers uh we only have i89 does
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
cross parts of Solen count I believe it
 
04:39:02.590 --> 04:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
crosses parts of don't quote me cin I
 
04:39:04.150 --> 04:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
know we don't have an interstate in
 
04:39:06.590 --> 04:39:06.600 align:start position:0%
Claremont but I think this bill would be
 
04:39:08.910 --> 04:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
very helpful if we could pass it I
 
04:39:10.470 --> 04:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
realize it may have to be slightly
 
04:39:13.830 --> 04:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
amended but I think we've got to to make
 
04:39:17.429 --> 04:39:17.439 align:start position:0%
enable dot to help our snowmobile clubs
 
04:39:20.310 --> 04:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
and and continue a thriving tourist
 
04:39:23.029 --> 04:39:23.039 align:start position:0%
industry uh which will be very helpful
 
04:39:25.910 --> 04:39:25.920 align:start position:0%
to the people and the businesses uh in
 
04:39:30.070 --> 04:39:30.080 align:start position:0%
our state and again I please what I just
 
04:39:32.029 --> 04:39:32.039 align:start position:0%
can't speak highly enough of dot which I
 
04:39:34.869 --> 04:39:34.879 align:start position:0%
think is an efficient government agency
 
04:39:37.470 --> 04:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
only about I think 1,600 employees if
 
04:39:39.830 --> 04:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
I'm correct me if I'm wrong but they try
 
04:39:42.070 --> 04:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
to be responsive whenever they can and
 
04:39:43.788 --> 04:39:43.798 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for listening to me
 
04:39:46.270 --> 04:39:46.280 align:start position:0%

04:39:55.628 --> 04:39:55.638 align:start position:0%
a RightWay being used in this way on a
 
04:39:58.470 --> 04:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
state highway or off the top of my head
 
04:40:01.190 --> 04:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
I can't think of any I but I can if it
 
04:40:04.030 --> 04:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
gave me a maybe an hour or so I could go
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
back in my memory in my records I think
 
04:40:09.550 --> 04:40:09.560 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with similar bills before
 
04:40:11.550 --> 04:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
and I think we've always tried to to be
 
04:40:15.510 --> 04:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
helpful with them uh you right a right
 
04:40:20.110 --> 04:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
rways can be a touchy issue but I think
 
04:40:22.670 --> 04:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
do in the end according to what I
 
04:40:24.550 --> 04:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
understand it's not the federal
 
04:40:26.830 --> 04:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
government it's the do2 who has
 
04:40:29.110 --> 04:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility for maintaining these
 
04:40:31.470 --> 04:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
these right of ways and so I think we've
 
04:40:33.628 --> 04:40:33.638 align:start position:0%
got to pass some sort of legislation
 
04:40:36.628 --> 04:40:36.638 align:start position:0%
like this bill to an able dot to do its
 
04:40:39.470 --> 04:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
job to help the snowmobile
 
04:40:42.310 --> 04:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
clubs any other questions for the
 
04:40:44.230 --> 04:40:44.240 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you
 
04:40:47.990 --> 04:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:51.510 --> 04:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
you from uh do David I'm gonna say this
 
04:40:58.150 --> 04:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:58.160 --> 04:40:59.788 align:start position:0%
 
R

04:40:59.788 --> 04:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
R
 
04:41:02.150 --> 04:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chair good
 
04:41:05.910 --> 04:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee um
 
04:41:09.110 --> 04:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
so it seems like we have some agreement
 
04:41:12.830 --> 04:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
to work on an amendment to this bill so
 
04:41:15.390 --> 04:41:15.400 align:start position:0%
I will save my testimony that's prepared
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
for the bill as presented um but I'll do
 
04:41:22.110 --> 04:41:22.120 align:start position:0%
two things the the first is I will go
 
04:41:24.750 --> 04:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
back and see if we can find a way to
 
04:41:28.310 --> 04:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
permit this without the legislation if
 
04:41:30.110 --> 04:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
we need enabling
 
04:41:32.788 --> 04:41:32.798 align:start position:0%
legislation and the representatives are
 
04:41:34.868 --> 04:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
willing to work with us we will work
 
04:41:38.270 --> 04:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
with them to have language that we think
 
04:41:41.628 --> 04:41:41.638 align:start position:0%
helps um this is a difficult ult
 
04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
situation for us because this connector
 
04:41:49.430 --> 04:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
is on the interstate right of way which
 
04:41:51.788 --> 04:41:51.798 align:start position:0%
as Federal Highway has informed them is
 
04:41:55.550 --> 04:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
correct it's a do who owns a process to
 
04:41:58.510 --> 04:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
permit that but we do need to prepare
 
04:42:00.868 --> 04:42:00.878 align:start position:0%
information for federal highways
 
04:42:03.750 --> 04:42:03.760 align:start position:0%
permission to do that the other thing I
 
04:42:06.830 --> 04:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
just heard is it's potential that this
 
04:42:10.670 --> 04:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
Trail may cross some state-owned Surplus
 
04:42:10.680 --> 04:42:11.750 align:start position:0%
Trail may cross some state-owned Surplus
land

04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
land
 
04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
which has a legislative process that we
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
often need to go through in order to
 
04:42:21.750 --> 04:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
cumber in incumber or dispose of or let
 
04:42:24.270 --> 04:42:24.280 align:start position:0%
that state own land be used so I will
 
04:42:27.150 --> 04:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
research those two things I'm hopeful we
 
04:42:29.948 --> 04:42:29.958 align:start position:0%
can get to yes without any necessary
 
04:42:32.430 --> 04:42:32.440 align:start position:0%
legislation and I'll take any questions
 
04:42:36.230 --> 04:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
from the committee any
 
04:42:39.310 --> 04:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
questions representative NB thank you Mr
 
04:42:40.670 --> 04:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
04:42:43.470 --> 04:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
is there a safety issue with um having
 
04:42:45.030 --> 04:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
snowmobiles running parallel to a
 
04:42:48.030 --> 04:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
highway there there can be safety issues
 
04:42:49.788 --> 04:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
yes and that's one of the things that we
 
04:42:52.070 --> 04:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
consider so for an interstate we're
 
04:42:54.750 --> 04:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
fortunate to have a fair amount of land
 
04:42:57.230 --> 04:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
from the edge of pavement to the edge of
 
04:42:59.708 --> 04:42:59.718 align:start position:0%
the RightWay but as we look at that
 
04:43:02.070 --> 04:43:02.080 align:start position:0%
we'll consider a couple of things
 
04:43:04.310 --> 04:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
whether the RightWay fence needs to be
 
04:43:07.030 --> 04:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
breached for for the trail to get on
 
04:43:09.510 --> 04:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
there it's possible we can relocate that
 
04:43:12.110 --> 04:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
to keep a continuous fence to help to
 
04:43:14.670 --> 04:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
keep animals out of the RightWay we'll
 
04:43:18.670 --> 04:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
also look at lights and the impact the
 
04:43:20.910 --> 04:43:20.920 align:start position:0%
lights from the snowmobile could have on
 
04:43:23.390 --> 04:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
the interstate traffic and any confusion
 
04:43:25.910 --> 04:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
that could cause and we'll also look at
 
04:43:28.430 --> 04:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
any maintenance issues that a trail
 
04:43:31.310 --> 04:43:31.320 align:start position:0%
could cost cause so there are always
 
04:43:33.868 --> 04:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
concerns but we're we're hopeful we can
 
04:43:36.910 --> 04:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
mitigate them and the the reason we have
 
04:43:39.550 --> 04:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
a process is because of those safety
 
04:43:39.560 --> 04:43:42.868 align:start position:0%
a process is because of those safety
concerns

04:43:42.868 --> 04:43:42.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
yes representative uh
 
04:43:48.070 --> 04:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
Bridal thank you chair and thank you for
 
04:43:51.670 --> 04:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question um this parcel that
 
04:43:54.550 --> 04:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
is uh denied access doesn't look like
 
04:43:55.788 --> 04:43:55.798 align:start position:0%
there's any buildings on that but what
 
04:43:57.310 --> 04:43:57.320 align:start position:0%
I'm more concerned with is that where
 
04:44:01.110 --> 04:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
the rightaway is proposed I think of the
 
04:44:03.190 --> 04:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
only other side of the
 
04:44:06.550 --> 04:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
road snowmobile access is Route 11 I
 
04:44:08.390 --> 04:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
think going up to through like Alton in
 
04:44:10.070 --> 04:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
that area and they have Bridges and
 
04:44:11.830 --> 04:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
stuff there that cross some water is
 
04:44:15.708 --> 04:44:15.718 align:start position:0%
there any um concerns about for lack of
 
04:44:17.670 --> 04:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
better turn infrastructure needs that
 
04:44:19.310 --> 04:44:19.320 align:start position:0%
this I think it's a th000 foot section
 
04:44:20.510 --> 04:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
would require is there any Bridges or
 
04:44:21.708 --> 04:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
anything that needs to be built or is
 
04:44:25.670 --> 04:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
this just a uh like a 10 foot dirt path
 
04:44:27.670 --> 04:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to be straight through that
 
04:44:29.628 --> 04:44:29.638 align:start position:0%
that's a good question that will be part
 
04:44:34.628 --> 04:44:34.638 align:start position:0%
of our reviews um what I can say is um
 
04:44:37.910 --> 04:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
dncr and the clubs are very Cooperative
 
04:44:40.510 --> 04:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
with us if if any water Crossings or
 
04:44:42.868 --> 04:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
anything needed they will provide that
 
04:44:45.590 --> 04:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
as part of the the trail construction
 
04:44:46.948 --> 04:44:46.958 align:start position:0%
and that's something will'll work
 
04:44:50.550 --> 04:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
through um in a permitting
 
04:44:53.550 --> 04:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
process representative Derby thank you
 
04:44:55.510 --> 04:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
04:44:59.190 --> 04:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
question um so you mentioned um things
 
04:45:01.750 --> 04:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
like the the study and you know possible
 
04:45:03.550 --> 04:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
fencing changes and things like that is
 
04:45:04.670 --> 04:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
is that money you already have in your
 
04:45:08.110 --> 04:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
budget to to um make those changes if
 
04:45:10.430 --> 04:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
needed that's something we would work
 
04:45:14.788 --> 04:45:14.798 align:start position:0%
with dncr and the clubs um dncr has some
 
04:45:17.470 --> 04:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
funds that go to the clubs and we would
 
04:45:20.110 --> 04:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
typically be looking to the clubs to use
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
those grant and aid funds to um make
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:31.430 --> 04:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure any other
 
04:45:33.948 --> 04:45:33.958 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
04:45:36.350 --> 04:45:36.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony thank
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
you I don't have any more pink cards and
 
04:45:41.830 --> 04:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
I don't see anyone approaching the table
 
04:45:48.948 --> 04:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:51.390 --> 04:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
yes okay as soon as I make sure there's
 
04:45:53.670 --> 04:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
nobody else is there anybody else to
 
04:46:03.670 --> 04:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:06.990 --> 04:46:07.000 align:start position:0%
513 I won't go that fast I guess uh so
 
04:46:08.390 --> 04:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
my name is Adam Schmid I'm a lobbyist
 
04:46:09.990 --> 04:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
here in conquered and I do represent the
 
04:46:12.510 --> 04:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire snowmobile Association uh
 
04:46:13.948 --> 04:46:13.958 align:start position:0%
everything representative shamberg
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
conveyed to you earlier um was conveyed
 
04:46:17.270 --> 04:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
to me by their executive director this
 
04:46:19.150 --> 04:46:19.160 align:start position:0%
morning that said hey can you go pinch
 
04:46:20.788 --> 04:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
hit for us at the house resources
 
04:46:22.670 --> 04:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
committee um they're going to follow up
 
04:46:24.350 --> 04:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
to with the committee with some written
 
04:46:27.150 --> 04:46:27.160 align:start position:0%
testimony in support of the bill um
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
obviously the bill will have to be
 
04:46:29.948 --> 04:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
tweaked based upon the testimony we've
 
04:46:32.948 --> 04:46:32.958 align:start position:0%
heard so far I would trust do and and
 
04:46:34.430 --> 04:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative shamberg to work through
 
04:46:36.390 --> 04:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
that but just very briefly wanted to
 
04:46:38.510 --> 04:46:38.520 align:start position:0%
make sure the committee was aware uh
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
nhsa is supportive of this effort to try
 
04:46:42.510 --> 04:46:42.520 align:start position:0%
to solve this problem how we do it we're
 
04:46:45.310 --> 04:46:45.320 align:start position:0%
open to whatever dot needs to make this
 
04:46:47.390 --> 04:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
work but you will get some written
 
04:46:48.948 --> 04:46:48.958 align:start position:0%
correspondents from the association
 
04:46:51.070 --> 04:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
indicating their support for this thank
 
04:46:52.708 --> 04:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
you very I probably can't answer any
 
04:46:55.670 --> 04:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
questions about it okay so we won't ask
 
04:47:01.590 --> 04:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:06.430 --> 04:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:08.910 --> 04:47:08.920 align:start position:0%
minute so last time I asked this we got
 
04:47:10.590 --> 04:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
somebody else is there anybody else to
 
04:47:17.270 --> 04:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:20.990 --> 04:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
H will there's any further is
 
04:47:22.910 --> 04:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
information I'll try to be at the exact
 
04:47:25.230 --> 04:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
session I think next Wednesday just in
 
04:47:27.310 --> 04:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
case when I will work with represent
 
04:47:31.990 --> 04:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:34.670 --> 04:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
something thank you for the
 
04:47:36.910 --> 04:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
representatives it would be helpful to
 
04:47:39.590 --> 04:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
us if you work with the do and they say
 
04:47:41.670 --> 04:47:41.680 align:start position:0%
we can do this without it
 
04:47:44.070 --> 04:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
um if you could send us a note and say
 
04:47:46.868 --> 04:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
we don't need this legislation anymore
 
04:47:48.708 --> 04:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
and the way I understand all the bills
 
04:47:50.910 --> 04:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
we passed or didn't pass uh we'll still
 
04:47:53.190 --> 04:47:53.200 align:start position:0%
bring it up for a vote and probably itl
 
04:47:56.070 --> 04:47:56.080 align:start position:0%
it but um it would be nice if you told
 
04:47:58.030 --> 04:47:58.040 align:start position:0%
us that in advance or here's the
 
04:47:59.948 --> 04:47:59.958 align:start position:0%
amendment and then we'll bring the
 
04:48:02.150 --> 04:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
amendment up at the exec session for a
 
04:48:04.470 --> 04:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
vote okay thank you very much no one
 
04:48:06.750 --> 04:48:06.760 align:start position:0%
else approaching I've asked three times
 
04:48:09.868 --> 04:48:09.878 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to close HB 5113 and can I
 
04:48:11.868 --> 04:48:11.878 align:start position:0%
ask the Republican in this committee to
 
04:48:20.310 --> 04:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:22.788 --> 04:48:22.798 align:start position:0%
you the green folders probably have
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:39.708 --> 04:48:39.718 align:start position:0%
