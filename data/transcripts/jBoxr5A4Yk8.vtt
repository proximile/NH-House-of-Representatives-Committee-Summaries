which one
 
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.570 align:start position:0%
which one
resource

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
well good morning everyone being a
 
00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 align:start position:0%
little close to 9 30.
 
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 align:start position:0%
we have the department of administrative
 
00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
Services I see
 
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
few folks I recognize
 
00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
and this is on page 56 for those of you
 
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
oh yes that's that's what we think too
 
00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
that's a good sign
 
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 align:start position:0%
I I ended up saying to to Sherry um last
 
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
night I said our page numbers are they
 
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 align:start position:0%
their page numbers and are we I mean are
 
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
we working off the same version of the
 
00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
document because I I did this once where
 
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
we weren't and the page didn't mess
 
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
everybody up so we we are I'm Charlie
 
00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus I'm the commissioner of
 
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
administrative services and with me is I
 
00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
want you uh Catherine Keane Cassie you
 
00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
may call me I'm the Deputy Commissioner
 
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
of Das and I have a lot of people with
 
00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 align:start position:0%
me in case you have questions because I
 
00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
might not be able to answer them in fact
 
00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
very likely
 
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
um so Sherry Rockburn is in the front
 
00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
row and Sherry also did the slides so
 
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
that's very exciting sure is the
 
00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
assistant commissioner and we try to
 
00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 align:start position:0%
avoid calling her the new Joe Bouchard
 
00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:16.979 align:start position:0%
because that seems unfair
 
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
but occasionally that helps people
 
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.330 align:start position:0%
but occasionally that helps people
understand

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 align:start position:0%
in the back row is our CFO Maureen Ryan
 
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
Hoffman next to hers Kathy Schmidt
 
00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
um in who we're both part of our Central
 
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%
Finance office and then the front row
 
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
for whom you may have more questions
 
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
than for me is Karen rantamaki who is
 
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
our director of plant and property she's
 
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.290 align:start position:0%
our director of plant and property she's
right

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 align:start position:0%
was there okay
 
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 align:start position:0%
so excuse me between us we should be
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
able to answer any questions I'm going
 
00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
to go through the presentation because I
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
thought rather than going accounting
 
00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 align:start position:0%
unit by accounting unit which we we can
 
00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:50.759 align:start position:0%
do if you if you want
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
um I'll summarize some things
 
00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
and it'll help um understand some so
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
looking at our presentation
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
I've talked to you about who we are and
 
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
why you should care that we're a central
 
00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
Service Agency I'm not going to go
 
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 align:start position:0%
through that again but just the notion
 
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
that um of the the many varied things
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
that we do as an agency and how they
 
00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:10.979 align:start position:0%
affect everybody else but that's there
 
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 align:start position:0%
for your reference I'm going to skip to
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
page four
 
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
page four which is titled how do we
 
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.310 align:start position:0%
page four which is titled how do we
spend

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
spend
 
00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 align:start position:0%
um it feels like I should be a song how
 
00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:27.419 align:start position:0%
I I broke it up in a couple of ways when
 
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 align:start position:0%
I want to use this slide to explain to
 
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
you a little bit about who we are one is
 
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:32.629 align:start position:0%
you a little bit about who we are one is
that

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
um there are five groups we refer to as
 
00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:37.220 align:start position:0%
attached boards these are independent
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
administratively attached agencies
 
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
um they're our friends they're our
 
00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 align:start position:0%
family but they're not we're not the
 
00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:46.919 align:start position:0%
boss of them and so I so I say that we
 
00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
do some administrative things helping
 
00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
them out
 
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:51.660 align:start position:0%
um with finance and HR and a couple
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
things like that but they're independent
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
agencies so
 
00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 align:start position:0%
um there's time you have on your
 
00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 align:start position:0%
schedule to talk to them about their
 
00:06:57.479 --> 00:06:58.909 align:start position:0%
schedule to talk to them about their
budget

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 align:start position:0%
um and it's not something that we
 
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
control so I just say that um so that
 
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:05.100 align:start position:0%
everybody understands because
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
um administratively attached agencies
 
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
are something that there's often a lot
 
00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:11.039 align:start position:0%
of misunderstanding about in um
 
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
in various quarters of state government
 
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
and how they really are completely
 
00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
independent agencies they just happen to
 
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:18.060 align:start position:0%
be very small agencies one of them is
 
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
actually literally a staff of one but
 
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
they're nonetheless an agency just in
 
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
the same way HHS is just slightly fewer
 
00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:28.249 align:start position:0%
the same way HHS is just slightly fewer
people

00:07:28.249 --> 00:07:28.259 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:07:28.259 --> 00:07:28.969 align:start position:0%
people
um

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:28.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk to you about retiree
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
Health plant and property and then
 
00:07:34.309 --> 00:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
everything else we do
 
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
um and it's
 
00:07:37.370 --> 00:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
one way to think of our budget and I
 
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
often think of it this way is we're two
 
00:07:43.309 --> 00:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
agencies we're retiree health
 
00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 align:start position:0%
and we're administrative Services
 
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
retiree health is a is a separate
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
program it's not an it's not an
 
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
operational thing that we do it's a it's
 
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
a it's a benefit that we pay and
 
00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
um what happens there is slightly
 
00:07:59.089 --> 00:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
different you know there's not staff
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
there's not we have staff who administer
 
00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
it but that part of the budget is a um
 
00:08:07.129 --> 00:08:07.139 align:start position:0%
is a benefit that's administered and and
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
so we we think of it very differently
 
00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:10.500 align:start position:0%
the rest of it is the operations of the
 
00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:12.419 align:start position:0%
department that we do I say plan
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
property because they're half of the
 
00:08:16.129 --> 00:08:16.139 align:start position:0%
rest of the department it's the biggest
 
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
thing that we do is take care of
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
buildings I don't mean it's the most
 
00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
important thing we do but the day your
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
heat goes out it is the most important
 
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
thing we do the water leaks from the
 
00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
second floor ladies room into your
 
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
office I speak hypothetically as
 
00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:30.660 align:start position:0%
somebody whose office is under the
 
00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
second floor ladies room and had a leak
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
into it it did actually happen I was out
 
00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:37.339 align:start position:0%
for three weeks
 
00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
so that's us you got a leak we fix it um
 
00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:43.140 align:start position:0%
that's Karen actually
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
um not literally every leak she's not
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
out there with a with a monkey wrench
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
but um still she could be
 
00:08:51.889 --> 00:08:51.899 align:start position:0%
um so those are pieces you're going to
 
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
see in our budget something called
 
00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:56.580 align:start position:0%
Central facilities expense which is an
 
00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:57.889 align:start position:0%
Central facilities expense which is an
additional

00:08:57.889 --> 00:08:57.899 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:08:57.899 --> 00:08:58.490 align:start position:0%
additional
um

00:08:58.490 --> 00:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
double budgeting mechanism that's
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
created and it's created and I'll
 
00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:04.019 align:start position:0%
explain it um at the end of our
 
00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
divisions uh a way to more accurately
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
and precisely account for expenses
 
00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:11.459 align:start position:0%
instead of a sort of ham-handed way
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
we've done it in the past
 
00:09:15.050 --> 00:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna go to slide five where do we
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
spend General funds Finance committees
 
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
tend to be particularly concerned about
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
General funds
 
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:22.680 align:start position:0%
and I want to make the point here that
 
00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
you know the governor's targets were
 
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
were relatively tight for most agencies
 
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
for every agency
 
00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
and I just point this out to show you
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
that we actually hit the governor's
 
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
Target we're down three percent off of
 
00:09:38.329 --> 00:09:38.339 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized and then up and and
 
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:40.620 align:start position:0%
then up in the second year as everybody
 
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
is but um we made a very significant
 
00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:45.899 align:start position:0%
effort in the efficiency budget and in
 
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
what the governor ended up proposing uh
 
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
uh to propose a very very tight budget
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
and so if you look at that at the bottom
 
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
of page five
 
00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:57.660 align:start position:0%
um it's really very I think it's very
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
strong and I now I'm going to go through
 
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
the divisions one by one commissioner
 
00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
you don't mind if you take some
 
00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
questions I'll take questions at any any
 
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
time at any moment representative
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
McGuire thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
commissioner so
 
00:10:11.930 --> 00:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
um on this page I just want to ask
 
00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
because we're here right sure look at
 
00:10:15.829 --> 00:10:15.839 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's office line and look
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
at 22 actuals compared to the rest yes
 
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
so what happened uh legal settlements
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
legal settlements are not budgeted but
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
are paid out of a out of an accounting
 
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
unit that is within the office of the
 
00:10:31.090 --> 00:10:31.100 align:start position:0%
commissioner activity code so every year
 
00:10:34.009 --> 00:10:34.019 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year that
 
00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
that particular activity code ends up
 
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
looking large in this particular case
 
00:10:41.449 --> 00:10:41.459 align:start position:0%
there were something like 6.2 million
 
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:43.500 align:start position:0%
dollars of settlements that were paid
 
00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:46.140 align:start position:0%
that um significantly inflates that
 
00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
number and so so that is something I
 
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
should have pointed that out because we
 
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:50.389 align:start position:0%
should have pointed that out because we
actually

00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:52.500 align:start position:0%
we actually talked about that and I and
 
00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:54.300 align:start position:0%
I forgot to mention it so thanks for
 
00:10:56.569 --> 00:10:56.579 align:start position:0%
noticing so all the other things are
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
going up to some degree I mean it looks
 
00:11:01.069 --> 00:11:01.079 align:start position:0%
flat right but but there's a mission
 
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
piece there that's going to come along
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
presumably it is is that 6 million
 
00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
unusual do you know what the history of
 
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.690 align:start position:0%
unusual do you know what the history of
that

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
um the 6 million is not I can get you
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
the history of that the 6 million Is Not
 
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
Unusual we have
 
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.490 align:start position:0%
Unusual we have
um

00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
we have settlements and and I'm going to
 
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
guess but I think they vary between
 
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
maybe four and 10 million a year and but
 
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
why don't I look up the history of that
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
but um so maybe we should have a budget
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
number rather than a zero becoming 6
 
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.870 align:start position:0%
number rather than a zero becoming 6
million

00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
um there are it's it's accounted for in
 
00:11:40.009 --> 00:11:40.019 align:start position:0%
the kafir but um
 
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
it's a good question I mean maybe we
 
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
should have a budgeted number but um let
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
me do a let me do a history Jerry do you
 
00:11:47.449 --> 00:11:47.459 align:start position:0%
have something
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
full history but I was just going to
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
reference reference
 
00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:56.220 align:start position:0%
say 99 Colon D is the RSA that allows
 
00:11:59.930 --> 00:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
for the legal settlements to be paid as
 
00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:01.740 align:start position:0%
they're incurred and they're funded from
 
00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
funds not otherwise appropriated and the
 
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
governor can draw a warrant against any
 
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:08.220 align:start position:0%
settlement that comes in so that's
 
00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
because that RSA exists it traditionally
 
00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:13.140 align:start position:0%
hasn't been budgeted and then if we do
 
00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:15.660 align:start position:0%
have a settlement our department will
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
issue a warrant on behalf of the
 
00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
governor to make those those payments
 
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
out the door RSA number again yep
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
99-d colon 2.
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.889 --> 00:12:33.899 align:start position:0%
yeah so the concept is if we budgeted
 
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
something maybe that would incentivize
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
people to sue us is that the problem or
 
00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:42.839 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to say that's true
 
00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
because I I think the people who
 
00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
represent the people suing
 
00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
um don't think that they're limited by
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
whether money is appropriated or not so
 
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
I don't think I don't think it's
 
00:12:56.449 --> 00:12:56.459 align:start position:0%
actually an incentive but I don't think
 
00:12:57.889 --> 00:12:57.899 align:start position:0%
it would be a horrible idea to set money
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
aside for it if you in a year where you
 
00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
had money to set aside you'd probably
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
want to create a separate
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing accounting unit and uh
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
why don't we why don't we get you a five
 
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
six seven year history of of what we've
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
paid uh and source of funds and because
 
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
typically the settlement comes from
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
if a tree falls on you in the Parks and
 
00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
you sue the parks fund would pay for
 
00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
that if you something happens on the
 
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
highway the highway fund would pay for
 
00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:29.459 align:start position:0%
that and so a lot of it is General funds
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:38.090 align:start position:0%
 
attack

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:49.260 align:start position:0%
there's something to be said for that
 
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
too much time on this but the justice
 
00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:54.180 align:start position:0%
department gives a fiscal committee a
 
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
list of the settlement amounts so this
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
those settlement amounts basically paid
 
00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:02.820 align:start position:0%
from your account I guess yes it's a lot
 
00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
of things like that were they somebody
 
00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
else takes an action and we write a
 
00:14:10.129 --> 00:14:10.139 align:start position:0%
check all right thanks so
 
00:14:10.139 --> 00:14:11.509 align:start position:0%
check all right thanks so
um

00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:13.620 align:start position:0%
but yes these are routine thing that
 
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:15.180 align:start position:0%
comes through when we process them very
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
quickly it's it's one of the things
 
00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:18.540 align:start position:0%
somebody told me when I started these
 
00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339 align:start position:0%
can't sit on your desk
 
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
like when you're when you're I spend
 
00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:24.660 align:start position:0%
half my day signing things but this is
 
00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
something where they said you know it
 
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
comes in we're not sticking in a folder
 
00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
it's presented to you and it's so
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
um so I want to skip ahead to Page Six
 
00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:36.600 align:start position:0%
um operational challenges I'm gonna I'm
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
gonna lead with this rather than ending
 
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
with this and this is functionally the
 
00:14:42.769 --> 00:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
the three things we're going to ask you
 
00:14:42.779 --> 00:14:44.269 align:start position:0%
the three things we're going to ask you
for

00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:14:46.189 --> 00:14:46.199 align:start position:0%
um that aren't in the budget and so I
 
00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:47.459 align:start position:0%
thought you know let's just be upfront
 
00:14:49.129 --> 00:14:49.139 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:14:52.009 --> 00:14:52.019 align:start position:0%
um and there are three areas and they're
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
not in in a priority order because
 
00:14:56.269 --> 00:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
they're sort of of equal Priority One is
 
00:14:57.889 --> 00:14:57.899 align:start position:0%
moving costs and fed up for swing space
 
00:14:59.810 --> 00:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
it's one of the challenges we have
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
routinely and people have noticed this
 
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
with the parking garage moving moving of
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
Justice debate and all of that and
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
additional people are going to have to
 
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
move there is moving costs are never
 
00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
budgeted or planned for
 
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
um we're going to be doing a significant
 
00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
renovation on the on the State House
 
00:15:17.329 --> 00:15:17.339 align:start position:0%
Annex which is which involves all the
 
00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
mechanical systems Etc and there's a lot
 
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
of moving that goes on with that and
 
00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
moving costs are fairly expensive
 
00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
it's a bill for granite play Slash
 
00:15:29.329 --> 00:15:29.339 align:start position:0%
moving Justice slash the parking garage
 
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
had a placeholder of 1.2 million dollars
 
00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
for moving costs and so what I what I am
 
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
going to ask you for is is could we
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
consider doing that
 
00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:42.300 align:start position:0%
um for uh the rest of the moves in in
 
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:44.220 align:start position:0%
state government
 
00:15:44.220 --> 00:15:44.930 align:start position:0%
state government
um

00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:44.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
for moving people around both with the
 
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
annex renovation the likelihood of
 
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
buying Granite place and moving other
 
00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
agencies into it
 
00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:54.300 align:start position:0%
um you know for example what if
 
00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:56.040 align:start position:0%
agriculture moves from the annex into
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
Granite place they have no money
 
00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:00.899 align:start position:0%
budgeted for for moving
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
um and then Hall Street which apparently
 
00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:03.899 align:start position:0%
the capital budget contemplates buying
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
as well the old Granite State College
 
00:16:07.189 --> 00:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
Bear right building
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
two new positions
 
00:16:11.750 --> 00:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
and I know how the committee looks upon
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
new positions but I'm going to ask
 
00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.170 align:start position:0%
new positions but I'm going to ask
um

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
the one question is purchasing agents as
 
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
as some of you know the governor and
 
00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
Council undertook a significant change
 
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
this year commodity contracts did not
 
00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
used to go to governor and Council
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
um you know I think that things that go
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
to governor and Council involve a great
 
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
deal more work than things that don't go
 
00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:34.440 align:start position:0%
to governor and Council
 
00:16:38.569 --> 00:16:38.579 align:start position:0%
so um the the division of procurement
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
has essentially had their workload I
 
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
don't want to say doubled because it's
 
00:16:44.389 --> 00:16:44.399 align:start position:0%
not quite that bad but it's close to
 
00:16:46.189 --> 00:16:46.199 align:start position:0%
that and
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
um what I'd like to do is ask for three
 
00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:49.860 align:start position:0%
new purchasing agents Rank and file
 
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:53.180 align:start position:0%
purchasing agents not not managers not
 
00:16:55.249 --> 00:16:55.259 align:start position:0%
semi-directors or anything like that but
 
00:16:57.889 --> 00:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
just on people to people to get the job
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
done because of the significant
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
additional effort it's a cost associated
 
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:06.299 align:start position:0%
the HR coordinator positions would be a
 
00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
conversion we stood up a recruitment
 
00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.010 align:start position:0%
conversion we stood up a recruitment
unit

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:09.020 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:17:12.949 --> 00:17:12.959 align:start position:0%
with arpa funds at uh at the division of
 
00:17:14.929 --> 00:17:14.939 align:start position:0%
personnel we we think it's going very
 
00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
successfully it's identifying
 
00:17:18.829 --> 00:17:18.839 align:start position:0%
significant operational challenges that
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
exist in the state and that we're
 
00:17:25.370 --> 00:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
um and that the there is an ability to
 
00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.390 align:start position:0%
um and that the there is an ability to
um

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:29.460 align:start position:0%
there's an ability to uh
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
make a significant operational change
 
00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:32.580 align:start position:0%
for the state you know in the state with
 
00:17:35.810 --> 00:17:35.820 align:start position:0%
a 20 vacancy rate this is a big thing so
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
what we'd like to do is to make those
 
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
positions permanent as opposed to
 
00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
um temporary arpa positions and I I hope
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
you would consider
 
00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
um smiling upon that or part of that and
 
00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
then the third thing is deferred
 
00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:49.909 align:start position:0%
then the third thing is deferred
maintenance

00:17:49.909 --> 00:17:49.919 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
um as representative Weiler's leaky
 
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
stairwell story indicates
 
00:17:58.970 --> 00:17:58.980 align:start position:0%
um we have a lot of leaky bucket Roofing
 
00:18:01.610 --> 00:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
Etc related issues and
 
00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:03.539 align:start position:0%
um deferred maintenance is always an
 
00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:06.660 align:start position:0%
issue and one thing we had looked at
 
00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
um trying to do frankly in the
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
governor's phase and and we didn't get
 
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
it and I'm so I'm asking you
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
um is 3.6 million we would we would ask
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
it be appropriated to the maintenance
 
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:18.890 align:start position:0%
it be appropriated to the maintenance
fund

00:18:18.890 --> 00:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
by doing that it becomes a one-time
 
00:18:21.179 --> 00:18:22.370 align:start position:0%
by doing that it becomes a one-time
expense

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:22.380 align:start position:0%
expense
 
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
as opposed to uh um an ongoing effort
 
00:18:27.289 --> 00:18:27.299 align:start position:0%
you know the we'll talk we can talk
 
00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
about the maintenance fund when we get
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
there and how it's funded but the idea
 
00:18:34.549 --> 00:18:34.559 align:start position:0%
of that fund um which is this committee
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
and the Senate created uh four years ago
 
00:18:39.650 --> 00:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
was to fix things that need fixing as
 
00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to fixing things in an
 
00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
accounting unit that happens to have
 
00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:48.299 align:start position:0%
money left over so fix the roof that's
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
most broken not the roof where we happen
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
to have money left over so those are the
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
three things I'm going to essentially
 
00:18:57.169 --> 00:18:57.179 align:start position:0%
ask you for so if you remember that
 
00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:00.620 align:start position:0%
during our presentation it's there
 
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
so turning to Pardon Me turning to page
 
00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.750 align:start position:0%
so turning to Pardon Me turning to page
seven

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:08.220 align:start position:0%
I know that Kennedy has an interest in
 
00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:08.810 align:start position:0%
I know that Kennedy has an interest in
um

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
in uh vacancy rates and and how we're
 
00:19:12.059 --> 00:19:13.669 align:start position:0%
in uh vacancy rates and and how we're
doing

00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
um and so this is just a description of
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
our of our 311 full-time classified and
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
unclassified positions where are we and
 
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:23.220 align:start position:0%
the vacancy rate is is roughly flat I
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
like to think we're doing a great job
 
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
and keeping up I mean we hire
 
00:19:30.289 --> 00:19:30.299 align:start position:0%
to give you an idea in our agency we
 
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
hire something between 100 and 130
 
00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
people every 12 months
 
00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
and a lot of those are part-timers have
 
00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:40.740 align:start position:0%
maybe half part-time half full-time and
 
00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:42.059 align:start position:0%
there's a turnover with people going to
 
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
other agencies but we're we're happy to
 
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
be a sort of a net net improver of our
 
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:50.460 align:start position:0%
position not every not every agency is
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
but we make an effort to only make an
 
00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:55.460 align:start position:0%
effort to be a nice place to work so
 
00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
that tries to get you some people
 
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:01.740 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:20:04.370 --> 00:20:04.380 align:start position:0%
yes question represents McGuire thank
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
you so
 
00:20:08.210 --> 00:20:08.220 align:start position:0%
um this says 311 which is the current
 
00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:12.059 align:start position:0%
number but the budget on page 127 says
 
00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
you're going up to 328.
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
um I guess you'll talk as we go along
 
00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:19.980 align:start position:0%
yes we'll go if you want we'll go
 
00:20:21.289 --> 00:20:21.299 align:start position:0%
through division by division and I'll
 
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
talk about that yeah a number of those
 
00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.669 align:start position:0%
talk about that yeah a number of those
are

00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
committee should be aware of this
 
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:30.240 align:start position:0%
the 311 number that's in the budget
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
document tends what one does not include
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
part-time positions does not include
 
00:20:36.950 --> 00:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
full-time temporary positions does the
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:44.220 align:start position:0%
part of our increase of the line share
 
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
of our increases the conversion of some
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
of those 59 positions into regular class
 
00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:51.780 align:start position:0%
10 classified positions and I can talk
 
00:20:53.570 --> 00:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
about those agency by agency as we go
 
00:20:55.669 --> 00:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
and then a couple of a couple of things
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
here and there
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
um where there were additions to our
 
00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:00.950 align:start position:0%
um where there were additions to our
list

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
and Sherry's actually sitting next to me
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
with a giant breakdown of
 
00:21:06.529 --> 00:21:06.539 align:start position:0%
because she spent time last night
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
reconciling our position comes
 
00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to start with the
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner's office which is in your
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
budget book is page 56 to 63.
 
00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner's office is not
 
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
um just me and
 
00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:22.140 align:start position:0%
my coffee machine I don't I don't
 
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
actually have a coffee machine that's
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
not permitted under State rules
 
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.110 align:start position:0%
not permitted under State rules
um

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:29.149 --> 00:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
it's it includes the state budget office
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
the Department Of Central Finance office
 
00:21:33.649 --> 00:21:33.659 align:start position:0%
or business office including Human
 
00:21:36.110 --> 00:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
Resources payroll Etc the office of Cost
 
00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
Containment which is a small program the
 
00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:40.559 align:start position:0%
Deferred Compensation commission is in
 
00:21:42.789 --> 00:21:42.799 align:start position:0%
there our rules and procedures office
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
which are lawyers who work on rules
 
00:21:49.490 --> 00:21:49.500 align:start position:0%
um so various assorted things in that
 
00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:51.260 align:start position:0%
group as well
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
the numbers here
 
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.970 align:start position:0%
the numbers here
um

00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
the numbers here include a couple things
 
00:22:00.350 --> 00:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
and I've highlighted for you
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
um the slight increases we
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
we wanted to budget an additional fifty
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for overtime across the
 
00:22:09.830 --> 00:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
department department and because of the
 
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire first upgrade that is
 
00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:12.780 align:start position:0%
going to happen
 
00:22:15.409 --> 00:22:15.419 align:start position:0%
um and and what I did is budgeted in
 
00:22:15.419 --> 00:22:16.130 align:start position:0%
um and and what I did is budgeted in
this

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:16.140 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
in the commissioner's office for
 
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:18.950 align:start position:0%
in the commissioner's office for
distribution

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
00:22:22.010 --> 00:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
as opposed to budgeting in one division
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
or another and frankly the reason we did
 
00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
that was to allow us to make operational
 
00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:28.860 align:start position:0%
decisions about
 
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:32.700 align:start position:0%
um you know what's happening in in uh in
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
the group that manages New Hampshire
 
00:22:36.169 --> 00:22:36.179 align:start position:0%
first what's happening in the in
 
00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:38.460 align:start position:0%
accounting services which is going to be
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
responsible for much of the financial
 
00:22:42.110 --> 00:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
part of the system and where can that
 
00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
money be uh best allocated
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and I think that makes a lot more
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
sense than trying to hire additional
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
people take the people that we have and
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they have capacity to
 
00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
work extra hours work them extra hours
 
00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:57.830 align:start position:0%
work extra hours work them extra hours
um

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
some of the uh our class 30 line for
 
00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.789 align:start position:0%
some of the uh our class 30 line for
equipment

00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
um has
 
00:23:06.409 --> 00:23:06.419 align:start position:0%
um some has a significant increase in
 
00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:09.539 align:start position:0%
fiscal 24. excuse me
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
um for Furniture's fixtures and
 
00:23:12.529 --> 00:23:12.539 align:start position:0%
equipment the kind of things that go
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
along with that with any kind of a
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
renovation and particularly as you as
 
00:23:19.789 --> 00:23:19.799 align:start position:0%
you change your format and you use it as
 
00:23:21.789 --> 00:23:21.799 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to discard old furniture
 
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:24.299 align:start position:0%
if you've wandered through the Annex in
 
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:27.299 align:start position:0%
particular you'll notice that furniture
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
Never Dies
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
but there's some that we think really
 
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
really ought to be retired
 
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:34.430 align:start position:0%
really ought to be retired
um

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
in addition to that the agency has spent
 
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
almost no money in recent years on
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
training it's something that most
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
employees would like it's something that
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
we would like to do I remember two years
 
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
ago I approved sending someone to um to
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
training and someone said okay
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
um where are we going to get the money
 
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
and I said well what do we have in the
 
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:57.480 align:start position:0%
training line on the budget and they
 
00:23:59.390 --> 00:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
said a hundred dollars and it's a twenty
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
six hundred dollar course I'm like okay
 
00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
so maybe we'll do that next year
 
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
and so there's a little bit of that and
 
00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
so what we want wanted to do and again
 
00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
that's centralized for the agency as
 
00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:12.059 align:start position:0%
opposed to for us in addition to that we
 
00:24:15.409 --> 00:24:15.419 align:start position:0%
uh we we plugged 250 000 to fund
 
00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:17.580 align:start position:0%
upgrades for the Statewide budget system
 
00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
the budget system people
 
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:20.940 align:start position:0%
um probably know is a very complicated
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
system is a relatively old system it's
 
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
run by a company called AGS
 
00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:29.700 align:start position:0%
um and it's sometimes called bars you'll
 
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
hear referred to it's it produces the
 
00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
joint document in front of you uh it's
 
00:24:36.049 --> 00:24:36.059 align:start position:0%
something that we we work on with the
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
LBA we have within our budget office one
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
of our business supervisors Steve
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
McLaughlin who's a who's very computer
 
00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.549 align:start position:0%
McLaughlin who's a who's very computer
talented

00:24:43.549 --> 00:24:43.559 align:start position:0%
talented
 
00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:44.149 align:start position:0%
talented
um

00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh had talked a lot about
 
00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:47.870 align:start position:0%
uh had talked a lot about
um

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:47.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
um uh improving the system to to change
 
00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:53.580 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that are manual
 
00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:56.780 align:start position:0%
um and make them uploadable for example
 
00:24:59.890 --> 00:24:59.900 align:start position:0%
and and we think we could do something
 
00:25:03.169 --> 00:25:03.179 align:start position:0%
in that budget range for that system to
 
00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
make the system better rather than
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
having to procure a new budget system I
 
00:25:08.270 --> 00:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
mean at some point we are going to have
 
00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:10.500 align:start position:0%
to procure a new budget system it's just
 
00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:11.820 align:start position:0%
something that happens you can't keep
 
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
putting Band-Aids on the old system as
 
00:25:16.250 --> 00:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
the underlying architecture works with
 
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
changes but it's something we we wanted
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:23.220 align:start position:0%
um and then the other theme that I want
 
00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:24.539 align:start position:0%
to mention to you
 
00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:26.700 align:start position:0%
is that you will see that our class 27
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
doit costs are budgeted by division now
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
instead of in one spot so the doit costs
 
00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:34.980 align:start position:0%
are allocated to agencies through class
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
27. we used to budget them about
 
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
two and a half million dollars in one
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
line in one division one accounting unit
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
in our agency which makes it seem like
 
00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
um fdm it was at the time is the only
 
00:25:51.769 --> 00:25:51.779 align:start position:0%
people who use computers in the entire
 
00:25:53.870 --> 00:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
agency well that's not the that's not
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
the right way to budget it's just what
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
we happened to do for for 20 years so
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
we're trying to budget the right way
 
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.130 align:start position:0%
we're trying to budget the right way
there

00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:26:04.310 --> 00:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
that's the commissioner's office
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
if you look at page nine it's accounting
 
00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.669 align:start position:0%
if you look at page nine it's accounting
services

00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:15.529 --> 00:26:15.539 align:start position:0%
accounting services is the or you might
 
00:26:16.789 --> 00:26:16.799 align:start position:0%
think of them as the office of the
 
00:26:18.649 --> 00:26:18.659 align:start position:0%
Comptroller or occasionally referred to
 
00:26:21.049 --> 00:26:21.059 align:start position:0%
as boa despite the fact that those
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
aren't their initials in um in state
 
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
government often and this is the
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
accounting oversight the the
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
Statewide payroll office is here and the
 
00:26:33.529 --> 00:26:33.539 align:start position:0%
um and they obviously they do the
 
00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:37.140 align:start position:0%
aquifer every year as well and this is a
 
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
this is one of those areas that's a very
 
00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
simple budget
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
um and it's something that we hope no
 
00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
one ever notices
 
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
but if we didn't have it we would have
 
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
to cease operating as a state
 
00:26:51.529 --> 00:26:51.539 align:start position:0%
um but one of those things that you the
 
00:26:53.450 --> 00:26:53.460 align:start position:0%
accounting and they do a particularly
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
good job
 
00:26:57.049 --> 00:26:57.059 align:start position:0%
um nothing much is nothing much is
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
different here uh the one thing we did
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
ask for but didn't receive in in the
 
00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:02.750 align:start position:0%
ask for but didn't receive in in the
budget

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:03.409 align:start position:0%
budget
um

00:27:03.409 --> 00:27:03.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:04.850 --> 00:27:04.860 align:start position:0%
you know with our there's a lot of
 
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:07.020 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements happening and
 
00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:08.460 align:start position:0%
there was some discussion with gopher
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
about whether there would be a reporting
 
00:27:12.289 --> 00:27:12.299 align:start position:0%
position there that we worked with or it
 
00:27:13.669 --> 00:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
would be easier for them to just have
 
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
the reporting position in admin services
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
and the thought was that well it should
 
00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
be in admin Services because after all
 
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
that's that's where we do the single
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
federal audit that's where we do most
 
00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:26.750 align:start position:0%
federal audit that's where we do most
reporting

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:28.700 align:start position:0%
um and so they
 
00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
graciously told us to ask for it in the
 
00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:35.460 align:start position:0%
budget and we were graciously told no
 
00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.930 align:start position:0%
budget and we were graciously told no
so

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh division of personnel is something
 
00:27:42.289 --> 00:27:42.299 align:start position:0%
people have a lot of interest in these
 
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
days particularly when vacancy rates are
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
high or when you're looking for a job
 
00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:47.269 align:start position:0%
high or when you're looking for a job
frankly

00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
frankly
 
00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:48.169 align:start position:0%
frankly
um

00:27:48.169 --> 00:27:48.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
so not to interrupt you commissioner
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
please saying that you would like us I
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
would like to consider that 190 yes I
 
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:56.580 align:start position:0%
would thousand dollars added into the
 
00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
budget I would I think um if we are
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
going to do significant reporting on
 
00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:02.690 align:start position:0%
going to do significant reporting on
um

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do significant
 
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
reporting on arpa and we are going to
 
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
have to for for years to come
 
00:28:10.669 --> 00:28:10.679 align:start position:0%
um we have a we have a class 59 position
 
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
that's currently doing some work on that
 
00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:15.779 align:start position:0%
but will it like like all the class 59
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
our positions will expire on June 30th
 
00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
um which is something we should talk
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
about at some point about it's been
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
added to our list thank you
 
00:28:26.159 --> 00:28:27.649 align:start position:0%
added to our list thank you
thanks

00:28:27.649 --> 00:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
um division of personnel
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
um Statewide hiring and procedures and
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
and this is an area where I know there's
 
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
some interest from in various pieces of
 
00:28:37.250 --> 00:28:37.260 align:start position:0%
the committee about the reform of the
 
00:28:40.490 --> 00:28:40.500 align:start position:0%
classification system that's ongoing
 
00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
um the state's Bureau of Education and
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
Training is run out of this division
 
00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:47.640 align:start position:0%
um the Statewide training
 
00:28:49.850 --> 00:28:49.860 align:start position:0%
um in addition to that over the last
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
couple of years we created a an hrsu we
 
00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:53.820 align:start position:0%
call it
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
there's there's been a lot of discussion
 
00:28:57.049 --> 00:28:57.059 align:start position:0%
for the last
 
00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:00.860 align:start position:0%
15 maybe years about centralizing or
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
decentralizing uh some back office
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
functions but HR being one of them
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
and what we figured out we think we
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
figured out is that that's the wrong
 
00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:13.980 align:start position:0%
question that it should be both
 
00:29:16.250 --> 00:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
centralized and decentralized and if
 
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
you're an agency like um
 
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
well let's say HHS right the biggest
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
agency in the state they've three
 
00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:25.140 align:start position:0%
thousand in some positions and they
 
00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
haven't they have an HR staff of 25 20
 
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
28 28 thank you
 
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:32.940 align:start position:0%
um which is actually bigger than our
 
00:29:36.889 --> 00:29:36.899 align:start position:0%
division of personnel and um
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
probably their employees are getting a
 
00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:40.980 align:start position:0%
commensurate level of service with that
 
00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:43.640 align:start position:0%
but if you're a relatively small agency
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
agencies of fewer than 100 100 employees
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
you either don't have you might have one
 
00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
HR staff you probably don't you probably
 
00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
have somebody who's assigned to do
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
you know this and this and this and one
 
00:30:00.590 --> 00:30:00.600 align:start position:0%
of the this is is HR you probably do a
 
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
great job given your level of training
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
and experience but your level of
 
00:30:06.289 --> 00:30:06.299 align:start position:0%
training and experience is probably
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
slightly less and
 
00:30:09.529 --> 00:30:09.539 align:start position:0%
um and then there are a bunch of
 
00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
agencies that just don't have that so
 
00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:13.140 align:start position:0%
what we did and most of this is done
 
00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
through accept and expend through fiscal
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
right now is we created a support unit
 
00:30:20.409 --> 00:30:20.419 align:start position:0%
to um to create
 
00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
an order of magnitude that makes that
 
00:30:24.769 --> 00:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
work and so they're managed centrally
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
through the division of personnel and I
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
think right now it's something like
 
00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:31.980 align:start position:0%
eight agencies small agencies
 
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
yeah about that it's it's less it's
 
00:30:36.409 --> 00:30:36.419 align:start position:0%
fewer than we hoped it's fewer than we
 
00:30:37.850 --> 00:30:37.860 align:start position:0%
hope but anyway that's something that
 
00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.350 align:start position:0%
hope but anyway that's something that
exists

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
exists
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
um and that's why one other one
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
um well there there is because of the
 
00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
the workload in personnel which you know
 
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
this committee's heard about for 20
 
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.350 align:start position:0%
this committee's heard about for 20
years

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
um there was a position added in in the
 
00:30:50.159 --> 00:30:51.529 align:start position:0%
um there was a position added in in the
budget

00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:51.539 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:52.980 align:start position:0%
um and the thing I want to remind you
 
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
that we talked about was converting the
 
00:30:57.049 --> 00:30:57.059 align:start position:0%
Statewide recruitment unit
 
00:30:59.570 --> 00:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
um is is our big ask here
 
00:31:03.169 --> 00:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
and so in this particular unit
 
00:31:05.450 --> 00:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
um the most significant change the most
 
00:31:07.549 --> 00:31:07.559 align:start position:0%
significant increase is related to the
 
00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:11.340 align:start position:0%
the doit funds being placed in the unit
 
00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
instead of not so representative McGuire
 
00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
as we go through we talked about the 17
 
00:31:18.889 --> 00:31:18.899 align:start position:0%
positions that were added this was the
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
first of the I'll say new positions as
 
00:31:24.289 --> 00:31:24.299 align:start position:0%
we go through this just to give you the
 
00:31:26.930 --> 00:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
um the heads up the preview we'll have
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
three positions that will come up this
 
00:31:31.549 --> 00:31:31.559 align:start position:0%
is the first of the three the remaining
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
positions are the result of conversions
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
things that were in temporary positions
 
00:31:37.250 --> 00:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
that are becoming permanent so it's not
 
00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
that there is a new position added to
 
00:31:40.669 --> 00:31:40.679 align:start position:0%
the budget it looks new in the terms of
 
00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
how the reporting works in the budget
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
document so of the 17 there's three
 
00:31:46.789 --> 00:31:46.799 align:start position:0%
brand new and this is one of those three
 
00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
a bit more
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
correct that is not in anything
 
00:31:51.659 --> 00:31:56.810 align:start position:0%
correct that is not in anything
okay correct

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:59.570 --> 00:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
okay that that's Personnel since there's
 
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
a little break does anybody else have
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
any questions so far
 
00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:07.980 align:start position:0%
I do have since we're on Personnel we've
 
00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
heard it from the governor that he was
 
00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
proposing a 10 across the board pay
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
increase which I guess is in house bill
 
00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:18.059 align:start position:0%
too so none of your numbers include any
 
00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:20.220 align:start position:0%
of the benefit impact of that or the
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
cost of that and I understand from the
 
00:32:25.250 --> 00:32:25.260 align:start position:0%
LBA it's what in the neighborhood of
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
about a hundred million dollars is that
 
00:32:32.690 --> 00:32:32.700 align:start position:0%
I think that's right yeah it's just shy
 
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:34.500 align:start position:0%
it's around maybe 98 million of salary
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
and benefit
 
00:32:38.389 --> 00:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
to account for a 10 and 2 percent then
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
that all of that is in house bill too
 
00:32:42.169 --> 00:32:42.179 align:start position:0%
and is that classified and
 
00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
non-classified or is it everyone's
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
getting that increase when we so
 
00:32:49.669 --> 00:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
typically when we budget an increase as
 
00:32:51.169 --> 00:32:51.179 align:start position:0%
a there's a the reason there's
 
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislation on it is that you you extend
 
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:55.500 align:start position:0%
that to legislative judicial branch
 
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
employees you extend it to unrepresented
 
00:32:59.510 --> 00:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
employees you extended to unclassified
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
employees and and then various assorted
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
things as a as a whole file we have at
 
00:33:07.549 --> 00:33:07.559 align:start position:0%
home so to speak on on this and how we
 
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
do that but yes it's not some people
 
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
don't get a raise and other people don't
 
00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:15.240 align:start position:0%
everybody everybody would so
 
00:33:17.090 --> 00:33:17.100 align:start position:0%
um hopefully we'll see complete House
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 shortly that's what I've heard
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
so but I think that that my
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is that's like literally
 
00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
what it is it's a 10 the the CBA and the
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
unions talked about this as well
 
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
um the CBA that they reached tentative
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
agreement on is uh 10 on July 1st and
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
then two percent on the next July 1st
 
00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:39.059 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire I guess that's a
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
question yeah so so what you're saying
 
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:44.820 align:start position:0%
is if we see a class 10 or a class 11
 
00:33:48.289 --> 00:33:48.299 align:start position:0%
line those don't include those that 12
 
00:33:52.250 --> 00:33:52.260 align:start position:0%
increase is that right so if there is an
 
00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
increase these are all either new
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
positions or step changes
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
um representative the other thing I
 
00:34:13.849 --> 00:34:13.859 align:start position:0%
would point out which is also a theme
 
00:34:16.129 --> 00:34:16.139 align:start position:0%
throughout um it's it's primarily
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
highlighted in the bullets but we
 
00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
haven't talked a lot about it is a lot
 
00:34:23.329 --> 00:34:23.339 align:start position:0%
of the 22 lower costing is really a
 
00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
result of vacancies in a lot of areas
 
00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
and so the 23 to 24
 
00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
budget doesn't look like it's growing as
 
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
much that's normally it's going to be
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
step increases things of that nature 22
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
going into 24 22 to 23 is really a
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
result of vacancies and a lot of our
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
areas are getting better with our
 
00:34:44.629 --> 00:34:44.639 align:start position:0%
vacancies but that's the other driver
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
that you know why does 22 look so low so
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out that some of
 
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
that 10 and 60 line is the result of
 
00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:55.190 align:start position:0%
that 10 and 60 line is the result of
that

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
so are you saying hiring at the end of
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
22 was pretty good is that I think it's
 
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
fair to say hiring is improving and I
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
think that um
 
00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:08.460 align:start position:0%
I mean we could talk for a couple hours
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
on on this whole thing but uh um the the
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
state the state is getting uh is getting
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
more applicants is doing a better job
 
00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
hiring and is bringing more people on
 
00:35:18.770 --> 00:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
board we have a lot of people leaving
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
and it's a it's a it's a churn issue
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
right and I I I'm using my agency as an
 
00:35:26.930 --> 00:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
example if we hire 120 people and we
 
00:35:31.069 --> 00:35:31.079 align:start position:0%
have 118 people leave it looks like
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
all you did over the last year is hire
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
two people it's a lot of work to hire
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
120 people it's a lot a lot of time and
 
00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:40.380 align:start position:0%
I you know and I uh Cassie and I are
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
sharing I do a final interview with all
 
00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:43.260 align:start position:0%
of them too so it's you know think of
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
the number of hours that is which I
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
think is important but I think the
 
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
state's doing a much better job and I
 
00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
think if we were If This Were a year and
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
a half ago we would be
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
forlorn in talking to you we would be a
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
little bit down in the mouth on it I I
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
feel I feel very good Cassie's writing
 
00:36:05.569 --> 00:36:05.579 align:start position:0%
something important
 
00:36:07.190 --> 00:36:07.200 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to point out that it
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
looks like it's good that we're doing
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
okay we're keeping up but um there are
 
00:36:13.069 --> 00:36:13.079 align:start position:0%
certain kinds of positions that are
 
00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
nearly impossible to hire and in our
 
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
department that's Engineers right and
 
00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
that's in our division of Public Works
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
and um and we also administer the
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
Statewide Enterprise computer system and
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's really really hard to hire I.T
 
00:36:29.630 --> 00:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
people and recently we hired two people
 
00:36:32.450 --> 00:36:32.460 align:start position:0%
and they left within a month or six
 
00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780 align:start position:0%
weeks because they had better
 
00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the record they liked
 
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.550 align:start position:0%
opportunities for the record they liked
it

00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
and I didn't leave because of us
 
00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579 align:start position:0%
and they and they and it's just
 
00:36:43.910 --> 00:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
important they made that clear but in in
 
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
fact in both cases they left for jobs
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
that were
 
00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
100 remote which we're not and
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
um and in both cases the one guy said he
 
00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
doubled his money and the other guy said
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
he got a 50 pay raise and I I asked the
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
head of that Division and he said
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
he said I don't know the exact numbers
 
00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
but I think they're right so that's an
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
issue the other at the at the at the
 
00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.030 align:start position:0%
issue the other at the at the at the
other

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
um end of the wage scale we have an
 
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:12.900 align:start position:0%
enormous vacancy rate among building
 
00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:15.420 align:start position:0%
service workers cleaners Etc
 
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
um and it's it's it's hard to
 
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:20.040 align:start position:0%
you know when when Dunkin Donuts pays
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
really well and and you don't have to
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
clean toilets although you probably do a
 
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
little but anyway
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
well so far we've heard nobody that
 
00:37:30.050 --> 00:37:30.060 align:start position:0%
doesn't like you so that guess that
 
00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
could be concerning but thank you we do
 
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
have representative Wilder with a
 
00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:36.050 align:start position:0%
have representative Wilder with a
question

00:37:36.050 --> 00:37:36.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh commissioner I
 
00:37:42.190 --> 00:37:42.200 align:start position:0%
thought I saw a while ago like a 10-year
 
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
listing of total employees in the state
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
and it didn't seem to show much
 
00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:48.530 align:start position:0%
and it didn't seem to show much
variation

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
variation
 
00:37:50.870 --> 00:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
over the 10 years now I don't know how
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
it was put together but it didn't seem
 
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
to reflect this 20 vacancy we're hearing
 
00:37:58.730 --> 00:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
and we also go to the treasurer and say
 
00:38:01.069 --> 00:38:01.079 align:start position:0%
how many paychecks are you issuing and
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
those those numbers come close too so it
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make sense either either
 
00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:07.320 align:start position:0%
we're not either they're listing just
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
the positions
 
00:38:10.730 --> 00:38:10.740 align:start position:0%
or they're listing the people that are
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
getting paid I don't know which well
 
00:38:14.270 --> 00:38:14.280 align:start position:0%
there are there are I've actually done
 
00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
some looking into this myself because I
 
00:38:19.609 --> 00:38:19.619 align:start position:0%
had a very similar question and um
 
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
so you know the good news and the bad
 
00:38:25.550 --> 00:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
news so the good news is that that I
 
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
think you're right that the total number
 
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:29.099 align:start position:0%
of employed classified employees I'm
 
00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
going to use that as a sort of a
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
baseline number because it doesn't
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
there's not a big question about what's
 
00:38:36.470 --> 00:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
included in that or not has not
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
dramatically changed that is number of
 
00:38:40.430 --> 00:38:40.440 align:start position:0%
people employed versus vacancy right
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's why vacancy rate can be
 
00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.890 align:start position:0%
that's why vacancy rate can be
misleading

00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:42.900 align:start position:0%
misleading
 
00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
hasn't changed dramatically Howard has
 
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
changed and you know we were at some
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
point a little over
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm making numbers up I don't have
 
00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
them with me but a little over nine
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
thousand and maybe we dip down to more
 
00:38:58.370 --> 00:38:58.380 align:start position:0%
like more like um 8 500 8400 8300
 
00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
but it's not a question of we used to be
 
00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
at ten thousand and now we're at seven
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
or something like that it's more about
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
moving up and down within a
 
00:39:11.510 --> 00:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
maybe thousand employee range out of ten
 
00:39:13.849 --> 00:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
thousand positions and that's not
 
00:39:13.859 --> 00:39:15.829 align:start position:0%
thousand positions and that's not
dramatic

00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
dramatic
 
00:39:18.410 --> 00:39:18.420 align:start position:0%
depending on where they are right if if
 
00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
I if you told me
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
we have to run our department forever
 
00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:25.339 align:start position:0%
and ever with
 
00:39:25.339 --> 00:39:27.109 align:start position:0%
and ever with
uh

00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:29.329 --> 00:39:29.339 align:start position:0%
ten percent of our positions permanently
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
vacant but the other ninety percent
 
00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:33.660 align:start position:0%
would always be full
 
00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:36.780 align:start position:0%
and I would never lose anybody
 
00:39:38.690 --> 00:39:38.700 align:start position:0%
um I could make that work if I could if
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
I could pick the positions and we could
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
we spent a lot of time on it but what
 
00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
what happens is there's this there's
 
00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
again this churn that goes on and so the
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
state historically has has had a had a
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
10 to 12 vacancy rate maybe if you look
 
00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
at Personnel reports I only went back
 
00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:55.740 align:start position:0%
about 20 years but if you but if you
 
00:39:57.770 --> 00:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
look at them they there's not a huge
 
00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.270 align:start position:0%
look at them they there's not a huge
variation

00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
variation
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
um and it was in that range and it's
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
lately it's gone up but it's also true
 
00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
that the number of authorized positions
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
in the last let's just say five or six
 
00:40:09.770 --> 00:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
years has gone up not dramatically but
 
00:40:12.770 --> 00:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
um of a substantial number and so I
 
00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:14.940 align:start position:0%
would say that yes
 
00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:17.940 align:start position:0%
it's not huge but there's no question
 
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
that we're
 
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
we're in a valley and it's a discernible
 
00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:25.490 align:start position:0%
we're in a valley and it's a discernible
Valley

00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:29.040 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you so is
 
00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
churn save money not just in the sense
 
00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:33.900 align:start position:0%
that somebody leaves and it takes two
 
00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:35.700 align:start position:0%
months to hire somebody to replace them
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
but also in the sense that it's the
 
00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
person retiring or leaving is at a
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
higher step and when the new one comes
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
in to fill this position it starts at
 
00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:47.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
yes sort of I'm gonna
 
00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:52.849 align:start position:0%
yes sort of I'm gonna
um

00:40:52.849 --> 00:40:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
yes I mean there's no question that that
 
00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:56.820 align:start position:0%
it's true that
 
00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
the gap between employees saves the
 
00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:01.020 align:start position:0%
state money there's there's I got two
 
00:41:02.089 --> 00:41:02.099 align:start position:0%
months where you're not paying anybody
 
00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
or three months or six months or pick a
 
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
number that number of months that you're
 
00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
not paying anybody and typically the
 
00:41:09.410 --> 00:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
people who leave and the people who come
 
00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
in it's higher versus lower although in
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
a tight labor market we're not really
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
hiring at that different a salary when
 
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:19.380 align:start position:0%
the new person comes in the only thing
 
00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh the counterbalance to that though is
 
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.609 --> 00:41:28.619 align:start position:0%
the the state's hiring managers do a
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
decent job they they generally do a good
 
00:41:33.730 --> 00:41:33.740 align:start position:0%
job but we don't we don't hire
 
00:41:38.030 --> 00:41:38.040 align:start position:0%
supervisors on the basis of their
 
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:41.220 align:start position:0%
expertise in hiring people and I'm going
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
to use Karen's behind me for a minute
 
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:46.020 align:start position:0%
and you know Karen Karen's hired because
 
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
she's she's an engineer she's a very
 
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
good engineer from Caltech and Etc and I
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't think she um
 
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
I don't think she took a lot of job a
 
00:41:58.490 --> 00:41:58.500 align:start position:0%
lot of courses in hiring when she was
 
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
there and when we evaluated that
 
00:42:03.109 --> 00:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
position and uh this is when we're
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
Cassie and I did do a final interview
 
00:42:08.329 --> 00:42:08.339 align:start position:0%
um and um we didn't ask her
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
um how much training do you have in
 
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
hiring and how much time of your
 
00:42:13.970 --> 00:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
schedule can you devote to hiring and
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
when you when you have too many
 
00:42:16.849 --> 00:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
vacancies you end up spending an
 
00:42:19.550 --> 00:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
inordinate amount of your time
 
00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
um hiring people and dealing with that
 
00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:24.060 align:start position:0%
it's a long process there's a lot of
 
00:42:25.849 --> 00:42:25.859 align:start position:0%
applications that come through if you
 
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
want to do a good job you have to turn
 
00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.220 align:start position:0%
them around really quickly and you have
 
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
to interview a lot of people you should
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
not just interview one people because
 
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:34.740 align:start position:0%
one person because I think we've all had
 
00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
an experience where jeez he looked great
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
in the interview
 
00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
I thought he was I didn't realize he had
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
that that issue with PTSD and or
 
00:42:46.609 --> 00:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
whatever and the
 
00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
um and so that's that's the cost and if
 
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
you have you have your your senior
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
people spending too much of their time
 
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
um just trying to fill positions day in
 
00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
and day out and not doing the
 
00:43:02.329 --> 00:43:02.339 align:start position:0%
it's a value add that theoretically
 
00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:03.900 align:start position:0%
you've hired them for
 
00:43:06.290 --> 00:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
um there's a cost associated with that
 
00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
but there's no question that on the
 
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:10.440 align:start position:0%
balancing side just in terms of spend it
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
does reduce the spend I mean the lapse
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
we've had relatively High lapses in
 
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
recent years
 
00:43:17.809 --> 00:43:17.819 align:start position:0%
um silly high and it's because of
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
employee positions being vacant okay now
 
00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:21.890 align:start position:0%
employee positions being vacant okay now
um

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
let me ask you about this other thing
 
00:43:25.730 --> 00:43:25.740 align:start position:0%
where you said you can't hire for
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
certain positions doit Etc
 
00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:31.500 align:start position:0%
um is that because the the
 
00:43:34.609 --> 00:43:34.619 align:start position:0%
classification system is really got some
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
problems in those areas right certain
 
00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:39.980 align:start position:0%
jobs are misclassified or the the
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
baseline or whatever of those things are
 
00:43:42.359 --> 00:43:44.210 align:start position:0%
baseline or whatever of those things are
wrong

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
I mean we've heard the exact same thing
 
00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:48.140 align:start position:0%
out of Corrections well
 
00:43:50.930 --> 00:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
it's I I think there's a lot to it I
 
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
don't want to say they're classed wrong
 
00:43:54.050 --> 00:43:54.060 align:start position:0%
and we'll let Cassie talk about this too
 
00:43:56.990 --> 00:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.550 --> 00:43:58.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things about a large
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
complicated system like the state is
 
00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
you're doing a you're doing an
 
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
evaluation where you're
 
00:44:04.609 --> 00:44:04.619 align:start position:0%
cross-referencing everybody against
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
everybody else and it's not possible to
 
00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
do that in a way where there are some
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
positions that aren't
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
where you don't capture market trends
 
00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
all the time and that there aren't some
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
positions that are not captured and and
 
00:44:23.329 --> 00:44:23.339 align:start position:0%
the truth is that even where we're
 
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
having trouble hiring people we hire
 
00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:26.579 align:start position:0%
some people
 
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
but you you have to try to hire somebody
 
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
who's thinking and put it this way the
 
00:44:32.510 --> 00:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
attraction one of the attractions to the
 
00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
state is work-life balance it is it is a
 
00:44:37.010 --> 00:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
job where you are literally not allowed
 
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
to work more than 37 and a half hours
 
00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
um it is a it is a job where you get
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
um and for some people they're like I
 
00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:47.099 align:start position:0%
need I'm at a point in my life I want to
 
00:44:49.069 --> 00:44:49.079 align:start position:0%
just like like calm down a little bit
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
work hard but not for 60 hours and then
 
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
and then if I'm honest um our health
 
00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:56.579 align:start position:0%
benefits are really quite an attraction
 
00:44:59.990 --> 00:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
but not to 25 year olds
 
00:45:02.809 --> 00:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I have too much to add
 
00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
to what Charlie said but the current
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
process allows for something called a
 
00:45:10.910 --> 00:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
reallocation of a position so if if a
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
department thinks that they have a class
 
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
of employees that are not properly
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
classified they can say this is what
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
they do we can compare it against what
 
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
the old job description used to be and
 
00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:27.660 align:start position:0%
we review that and we then adjust the
 
00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
position if appropriate and I'm thinking
 
00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
back a couple years ago we did that with
 
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
state troopers they were moved up a
 
00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
labor grade because they had new new
 
00:45:39.230 --> 00:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
computer-related duties in their job
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
that they didn't previously had when the
 
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
job was classified so that kind of tool
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
reallocation is available to something
 
00:45:47.569 --> 00:45:47.579 align:start position:0%
like the Department of Corrections for
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
their Corrections Officers in the in the
 
00:45:52.490 --> 00:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
new system that we're working on we're
 
00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
working on a component that will allow
 
00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
us to go out to Market on positions and
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
compare and it doesn't mean there's
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
going to be an automatic adjustment I
 
00:46:03.650 --> 00:46:03.660 align:start position:0%
mean even private employers go out to
 
00:46:05.809 --> 00:46:05.819 align:start position:0%
Market and say what are we paying nurses
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
doctors whatever and and they make
 
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
decisions about well what do we do about
 
00:46:11.990 --> 00:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
this right do we want to adjust do we
 
00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
not want to adjust in our circumstances
 
00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
we'd probably have to take that that
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
information into account when we go back
 
00:46:21.710 --> 00:46:21.720 align:start position:0%
to the table for collective bargaining
 
00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
and I I would just add to that um
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
related to things we talked about before
 
00:46:28.609 --> 00:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
I think everybody who sits in this chair
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
these chairs is going to some point say
 
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
to you that the the obstacle to my
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
hiring people is money
 
00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
that we we don't compete financially on
 
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
salary we compete very well in benefits
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
um and I'm I'm not not going to say that
 
00:46:44.990 --> 00:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
I it's true that that
 
00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
um you know lately we can't hire anybody
 
00:46:49.609 --> 00:46:49.619 align:start position:0%
except one or step two it's just not
 
00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
possible and it we're out of Market
 
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.230 align:start position:0%
possible and it we're out of Market
um

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
I don't want to over emphasize that
 
00:46:59.210 --> 00:46:59.220 align:start position:0%
though the the state the state's ability
 
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:02.579 align:start position:0%
to compete is always been multifaceted
 
00:47:05.210 --> 00:47:05.220 align:start position:0%
the attraction of a state job there
 
00:47:06.829 --> 00:47:06.839 align:start position:0%
there are a bunch of components one is
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
public service and don't minimize that
 
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
that's very real one is uh benefits
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
right it just benefits the other is that
 
00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:17.640 align:start position:0%
the state as an Enterprise is very
 
00:47:19.550 --> 00:47:19.560 align:start position:0%
unlikely to close
 
00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
it's not true of Fred's construction the
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
state is very unlikely to close that's a
 
00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:24.950 align:start position:0%
state is very unlikely to close that's a
benefit

00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
um it is true that on salaries we have
 
00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
lost significant ground to inflation and
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
historically we've kept up and we lost
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
something like 15 16 to inflation over
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
the last let's just say five years pick
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
a number
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
um and and I so I I say that I think you
 
00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
know a 10 raise for example
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
it's really quite large right it's huge
 
00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
by historical standards on the other
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
hand we still won't have kept up with
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
inflation and so
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
you know if I'm doing a spreadsheet at
 
00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:57.290 align:start position:0%
you know if I'm doing a spreadsheet at
home

00:47:57.290 --> 00:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:48:00.589 --> 00:48:00.599 align:start position:0%
and and I do because I'm a little geeky
 
00:48:00.599 --> 00:48:02.030 align:start position:0%
and and I do because I'm a little geeky
but

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
um I know what CPI is and I know what my
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
salary is and I know whether it's kept
 
00:48:11.150 --> 00:48:11.160 align:start position:0%
up or not and uh it I think that will
 
00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
make a difference in in two ways
 
00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
one is that it is a wage adjustment it
 
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
does make make us a little more
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
competitive the other is that is that
 
00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
there's a psychological effect of it
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
being you know maybe this isn't an exact
 
00:48:27.890 --> 00:48:27.900 align:start position:0%
cost of living adjustment but 10 sounds
 
00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
very real and I think there are there
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
are a number of people who are sitting
 
00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:32.940 align:start position:0%
who are sitting
 
00:48:34.849 --> 00:48:34.859 align:start position:0%
um particularly good people who are
 
00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:36.900 align:start position:0%
competitive people who I really don't
 
00:48:39.349 --> 00:48:39.359 align:start position:0%
want to lose thinking you know what
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
point do I decide I really need to like
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
um take the money and I think this
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
reduces the incentive to take the money
 
00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.390 align:start position:0%
reduces the incentive to take the money
okay

00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:53.220 align:start position:0%
procurement and support services
 
00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
uh page 11 107 to 119 in your in your
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
book at home this is a very uh
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
complicated I've I've uh I don't want to
 
00:49:04.130 --> 00:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
let this meeting go without explaining
 
00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:06.240 align:start position:0%
to you that our department
 
00:49:10.010 --> 00:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
it has lots of little nooks and crannies
 
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
and I say we're like a big English
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
muffin of state government
 
00:49:15.950 --> 00:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sure somebody was afraid I
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say that but I I did
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
um nowhere is that more true than in
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
this division this is purchasing
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
this is where we buy stuff this is
 
00:49:26.809 --> 00:49:26.819 align:start position:0%
Statewide purchasing but it also
 
00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:27.960 align:start position:0%
includes a whole bunch of other little
 
00:49:29.569 --> 00:49:29.579 align:start position:0%
things surplus food distribution which
 
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
is run out of a warehouse on store
 
00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
Street it includes Surplus property the
 
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
state unlike the federal government
 
00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:37.980 align:start position:0%
sells its property when it's done with
 
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
it we also we also grabbed the federal
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
Surplus too because why not
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and we sell it at White Farm some of
 
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
you have been to the surplus auction
 
00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
there some of you have been there lots
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
of knives there lately if you want to go
 
00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:54.180 align:start position:0%
because they get stopped at the airport
 
00:49:56.510 --> 00:49:56.520 align:start position:0%
um we do this is where the merchant card
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
program the state's credit card programs
 
00:50:00.230 --> 00:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
are done out of it's where the P card
 
00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
the state where we use a credit card is
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
done out of it's where Fleet Management
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
is done out of it's where Real Property
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
Management the state has one real estate
 
00:50:09.119 --> 00:50:10.849 align:start position:0%
Management the state has one real estate
lawyer

00:50:10.849 --> 00:50:10.859 align:start position:0%
lawyer
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
um he's a nice guy he may be a little
 
00:50:14.329 --> 00:50:14.339 align:start position:0%
overworked but he's a good guy and he's
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
out of this division too
 
00:50:16.319 --> 00:50:17.870 align:start position:0%
out of this division too
um

00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
anyway that's what this division is it
 
00:50:23.089 --> 00:50:23.099 align:start position:0%
includes in the budget it's also where
 
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
graphic Services is I'm sorry people are
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
aware of that Statewide graphic Services
 
00:50:29.329 --> 00:50:29.339 align:start position:0%
is managed also out of a building on
 
00:50:31.010 --> 00:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
store Street
 
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
um out of this division
 
00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.270 align:start position:0%
um out of this division
um

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
and that's that's where a lot of the
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
other income from comes from the agency
 
00:50:41.569 --> 00:50:41.579 align:start position:0%
income basically we we print stuff for
 
00:50:43.849 --> 00:50:43.859 align:start position:0%
safety safety pays for it and it's it's
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
a centralized function there's one new
 
00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:48.660 align:start position:0%
full-time administrator position here
 
00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:49.800 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
um we have a lot of purchasing agents
 
00:50:53.809 --> 00:50:53.819 align:start position:0%
and it's and it's one basically Gary
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
London said I want I want one more
 
00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
senior manager I need that they do
 
00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:01.140 align:start position:0%
contracts too but they also help the
 
00:51:03.170 --> 00:51:03.180 align:start position:0%
junior managers and and bring them along
 
00:51:06.170 --> 00:51:06.180 align:start position:0%
we have a very good purchasing staff
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
um and they do a good job
 
00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.970 align:start position:0%
um and they do a good job
um

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:09.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:12.650 --> 00:51:12.660 align:start position:0%
uh some of the increases their dit costs
 
00:51:14.329 --> 00:51:14.339 align:start position:0%
are here and the mail the centralized
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
mail unit which used to be in plant and
 
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
property is going to be in the next
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
budget in procurement and support
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
services uh frankly just because it's a
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
support service and the sway the
 
00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
property people aren't
 
00:51:29.210 --> 00:51:29.220 align:start position:0%
we maintain buildings and deliver the
 
00:51:31.069 --> 00:51:31.079 align:start position:0%
mail now they maintain buildings
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
delivering the mail to somebody else so
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
um this is where I want to ask for three
 
00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
new purchasing agents because of the
 
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
increased volume required for governor
 
00:51:42.589 --> 00:51:42.599 align:start position:0%
and Council
 
00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:44.690 align:start position:0%
and Council
so

00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:44.700 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
I will note that purchasing is the
 
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
oldest part of our agency having been
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
established with a purchasing agent in
 
00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:52.370 align:start position:0%
established with a purchasing agent in
1915.

00:51:52.370 --> 00:51:52.380 align:start position:0%
1915.
 
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
president of hedge followed by
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.809 --> 00:52:02.819 align:start position:0%
we um the
 
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
um this year the governor and Council
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
decided that they now want to see
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
commodity contracts instead of just
 
00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
service contracts so there's an enormous
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
amount of volume increase that didn't
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
used to exist
 
00:52:15.829 --> 00:52:15.839 align:start position:0%
um and there I'll just say they're a
 
00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:17.220 align:start position:0%
little I mean they're great people but
 
00:52:21.109 --> 00:52:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:21.119 --> 00:52:23.870 align:start position:0%
 
sir

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:28.250 align:start position:0%
 
ens

00:52:28.250 --> 00:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
no that so so in the past uh commodity
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
contracts because they're typically done
 
00:52:38.870 --> 00:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
by bid right there's so you know how
 
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
much you're going to charge us for road
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
salt didn't go to council because they
 
00:52:44.210 --> 00:52:44.220 align:start position:0%
they didn't necessarily look at them
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
there's a subset of counselors in
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
particular who thought you know I want
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
to see contracts and some who have been
 
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
there a while who have always wanted to
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
see commodity contracts and would like
 
00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:56.579 align:start position:0%
to see any contract I could you know the
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
more the merrier and
 
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
um historically it hadn't been done
 
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:03.540 align:start position:0%
because it seemed like
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
um there would be less debate discussion
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
or need for oversight of that and
 
00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:09.410 align:start position:0%
or need for oversight of that and
um

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:12.109 --> 00:53:12.119 align:start position:0%
it is what it is and I said to the
 
00:53:12.119 --> 00:53:13.609 align:start position:0%
it is what it is and I said to the
council

00:53:13.609 --> 00:53:13.619 align:start position:0%
council
 
00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:15.300 align:start position:0%
will administer whatever you pass
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
because that's what we do but um I do
 
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
know that there are a bunch of agencies
 
00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
who are saying to themselves I don't
 
00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
understand why what are they looking at
 
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
in the in the fuel contract what are
 
00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
they looking at in this but I think the
 
00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
I think the council probably feels the
 
00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:32.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:33.650 --> 00:53:33.660 align:start position:0%
there's a sense of the governor and
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
Council process the more things they see
 
00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
the more
 
00:53:40.190 --> 00:53:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh corruption can be avoided good
 
00:53:43.609 --> 00:53:43.619 align:start position:0%
practices implemented Etc and it I I do
 
00:53:45.049 --> 00:53:45.059 align:start position:0%
believe that the governor and Council
 
00:53:48.349 --> 00:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
process in the state creates a a
 
00:53:50.329 --> 00:53:50.339 align:start position:0%
transparency that doesn't exist in a lot
 
00:53:53.089 --> 00:53:53.099 align:start position:0%
of States on procurement and you know if
 
00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:54.420 align:start position:0%
I were on the council would I want to
 
00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
see commodity contracts I I think maybe
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't but I'm not on the council I
 
00:54:00.829 --> 00:54:00.839 align:start position:0%
didn't run for office and they get to
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
decide but it just it just that there's
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just a lot of work with I'm I'm not
 
00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:13.140 align:start position:0%
kidding so when uh no that's okay uh oh
 
00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
the benefit
 
00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:14.870 align:start position:0%
the benefit
um

00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:16.609 --> 00:54:16.619 align:start position:0%
that's the question I would ask the
 
00:54:20.589 --> 00:54:20.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't mean I don't mean it that
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
way but you know what I mean yeah
 
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
it's okay well on the related issue I
 
00:54:30.230 --> 00:54:30.240 align:start position:0%
mean it's up it's not up to them right
 
00:54:32.930 --> 00:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
it's up to law what they see we could
 
00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
change law so they wouldn't see this
 
00:54:37.849 --> 00:54:37.859 align:start position:0%
right there there's a that's probably a
 
00:54:39.049 --> 00:54:39.059 align:start position:0%
discussion for the Attorney General
 
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an argument about
 
00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.790 align:start position:0%
there's a there's an argument about
um

00:54:43.790 --> 00:54:43.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:45.770 --> 00:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
because the council has required
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
constitutionally to approve all funding
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
I think that it is their General
 
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
position that they may request to see
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:00.230 --> 00:55:00.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just where are my head's going cost
 
00:55:03.049 --> 00:55:03.059 align:start position:0%
benefit and and I think I heard you say
 
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:05.220 align:start position:0%
that there is a
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
considerable additional cost to
 
00:55:09.290 --> 00:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
accommodate this and I'm still not
 
00:55:12.109 --> 00:55:12.119 align:start position:0%
connecting any benefit I I think what
 
00:55:13.730 --> 00:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
the council hopes is that they will see
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
things in contracts that they can
 
00:55:20.290 --> 00:55:20.300 align:start position:0%
um squash or turn or avoid or suspend
 
00:55:24.170 --> 00:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
and uh save us money that way or improve
 
00:55:26.569 --> 00:55:26.579 align:start position:0%
bidding practices
 
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
they're hoping for efficiency and
 
00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:31.010 align:start position:0%
they're hoping for efficiency and
transparency

00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
00:55:34.490 --> 00:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
is I think their points
 
00:55:36.349 --> 00:55:36.359 align:start position:0%
okay thank you whether that comes to
 
00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
pass or not is a separate question can I
 
00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
get to know how much this is costing us
 
00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:45.049 align:start position:0%
get to know how much this is costing us
someday

00:55:45.049 --> 00:55:45.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
so uh talk about the the sort of two
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
million dollar difference between actual
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
and and future and this page
 
00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
um there are a couple of there are a
 
00:55:57.470 --> 00:55:57.480 align:start position:0%
couple of components of that
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
um uh the one is significant vacancy
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
rates the other is that is that we uh is
 
00:56:06.049 --> 00:56:06.059 align:start position:0%
that we carry costs in in graphic
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
services for example which is a
 
00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:10.140 align:start position:0%
self-funded largely self-funded entity
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a general fund
 
00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:13.740 align:start position:0%
component to it
 
00:56:15.589 --> 00:56:15.599 align:start position:0%
um where if we have the business there
 
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
are positions that are on the books that
 
00:56:19.430 --> 00:56:19.440 align:start position:0%
would be filled but if we don't have the
 
00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:22.020 align:start position:0%
business they are they are not filled
 
00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
and and it's why there's the giant
 
00:56:26.390 --> 00:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
discrepancy Giants long term
 
00:56:29.329 --> 00:56:29.339 align:start position:0%
um in other because it's it's uh it's
 
00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
money that we would theoretically be uh
 
00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:34.020 align:start position:0%
billing people for those services and
 
00:56:37.270 --> 00:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:40.380 align:start position:0%
if you will is
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
um is down people are printing less than
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
they than they were
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
and and we uh we don't spend the money
 
00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:50.579 align:start position:0%
if we don't know the business we're not
 
00:56:53.329 --> 00:56:53.339 align:start position:0%
permitted to it is a it is an entity
 
00:56:53.339 --> 00:56:55.069 align:start position:0%
permitted to it is a it is an entity
that

00:56:55.069 --> 00:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh Gary said to me you know we're going
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
to end the year in the black and I said
 
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
well that's good because legally we
 
00:57:03.049 --> 00:57:03.059 align:start position:0%
can't end it in the red
 
00:57:03.059 --> 00:57:04.370 align:start position:0%
can't end it in the red
um

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:04.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:07.790 --> 00:57:07.800 align:start position:0%
in a nice way but it's um uh so there
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
are there are uh there are positions
 
00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:11.220 align:start position:0%
there that are
 
00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:14.460 align:start position:0%
um 100 other funds and that are just not
 
00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:16.260 align:start position:0%
filled and almost certainly will not be
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
filled but suddenly people start
 
00:57:21.589 --> 00:57:21.599 align:start position:0%
printing stuff they would be filled so
 
00:57:23.750 --> 00:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
if we cut down that area it really makes
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
no difference to to anybody right it
 
00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:28.200 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't yes it also it's also
 
00:57:35.990 --> 00:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
um Public Works
 
00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:40.510 align:start position:0%
um Public Works
um

00:57:40.510 --> 00:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:43.730 --> 00:57:43.740 align:start position:0%
uh Public Works we build things uh we
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
oversee building things
 
00:57:45.839 --> 00:57:48.309 align:start position:0%
oversee building things
um

00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:51.710 --> 00:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
vacancies uh create a lower spend here
 
00:57:54.710 --> 00:57:54.720 align:start position:0%
this is a this is another area where
 
00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:56.450 align:start position:0%
this is a this is another area where
um about

00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
um about
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
um about a third of their budget is is
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
billed out so to speak for by project
 
00:58:03.230 --> 00:58:03.240 align:start position:0%
um typically capital budget projects but
 
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:04.740 align:start position:0%
they're Associated other projects
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
generally funded projects are not billed
 
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
out they're funded just funded
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
um we're in the process of developing a
 
00:58:15.049 --> 00:58:15.059 align:start position:0%
new model and and looking at this public
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
works is um because of the difficulty
 
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
hiring engineers and Architects and
 
00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
engineers and architects who are who are
 
00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:24.500 align:start position:0%
project managers as opposed to
 
00:58:27.549 --> 00:58:27.559 align:start position:0%
sort of academic Engineers or Architects
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we we want to
 
00:58:33.049 --> 00:58:33.059 align:start position:0%
experiment with and and we're going to
 
00:58:35.569 --> 00:58:35.579 align:start position:0%
and and I'm nodding my head in an odd
 
00:58:37.849 --> 00:58:37.859 align:start position:0%
way at Karen behind me
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
um and looking on smaller projects we're
 
00:58:41.210 --> 00:58:41.220 align:start position:0%
going to experiment a little bit with
 
00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
how we uh how we manage a project and
 
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
and part of that is is related to is the
 
00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
state a general contractor
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
there's a state not a general contractor
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
the state her is a consultant on the
 
00:58:53.390 --> 00:58:53.400 align:start position:0%
front end of a process as a project
 
00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
manager who's also an engineer or an
 
00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
architect in the middle of the process
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
and then has has clerks who do the who
 
00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
do the oversight on on the back end in
 
00:59:03.829 --> 00:59:03.839 align:start position:0%
addition to that some of that is
 
00:59:05.690 --> 00:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
replicated at agencies what we want to
 
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:08.460 align:start position:0%
do is is find a way that can uh make
 
00:59:10.609 --> 00:59:10.619 align:start position:0%
things happen faster and and alleviate
 
00:59:13.250 --> 00:59:13.260 align:start position:0%
some of the burden on a small staff
 
00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
when the number of projects that must be
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
overseen are going up dramatically in
 
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
large part because of our phones and
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
this is an area where the state has
 
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:24.780 align:start position:0%
historically insisted
 
00:59:28.970 --> 00:59:28.980 align:start position:0%
um going back for decades
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
um of oversight by a central unit it
 
00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
actually oddly goes back to the only one
 
00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
of my predecessors who went to jail went
 
00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:40.020 align:start position:0%
to jail in the 40s or at least I know
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
about when going to jail
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
he went to jail in the 40s
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
um for uh when we had Public Works
 
00:59:47.690 --> 00:59:47.700 align:start position:0%
before it was taken away from us and
 
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
then later given back for mismanagement
 
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
of a construction project where
 
00:59:55.309 --> 00:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
basically he basically well
 
00:59:57.289 --> 00:59:57.299 align:start position:0%
he let the manager do whatever he wanted
 
00:59:59.150 --> 00:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
and then there was so there were some
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
Financial irregularities that might have
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
accrued to the benefit of his own bank
 
01:00:04.319 --> 01:00:05.150 align:start position:0%
accrued to the benefit of his own bank
account

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:07.980 align:start position:0%
and that apparently was frowned upon at
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
the time
 
01:00:09.119 --> 01:00:10.569 align:start position:0%
the time
so

01:00:10.569 --> 01:00:10.579 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
probably is now as well
 
01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:14.390 align:start position:0%
probably is now as well
so

01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:17.569 --> 01:00:17.579 align:start position:0%
that's where we so um because of that
 
01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:20.339 align:start position:0%
we have an enormous vacancy rate here
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I would like you
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
to consider doing and I realize this is
 
01:00:27.349 --> 01:00:27.359 align:start position:0%
another ask is allocating so we we
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
unfunded positions to the tune of 400
 
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
000 a year
 
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:33.180 align:start position:0%
and I would like you to consider
 
01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.730 align:start position:0%
and I would like you to consider
um

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:34.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:37.130 --> 01:00:37.140 align:start position:0%
um giving us some of that as in a
 
01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
consultant line the state hires
 
01:00:41.630 --> 01:00:41.640 align:start position:0%
consultants and the state has staff or
 
01:00:43.549 --> 01:00:43.559 align:start position:0%
lack of Staff right now to do the same
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
things and we'd like to use that as part
 
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
of an experimentation process
 
01:00:52.190 --> 01:00:52.200 align:start position:0%
to find the better way to do things
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
that's Public Works
 
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
I'll also note that they will be the
 
01:00:59.809 --> 01:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.289 --> 01:01:03.299 align:start position:0%
I have a question represent ylr
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
relevant to what we're doing in
 
01:01:07.549 --> 01:01:07.559 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County where we're
 
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
going to put a 63 million dollar office
 
01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:11.460 align:start position:0%
building up
 
01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
and one of the Commissioners says we
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
need to hire a person to oversee it
 
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
and some of the others say no no we got
 
01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:20.700 align:start position:0%
people on staff well we haven't put up a
 
01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:22.859 align:start position:0%
big building in decades
 
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
and well we'll let the the contractor or
 
01:01:28.609 --> 01:01:28.619 align:start position:0%
the oh the architect
 
01:01:30.349 --> 01:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
and and I'm thinking no that's not a
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
good idea it's always a better idea to
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
have someone that's not part of the
 
01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:36.480 align:start position:0%
architect not part of the building
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
business that works for us that does it
 
01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:41.339 align:start position:0%
on a full-time basis and so I'm
 
01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:42.900 align:start position:0%
supporting that Commission of the other
 
01:01:44.089 --> 01:01:44.099 align:start position:0%
two are not
 
01:01:46.609 --> 01:01:46.619 align:start position:0%
convinced but I think I would use the
 
01:01:48.349 --> 01:01:48.359 align:start position:0%
example of the way you do it for the
 
01:01:48.359 --> 01:01:49.309 align:start position:0%
example of the way you do it for the
state

01:01:49.309 --> 01:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
always would have someone
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
that's specifically working for us
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
I I think it's I think it's very
 
01:01:58.250 --> 01:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
important and you know Karen has a team
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
and we you know we do a lot of the
 
01:02:01.370 --> 01:02:01.380 align:start position:0%
construction I'm not a lot of other
 
01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:03.839 align:start position:0%
agencies to do too obviously but we do a
 
01:02:06.650 --> 01:02:06.660 align:start position:0%
lot of construction and um you know
 
01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:07.980 align:start position:0%
there'll be somebody with Public Works
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
who has a very centralized attitude
 
01:02:12.650 --> 01:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
they'll also be
 
01:02:15.530 --> 01:02:15.540 align:start position:0%
um you know one of Karen's staff who is
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
who is you know dedicated depending on
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
the size and scope of the project to
 
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
that project as well from uh from a
 
01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:24.119 align:start position:0%
management oversight standpoint you know
 
01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:25.619 align:start position:0%
you don't want to reach the point where
 
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
somebody says hey where are the garage
 
01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
doors oh we didn't think you nearly
 
01:02:30.049 --> 01:02:30.059 align:start position:0%
needed those
 
01:02:32.569 --> 01:02:32.579 align:start position:0%
and that and it sounds silly but little
 
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
weird things happen all the time in the
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
in in construction where where people
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
make operational decisions based on what
 
01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
they think you want
 
01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
as opposed to how you're going to use
 
01:02:45.049 --> 01:02:45.059 align:start position:0%
your house and it's usually might be a
 
01:02:47.510 --> 01:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
team rather than a person because
 
01:02:49.309 --> 01:02:49.319 align:start position:0%
especially if someone's over here making
 
01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
sure that concrete passes the slump test
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
and someone's over there making sure
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
that the steel beams are put together
 
01:02:58.250 --> 01:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
right and it can't be two places at once
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
while all this poor is going on so
 
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes you got to watch it
 
01:03:04.730 --> 01:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
continuously and inhibit okay so we'll
 
01:03:06.530 --> 01:03:06.540 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about
 
01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
as well about kind of how we how we
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
um so so currently we we have a lot of
 
01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:20.280 align:start position:0%
capital or capital-like projects
 
01:03:21.829 --> 01:03:21.839 align:start position:0%
happening I think
 
01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:23.940 align:start position:0%
probably 40 to 50 right now in my
 
01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:25.190 align:start position:0%
probably 40 to 50 right now in my
division

01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:03:27.289 --> 01:03:27.299 align:start position:0%
um between arpa funded things Capital
 
01:03:29.450 --> 01:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
funded things and and operating fund
 
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
funded things
 
01:03:33.230 --> 01:03:33.240 align:start position:0%
um and a lot of those go through public
 
01:03:36.049 --> 01:03:36.059 align:start position:0%
works as as the commissioner was just
 
01:03:38.329 --> 01:03:38.339 align:start position:0%
talking about but we always have someone
 
01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
on our staff that is very familiar with
 
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
the building so somebody that either
 
01:03:45.109 --> 01:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
operates the building or is responsible
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
for that building in some way that
 
01:03:49.309 --> 01:03:49.319 align:start position:0%
attends all those construction meetings
 
01:03:50.569 --> 01:03:50.579 align:start position:0%
um and it it
 
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:52.760 align:start position:0%
Works hand in hand with the public works
 
01:03:55.730 --> 01:03:55.740 align:start position:0%
assigned project manager to make sure
 
01:03:56.930 --> 01:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
that all those things that we're just
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
talking about happen
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
um and and with arpa happening and with
 
01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
the additional throughput of projects
 
01:04:05.089 --> 01:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
happening within our division we we have
 
01:04:05.099 --> 01:04:05.930 align:start position:0%
happening within our division we we have
some

01:04:05.930 --> 01:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
um a couple of folks that are just
 
01:04:09.470 --> 01:04:09.480 align:start position:0%
dedicated to project management all the
 
01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
time that's all they do
 
01:04:12.410 --> 01:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
um is there anything else specifically
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
you want to talk about okay
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
not that we're offering to help
 
01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
um okay that's Public Works uh
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
Enterprise application management this
 
01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:31.140 align:start position:0%
is a division that used to be called fdm
 
01:04:34.190 --> 01:04:34.200 align:start position:0%
it was called financial data management
 
01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:34.789 align:start position:0%
it was called financial data management
um

01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
and the staff at some point said to me
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
you know that's a stupid name we don't
 
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
just manage financial data we manage the
 
01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:42.900 align:start position:0%
state's entire Enterprise application
 
01:04:45.470 --> 01:04:45.480 align:start position:0%
would you mind if we changed our name
 
01:04:47.329 --> 01:04:47.339 align:start position:0%
and so in the last budget I think we
 
01:04:49.069 --> 01:04:49.079 align:start position:0%
changed their name
 
01:04:51.049 --> 01:04:51.059 align:start position:0%
um and it so New Hampshire first is the
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
state's enterprise system it manages all
 
01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
of our functions it's the structural
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
backbone of state government it manages
 
01:05:00.049 --> 01:05:00.059 align:start position:0%
you know everything HR payroll Etc it's
 
01:05:01.730 --> 01:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
how we pay people it's How We Do
 
01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:04.619 align:start position:0%
finances it's how we do everything
 
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
um that system this is a this is a unit
 
01:05:09.049 --> 01:05:09.059 align:start position:0%
that does this they have had some hiring
 
01:05:11.569 --> 01:05:11.579 align:start position:0%
challenges although they are
 
01:05:13.730 --> 01:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh they do yeoman's work and they've
 
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
done a good job a couple of couple of
 
01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
people left very quickly because they
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
got 100 remote offers a couple people
 
01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:20.870 align:start position:0%
got 100 remote offers a couple people
stayed

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
stayed
 
01:05:22.309 --> 01:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
um which is a good sign
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
um and uh and they're very good people
 
01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:26.569 align:start position:0%
um and uh and they're very good people
um

01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:26.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:28.730 --> 01:05:28.740 align:start position:0%
we're there looks like they went down
 
01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
but that's because the doit budget used
 
01:05:32.990 --> 01:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
to be centralized here and has now been
 
01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
spread across divisions um as it as it
 
01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:36.359 align:start position:0%
ought to be
 
01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
we received a 15 million dollar approval
 
01:05:41.089 --> 01:05:41.099 align:start position:0%
from fiscal for arpa funds and from the
 
01:05:41.099 --> 01:05:42.470 align:start position:0%
from fiscal for arpa funds and from the
council

01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
council
 
01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
to start a major upgrade of New
 
01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:45.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire first
 
01:05:48.289 --> 01:05:48.299 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire first is the state's HR
 
01:05:50.930 --> 01:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
System it's the state's Finance system
 
01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
and it's time to upgrade it and and as
 
01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
you probably know the state has three
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
choices in this we could do nothing
 
01:06:00.049 --> 01:06:00.059 align:start position:0%
um which is which was the old-fashioned
 
01:06:02.089 --> 01:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
tactic of the state which we did 20
 
01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:03.839 align:start position:0%
years ago we didn't at some point we
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
didn't upgrade right time for an upgrade
 
01:06:08.270 --> 01:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
and someone went oh geez let's just not
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
and we didn't and for 20 years we had
 
01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
and then eventually you know at some
 
01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
point the only guy I left who runs the
 
01:06:15.410 --> 01:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
system retires and you have to you have
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
to upgrade so we did a huge upgrade
 
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:19.980 align:start position:0%
actually in two phases of the system
 
01:06:22.069 --> 01:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
so the current system we run is run by
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
infor so we can either so we're not
 
01:06:25.010 --> 01:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
going to do nothing
 
01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
um Dennis Goulet hates it when I say one
 
01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:28.500 align:start position:0%
of our three choices is to do nothing
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
because that's not really a choice I'm
 
01:06:33.049 --> 01:06:33.059 align:start position:0%
like I know but it's a choice we've made
 
01:06:33.059 --> 01:06:34.670 align:start position:0%
like I know but it's a choice we've made
before

01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
um so the two choices are completely
 
01:06:38.510 --> 01:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
re-procure and develop a new system or
 
01:06:40.910 --> 01:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
to do a significant upgrade to the new
 
01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:41.750 align:start position:0%
to do a significant upgrade to the new
system

01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
now is the time for this because it's
 
01:06:45.670 --> 01:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
you know moving from on-premise to cloud
 
01:06:49.549 --> 01:06:49.559 align:start position:0%
and it's a dramatic change in their uh
 
01:06:51.890 --> 01:06:51.900 align:start position:0%
life cycle system instead of they're
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
moving from v11 to Cloud Suite so it's
 
01:06:56.870 --> 01:06:56.880 align:start position:0%
not a number now it's a name it's like
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's like when Windows goes from it's
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
not a 3.1 to 3.2 it's a 3.1 to Windows
 
01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
95 kind of thing I might be dating
 
01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:07.130 align:start position:0%
95 kind of thing I might be dating
myself

01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:07.140 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:07:09.289 --> 01:07:09.299 align:start position:0%
um anyway that's that's a major thing
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
that you'll see coming through in our
 
01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:12.660 align:start position:0%
division over the next
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
um well over the next two years and it's
 
01:07:17.510 --> 01:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
going to be a significant point of pain
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
risk and benefits is our is our next uh
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
division page 122 to 127
 
01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:26.089 align:start position:0%
division page 122 to 127
um

01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
this is half our budget
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
it's interesting it's not that many
 
01:07:31.789 --> 01:07:31.799 align:start position:0%
people but it's half our budget and it's
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
half our budget because this is where
 
01:07:34.849 --> 01:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
retiree health is
 
01:07:34.859 --> 01:07:36.170 align:start position:0%
retiree health is
um

01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:38.329 --> 01:07:38.339 align:start position:0%
it's a very well-run Division and I
 
01:07:40.309 --> 01:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
would say that even if Cassie isn't the
 
01:07:42.950 --> 01:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
one who used to run it but
 
01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:43.789 align:start position:0%
one who used to run it but
um

01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:45.740 align:start position:0%
I think we do a really good job here
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's workers comp it's
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
insurance and it's for in its retiree
 
01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
health I'm oversimplifying a little bit
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
retiree health is the thing the Marquee
 
01:07:56.270 --> 01:07:56.280 align:start position:0%
item I think is the right phrase health
 
01:07:58.730 --> 01:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
benefits yes and uh oh yeah and health
 
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
benefits I'm sorry good Lord
 
01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
um the health benefits plan for the
 
01:08:04.549 --> 01:08:04.559 align:start position:0%
state which which you know is a 300
 
01:08:07.069 --> 01:08:07.079 align:start position:0%
million dollar plan right this is an
 
01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
enormous operation for the state's
 
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
safest how self-insured we don't just
 
01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
hire an insurance company and we do we
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
do a very good job we're routinely
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
talked to by people who think well you
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
guys do that really well well we do we
 
01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:21.900 align:start position:0%
know what our mission is uh and we hit
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
it so you can see in the budget here
 
01:08:25.729 --> 01:08:25.739 align:start position:0%
that retiree Health has the large
 
01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
portion you can also see that
 
01:08:32.689 --> 01:08:32.699 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 actuals 52 fiscal 23 adjusted
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
authorizes 67 in that line and and
 
01:08:38.150 --> 01:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
probably at some point you look at that
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
and go huh
 
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
um did I anticipate something
 
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
um if you flip to the next slide we can
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
talk about this
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
um this is an area where I think it's
 
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
very important for our department that
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
we take a Victory lap and we did before
 
01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:58.189 align:start position:0%
we take a Victory lap and we did before
um

01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna I'm gonna have Cassie talk
 
01:09:01.970 --> 01:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
about retiree Health
 
01:09:01.980 --> 01:09:03.590 align:start position:0%
about retiree Health
um

01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:06.289 --> 01:09:06.299 align:start position:0%
because she has a lot to do with it but
 
01:09:08.809 --> 01:09:08.819 align:start position:0%
the trend line was very bad and we've
 
01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
had some very difficult discussions
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
budgetarily in the past but if you look
 
01:09:14.990 --> 01:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
on that graph at the at the first four
 
01:09:16.729 --> 01:09:16.739 align:start position:0%
or five years there's an upward moving
 
01:09:19.610 --> 01:09:19.620 align:start position:0%
trend line and we changed it and we
 
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:20.940 align:start position:0%
changed it by doing the right things
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
about leveraging federal funds in ways
 
01:09:27.349 --> 01:09:27.359 align:start position:0%
that um created a ridiculously sized
 
01:09:31.070 --> 01:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:35.940 align:start position:0%
start by saying that in 2016 and 2017 um
 
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
some of the committee members were
 
01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
serving at that time and we really had a
 
01:09:42.050 --> 01:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
crisis we had a budgetary crisis where
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
we found ourselves a 10 million dollar
 
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
deficit for retiree health and so we
 
01:09:50.689 --> 01:09:50.699 align:start position:0%
worked over a series of years to change
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
the law about
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
um and contributions that retirees are
 
01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
required to pay toward the cost of
 
01:10:00.709 --> 01:10:00.719 align:start position:0%
retiree health benefits and for the
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
first time ever we implemented a premium
 
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
contribution for Medicare retirees
 
01:10:09.470 --> 01:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
um and we changed other certain elements
 
01:10:11.689 --> 01:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
like co-pays and that kind of thing but
 
01:10:13.550 --> 01:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
we were also looking ahead and
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
strategically considering well what are
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
the bigger things that we might be able
 
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
to do that could achieve some real
 
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
savings and if you look at 2019 through
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
the rest of the um the years there you
 
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
see Medicare Advantage Cost Containment
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
and that's really the big one and by the
 
01:10:30.890 --> 01:10:30.900 align:start position:0%
way when we say the big one we also are
 
01:10:33.850 --> 01:10:33.860 align:start position:0%
worried that it may be our last one okay
 
01:10:37.010 --> 01:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
but what we were able to do was take the
 
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
medication the medical portion of
 
01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:41.709 align:start position:0%
medication the medical portion of
Medicare

01:10:41.709 --> 01:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
Medicare
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
retiree benefits and move from a
 
01:10:48.169 --> 01:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
self-insured plan to a fully insured
 
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
plan and in 2019 we did that with anthem
 
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:55.260 align:start position:0%
and literally what we were identifying
 
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
this as a strategy but we were waiting
 
01:10:59.689 --> 01:10:59.699 align:start position:0%
for the Medicare networks to catch up
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire and the minute
 
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
they did we met with Anthem and we
 
01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
amended our contract and and and fully
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
ensured that that medical piece and what
 
01:11:10.910 --> 01:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
it did was bring in federal funds and
 
01:11:12.830 --> 01:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
that federal funds helped to offset our
 
01:11:14.510 --> 01:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
general funds and that's really the
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
strategy and that's what you see here
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
with the savings so in 1920 we stayed
 
01:11:21.169 --> 01:11:21.179 align:start position:0%
with Anthem and that reflects our
 
01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
contract Amendment and then we went out
 
01:11:24.890 --> 01:11:24.900 align:start position:0%
to bid and
 
01:11:28.370 --> 01:11:28.380 align:start position:0%
um which was uh unusual for us we we
 
01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
separated out the Medicare piece and we
 
01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
changed vendors for the first time in I
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
don't know 15 plus years we moved to
 
01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
Aetna and they actually bid zero dollars
 
01:11:42.709 --> 01:11:42.719 align:start position:0%
for the premium for our Medicare Medical
 
01:11:45.410 --> 01:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
Services we we continue to have
 
01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
self-insured prescription drugs by the
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
way and so why did they bid a million
 
01:11:54.950 --> 01:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
zero dollars and it's because it's it
 
01:11:58.610 --> 01:11:58.620 align:start position:0%
works for us and um it's because they
 
01:12:00.229 --> 01:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
they were betting that the federal
 
01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
subsidies that they got were enough to
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
to meet their needs and and
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
um so it's been actually a very valuable
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
relationship and so we continued to take
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
that Medicare Savings and you could see
 
01:12:15.050 --> 01:12:15.060 align:start position:0%
we did a little better it's it's also
 
01:12:17.330 --> 01:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
really important to say that
 
01:12:20.270 --> 01:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
um in 20 you start having covid and what
 
01:12:22.010 --> 01:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
happened there were changes in how
 
01:12:24.169 --> 01:12:24.179 align:start position:0%
people's behaviors about going to the
 
01:12:27.290 --> 01:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
doctor getting medical procedures Etc in
 
01:12:29.330 --> 01:12:29.340 align:start position:0%
in in health benefit world we call that
 
01:12:31.490 --> 01:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
good experience so we've had good
 
01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
experience but um that experience has
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
jumped this calendar year particularly
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
when you look at 2023
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
um that that's our budgeted amount right
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
so we're waiting for our our final
 
01:12:44.570 --> 01:12:44.580 align:start position:0%
expenditures to come in and we expect it
 
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
to come in what did we say yesterday
 
01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:50.280 align:start position:0%
about 10 maybe 10 10 million ish um uh
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
lower than we budgeted and and but but I
 
01:12:55.729 --> 01:12:55.739 align:start position:0%
I think it's kind of important it goes
 
01:12:57.169 --> 01:12:57.179 align:start position:0%
back to I think we've had our last
 
01:12:59.390 --> 01:12:59.400 align:start position:0%
rabbit coming out of the hat that if you
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
even drop your 23 10 million ish you you
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
can see that upward trending costs and
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
and that's because inflation is hitting
 
01:13:09.169 --> 01:13:09.179 align:start position:0%
health care and in prescription drugs
 
01:13:11.870 --> 01:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
just like everywhere else
 
01:13:13.850 --> 01:13:13.860 align:start position:0%
it's a big thing
 
01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:16.260 align:start position:0%
are the number of retirees also
 
01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:17.510 align:start position:0%
are the number of retirees also
increasing

01:13:17.510 --> 01:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
increasing
 
01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:19.500 align:start position:0%
they they are we have
 
01:13:22.850 --> 01:13:22.860 align:start position:0%
um our 13 500 now so
 
01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
um so and and I think covid did
 
01:13:28.010 --> 01:13:28.020 align:start position:0%
accelerate the the rate of
 
01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:31.260 align:start position:0%
um retirements by state employees
 
01:13:33.950 --> 01:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
um and uh you know for your information
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things that you don't
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily see in this chart but is
 
01:13:42.649 --> 01:13:42.659 align:start position:0%
that the legislature since about 2009
 
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
has been looking at the eligibility for
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
retiree health and um and began to close
 
01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
the door and tighten that up and so that
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
um it used to be that you would have to
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
have only 10 years of State service well
 
01:13:58.070 --> 01:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
now you need to have 20. and um then
 
01:14:01.610 --> 01:14:01.620 align:start position:0%
they um they they I guess I guess other
 
01:14:04.189 --> 01:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
things that we did like increase the
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
premium contribution for the
 
01:14:08.209 --> 01:14:08.219 align:start position:0%
non-medicare we found a lot of spouses
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
left the plan and that was likely
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
because they had other coverage right so
 
01:14:13.970 --> 01:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
we I think we've done everything we can
 
01:14:15.470 --> 01:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
to really tighten up the eligibility
 
01:14:19.130 --> 01:14:19.140 align:start position:0%
I'll note that the under 65 retirees or
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
non-medicare retirees have have declined
 
01:14:24.169 --> 01:14:24.179 align:start position:0%
for a few years we we think it's flat
 
01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
now because we think most of that's been
 
01:14:27.530 --> 01:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
teased out but it's a smaller number
 
01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:30.600 align:start position:0%
it's a more expensive group The over 65
 
01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:33.420 align:start position:0%
retirees continued to tick up and and I
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
think will but um think of it as
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
something like don't hold me to this
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
number but something like three percent
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:46.140 align:start position:0%
yeah and and those those under 65
 
01:14:48.110 --> 01:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
retirees are delaying retirement because
 
01:14:51.410 --> 01:14:51.420 align:start position:0%
people are right and um and the Medicare
 
01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
retirees are about a third the cost of
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
the non-medicare retirees and that's
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
because of the federal funds that come
 
01:14:59.330 --> 01:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
in for Medicare
 
01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:00.410 align:start position:0%
in for Medicare
good

01:15:00.410 --> 01:15:00.420 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:15:02.209 --> 01:15:02.219 align:start position:0%
next Friday we have a number of
 
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
retirement bills coming up that you
 
01:15:06.649 --> 01:15:06.659 align:start position:0%
might want to pay attention to or
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
they made it through the house the last
 
01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
couple of days okay
 
01:15:13.550 --> 01:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
oh great okay we will watch for that
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna
 
01:15:16.610 --> 01:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna finally and I know you're
 
01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
asking is he ever going to shut up um
 
01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
planting property
 
01:15:23.570 --> 01:15:23.580 align:start position:0%
um which in your book is Page 71 to 107.
 
01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of pages
 
01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:27.900 align:start position:0%
before we run back there I did have a
 
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
question since we're on 127. you show
 
01:15:34.149 --> 01:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
like about a 17
 
01:15:37.550 --> 01:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
number increase in employees if you go
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of 127
 
01:15:44.630 --> 01:15:44.640 align:start position:0%
the authorized is the 11
 
01:15:47.649 --> 01:15:47.659 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at perhaps as many as
 
01:15:50.090 --> 01:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
328 have you been assigned like is that
 
01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:52.020 align:start position:0%
part of the not digging back but housing
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
appeals board and other things no it's
 
01:15:55.729 --> 01:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
actually that's not it's not them or
 
01:15:57.649 --> 01:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
anything like that this is all us and
 
01:15:57.659 --> 01:15:58.430 align:start position:0%
anything like that this is all us and
it's

01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
um it's like we've ticked a couple as we
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
went through the presentation three of
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
them are new full-time positions one is
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
a purchasing administrator we talked
 
01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:10.140 align:start position:0%
about one is the HR coordinator a dop
 
01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
and the the other actually we'll talk
 
01:16:13.189 --> 01:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
about in this division is an
 
01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:14.780 align:start position:0%
environmental health and safety person
 
01:16:17.930 --> 01:16:17.940 align:start position:0%
at in plant and property which
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
seems like something we ought to have
 
01:16:23.990 --> 01:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
um the other there are 12 that are
 
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.370 align:start position:0%
um the other there are 12 that are
conversions

01:16:25.370 --> 01:16:25.380 align:start position:0%
conversions
 
01:16:27.770 --> 01:16:27.780 align:start position:0%
and um and there are a couple things one
 
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
is the you know the peak card
 
01:16:31.790 --> 01:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
administrator has been a class 20 has
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
been a class 59 position instead of a
 
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
class 10 position instead of a regular
 
01:16:38.689 --> 01:16:38.699 align:start position:0%
and it's the pcard program is not
 
01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
temporary not like it's going to go away
 
01:16:44.209 --> 01:16:44.219 align:start position:0%
um our our Surplus uh our Surplus people
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
the the guys at uh White Farm you know
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
one is a full-time
 
01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
permanent employee and he has a
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
full-time temporary full-time temporary
 
01:16:54.050 --> 01:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
is a misleading name and say government
 
01:16:55.669 --> 01:16:55.679 align:start position:0%
but you know they've been in the
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
position for a lot of years I'm about to
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
give the one guy a longevity certificate
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
and um next week I think and it and so
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a conversion as well
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
there's a conversion Steve in the mail
 
01:17:08.810 --> 01:17:08.820 align:start position:0%
room is being converted
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
um just to give you an idea I'm like oh
 
01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
Steve isn't and they're like no I'm like
 
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and then one is the Paid Family Leave
 
01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
position started out as a as a extra
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
budgetary thing so it's a 59 and now
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's in the position then in plant and
 
01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
property one of the things that we're
 
01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:28.370 align:start position:0%
property one of the things that we're
doing

01:17:28.370 --> 01:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:17:31.130 --> 01:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
is we're taking we have an enormous
 
01:17:32.689 --> 01:17:32.699 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate among building service
 
01:17:32.699 --> 01:17:33.790 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate among building service
workers

01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
workers
 
01:17:37.370 --> 01:17:37.380 align:start position:0%
52 or something like that
 
01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
um and they're just nearly impossible to
 
01:17:41.270 --> 01:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
fill we've taken a whole bunch of
 
01:17:43.370 --> 01:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
part-time positions and
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
um are converting them to full-time
 
01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
positions we're doing that initially
 
01:17:49.970 --> 01:17:49.980 align:start position:0%
with a class 59 but we've been able to
 
01:17:49.980 --> 01:17:51.229 align:start position:0%
with a class 59 but we've been able to
hire

01:17:51.229 --> 01:17:51.239 align:start position:0%
hire
 
01:17:52.729 --> 01:17:52.739 align:start position:0%
we've been able to hire at a full-time
 
01:17:54.770 --> 01:17:54.780 align:start position:0%
position I mean that's just um that's
 
01:17:55.970 --> 01:17:55.980 align:start position:0%
not really a surprise that's a market
 
01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:57.530 align:start position:0%
not really a surprise that's a market
thing

01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:17:59.750 --> 01:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and so we want to do that with seven
 
01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:01.380 align:start position:0%
of those positions and we're basically
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
going to take what would have been class
 
01:18:06.649 --> 01:18:06.659 align:start position:0%
50 money and so to be fewer people but
 
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
right now there are fewer vacant
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
positions we can't we're having trouble
 
01:18:11.930 --> 01:18:11.940 align:start position:0%
hiring could you just put like a
 
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:13.800 align:start position:0%
one-page sheet together we can do that
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
when somebody asks that question sure
 
01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
I'll do something and it'll probably
 
01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
look something like yeah that'd be
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
perfect yeah just so when the question
 
01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:22.500 align:start position:0%
is asked is someone well you went from 3
 
01:18:25.610 --> 01:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
11 to 328 absolutely so when you convert
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
two part-time
 
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
yeah shoot part-time to full-time you
 
01:18:31.850 --> 01:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
add a lot of benefits right and that's
 
01:18:33.890 --> 01:18:33.900 align:start position:0%
why it's you can hire whereas otherwise
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
you can't yes yes that's exactly why and
 
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
it's and it's there's a lot of cost then
 
01:18:40.130 --> 01:18:40.140 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's two to one I think
 
01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:41.630 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's two to one I think
it's

01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:18:43.490 --> 01:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
that's four to one because of that
 
01:18:45.950 --> 01:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
whatever all right thank you so we're so
 
01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.390 align:start position:0%
whatever all right thank you so we're so
financially

01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
financially
 
01:18:50.090 --> 01:18:50.100 align:start position:0%
we're it's a zero sum for us and because
 
01:18:51.229 --> 01:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:18:53.149 --> 01:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean it's you know the state went
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know State went up and down on on on
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
part-time cleaners and full-time people
 
01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
won't remember but the 80s and the 90s
 
01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
and we experimented five different ways
 
01:19:03.830 --> 01:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
and was Contracting out and that's not
 
01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
the contractors can hire anybody either
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
um but um
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh and we're in a point right now where
 
01:19:12.229 --> 01:19:12.239 align:start position:0%
where part-time doesn't work if it does
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's a lot cheaper but it we can't
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
get them
 
01:19:19.070 --> 01:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:20.820 align:start position:0%
it's just I want to re-emphasize what
 
01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:22.140 align:start position:0%
what the commissioner had said is that
 
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
when we did the conversion from the part
 
01:19:26.510 --> 01:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
time to the full time we got rid of that
 
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
part-time budget so we made sure that
 
01:19:30.169 --> 01:19:30.179 align:start position:0%
was a budget neutral we didn't add any
 
01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
any dollars even though the position
 
01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
count grew for those
 
01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:36.420 align:start position:0%
thank you that's helpful
 
01:19:36.420 --> 01:19:38.030 align:start position:0%
thank you that's helpful
um

01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:41.330 --> 01:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
so most of what is in this slide I said
 
01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
but just important we manage a lot of
 
01:19:44.870 --> 01:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
buildings there are more than 90
 
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
buildings across the state including all
 
01:19:48.649 --> 01:19:48.659 align:start position:0%
the courthouses
 
01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
um more than four million square feet of
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
Office Space
 
01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
and and I like to say the inside the
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
outside and the underneath
 
01:19:57.890 --> 01:19:57.900 align:start position:0%
of those office spaces some of the
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
release buildings we have a
 
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
responsibility there the underneath
 
01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
matters because that's where all the all
 
01:20:05.209 --> 01:20:05.219 align:start position:0%
this stuff happens and
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
um and there's a lot there's a lot that
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
goes on there we also do Statewide
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
Energy Management as people probably
 
01:20:09.960 --> 01:20:11.209 align:start position:0%
Energy Management as people probably
know

01:20:11.209 --> 01:20:11.219 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
um but it's a lot of work it's a lot of
 
01:20:14.450 --> 01:20:14.460 align:start position:0%
buildings and in some basic way it's it
 
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
it is what touches everybody every day
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
every state employee
 
01:20:21.590 --> 01:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
um goes to work somewhere and they and
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
they you know here and that window
 
01:20:26.570 --> 01:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
breaks one of Karen's people's coming
 
01:20:28.850 --> 01:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
over to take care of it uh the new
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
safety administrator environmental
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
health and safety officer position
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
um that's created instead of uh catches
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
catch can I think it's important we have
 
01:20:41.330 --> 01:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
a lot of people doing a lot of work on
 
01:20:44.209 --> 01:20:44.219 align:start position:0%
Old equipment and buildings we have a
 
01:20:45.770 --> 01:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
responsibility to
 
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:49.140 align:start position:0%
them and ourselves to be safe
 
01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:50.810 align:start position:0%
them and ourselves to be safe
um

01:20:50.810 --> 01:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:54.590 --> 01:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
Granite Place presuming we buy it and
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
frankly even if we don't even even if
 
01:20:59.450 --> 01:20:59.460 align:start position:0%
it's leased and then Hall Street there
 
01:21:02.689 --> 01:21:02.699 align:start position:0%
are positions in here for if we buy that
 
01:21:04.250 --> 01:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
building there has to be a maintenance
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
person as well we own a building there
 
01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:08.040 align:start position:0%
has to be a maintenance person I
 
01:21:09.890 --> 01:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
remember I said to the governor's office
 
01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:11.219 align:start position:0%
at one point the governor's budget
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
director said what do you want that
 
01:21:14.149 --> 01:21:14.159 align:start position:0%
position for and I said well if you buy
 
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
Hall Street
 
01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
we need we need a maintenance guy if you
 
01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
don't buy Hull Street we don't need a
 
01:21:20.330 --> 01:21:20.340 align:start position:0%
maintenance guy and he went oh I get
 
01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:21.110 align:start position:0%
maintenance guy and he went oh I get
that

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:24.470 --> 01:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
so that's that's kind of where that is
 
01:21:25.970 --> 01:21:25.980 align:start position:0%
um I'll talk a little bit about
 
01:21:27.950 --> 01:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
utilities and deferred maintenance
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
um because I think there's something
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
people want to talk about and then
 
01:21:33.530 --> 01:21:33.540 align:start position:0%
there's money in fiscal 25 for what we
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
refer to sometimes as the Manchester
 
01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.590 align:start position:0%
refer to sometimes as the Manchester
property

01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:39.719 align:start position:0%
because I think once the facility moves
 
01:21:42.050 --> 01:21:42.060 align:start position:0%
it's not the synonym Center anymore I
 
01:21:42.950 --> 01:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
don't know what I'm supposed to call
 
01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:46.340 align:start position:0%
that thing anymore right but that thing
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
the what used to be YDC
 
01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
and if it moves out the property will
 
01:21:54.229 --> 01:21:54.239 align:start position:0%
still be there and and most of the bills
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
end up transferring the maintenance of
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
that property which is currently with
 
01:22:00.350 --> 01:22:00.360 align:start position:0%
that staff to us so there's money to
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
make sure everything doesn't burn down
 
01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
and turn into well frankly Laconia
 
01:22:08.450 --> 01:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
um if you know what I mean
 
01:22:11.810 --> 01:22:11.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman commissioner when
 
01:22:14.149 --> 01:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
we were discussing
 
01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
building the
 
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
parking garage over here
 
01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
the architect that seemed to be
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
listening more to Concord than to us
 
01:22:24.890 --> 01:22:24.900 align:start position:0%
said well we've got to have 20 percent
 
01:22:27.950 --> 01:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
more space for the Attorney General when
 
01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:29.640 align:start position:0%
we're moving him from that building to
 
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
this new building is he getting 20
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
percent more whoever it is getting more
 
01:22:35.090 --> 01:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
20 percent
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
more space
 
01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
I don't know it depends how you count
 
01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
does it Karen not 20 it is it is more
 
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
space because of the functionality
 
01:22:47.689 --> 01:22:47.699 align:start position:0%
issues with you know their basement and
 
01:22:52.610 --> 01:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
um they currently have 50 something
 
01:22:56.570 --> 01:22:56.580 align:start position:0%
thousand square feet and I think they're
 
01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
going to be at about 61 000 square feet
 
01:23:01.250 --> 01:23:01.260 align:start position:0%
so it's a little more space it's not
 
01:23:03.790 --> 01:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
dramatically better than they have today
 
01:23:06.290 --> 01:23:06.300 align:start position:0%
it's ten percent basically the Attorney
 
01:23:07.490 --> 01:23:07.500 align:start position:0%
General said to me I don't want to go
 
01:23:08.930 --> 01:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
backwards he said I don't want to be the
 
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
attorney general who moved us out of
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
downtown into into space that isn't
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
downtown and is worse and I suppose not
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
I said it's not going to be worse and
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
there's some ways it's going to be
 
01:23:20.450 --> 01:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
better they have some offices today
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
where the walls aren't real walls
 
01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:23.090 align:start position:0%
where the walls aren't real walls
they're

01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
you know the partitions that form
 
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
cubicles and you just send them to the
 
01:23:29.149 --> 01:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
ceiling and we call it a wall they're
 
01:23:30.890 --> 01:23:30.900 align:start position:0%
that and the new walls aren't going to
 
01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
be like that so thank you it's better
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
um so I'm going to talk uh I'm gonna
 
01:23:42.649 --> 01:23:42.659 align:start position:0%
explain the big change we made here uh
 
01:23:45.530 --> 01:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
on on two in two slides before that I
 
01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:47.699 align:start position:0%
want to talk about utilities because uh
 
01:23:49.130 --> 01:23:49.140 align:start position:0%
those of you on fiscal are going to see
 
01:23:50.810 --> 01:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
you are going to see a request we're
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
coming back for um
 
01:23:54.890 --> 01:23:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh you know there's a provision in every
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
budget that if the money isn't
 
01:23:58.010 --> 01:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
sufficient to pay utilities because
 
01:23:59.330 --> 01:23:59.340 align:start position:0%
something happened let's just say with
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
electric rates
 
01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
um that we would come back to fiscal
 
01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
you're probably going to see an item you
 
01:24:05.990 --> 01:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
saw one last year for just under a
 
01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
million this is going to be over a
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
million something like one five and it's
 
01:24:12.050 --> 01:24:12.060 align:start position:0%
because when we set rates um
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
the last few years have been very unkind
 
01:24:15.649 --> 01:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
to electric rates
 
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
and those paying them and so we're
 
01:24:20.209 --> 01:24:20.219 align:start position:0%
coming back with that the state the
 
01:24:22.250 --> 01:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
state pays something like 11 million
 
01:24:25.090 --> 01:24:25.100 align:start position:0%
dollars a year in electric in utilities
 
01:24:27.890 --> 01:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
and and we're going to be about 10 short
 
01:24:29.990 --> 01:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:24:32.209 --> 01:24:32.219 align:start position:0%
and I can explain to you why if I can
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
bring my Unitil bill in and show it to
 
01:24:35.689 --> 01:24:35.699 align:start position:0%
you and I think you can probably explain
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.250 align:start position:0%
 
not

01:24:40.250 --> 01:24:40.260 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:40.910 align:start position:0%
not
um

01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:42.830 --> 01:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
not great right this is what I'm
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
thinking to myself I need to I need to
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
invest in a wagon wheel or something
 
01:24:49.729 --> 01:24:49.739 align:start position:0%
um deferred maintenance one of the big
 
01:24:51.890 --> 01:24:51.900 align:start position:0%
changes you made a few years ago is
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
creating a maintenance fund for us and
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's a 75 cent a square foot charge
 
01:24:59.390 --> 01:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
on on uh on the the rent like charges
 
01:25:01.850 --> 01:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
that we charge other agencies
 
01:25:04.010 --> 01:25:04.020 align:start position:0%
um to create an essentialized fund to do
 
01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance that's not capital budget
 
01:25:08.209 --> 01:25:08.219 align:start position:0%
and that isn't your you know regular
 
01:25:11.330 --> 01:25:11.340 align:start position:0%
operating you know elevator maintenance
 
01:25:13.070 --> 01:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
contract for extinguisher contract and
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
whatever you have left over but is roofs
 
01:25:18.290 --> 01:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
and Carpeting and um you know equipment
 
01:25:20.830 --> 01:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
needs when they come up but doing the
 
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
across the system doing the work that
 
01:25:25.790 --> 01:25:25.800 align:start position:0%
needs to be done as opposed to the work
 
01:25:28.010 --> 01:25:28.020 align:start position:0%
that there happens to be money for
 
01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
I mean in truth if you think about the
 
01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
building dra is in versus the building
 
01:25:35.689 --> 01:25:35.699 align:start position:0%
that education is currently moved out of
 
01:25:37.729 --> 01:25:37.739 align:start position:0%
the one is really nice and has fewer
 
01:25:39.709 --> 01:25:39.719 align:start position:0%
maintenance needs the others dump it has
 
01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
a lot of Maintenance needs and there's a
 
01:25:43.550 --> 01:25:43.560 align:start position:0%
point at which it's not completely fair
 
01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:44.450 align:start position:0%
point at which it's not completely fair
to

01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
let the one group off scot-free that's
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
deferred maintenance and that's where I
 
01:25:51.050 --> 01:25:51.060 align:start position:0%
would put if you gave us a 3.6 million
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
dollars and then I'll be fast on Central
 
01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
facilities Bureau representative hatch
 
01:25:57.410 --> 01:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
as a question oh sure on that
 
01:25:58.850 --> 01:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
maintenance fund and like I think you
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
just answered my question is that
 
01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:03.300 align:start position:0%
sufficient that 75 or is that
 
01:26:06.290 --> 01:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
never sufficient I mean the truth is
 
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
this the state has you know what I mean
 
01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
the state has 500 million to a billion
 
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
dollars in deferred maintenance needs
 
01:26:13.129 --> 01:26:13.139 align:start position:0%
and we don't we don't track accurately
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
because there's no point right and um
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
because you're going to do a million or
 
01:26:18.890 --> 01:26:18.900 align:start position:0%
two million a year you have to make sure
 
01:26:21.649 --> 01:26:21.659 align:start position:0%
you get the get the big stuff and you
 
01:26:23.629 --> 01:26:23.639 align:start position:0%
know if you if you give me 100 million
 
01:26:24.830 --> 01:26:24.840 align:start position:0%
dollars I could figure out how to spend
 
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
it I don't think we have the staff but
 
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
um we could figure out how to spend it
 
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
so it I think it's I think it's a good
 
01:26:32.270 --> 01:26:32.280 align:start position:0%
number I think it's a good number for
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
for its purpose I'm just thinking in
 
01:26:37.370 --> 01:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
terms of critical need no and it it I
 
01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:39.960 align:start position:0%
think on an ongoing basis um that's a
 
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:42.780 align:start position:0%
good number to use I think that if you
 
01:26:44.629 --> 01:26:44.639 align:start position:0%
have one-time expenditures you're you
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
could make I would put a one-time
 
01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
infusion of um I think we asked for 3.6
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
into that fund and and I think it's good
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
and I think it's actually a good place
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
for things like that to happen so your
 
01:27:00.169 --> 01:27:00.179 align:start position:0%
slide shows 2.6 but yeah well then I'll
 
01:27:03.530 --> 01:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:07.430 --> 01:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry uh fiscal 24 2.6 and then
 
01:27:09.950 --> 01:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
an additional 1 million in fiscal 25 for
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
a total of three six
 
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
um but that can be scalable and it can
 
01:27:16.610 --> 01:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
also depend on what year to put it in so
 
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry I didn't read all the way
 
01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:19.370 align:start position:0%
okay I'm sorry I didn't read all the way
across

01:27:19.370 --> 01:27:19.380 align:start position:0%
across
 
01:27:20.930 --> 01:27:20.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:26.570 --> 01:27:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
um so we created a central facilities
 
01:27:31.129 --> 01:27:31.139 align:start position:0%
Bureau why we budget most of this
 
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
division by accounting unit by building
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that most of the
 
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
accounting units are building some of
 
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
them are multiple buildings some of them
 
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
are all building and there a lot of
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
costs are done on the basis of a
 
01:27:45.169 --> 01:27:45.179 align:start position:0%
building right there's a utility bill
 
01:27:46.970 --> 01:27:46.980 align:start position:0%
most of our utility bills are for one
 
01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:48.530 align:start position:0%
most of our utility bills are for one
building

01:27:48.530 --> 01:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
um or are easily separated out by a
 
01:27:53.450 --> 01:27:53.460 align:start position:0%
building and and and the work is done by
 
01:27:55.550 --> 01:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
a building but a lot of the staff costs
 
01:27:57.050 --> 01:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
and some other costs don't really
 
01:27:59.689 --> 01:27:59.699 align:start position:0%
function that way and never have and so
 
01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
what we used to do is a sort of odd
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
approach and I used to say this I'm
 
01:28:04.370 --> 01:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
going to use the names of people who've
 
01:28:06.830 --> 01:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
all retired because it's easier
 
01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:07.550 align:start position:0%
all retired because it's easier
um

01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:09.709 --> 01:28:09.719 align:start position:0%
Ron White was the highest paid person in
 
01:28:11.270 --> 01:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of General services so we
 
01:28:13.490 --> 01:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
budgeted him in 29.50 which is the
 
01:28:15.850 --> 01:28:15.860 align:start position:0%
largest accounting unit because
 
01:28:18.530 --> 01:28:18.540 align:start position:0%
salary biggest accounting unit
 
01:28:20.450 --> 01:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
second biggest salary we budgeted that
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
guy in the second biggest accounting
 
01:28:23.209 --> 01:28:23.219 align:start position:0%
unit which happened to be 29 Hayes and
 
01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
drive because you know that kind of
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
works and you and we would do that and
 
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
so there'd be a building where it looks
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
like they have no maintenance staff
 
01:28:32.209 --> 01:28:32.219 align:start position:0%
was because the guy sits in the building
 
01:28:34.550 --> 01:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
next door and so the one building pays
 
01:28:35.810 --> 01:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
all the costs and the other pays none of
 
01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
the costs of that guy and it looks like
 
01:28:39.530 --> 01:28:39.540 align:start position:0%
nobody does anything there
 
01:28:41.090 --> 01:28:41.100 align:start position:0%
it's a rough
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
vague easily administered tool that was
 
01:28:44.159 --> 01:28:45.110 align:start position:0%
vague easily administered tool that was
okay

01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:28:46.729 --> 01:28:46.739 align:start position:0%
but it's not accurate and it's not right
 
01:28:49.129 --> 01:28:49.139 align:start position:0%
and it and it does not reflect how we
 
01:28:52.010 --> 01:28:52.020 align:start position:0%
actually do costs so uh so Karen and
 
01:28:54.010 --> 01:28:54.020 align:start position:0%
herself spent a great deal of time
 
01:28:56.390 --> 01:28:56.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately for them trying to figure
 
01:28:58.250 --> 01:28:58.260 align:start position:0%
out this and they created a central
 
01:29:00.229 --> 01:29:00.239 align:start position:0%
facilities Bureau which is where the
 
01:29:01.850 --> 01:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
centralized charges some charges are
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
easily centralized some are easily
 
01:29:06.290 --> 01:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
allocated to a building utility bill is
 
01:29:08.990 --> 01:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
the best example and as opposed to an
 
01:29:10.990 --> 01:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
electrician who works in 25 buildings
 
01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
and his cost should be amortized over
 
01:29:16.430 --> 01:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
that so we created that unit and uh and
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
the cost will be will be allocated that
 
01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:20.699 align:start position:0%
way as a central expense it makes it
 
01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
look like this division's budget went up
 
01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
eight million dollars but it didn't
 
01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
the chart on page
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
20 whatever page has a chart kind of
 
01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
explains how this works
 
01:29:35.629 --> 01:29:35.639 align:start position:0%
and that
 
01:29:35.639 --> 01:29:37.070 align:start position:0%
and that
um

01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:39.290 --> 01:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
I use a couple of a couple of examples
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
we use labor and revenue just because
 
01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
they happen to be two agencies that are
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
in their own building
 
01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know if there's a there's an
 
01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
accounting unit for Spalding
 
01:29:51.890 --> 01:29:51.900 align:start position:0%
and the what happens is we take the
 
01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
actual expenses for Spalding and we Bill
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
labor for them they then pay Das as a
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
line in their budget for Tran I think
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
it's actually listed as transfers to
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
General Services we might have changed
 
01:30:04.129 --> 01:30:04.139 align:start position:0%
the name of that
 
01:30:05.810 --> 01:30:05.820 align:start position:0%
under the new model what will happen
 
01:30:08.510 --> 01:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
though is that that accounting unit will
 
01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:10.310 align:start position:0%
though is that that accounting unit will
also

01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh there'll be a similar transfer
 
01:30:14.450 --> 01:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
between the central facilities Bureau
 
01:30:16.490 --> 01:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
and that accounting unit so that then
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
those Central facility costs are also
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
allocated to that accounting unit and is
 
01:30:22.070 --> 01:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
then billed to in this case the
 
01:30:24.290 --> 01:30:24.300 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and that's how this
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
will work it
 
01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:28.500 align:start position:0%
it I know it might seem a little bit
 
01:30:33.229 --> 01:30:33.239 align:start position:0%
complicated but it's good accounting
 
01:30:40.550 --> 01:30:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:44.699 --> 01:30:51.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:30:51.709 --> 01:30:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:55.430 --> 01:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
on page 75 and 76
 
01:30:58.310 --> 01:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
of your handout so um your actual budget
 
01:31:00.890 --> 01:31:00.900 align:start position:0%
book 75 and 76.
 
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
you'll see the central facilities
 
01:31:06.050 --> 01:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
account which happens to be 15.89 so
 
01:31:07.790 --> 01:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
once again that's on the takes up most
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
of 75 and a little bit on 76.
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
and so what you'll see there is that
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
you'll see all of those shared costs of
 
01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
about 8 million each year most of that
 
01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:20.940 align:start position:0%
being personnel and so as as the
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner had stated those costs are
 
01:31:24.110 --> 01:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
for a lot of the workers that are shared
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
amongst all the buildings they'll get
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
allocated based on the work that they do
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
and get billed to those appropriate
 
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
entities the next what you'll see at the
 
01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:34.860 align:start position:0%
very bottom of that page is it says
 
01:31:37.850 --> 01:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
intra agency transfers of 8 million and
 
01:31:39.350 --> 01:31:39.360 align:start position:0%
then the the grand total on the next
 
01:31:42.470 --> 01:31:42.480 align:start position:0%
page will show net funds zero so once
 
01:31:43.850 --> 01:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
again while it looks like total
 
01:31:45.470 --> 01:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
Appropriations have gone up 8 million
 
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
for the Department there's also an exact
 
01:31:49.430 --> 01:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
dollar for dollar Revenue that's coming
 
01:31:50.930 --> 01:31:50.940 align:start position:0%
in from those agencies that we're going
 
01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
to be billing so I just want to point
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
that out because you know you
 
01:31:56.390 --> 01:31:56.400 align:start position:0%
you tend to focus on that sort of spend
 
01:31:58.490 --> 01:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
line and this is one where it's a net
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
zero transaction
 
01:32:03.169 --> 01:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
um when you look at it in total
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
you think about your budget there are
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
two two areas in the budget where where
 
01:32:08.930 --> 01:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
there's sort of quasi-double billing
 
01:32:11.149 --> 01:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
doit costs which are allocated every
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
agency and we pay the oit so it shows up
 
01:32:15.050 --> 01:32:15.060 align:start position:0%
twice and frankly our plant and property
 
01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
expenses and this is a sort of a sub
 
01:32:20.090 --> 01:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
double billing whatever that works out
 
01:32:24.590 --> 01:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
here so if my quick arithmetic is still
 
01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
any good
 
01:32:30.649 --> 01:32:30.659 align:start position:0%
is about a six million dollar new ask
 
01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
over what the governor had supported I
 
01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
think we've got
 
01:32:37.370 --> 01:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
the three new positions and purchasing
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
and deferred maintenance that's arpa
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
contract Service I'm sure your math is
 
01:32:45.350 --> 01:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
right oh I I don't know maybe it sounds
 
01:32:47.330 --> 01:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
too good then maybe I should check it a
 
01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:49.430 align:start position:0%
too good then maybe I should check it a
little further

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
little further
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
so we have that Mr Hoffman those items
 
01:32:55.729 --> 01:32:55.739 align:start position:0%
and that one sheet of paper showing the
 
01:32:58.790 --> 01:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
why it's going from 3 11 to 328 or
 
01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:01.370 align:start position:0%
why it's going from 3 11 to 328 or
whatever

01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
okay good
 
01:33:05.030 --> 01:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
I must see it in the right private
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
school or something
 
01:33:09.770 --> 01:33:09.780 align:start position:0%
Mr Hoffman used to work for das so his
 
01:33:12.110 --> 01:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
math must be correct well we steal all
 
01:33:14.450 --> 01:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
the good people we can right we we try
 
01:33:16.129 --> 01:33:16.139 align:start position:0%
to steal them back we we still Sherry
 
01:33:17.450 --> 01:33:17.460 align:start position:0%
from the LBA
 
01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:18.709 align:start position:0%
from the LBA
tonight

01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
tonight
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
so I did have some questions but you
 
01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
also have under your jurisdiction the
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
child advocate advocate for special
 
01:33:29.930 --> 01:33:29.940 align:start position:0%
education in housing appeal board so
 
01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
they're they're they're here separately
 
01:33:34.189 --> 01:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
I'll go away and you can talk to them I
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
was just curious why they were assigned
 
01:33:38.450 --> 01:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
to das especially like when you look at
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
child advocate maybe advocate for
 
01:33:42.530 --> 01:33:42.540 align:start position:0%
special education I've been asked by
 
01:33:44.570 --> 01:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
other division members oh I can explain
 
01:33:46.669 --> 01:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
that entirely
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
um my this is my sense when the
 
01:33:51.169 --> 01:33:51.179 align:start position:0%
legislature passes a bill
 
01:33:54.050 --> 01:33:54.060 align:start position:0%
and something happens in it and there's
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
a loose end and they don't know what to
 
01:33:56.570 --> 01:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
do with it
 
01:34:02.330 --> 01:34:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:04.610 --> 01:34:04.620 align:start position:0%
somebody somebody said to me once about
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh actually one or two of the the
 
01:34:10.490 --> 01:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
um independent agencies
 
01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:11.689 align:start position:0%
um independent agencies
um

01:34:11.689 --> 01:34:11.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:13.729 --> 01:34:13.739 align:start position:0%
they said doesn't everybody just get
 
01:34:15.470 --> 01:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
assigned to you
 
01:34:17.149 --> 01:34:17.159 align:start position:0%
and I said well
 
01:34:20.510 --> 01:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
yes but they don't have to
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
but I think uh I think we're used to it
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
now although my understanding is they
 
01:34:30.470 --> 01:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
have no staff so they're probably easier
 
01:34:32.270 --> 01:34:32.280 align:start position:0%
and I could go to a boxing match not
 
01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
that I enjoy boxing but well thanks
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
Charlie I don't see a need for you to
 
01:34:38.689 --> 01:34:38.699 align:start position:0%
come back but thank you you know
 
01:34:40.250 --> 01:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
um anytime we're right across the road
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
and I can come back you can come over
 
01:34:44.750 --> 01:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
you can talk to a sub subset of us if
 
01:34:47.030 --> 01:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
you'd like we're happy to help we'll try
 
01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:49.260 align:start position:0%
to fit that six million dollar in but
 
01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
again we don't really know yet so but
 
01:34:53.570 --> 01:34:53.580 align:start position:0%
we'll try you know my somebody said to
 
01:34:55.010 --> 01:34:55.020 align:start position:0%
me before the meeting we don't know how
 
01:34:57.530 --> 01:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
much money we have to spend I forget who
 
01:35:01.790 --> 01:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
next Wednesday
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
in theory thank you very much all right
 
01:35:05.639 --> 01:35:06.830 align:start position:0%
in theory thank you very much all right
thanks

01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
so someone from the child advocate
 
01:35:10.080 --> 01:35:16.550 align:start position:0%
so someone from the child advocate
thanks

01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
and once uh you get seated if you want
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
to state your name and if it's difficult
 
01:35:24.530 --> 01:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
to spell for our Clerk
 
01:35:26.750 --> 01:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
that would be good and maybe you could
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
ask my question uh
 
01:35:31.610 --> 01:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
maybe you could answer my question why
 
01:35:34.250 --> 01:35:34.260 align:start position:0%
you were assigned to das
 
01:35:37.430 --> 01:35:37.440 align:start position:0%
oh so my name is Cassandra Sanchez I am
 
01:35:39.590 --> 01:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
the child advocate and I have with me
 
01:35:41.629 --> 01:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
Karen Kimmel from my office
 
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:43.500 align:start position:0%
um what I can share with you is we are
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
an independent oversight agency and as
 
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
an independent agency
 
01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
we could not be placed under DHHS
 
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
because we oversee their services
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
um our office oversees All Children's
 
01:35:58.250 --> 01:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
Services so we would not be a good fit
 
01:36:00.950 --> 01:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
under the doe and that leaves for us to
 
01:36:03.410 --> 01:36:03.420 align:start position:0%
be independent and impartial the best
 
01:36:09.550 --> 01:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.229 --> 01:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:16.910 --> 01:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
c-a-s-s-a-n-d-r-a last name Sanchez
 
01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:21.649 align:start position:0%
c-a-s-s-a-n-d-r-a last name Sanchez
s-a-n-c-h-e-z

01:36:21.649 --> 01:36:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:23.810 --> 01:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
and I have with me Karen Kimmel and her
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
last name is spelled
 
01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:39.709 --> 01:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
we have some materials that we're
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
sharing with you as well I will go over
 
01:36:45.169 --> 01:36:45.179 align:start position:0%
the Powerpoint slides that we have here
 
01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
for you
 
01:36:48.470 --> 01:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
um and I have some references to the
 
01:36:50.450 --> 01:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
budget materials as well
 
01:36:52.550 --> 01:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
but I did want to start and share a bit
 
01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:54.300 align:start position:0%
about the office for those who may not
 
01:36:55.550 --> 01:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
be familiar with the office of the child
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
advocate our role is to be an
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
independent impartial agency that
 
01:37:02.110 --> 01:37:02.120 align:start position:0%
oversees Children's Services
 
01:37:04.729 --> 01:37:04.739 align:start position:0%
initially when the office was developed
 
01:37:09.129 --> 01:37:09.139 align:start position:0%
the oversight was specifically for dcyf
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
including their Juvenile Justice we have
 
01:37:15.169 --> 01:37:15.179 align:start position:0%
since had an expanded jurisdiction as of
 
01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
December 2020
 
01:37:18.890 --> 01:37:18.900 align:start position:0%
and with that time frame we now with
 
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
with that new jurisdiction we now have
 
01:37:23.290 --> 01:37:23.300 align:start position:0%
oversight over
 
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
DHHS child serving agencies other
 
01:37:28.430 --> 01:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
executive branch agencies that provide
 
01:37:30.770 --> 01:37:30.780 align:start position:0%
services to children and the provider
 
01:37:33.350 --> 01:37:33.360 align:start position:0%
agencies that contract with them and
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
what that means is that that includes
 
01:37:36.110 --> 01:37:36.120 align:start position:0%
our oversight over all of the
 
01:37:37.610 --> 01:37:37.620 align:start position:0%
residential facilities that are now
 
01:37:39.410 --> 01:37:39.420 align:start position:0%
contracted with the state they're
 
01:37:40.669 --> 01:37:40.679 align:start position:0%
contracted through the Bureau of
 
01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:42.659 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health which falls
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
under DHHS we have oversight over that
 
01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
agency and all the contracts they
 
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
maintain we have oversight over dcyf and
 
01:37:51.290 --> 01:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
the contracts that they maintain for
 
01:37:54.649 --> 01:37:54.659 align:start position:0%
Provider Services to families
 
01:37:56.149 --> 01:37:56.159 align:start position:0%
um and it also would include in the
 
01:37:57.850 --> 01:37:57.860 align:start position:0%
executive branch
 
01:38:00.729 --> 01:38:00.739 align:start position:0%
doe with regards to Children's
 
01:38:04.310 --> 01:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
educational needs and the goal of our
 
01:38:05.930 --> 01:38:05.940 align:start position:0%
office is to ensure that children across
 
01:38:07.010 --> 01:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire's best
 
01:38:09.470 --> 01:38:09.480 align:start position:0%
interests are protected at all times and
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
that we have services available to meet
 
01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
their needs so in our oversight role we
 
01:38:16.250 --> 01:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
spend a significant period of time
 
01:38:19.790 --> 01:38:19.800 align:start position:0%
assessing and reviewing the Provider
 
01:38:21.890 --> 01:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
Services that are offered to children as
 
01:38:23.810 --> 01:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
well as those residential facilities and
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
sununa youth services Center
 
01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
um we've been highly involved in in
 
01:38:30.530 --> 01:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
discussions around the new replacement
 
01:38:32.209 --> 01:38:32.219 align:start position:0%
facility and taking a look at the bills
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
this session my time is spent advocating
 
01:38:38.510 --> 01:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
in legislature to governmental entities
 
01:38:41.870 --> 01:38:41.880 align:start position:0%
as well as meeting with children and
 
01:38:44.689 --> 01:38:44.699 align:start position:0%
hearing their concerns and needs and
 
01:38:46.669 --> 01:38:46.679 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we are able to address
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
their concerns through complaints we
 
01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
also work a lot with parents so one of
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
the documents that we have for you here
 
01:38:57.050 --> 01:38:57.060 align:start position:0%
is our our fifth annual report and our
 
01:38:58.669 --> 01:38:58.679 align:start position:0%
fifth annual report highlights the work
 
01:39:00.530 --> 01:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
that we've done our annual year goes
 
01:39:00.540 --> 01:39:02.270 align:start position:0%
that we've done our annual year goes
from

01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
October 1 to September 30th and so our
 
01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
last year was October 1 2021 to
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
September 30th 2022 and that shares a
 
01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
lot there's a lot of data in here about
 
01:39:17.810 --> 01:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.810 --> 01:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
and so to get to our budget
 
01:39:20.820 --> 01:39:29.510 align:start position:0%
and so to get to our budget
needs

01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:31.729 --> 01:39:31.739 align:start position:0%
so in the slideshow
 
01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:33.300 align:start position:0%
um the the slides that we have for you
 
01:39:35.510 --> 01:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
here we start by sharing the mission and
 
01:39:37.129 --> 01:39:37.139 align:start position:0%
the Mandate of the office the mission of
 
01:39:41.110 --> 01:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
the office was updated in 2021 after a
 
01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
strategic planning effort by the office
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
and so if you look on page six of the
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
annual report you can see some of the
 
01:39:51.770 --> 01:39:51.780 align:start position:0%
highlights of the work completed by the
 
01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:52.669 align:start position:0%
highlights of the work completed by the
office

01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:39:56.330 --> 01:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
and the annual report also speaks to the
 
01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
process of the Strategic plan which
 
01:39:59.270 --> 01:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
would be on the following page page
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
seven but those highlights there are
 
01:40:04.129 --> 01:40:04.139 align:start position:0%
just some touch points of outcomes
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
um of the office and how we have
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
influenced the lives of children through
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
our work again those are just highlights
 
01:40:12.110 --> 01:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
that does not capture
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
all of the work that we do in all of the
 
01:40:15.649 --> 01:40:15.659 align:start position:0%
children's lives that we are able to
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:23.930 --> 01:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
if you go to the following page on the
 
01:40:26.450 --> 01:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
slide show page three we have the
 
01:40:29.270 --> 01:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
overview of the office and this touches
 
01:40:30.890 --> 01:40:30.900 align:start position:0%
on the specific we have some specific
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
numbers for you in the in a report if
 
01:40:35.330 --> 01:40:35.340 align:start position:0%
you flip to the annual report page 15
 
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
you can see the complaints and inquiries
 
01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
that come into our office so those are
 
01:40:42.350 --> 01:40:42.360 align:start position:0%
direct Outreach to our office with
 
01:40:44.090 --> 01:40:44.100 align:start position:0%
either an issue with the system or with
 
01:40:45.770 --> 01:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
one of the child serving entities that
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
is working with a family or a child or a
 
01:40:51.050 --> 01:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
provider and so in the past annual year
 
01:40:53.930 --> 01:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
we had 319 contacts to the office
 
01:40:55.729 --> 01:40:55.739 align:start position:0%
primarily those come in through phone
 
01:40:57.530 --> 01:40:57.540 align:start position:0%
and email but we also have some
 
01:41:00.709 --> 01:41:00.719 align:start position:0%
in-person contact and some of our
 
01:41:03.169 --> 01:41:03.179 align:start position:0%
personal Outreach
 
01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
um to the children where we will get
 
01:41:06.050 --> 01:41:06.060 align:start position:0%
these complaints and inquiries and the
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
bottom there shows you who our primary
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
callers are which
 
01:41:10.370 --> 01:41:10.380 align:start position:0%
um at this time it is parents and
 
01:41:11.629 --> 01:41:11.639 align:start position:0%
guardians but we've made a great push
 
01:41:13.910 --> 01:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
and effort to ensure that we're reaching
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
children as well and hearing directly
 
01:41:18.169 --> 01:41:18.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
and if you go to page 17 it talks about
 
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:22.380 align:start position:0%
the incidents that are office monitors
 
01:41:24.490 --> 01:41:24.500 align:start position:0%
so we received
 
01:41:27.649 --> 01:41:27.659 align:start position:0%
2508 incident reports in this past
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
annual year that's a 31 increase from
 
01:41:33.410 --> 01:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
the prior annual year and we do expect
 
01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
that number to continue to go up
 
01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
um the incidents it lists for you there
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
all that is included in the incidents
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
that we receive and as I mentioned with
 
01:41:44.330 --> 01:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
our oversight over the facilities the
 
01:41:45.649 --> 01:41:45.659 align:start position:0%
majority of those reports come from
 
01:41:48.169 --> 01:41:48.179 align:start position:0%
facilities that specifically restraint
 
01:41:50.209 --> 01:41:50.219 align:start position:0%
and seclusion reports and incident
 
01:41:52.490 --> 01:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
reports from sysc
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
and what our office does is we review
 
01:41:55.850 --> 01:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
all of those incidents and ensure that
 
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
children's rights are being protected
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
and that they are being kept safe in
 
01:42:00.649 --> 01:42:00.659 align:start position:0%
these programs so we do review each of
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
those incidents that come into the
 
01:42:04.910 --> 01:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
office which does require quite
 
01:42:07.850 --> 01:42:07.860 align:start position:0%
a time commitment of staff to be able to
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
do that and as I mentioned we anticipate
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
that number to increase and the reason
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
for that is we are contracted with
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
out-of-state programs we have quite a
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
large amount of children that are placed
 
01:42:19.189 --> 01:42:19.199 align:start position:0%
out of state because we do not have
 
01:42:20.450 --> 01:42:20.460 align:start position:0%
enough New Hampshire programs to meet
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
their needs and when that happens for
 
01:42:23.639 --> 01:42:25.010 align:start position:0%
their needs and when that happens for
children

01:42:25.010 --> 01:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:42:26.570 --> 01:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
um we we seek to get the same
 
01:42:28.430 --> 01:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
documentation that we get for our
 
01:42:30.050 --> 01:42:30.060 align:start position:0%
in-state programs including restraint
 
01:42:32.270 --> 01:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
and seclusion reports we do not
 
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
consistently get those from all the out
 
01:42:36.410 --> 01:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
of state programs at this time
 
01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:39.900 align:start position:0%
and so with with the request from Bureau
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
of children's behavioral health for
 
01:42:43.609 --> 01:42:43.619 align:start position:0%
contract compliance for the
 
01:42:46.729 --> 01:42:46.739 align:start position:0%
the agencies to send everything to them
 
01:42:49.490 --> 01:42:49.500 align:start position:0%
and us we do expect an increase that
 
01:42:51.770 --> 01:42:51.780 align:start position:0%
request was sent out in November and
 
01:42:54.229 --> 01:42:54.239 align:start position:0%
they are expected to begin sending them
 
01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
this month and so we're not sure what
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
that number is going to look like but we
 
01:42:59.810 --> 01:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
do expect an increase of those coming in
 
01:43:03.290 --> 01:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
so to align with that additional work
 
01:43:05.390 --> 01:43:05.400 align:start position:0%
for the office we had requested through
 
01:43:08.750 --> 01:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
our Budget moving a part-time legal
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
secretary position to a full-time
 
01:43:13.790 --> 01:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
position it does appear that that was in
 
01:43:16.129 --> 01:43:16.139 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget it did
 
01:43:18.649 --> 01:43:18.659 align:start position:0%
include that the allocation for that
 
01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
position and this would be a person that
 
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
would specifically work on entering and
 
01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
reviewing the incidents and bringing any
 
01:43:27.169 --> 01:43:27.179 align:start position:0%
of concern to my attention to address
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:36.169 --> 01:43:36.179 align:start position:0%
I should know this question but too many
 
01:43:38.689 --> 01:43:38.699 align:start position:0%
facts when were you established when was
 
01:43:40.729 --> 01:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
your office established the office was
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
established in 2018.
 
01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
so we are still we are still a young new
 
01:43:45.119 --> 01:43:46.370 align:start position:0%
so we are still we are still a young new
office

01:43:46.370 --> 01:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
um I I was appointed to my position in
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
April as a second child advocate for the
 
01:43:50.159 --> 01:43:55.129 align:start position:0%
April as a second child advocate for the
state

01:43:55.129 --> 01:43:55.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:59.580 --> 01:43:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:59.590 --> 01:44:04.189 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:06.410 --> 01:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
um so if you flip the page of the annual
 
01:44:08.689 --> 01:44:08.699 align:start position:0%
report to page 18
 
01:44:10.070 --> 01:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
um you can see our system review
 
01:44:12.530 --> 01:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
mappings and so this is the work that we
 
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:15.420 align:start position:0%
do to influence system or change system
 
01:44:17.810 --> 01:44:17.820 align:start position:0%
reform and change when they're when we
 
01:44:19.970 --> 01:44:19.980 align:start position:0%
are able to identify cases of concern
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
with the agency so we did engage in
 
01:44:24.169 --> 01:44:24.179 align:start position:0%
three last year and these are typically
 
01:44:26.149 --> 01:44:26.159 align:start position:0%
cases um some of which may have been
 
01:44:29.450 --> 01:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
highlighted in the media or cases of
 
01:44:31.550 --> 01:44:31.560 align:start position:0%
severe severe abuse or neglect to a
 
01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:32.510 align:start position:0%
severe severe abuse or neglect to a
child

01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
um that our office felt required a
 
01:44:38.930 --> 01:44:38.940 align:start position:0%
review of this the system as a whole and
 
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking about System
 
01:44:41.209 --> 01:44:41.219 align:start position:0%
review mapping we're not talking about
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
just the dcyf system we're talking about
 
01:44:44.629 --> 01:44:44.639 align:start position:0%
other systems that may have been
 
01:44:47.450 --> 01:44:47.460 align:start position:0%
involved in the lives of that family and
 
01:44:49.669 --> 01:44:49.679 align:start position:0%
how can we make recommendations for
 
01:44:50.930 --> 01:44:50.940 align:start position:0%
changes to those systems to better
 
01:44:52.490 --> 01:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
protect children in the future so we
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
don't have in such severe instances or
 
01:44:57.530 --> 01:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
even potentially fatalities of children
 
01:44:59.450 --> 01:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
in the future of New Hampshire
 
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
so those are critical to the work that
 
01:45:03.470 --> 01:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
we do and and um
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
and the reform efforts that oftentimes
 
01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
come in front of legislature to take a
 
01:45:09.890 --> 01:45:09.900 align:start position:0%
look at changing state laws to better
 
01:45:13.370 --> 01:45:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:16.189 --> 01:45:16.199 align:start position:0%
and page 19 speaks to our Outreach and
 
01:45:16.199 --> 01:45:17.510 align:start position:0%
and page 19 speaks to our Outreach and
education

01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:45:20.149 --> 01:45:20.159 align:start position:0%
um so it notes Here facilities that we
 
01:45:21.770 --> 01:45:21.780 align:start position:0%
were able to visit in person some of the
 
01:45:23.090 --> 01:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
work that we did as well some some
 
01:45:26.090 --> 01:45:26.100 align:start position:0%
quotes that we had in response to
 
01:45:28.490 --> 01:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
different areas in which we visited and
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
we also attended some in-person events
 
01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
to further engage children
 
01:45:36.169 --> 01:45:36.179 align:start position:0%
as you'll see there we had at the time
 
01:45:40.970 --> 01:45:40.980 align:start position:0%
ending in September 25 000 plus miles
 
01:45:43.129 --> 01:45:43.139 align:start position:0%
driven by staff to be able to reach
 
01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
children some of those miles also
 
01:45:47.270 --> 01:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
include out of state miles so that ties
 
01:45:50.270 --> 01:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
back to our budget and that
 
01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:51.290 align:start position:0%
back to our budget and that
um

01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:52.970 align:start position:0%
um
we

01:45:52.970 --> 01:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:45:55.250 --> 01:45:55.260 align:start position:0%
had in this year
 
01:45:57.229 --> 01:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
um we had five thousand dollars in our
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
in-state travel reimbursement and eight
 
01:46:00.890 --> 01:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in our out of state
 
01:46:00.900 --> 01:46:02.870 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in our out of state
travel

01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
travel
 
01:46:05.450 --> 01:46:05.460 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately we did not get as much
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
of that in our efficiency budget for the
 
01:46:11.750 --> 01:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
following year so at this time it's
 
01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:12.890 align:start position:0%
following year so at this time it's
shrunk

01:46:12.890 --> 01:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
shrunk
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
I buy a lot for our office and
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
considering how much we've spent already
 
01:46:19.490 --> 01:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
this annual year we do see that if we
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
are not able to get additional funds we
 
01:46:22.790 --> 01:46:22.800 align:start position:0%
will not be able to outreach children in
 
01:46:24.530 --> 01:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
the way that we have been
 
01:46:26.209 --> 01:46:26.219 align:start position:0%
um in Prior years there was difficulty
 
01:46:27.890 --> 01:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
with that in-person Outreach because of
 
01:46:30.590 --> 01:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
coven but now with restrictions lifted
 
01:46:33.590 --> 01:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
we are able to visit much more than we
 
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
have than the office had in the past
 
01:46:37.490 --> 01:46:37.500 align:start position:0%
um currently out of the five thousand
 
01:46:40.370 --> 01:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
dollars of our end state
 
01:46:42.890 --> 01:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
um travel reimbursement we have 670
 
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
dollars left to get us through June
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
um and in our out of state travel we
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
have spent down about 3 000 and plan to
 
01:46:52.669 --> 01:46:52.679 align:start position:0%
continue to visit additional
 
01:46:54.169 --> 01:46:54.179 align:start position:0%
out-of-state facilities to meet with
 
01:46:58.490 --> 01:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
children so ideally we would like to
 
01:47:01.390 --> 01:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
add an additional 9 000 and out of state
 
01:47:04.490 --> 01:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
travel and I mean in state I'm sorry
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
in-state travel additional 9 000 and for
 
01:47:09.649 --> 01:47:09.659 align:start position:0%
out of state travel an additional 9 600
 
01:47:11.689 --> 01:47:11.699 align:start position:0%
and so that would include there are
 
01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
facilities that we have to fly to and
 
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
can't just drive to so that would afford
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
US the opportunity to be able to fly to
 
01:47:17.870 --> 01:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
these facilities and meet with children
 
01:47:19.910 --> 01:47:19.920 align:start position:0%
as we understand that those are some of
 
01:47:21.290 --> 01:47:21.300 align:start position:0%
the most vulnerable children of our
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
state because they're not close enough
 
01:47:25.129 --> 01:47:25.139 align:start position:0%
in close access for family to be
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
visiting on a regular basis for dcyf
 
01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:29.219 align:start position:0%
staff to be visiting on a regular basis
 
01:47:31.609 --> 01:47:31.619 align:start position:0%
so they are more at risk of abuse and
 
01:47:33.770 --> 01:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
neglect in placement so we would like to
 
01:47:35.510 --> 01:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
ensure their safety by by taking the
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
time to not only meet with them
 
01:47:38.030 --> 01:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
virtually but spending time at the
 
01:47:40.370 --> 01:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
facility in person
 
01:47:42.649 --> 01:47:42.659 align:start position:0%
Melissa Mr Hoffman did you get those
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
numbers good thanks
 
01:47:47.209 --> 01:47:47.219 align:start position:0%
representative hatch
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:47:50.270 --> 01:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thank you for the work
 
01:47:51.169 --> 01:47:51.179 align:start position:0%
you do
 
01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
um thank you on out of state or any
 
01:47:54.709 --> 01:47:54.719 align:start position:0%
travel is there is there a pre
 
01:47:56.689 --> 01:47:56.699 align:start position:0%
designated number of times you need to
 
01:47:59.090 --> 01:47:59.100 align:start position:0%
reach out to the children are physically
 
01:48:02.570 --> 01:48:02.580 align:start position:0%
interview them or see them is there uh
 
01:48:05.090 --> 01:48:05.100 align:start position:0%
parameters that you have to stay Within
 
01:48:09.649 --> 01:48:09.659 align:start position:0%
or is it it's not it's not at this time
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
it is at the discretion of the office we
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
do plan if a child is contacting the
 
01:48:16.370 --> 01:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
office and asking to meet with somebody
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
that we do have a procedure in place
 
01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
that we send somebody out within 24
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
hours as long as it's a weekday if
 
01:48:25.129 --> 01:48:25.139 align:start position:0%
they're calling on Friday afternoon
 
01:48:27.709 --> 01:48:27.719 align:start position:0%
um you know the following Monday to meet
 
01:48:29.570 --> 01:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
with the child immediately to ensure
 
01:48:32.689 --> 01:48:32.699 align:start position:0%
that they are safe so in those in that
 
01:48:34.129 --> 01:48:34.139 align:start position:0%
instance that is the one procedure in
 
01:48:35.629 --> 01:48:35.639 align:start position:0%
place otherwise for out-of-state
 
01:48:37.189 --> 01:48:37.199 align:start position:0%
facilities we look at the highest in
 
01:48:38.930 --> 01:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
need so we take a look at out-of-state
 
01:48:40.129 --> 01:48:40.139 align:start position:0%
facilities that have the most children
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
placed there and those in which that
 
01:48:44.149 --> 01:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
we've received either concerning reports
 
01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
from either in-state or out of state we
 
01:48:49.370 --> 01:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
do have Partners in um in some of these
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
states where the programs exist through
 
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
some of our professional organizations
 
01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
and those Partners will highlight when
 
01:48:55.250 --> 01:48:55.260 align:start position:0%
they're hearing concerns in their own
 
01:48:57.050 --> 01:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
State about the program and that was
 
01:48:58.729 --> 01:48:58.739 align:start position:0%
when we will prioritize going to visit
 
01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
that program and ensure the safety of
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire children because
 
01:49:03.950 --> 01:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we find that those States
 
01:49:05.570 --> 01:49:05.580 align:start position:0%
will know about the program the problems
 
01:49:07.609 --> 01:49:07.619 align:start position:0%
in the program but it will not travel
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
all the way up to New Hampshire and so
 
01:49:11.330 --> 01:49:11.340 align:start position:0%
we do we don't know necessarily that
 
01:49:12.770 --> 01:49:12.780 align:start position:0%
there are worries about what is
 
01:49:19.149 --> 01:49:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.310 --> 01:49:22.320 align:start position:0%
in terms of budgeting out of state
 
01:49:24.290 --> 01:49:24.300 align:start position:0%
um what you're basing on the additional
 
01:49:26.450 --> 01:49:26.460 align:start position:0%
mornings for or
 
01:49:29.530 --> 01:49:29.540 align:start position:0%
um that's all just yes so we would like
 
01:49:32.510 --> 01:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
ideally we would like to be able to
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
travel to at least three programs out of
 
01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
state by by plane a year and this would
 
01:49:41.689 --> 01:49:41.699 align:start position:0%
allow us to do that where others are
 
01:49:43.010 --> 01:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
within driving distance there are a
 
01:49:44.510 --> 01:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
number of programs in Massachusetts that
 
01:49:46.370 --> 01:49:46.380 align:start position:0%
would be driving distance
 
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
um so we would not it would not require
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
the this overnight stay necessarily it
 
01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
would not require flight in Vermont as
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
well which are in driving distance so
 
01:49:59.090 --> 01:49:59.100 align:start position:0%
those are much easier to get to and and
 
01:50:01.070 --> 01:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
much more fiscally conservative trips so
 
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
we do consider those as well but it's
 
01:50:05.510 --> 01:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
the further out trips that we would like
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to increase
 
01:50:10.010 --> 01:50:10.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:50:12.169 --> 01:50:12.179 align:start position:0%
so I'm still way back looking at your
 
01:50:14.030 --> 01:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
reports you know I haven't caught up yet
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
but obviously trafficking of any sort is
 
01:50:19.729 --> 01:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
bad I see that there are a number of
 
01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
cases of sex and work labor trafficking
 
01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
how much of is that increasing or where
 
01:50:29.209 --> 01:50:29.219 align:start position:0%
where are these people coming from that
 
01:50:31.609 --> 01:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
are being abused and
 
01:50:33.709 --> 01:50:33.719 align:start position:0%
it does appear that those numbers are
 
01:50:35.689 --> 01:50:35.699 align:start position:0%
increasing um and speaking with our
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
partners that specialize in that area it
 
01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
does appear those numbers continue to
 
01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.570 align:start position:0%
does appear those numbers continue to
increase

01:50:41.570 --> 01:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:50:43.129 --> 01:50:43.139 align:start position:0%
um it's often that we're finding it is
 
01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:45.000 align:start position:0%
children that are in care that are being
 
01:50:46.490 --> 01:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
trafficked whether they're running from
 
01:50:48.890 --> 01:50:48.900 align:start position:0%
a program there are times where they
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
will elope from a program and then we'll
 
01:50:51.950 --> 01:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
end up trafficked through that and
 
01:50:53.810 --> 01:50:53.820 align:start position:0%
return to the program reporting concerns
 
01:50:55.609 --> 01:50:55.619 align:start position:0%
for trafficking
 
01:50:57.290 --> 01:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
um there are other times that children
 
01:51:00.649 --> 01:51:00.659 align:start position:0%
are previously involved in trafficking
 
01:51:03.169 --> 01:51:03.179 align:start position:0%
and then come into care and it's the
 
01:51:06.050 --> 01:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
difficulty of creating barriers for them
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
and protection so that that relationship
 
01:51:09.770 --> 01:51:09.780 align:start position:0%
doesn't continue but if the person knows
 
01:51:12.050 --> 01:51:12.060 align:start position:0%
how to access them they do have the
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
ability even if they are in Care at
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
times thanks representative McGuire do
 
01:51:17.090 --> 01:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm still unclear as to
 
01:51:23.570 --> 01:51:23.580 align:start position:0%
exactly what your department does
 
01:51:26.870 --> 01:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
compared to HHS so I'm going to need an
 
01:51:30.770 --> 01:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
example so suppose a teacher thinks that
 
01:51:33.770 --> 01:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
a child is being mistreated
 
01:51:37.370 --> 01:51:37.380 align:start position:0%
they call dcyf yes and then they come
 
01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
out and investigate yes so where does uh
 
01:51:43.850 --> 01:51:43.860 align:start position:0%
your agency get involved in this example
 
01:51:46.850 --> 01:51:46.860 align:start position:0%
yes that's a great question so they
 
01:51:48.290 --> 01:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
would initially reach out to the agency
 
01:51:50.209 --> 01:51:50.219 align:start position:0%
the agency would go out and investigate
 
01:51:52.189 --> 01:51:52.199 align:start position:0%
and for instance the agency says that
 
01:51:54.770 --> 01:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
they've there's not enough for them to
 
01:51:56.750 --> 01:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
open a case with the family that it's
 
01:51:58.850 --> 01:51:58.860 align:start position:0%
not meeting the threshold of the law and
 
01:52:00.590 --> 01:52:00.600 align:start position:0%
so they're looking to close out with
 
01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
this family but there's additional
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
concerns that keep coming in and that
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
the school is contacting the agency and
 
01:52:08.450 --> 01:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
it's not going anywhere and they have
 
01:52:09.890 --> 01:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
real worries for the safety of that
 
01:52:11.689 --> 01:52:11.699 align:start position:0%
child so ultimately a call would come
 
01:52:13.609 --> 01:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
into our office from the school for
 
01:52:13.619 --> 01:52:14.689 align:start position:0%
into our office from the school for
instance

01:52:14.689 --> 01:52:14.699 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:16.139 align:start position:0%
explaining that they've attempted to
 
01:52:17.689 --> 01:52:17.699 align:start position:0%
work with the agency to protect this
 
01:52:19.129 --> 01:52:19.139 align:start position:0%
child they don't feel the agency was
 
01:52:19.139 --> 01:52:20.930 align:start position:0%
child they don't feel the agency was
responsive

01:52:20.930 --> 01:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
responsive
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
then at that point we do have to ensure
 
01:52:24.770 --> 01:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
that they engage with the Ombudsman out
 
01:52:27.229 --> 01:52:27.239 align:start position:0%
of HHS so we would refer them to the
 
01:52:29.689 --> 01:52:29.699 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman at HHS and ask them to call us
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
back once they've engaged with them and
 
01:52:32.990 --> 01:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
whether their concern was addressed
 
01:52:35.090 --> 01:52:35.100 align:start position:0%
oftentimes they will call the Ombudsman
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
they will call us back say our concern
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
was not addressed we have real safety
 
01:52:41.810 --> 01:52:41.820 align:start position:0%
concerns for this child and we've spoken
 
01:52:43.129 --> 01:52:43.139 align:start position:0%
to everybody within the agency and
 
01:52:45.470 --> 01:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
nothing is changing and at that point my
 
01:52:46.850 --> 01:52:46.860 align:start position:0%
office would get involved we have the
 
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
ability to directly sign in to their
 
01:52:52.910 --> 01:52:52.920 align:start position:0%
system the DHHS System review any case
 
01:52:54.169 --> 01:52:54.179 align:start position:0%
notes that they may have on that family
 
01:52:55.729 --> 01:52:55.739 align:start position:0%
review any efforts that they've made to
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
address the concerns called in by the
 
01:53:00.830 --> 01:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
reporter and if we find gaps there where
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
there are things that they may not have
 
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
looked into or there are instances in
 
01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
which they did not follow policy for
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
instance they may have sent somebody out
 
01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
to talk to the parents to ask about
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
specific abuse in the home but they did
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
not send somebody out separately to
 
01:53:16.129 --> 01:53:16.139 align:start position:0%
speak to the child in a safe location
 
01:53:18.290 --> 01:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
and so we would look at that and we
 
01:53:20.149 --> 01:53:20.159 align:start position:0%
would contact the agency and say and say
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
per policy you are expected to meet with
 
01:53:24.290 --> 01:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
a child separate from the family to
 
01:53:25.970 --> 01:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
ensure that the child is safely able to
 
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
disclose any concerns of abuse in the
 
01:53:29.689 --> 01:53:29.699 align:start position:0%
home that did not happen we need you to
 
01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
reopen and take a second look at this
 
01:53:34.070 --> 01:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
and further interview the child and that
 
01:53:35.450 --> 01:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
is an example that I can say we've
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely engaged in those
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
conversations with the agency and that
 
01:53:40.189 --> 01:53:40.199 align:start position:0%
is the purpose of our oversight is to
 
01:53:42.590 --> 01:53:42.600 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are following the law
 
01:53:44.870 --> 01:53:44.880 align:start position:0%
following their own policies and truly
 
01:53:47.330 --> 01:53:47.340 align:start position:0%
assessing for safety of children and we
 
01:53:48.950 --> 01:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
are finding with an overworked system
 
01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:51.480 align:start position:0%
that that's not always the case and
 
01:53:53.090 --> 01:53:53.100 align:start position:0%
they're overworked and understaffed and
 
01:53:55.129 --> 01:53:55.139 align:start position:0%
we do acknowledge that but that does not
 
01:53:58.370 --> 01:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
leave room for children to not be safe
 
01:54:01.970 --> 01:54:01.980 align:start position:0%
and to not be assessed appropriately
 
01:54:06.590 --> 01:54:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so in this example
 
01:54:09.109 --> 01:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
you call them and say do better in this
 
01:54:09.119 --> 01:54:10.669 align:start position:0%
you call them and say do better in this
case

01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:54:10.679 --> 01:54:11.890 align:start position:0%
case
um

01:54:11.890 --> 01:54:11.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:15.649 --> 01:54:15.659 align:start position:0%
if they don't that's the end of it or I
 
01:54:18.169 --> 01:54:18.179 align:start position:0%
mean can you
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
can somebody get fired who should have
 
01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
been doing their job and isn't or
 
01:54:25.729 --> 01:54:25.739 align:start position:0%
so we don't handle worker discipline
 
01:54:27.470 --> 01:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
that is handled within the agency it
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
would rise up to higher ups within the
 
01:54:32.090 --> 01:54:32.100 align:start position:0%
agency to share recommendations to them
 
01:54:33.590 --> 01:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
and what we found on the case because
 
01:54:35.750 --> 01:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
they are not reviewing every single case
 
01:54:37.370 --> 01:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
that's involved in the agency so we will
 
01:54:38.689 --> 01:54:38.699 align:start position:0%
go all the way up to the director of the
 
01:54:40.129 --> 01:54:40.139 align:start position:0%
agency and say this is what we're seeing
 
01:54:41.930 --> 01:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
may go to the commissioner if it's not
 
01:54:43.490 --> 01:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
going further and we also have the
 
01:54:45.530 --> 01:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
ability to share openly with the public
 
01:54:47.450 --> 01:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
or with the governor's office
 
01:54:49.189 --> 01:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
as well as the legislature if there are
 
01:54:50.570 --> 01:54:50.580 align:start position:0%
issues that we are seeing that are are
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
going unaddressed by the agency and
 
01:54:53.570 --> 01:54:53.580 align:start position:0%
they're not choosing to follow our
 
01:54:53.580 --> 01:54:55.250 align:start position:0%
they're not choosing to follow our
recommendations

01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:54:57.050 --> 01:54:57.060 align:start position:0%
so what what fraction of the case
 
01:55:00.109 --> 01:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
complaints you get do you just decide or
 
01:55:00.119 --> 01:55:01.629 align:start position:0%
complaints you get do you just decide or
just

01:55:01.629 --> 01:55:01.639 align:start position:0%
just
 
01:55:04.010 --> 01:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
do you mean that we actually have but
 
01:55:06.590 --> 01:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
now come on in the example you gave the
 
01:55:09.070 --> 01:55:09.080 align:start position:0%
school called you
 
01:55:12.590 --> 01:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
dcyf is not appropriately investigating
 
01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
some case that's a complaint right yes
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
so what fraction of those and then you
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
look into it and you say
 
01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
um maybe the complaint is not justified
 
01:55:27.169 --> 01:55:27.179 align:start position:0%
or maybe it is right so in what what
 
01:55:29.810 --> 01:55:29.820 align:start position:0%
fraction of the cases is the complaint
 
01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:31.790 align:start position:0%
fraction of the cases is the complaint
Justified

01:55:31.790 --> 01:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
Justified
 
01:55:33.709 --> 01:55:33.719 align:start position:0%
so that actually brings us to another
 
01:55:37.250 --> 01:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
item on um in our prioritized needs so
 
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
if you flip two and I will explain the
 
01:55:41.930 --> 01:55:41.940 align:start position:0%
connection in one moment
 
01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
if you flip to page six on the slides it
 
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
talks about a case management system so
 
01:55:48.649 --> 01:55:48.659 align:start position:0%
we do have a case management system
 
01:55:52.910 --> 01:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
we use Salesforce and we have been doing
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
our best to utilize the system
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
as well as we can there are a lot of
 
01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
difficulties in pulling the information
 
01:56:02.689 --> 01:56:02.699 align:start position:0%
that we would like to be able to pull
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
out of that system such as outcomes that
 
01:56:06.410 --> 01:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
is one that we are unable to track with
 
01:56:08.870 --> 01:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
the way the system is currently set up
 
01:56:11.390 --> 01:56:11.400 align:start position:0%
Salesforce was piloted with the state
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
and and we were offered the opportunity
 
01:56:16.370 --> 01:56:16.380 align:start position:0%
to Pilot with them early on
 
01:56:20.209 --> 01:56:20.219 align:start position:0%
um in 2018 so our office did that we at
 
01:56:21.530 --> 01:56:21.540 align:start position:0%
the end of that pilot had a lot of
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
recommendations for changes to the
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
program so that it could better assess
 
01:56:27.229 --> 01:56:27.239 align:start position:0%
the work that we are doing and we could
 
01:56:30.530 --> 01:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
have better outcome data to share there
 
01:56:32.270 --> 01:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
was no further work at that time and so
 
01:56:33.649 --> 01:56:33.659 align:start position:0%
as you will see there in that history it
 
01:56:36.770 --> 01:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
says in 2021 we worked with doit and Das
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
to release an RFI
 
01:56:42.290 --> 01:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
and RFQ was released in 2022 to
 
01:56:43.910 --> 01:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
determine an amount needed for our
 
01:56:45.770 --> 01:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
minimal needs so our minimal needs to
 
01:56:47.629 --> 01:56:47.639 align:start position:0%
get the program to a place where we can
 
01:56:49.850 --> 01:56:49.860 align:start position:0%
better measure and share outcomes of the
 
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
office we need two hundred and thousand
 
01:56:54.830 --> 01:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
dollars for a project that is the bare
 
01:56:57.770 --> 01:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
minimum we were quoted mil in in the
 
01:56:59.510 --> 01:56:59.520 align:start position:0%
Millions for some of the projects to
 
01:56:59.520 --> 01:57:00.530 align:start position:0%
Millions for some of the projects to
really

01:57:00.530 --> 01:57:00.540 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:57:02.930 --> 01:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
completely go through every aspect of
 
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
Salesforce and open it up and available
 
01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
to us for what we need we are looking at
 
01:57:08.510 --> 01:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
the bare minimum just to be able to get
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
this job done we've understand the
 
01:57:12.410 --> 01:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
importance of the outcome data and
 
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
really want to be able to better capture
 
01:57:16.609 --> 01:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
that for the agency as well because we
 
01:57:18.589 --> 01:57:18.599 align:start position:0%
do bring them these cases to them on a
 
01:57:20.629 --> 01:57:20.639 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis but it would be much
 
01:57:21.950 --> 01:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
more effective to bring it to them at
 
01:57:23.870 --> 01:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
the end of the year and say this is a
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
percentage of cases that our office had
 
01:57:29.209 --> 01:57:29.219 align:start position:0%
to intervene on and change had to happen
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
versus the complaints that we got we
 
01:57:32.930 --> 01:57:32.940 align:start position:0%
cannot do that we have way too many
 
01:57:35.330 --> 01:57:35.340 align:start position:0%
limitations with our system right now
 
01:57:38.570 --> 01:57:38.580 align:start position:0%
okay can you say
 
01:57:43.570 --> 01:57:43.580 align:start position:0%
what fraction of the complaints to dcyf
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
end up pushed up so that they become
 
01:57:51.050 --> 01:57:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:53.450 --> 01:57:53.460 align:start position:0%
um I died we don't have data that we
 
01:57:55.609 --> 01:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
share with the Ombudsman office there
 
01:57:57.290 --> 01:57:57.300 align:start position:0%
versus the ones that we get we do have
 
01:57:58.910 --> 01:57:58.920 align:start position:0%
meetings with the Ombudsman office on a
 
01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
regular basis at DHHS to talk about
 
01:58:04.189 --> 01:58:04.199 align:start position:0%
shared complaints and we find that often
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
they have they've received the complaint
 
01:58:07.790 --> 01:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
first before it comes to us there are a
 
01:58:09.589 --> 01:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
few that we we do always refer to them
 
01:58:11.689 --> 01:58:11.699 align:start position:0%
but we find that we have shared families
 
01:58:14.330 --> 01:58:14.340 align:start position:0%
and shared complaints but we don't have
 
01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
their data to know
 
01:58:18.709 --> 01:58:18.719 align:start position:0%
and and even specifics of names of
 
01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
families to know how many complaints
 
01:58:21.709 --> 01:58:21.719 align:start position:0%
that they're managing that we also
 
01:58:21.719 --> 01:58:24.229 align:start position:0%
that they're managing that we also
received

01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
received
 
01:58:27.770 --> 01:58:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:30.410 --> 01:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking at the slides four five
 
01:58:32.810 --> 01:58:32.820 align:start position:0%
and six all those prioritized needs none
 
01:58:34.070 --> 01:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
of those were addressed by the
 
01:58:35.390 --> 01:58:35.400 align:start position:0%
governor's office
 
01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
one of those was
 
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
um the one in which that was addressed
 
01:58:40.970 --> 01:58:40.980 align:start position:0%
by the governor's office is page five
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
and that is a legal secretary to go from
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
a part-time position to a full-time
 
01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:46.629 align:start position:0%
a part-time position to a full-time
position

01:58:46.629 --> 01:58:46.639 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:58:49.129 --> 01:58:49.139 align:start position:0%
where you show seven going to eight
 
01:58:54.050 --> 01:58:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.530 --> 01:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
so to the other position that's in the
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs is the public
 
01:59:03.950 --> 01:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
relations representative and training
 
01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:05.270 align:start position:0%
relations representative and training
officer

01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
officer
 
01:59:07.490 --> 01:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
so for our office it's quite important
 
01:59:11.390 --> 01:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
for us to be up to date on Research
 
01:59:14.270 --> 01:59:14.280 align:start position:0%
backing um Child Development so we focus
 
01:59:15.530 --> 01:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
a lot on research and Child Development
 
01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of research and on brain
 
01:59:21.530 --> 01:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
development for children as well as Aces
 
01:59:24.470 --> 01:59:24.480 align:start position:0%
studies so we follow research on a
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
regular basis and we we make
 
01:59:28.189 --> 01:59:28.199 align:start position:0%
recommendations for best practice based
 
01:59:29.689 --> 01:59:29.699 align:start position:0%
off of that
 
01:59:31.850 --> 01:59:31.860 align:start position:0%
um that requires us to attend a lot of
 
01:59:33.649 --> 01:59:33.659 align:start position:0%
trainings and stay up to date on the
 
01:59:35.030 --> 01:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
many changes that are happening in the
 
01:59:36.410 --> 01:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
happening in the psychology field
 
01:59:39.169 --> 01:59:39.179 align:start position:0%
relative to Child Development
 
01:59:41.089 --> 01:59:41.099 align:start position:0%
so part of our budget we do have have
 
01:59:44.570 --> 01:59:44.580 align:start position:0%
funds as well for employee training that
 
01:59:46.310 --> 01:59:46.320 align:start position:0%
was reduced down
 
01:59:48.770 --> 01:59:48.780 align:start position:0%
um quite a lot so we are looking at
 
01:59:49.970 --> 01:59:49.980 align:start position:0%
currently in the efficiency budget we
 
01:59:52.430 --> 01:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
have one dollar we are looking at adding
 
01:59:54.109 --> 01:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
additional two thousand dollars so that
 
01:59:56.510 --> 01:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
we can continue training but with that
 
01:59:58.609 --> 01:59:58.619 align:start position:0%
there is a lot that goes into organizing
 
02:00:00.890 --> 02:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
the trainings for our office so we are
 
02:00:02.570 --> 02:00:02.580 align:start position:0%
looking to add a position
 
02:00:04.910 --> 02:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh for a training officer full-time but
 
02:00:06.050 --> 02:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
as well as public relations
 
02:00:08.209 --> 02:00:08.219 align:start position:0%
representative so another aspect of
 
02:00:10.189 --> 02:00:10.199 align:start position:0%
reaching children in today's world is
 
02:00:12.290 --> 02:00:12.300 align:start position:0%
having active social media our office
 
02:00:14.209 --> 02:00:14.219 align:start position:0%
currently has a Facebook page we have a
 
02:00:17.209 --> 02:00:17.219 align:start position:0%
Twitter page and we have an Instagram
 
02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
we do our best with the staff on site to
 
02:00:21.050 --> 02:00:21.060 align:start position:0%
update that on a regular basis to be
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
able to share what reports we're putting
 
02:00:25.310 --> 02:00:25.320 align:start position:0%
out to engage the public and to to reach
 
02:00:26.689 --> 02:00:26.699 align:start position:0%
children that way
 
02:00:28.189 --> 02:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
with the limited staff that we have in
 
02:00:31.070 --> 02:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
office and all the other complaints
 
02:00:33.109 --> 02:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
um and incidents that we are reviewing
 
02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
in the office we have quite limited time
 
02:00:37.550 --> 02:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
to put effort into that but we fully
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
understand from the children that we
 
02:00:40.430 --> 02:00:40.440 align:start position:0%
meet with that social media is where
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
kids spend the majority of their time
 
02:00:43.070 --> 02:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
that's how we're going to reach them
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
that's how they're going to learn about
 
02:00:47.629 --> 02:00:47.639 align:start position:0%
us and be willing to outreach us and we
 
02:00:48.890 --> 02:00:48.900 align:start position:0%
also understand it takes multiple
 
02:00:50.870 --> 02:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
attempts with children to get them to
 
02:00:53.089 --> 02:00:53.099 align:start position:0%
engage with us so going out for children
 
02:00:55.430 --> 02:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
in facilities is great because they are
 
02:00:57.770 --> 02:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
there and accessible very easily but
 
02:00:58.970 --> 02:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about children in
 
02:01:00.410 --> 02:01:00.420 align:start position:0%
foster homes we don't have the same
 
02:01:02.270 --> 02:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
access to being available for children
 
02:01:03.950 --> 02:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
foster homes unless we have a
 
02:01:06.649 --> 02:01:06.659 align:start position:0%
relationship with the foster parent in
 
02:01:08.450 --> 02:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
that home where they may recommend the
 
02:01:09.950 --> 02:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
child to outreach us but children who
 
02:01:11.270 --> 02:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
remain in the community whether they're
 
02:01:12.589 --> 02:01:12.599 align:start position:0%
in their family homes or whether they're
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
in a foster placement or whether they're
 
02:01:16.370 --> 02:01:16.380 align:start position:0%
with an extended family member we are
 
02:01:18.169 --> 02:01:18.179 align:start position:0%
not reaching that population and we
 
02:01:19.370 --> 02:01:19.380 align:start position:0%
understand we're missing that population
 
02:01:21.770 --> 02:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
and so that's a real Focus for us is to
 
02:01:23.330 --> 02:01:23.340 align:start position:0%
to get to them and so this position
 
02:01:25.370 --> 02:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
would address both we would be able to
 
02:01:27.350 --> 02:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
have one position that would work dual
 
02:01:29.810 --> 02:01:29.820 align:start position:0%
track on promoting our social media
 
02:01:31.370 --> 02:01:31.380 align:start position:0%
and enhancing our connections to
 
02:01:33.649 --> 02:01:33.659 align:start position:0%
children that way and ensuring that we
 
02:01:35.270 --> 02:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
are receiving training that's adequate
 
02:01:37.129 --> 02:01:37.139 align:start position:0%
for our office because there are a lot
 
02:01:38.930 --> 02:01:38.940 align:start position:0%
of trainings that are offered some of
 
02:01:40.250 --> 02:01:40.260 align:start position:0%
which through professional organizations
 
02:01:43.250 --> 02:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
are offered for free but are they really
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
touching on the topics that we need to
 
02:01:45.890 --> 02:01:45.900 align:start position:0%
be expanding our knowledge on and we
 
02:01:47.089 --> 02:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
need somebody to take the time to really
 
02:01:48.410 --> 02:01:48.420 align:start position:0%
weed through the many of trainings
 
02:01:50.089 --> 02:01:50.099 align:start position:0%
offered to us and point out the ones
 
02:01:51.709 --> 02:01:51.719 align:start position:0%
that are going to be most worth our time
 
02:01:53.450 --> 02:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
and are truly going to benefit the
 
02:01:54.709 --> 02:01:54.719 align:start position:0%
issues that we're seeing in the state of
 
02:01:56.149 --> 02:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because a lot of these are
 
02:01:58.129 --> 02:01:58.139 align:start position:0%
National organizations that offer
 
02:02:00.050 --> 02:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
National trainings but is that really
 
02:02:02.450 --> 02:02:02.460 align:start position:0%
connecting to the issues of the children
 
02:02:04.790 --> 02:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire some are especially if
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
we're talking about mental health for
 
02:02:08.089 --> 02:02:08.099 align:start position:0%
children there's a large mental health
 
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
need for the children in the state of
 
02:02:11.870 --> 02:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so all of those seem to be
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
quite relevant but there are other areas
 
02:02:15.050 --> 02:02:15.060 align:start position:0%
of development that may be better
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
fitting for inner city children versus
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
children that that live in this
 
02:02:22.010 --> 02:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
population and so we we would greatly
 
02:02:24.530 --> 02:02:24.540 align:start position:0%
benefit from having a person to
 
02:02:26.810 --> 02:02:26.820 align:start position:0%
um spend their time specifically on
 
02:02:28.370 --> 02:02:28.380 align:start position:0%
those issues as well as being able to
 
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
bring in personal trainers to the office
 
02:02:33.830 --> 02:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
we have had an opportunity to work with
 
02:02:35.209 --> 02:02:35.219 align:start position:0%
um outside consultants and bring them
 
02:02:36.470 --> 02:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
into the office to do training
 
02:02:38.810 --> 02:02:38.820 align:start position:0%
specifically for staff and we find that
 
02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
because of the work that we do they are
 
02:02:42.109 --> 02:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
willing to give us a low and reduced
 
02:02:42.119 --> 02:02:43.189 align:start position:0%
willing to give us a low and reduced
cost

02:02:43.189 --> 02:02:43.199 align:start position:0%
cost
 
02:02:43.970 --> 02:02:43.980 align:start position:0%
um and so if we had somebody
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
specifically who was focusing their
 
02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
efforts on making those relationships
 
02:02:48.350 --> 02:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
and outreaching and explaining what we
 
02:02:50.149 --> 02:02:50.159 align:start position:0%
do and explaining why we need their
 
02:02:52.189 --> 02:02:52.199 align:start position:0%
expertise in our office we believe that
 
02:02:53.450 --> 02:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
we will be able to get more of those
 
02:02:55.129 --> 02:02:55.139 align:start position:0%
than we've had thus far we had one in
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
the past year and we'd like to see many
 
02:02:56.400 --> 02:03:00.350 align:start position:0%
the past year and we'd like to see many
more

02:03:00.350 --> 02:03:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
are there some additional questions from
 
02:03:06.890 --> 02:03:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
all right you've given us a lot of good
 
02:03:13.209 --> 02:03:13.219 align:start position:0%
information I am a little curious
 
02:03:16.669 --> 02:03:16.679 align:start position:0%
why they basically zeroed out your
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
training line or put a dollar did they
 
02:03:20.709 --> 02:03:20.719 align:start position:0%
someone expect you to get a grant this
 
02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:24.540 align:start position:0%
or no unfortunately we had a a large
 
02:03:27.350 --> 02:03:27.360 align:start position:0%
increase in our
 
02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:31.380 align:start position:0%
um our doit expenses as well as our Das
 
02:03:34.669 --> 02:03:34.679 align:start position:0%
expenses and with that increase we had
 
02:03:37.729 --> 02:03:37.739 align:start position:0%
to pull from other lines and
 
02:03:40.370 --> 02:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
um we there were certain lines that we
 
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
pulled some not all from but some such
 
02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
as that line had to go down to zero to
 
02:03:48.530 --> 02:03:48.540 align:start position:0%
be able to cover that cost
 
02:03:50.570 --> 02:03:50.580 align:start position:0%
um so if you see with the
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's the um
 
02:03:56.270 --> 02:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
transfer to oit and where's the other
 
02:03:56.280 --> 02:04:01.310 align:start position:0%
transfer to oit and where's the other
one

02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:04.070 --> 02:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay yes 27 and 28.
 
02:04:05.689 --> 02:04:05.699 align:start position:0%
um as you can see they drastically
 
02:04:08.270 --> 02:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
whatever 28 went from
 
02:04:12.410 --> 02:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
um the uh the actual expense in 2022 10
 
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
000 16 000 up to 22 almost 23 000. um so
 
02:04:18.350 --> 02:04:18.360 align:start position:0%
quite a jump in expense for our office
 
02:04:19.790 --> 02:04:19.800 align:start position:0%
and being a small office with a small
 
02:04:22.370 --> 02:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
budget that that leaves us very minimal
 
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
options of where to pull that money from
 
02:04:28.370 --> 02:04:28.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:28.380 --> 02:04:29.209 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:04:29.209 --> 02:04:29.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:31.790 --> 02:04:31.800 align:start position:0%
so representative Hewitt do you have any
 
02:04:37.430 --> 02:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:41.570 --> 02:04:41.580 align:start position:0%
not actual not actual suggestions but
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
um perhaps you could Enlighten us to
 
02:04:45.729 --> 02:04:45.739 align:start position:0%
send us something
 
02:04:47.510 --> 02:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
pertaining to
 
02:04:49.609 --> 02:04:49.619 align:start position:0%
the fact that you had to you had to
 
02:04:51.950 --> 02:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
reduce a lot of stuff that you wanted in
 
02:04:54.350 --> 02:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
your budget because of the expenses
 
02:04:58.450 --> 02:04:58.460 align:start position:0%
uh could you prioritize for us anything
 
02:05:01.129 --> 02:05:01.139 align:start position:0%
among the things that you cut
 
02:05:05.629 --> 02:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
anything that you feel is very important
 
02:05:08.990 --> 02:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
as far as the the work that you do so
 
02:05:11.209 --> 02:05:11.219 align:start position:0%
that we can assess what the difference
 
02:05:14.089 --> 02:05:14.099 align:start position:0%
is and and perhaps to save you some
 
02:05:14.099 --> 02:05:15.410 align:start position:0%
is and and perhaps to save you some
money

02:05:15.410 --> 02:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:05:17.390 --> 02:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely I can send you something for
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
that thank you and we are we are hoping
 
02:05:22.970 --> 02:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
to seek out currently our office is 100
 
02:05:25.790 --> 02:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
General funds funded so we are seeking
 
02:05:27.709 --> 02:05:27.719 align:start position:0%
looking to seek out some additional
 
02:05:29.209 --> 02:05:29.219 align:start position:0%
options but being a very young office
 
02:05:30.830 --> 02:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
we're really working to establish the
 
02:05:32.530 --> 02:05:32.540 align:start position:0%
office first before we can seek out
 
02:05:34.850 --> 02:05:34.860 align:start position:0%
additional funding streams for the
 
02:05:37.310 --> 02:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
office to um to ensure that we can
 
02:05:39.169 --> 02:05:39.179 align:start position:0%
establish some of this without having to
 
02:05:41.209 --> 02:05:41.219 align:start position:0%
use just 100 General funds but we
 
02:05:42.350 --> 02:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
understand that that is going to take
 
02:05:44.990 --> 02:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
some time so we don't we do not believe
 
02:05:46.189 --> 02:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
that that's going to be able to affect
 
02:05:50.030 --> 02:05:50.040 align:start position:0%
the 2425 budget but we hope for the
 
02:05:52.370 --> 02:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
next budget after that to include some
 
02:05:53.870 --> 02:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
other funding opportunities for our
 
02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:57.169 align:start position:0%
other funding opportunities for our
office

02:05:57.169 --> 02:05:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:59.089 --> 02:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
maybe the commissioner and his staff
 
02:06:01.490 --> 02:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
might be able to help you with perhaps
 
02:06:04.970 --> 02:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
seeking some assistance from somewhere I
 
02:06:06.770 --> 02:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
know Charlie and staff are very good
 
02:06:09.890 --> 02:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
about finding funds and making things
 
02:06:12.290 --> 02:06:12.300 align:start position:0%
work and certainly doesn't make a lot of
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
sense to zero out your line for training
 
02:06:17.770 --> 02:06:17.780 align:start position:0%
or travel basically
 
02:06:22.189 --> 02:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
I know you need doit assistance but you
 
02:06:25.070 --> 02:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
also need to be updated on training and
 
02:06:28.850 --> 02:06:28.860 align:start position:0%
so we'll get that to Melissa Mr Hoffman
 
02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
we'll see what we can do I think there
 
02:06:34.129 --> 02:06:34.139 align:start position:0%
is some support for helping you a little
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
bit but again we don't know the final
 
02:06:37.970 --> 02:06:37.980 align:start position:0%
numbers yet so
 
02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:39.649 align:start position:0%
numbers yet so
I

02:06:39.649 --> 02:06:39.659 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:06:41.510 --> 02:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
I don't see a need of you coming back
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
but again we might get a call and from
 
02:06:45.950 --> 02:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
either Melissa or Mr Hoffman absolutely
 
02:06:47.810 --> 02:06:47.820 align:start position:0%
happy to do so if needed thank you very
 
02:06:49.430 --> 02:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
much and I will make sure that I can get
 
02:06:50.689 --> 02:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
that together and send that to you as
 
02:06:53.149 --> 02:06:53.159 align:start position:0%
soon as possible thanks thank you very
 
02:06:53.159 --> 02:06:54.290 align:start position:0%
soon as possible thanks thank you very
much

02:06:54.290 --> 02:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:06:56.270 --> 02:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
we're running way behind schedule
 
02:06:58.490 --> 02:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
because everyone's provided so much good
 
02:06:58.500 --> 02:07:04.910 align:start position:0%
because everyone's provided so much good
information

02:07:04.910 --> 02:07:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:07.129 --> 02:07:07.139 align:start position:0%
so we have the advocate for special
 
02:07:13.550 --> 02:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:15.830 --> 02:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm the advocate for special
 
02:07:19.129 --> 02:07:19.139 align:start position:0%
education so again I'm curious why this
 
02:07:20.470 --> 02:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
is with you
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Reagan is why Senator Reagan is
 
02:07:25.430 --> 02:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
why Senator Reagan sponsored to build a
 
02:07:26.930 --> 02:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
Creighton advocate for special education
 
02:07:30.050 --> 02:07:30.060 align:start position:0%
and one day he walked into my office and
 
02:07:30.060 --> 02:07:31.609 align:start position:0%
and one day he walked into my office and
said

02:07:31.609 --> 02:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:07:34.970 --> 02:07:34.980 align:start position:0%
he said to Don is he here and I said you
 
02:07:37.370 --> 02:07:37.380 align:start position:0%
know Senator Reagan and uh she's like oh
 
02:07:38.689 --> 02:07:38.699 align:start position:0%
yeah he's right there and he goes and he
 
02:07:40.370 --> 02:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
goes so I have this bill I'm attaching
 
02:07:43.010 --> 02:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
it to you and I said okay
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
02:07:45.649 --> 02:07:45.659 align:start position:0%
um I think he wanted it to touch
 
02:07:47.149 --> 02:07:47.159 align:start position:0%
somewhere and he went you know childhood
 
02:07:48.709 --> 02:07:48.719 align:start position:0%
Advocates attached to you so we'll do
 
02:07:48.719 --> 02:07:49.850 align:start position:0%
Advocates attached to you so we'll do
that

02:07:49.850 --> 02:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:51.350 --> 02:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
um there's a placeholder budget here
 
02:07:53.209 --> 02:07:53.219 align:start position:0%
it's in gets commensurate with the
 
02:07:56.030 --> 02:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that was passed in 2023.
 
02:07:59.629 --> 02:07:59.639 align:start position:0%
um if an advocate is picked before 2023
 
02:08:01.609 --> 02:08:01.619 align:start position:0%
there is a there's a bill that
 
02:08:03.229 --> 02:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
authorizes funds not otherwise
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
appropriated Etc
 
02:08:07.490 --> 02:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
um I don't have any clue where that
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
stands I had heard two months ago that
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
they were close
 
02:08:14.450 --> 02:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
and but that's you know rumor on the
 
02:08:15.709 --> 02:08:15.719 align:start position:0%
street I heard they're going to pick a
 
02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
they might nominate a special education
 
02:08:18.830 --> 02:08:18.840 align:start position:0%
Advocate soon
 
02:08:21.290 --> 02:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
and so that's all I know when they do
 
02:08:24.250 --> 02:08:24.260 align:start position:0%
that we will work with that person on
 
02:08:26.629 --> 02:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
learning you know when you're a new
 
02:08:29.390 --> 02:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
agency and you start I mean you know God
 
02:08:31.609 --> 02:08:31.619 align:start position:0%
helped that person right
 
02:08:33.709 --> 02:08:33.719 align:start position:0%
um I gotta start but it's about so it's
 
02:08:35.450 --> 02:08:35.460 align:start position:0%
about 350 000 a little bit more than
 
02:08:38.030 --> 02:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
that and um and that's what the
 
02:08:40.189 --> 02:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
legislation said so I think it the the
 
02:08:42.890 --> 02:08:42.900 align:start position:0%
budget contemplates about two people
 
02:08:46.370 --> 02:08:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:48.770 --> 02:08:48.780 align:start position:0%
question yes well these people will
 
02:08:52.189 --> 02:08:52.199 align:start position:0%
start with two you see what happens so
 
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner I see that the budget
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh there's nothing of course that was
 
02:09:01.490 --> 02:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
authorized for 22 and 23 but again I
 
02:09:04.990 --> 02:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
looking at the justification for the
 
02:09:09.109 --> 02:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
359 thousand dollars in this budget when
 
02:09:12.290 --> 02:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
I guess nobody is there and
 
02:09:14.450 --> 02:09:14.460 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
so the bill passed quite some time ago
 
02:09:19.490 --> 02:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
and and in the bill for the but it
 
02:09:22.910 --> 02:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
passed off budget right and so in the in
 
02:09:25.010 --> 02:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
the legislation that created it they
 
02:09:28.790 --> 02:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
they suggested a a budget of about 350
 
02:09:30.290 --> 02:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
000 dollars
 
02:09:32.810 --> 02:09:32.820 align:start position:0%
um for that and so let's say an advocate
 
02:09:34.149 --> 02:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
had been picked
 
02:09:38.750 --> 02:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
in uh like three weeks or six months ago
 
02:09:41.209 --> 02:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
they would have been able to go to the
 
02:09:43.370 --> 02:09:43.380 align:start position:0%
funds nonetheless appropriated for about
 
02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
350 000 and we'd have done it through
 
02:09:49.669 --> 02:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
something with boa I don't remember
 
02:09:52.250 --> 02:09:52.260 align:start position:0%
exactly but Cherry would call somebody
 
02:09:54.290 --> 02:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
upstairs and they would do a budget and
 
02:09:56.450 --> 02:09:56.460 align:start position:0%
so we basically said Okay if that budget
 
02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
had happened and they had had somebody
 
02:10:00.649 --> 02:10:00.659 align:start position:0%
this is what it would be and so that's
 
02:10:02.270 --> 02:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
their Baseline
 
02:10:08.290 --> 02:10:08.300 align:start position:0%
so right now no person no office and
 
02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
350 000 plus or minus in general funds
 
02:10:13.490 --> 02:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
what I what I really think will happen
 
02:10:15.370 --> 02:10:15.380 align:start position:0%
is that in one of the next two or three
 
02:10:17.450 --> 02:10:17.460 align:start position:0%
executive Council meetings the governor
 
02:10:19.910 --> 02:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
will nominate an advocate because I I
 
02:10:21.649 --> 02:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
know there was a committee established
 
02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
and they took resumes and they were
 
02:10:24.350 --> 02:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
looking at people
 
02:10:26.510 --> 02:10:26.520 align:start position:0%
so they'll pick somebody then when that
 
02:10:28.370 --> 02:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
person is picked
 
02:10:30.410 --> 02:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
um you know on that Wednesday I'll go
 
02:10:31.609 --> 02:10:31.619 align:start position:0%
over and see them and say hey
 
02:10:31.619 --> 02:10:33.770 align:start position:0%
over and see them and say hey
congratulations

02:10:33.770 --> 02:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
congratulations
 
02:10:34.910 --> 02:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
um here's what we're going to do now and
 
02:10:36.589 --> 02:10:36.599 align:start position:0%
we'll find office space for them and it
 
02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
depends when they get picked where they
 
02:10:39.290 --> 02:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
might go
 
02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:41.940 align:start position:0%
did you folks flag that for us keep that
 
02:10:43.810 --> 02:10:43.820 align:start position:0%
in front of us
 
02:10:45.890 --> 02:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I think is a
 
02:10:47.870 --> 02:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
question yes so you heard the child
 
02:10:49.550 --> 02:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
advocate yes
 
02:10:53.930 --> 02:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
I did most of it all right so to me that
 
02:10:57.350 --> 02:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
sounds very duplicative with this HHS
 
02:10:57.360 --> 02:10:58.430 align:start position:0%
sounds very duplicative with this HHS
ombudsman

02:10:58.430 --> 02:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
ombudsman
 
02:11:02.950 --> 02:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
in this case is there a special ed
 
02:11:06.649 --> 02:11:06.659 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman at Department of Education to
 
02:11:09.290 --> 02:11:09.300 align:start position:0%
handle complaints or not
 
02:11:11.209 --> 02:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
it's a really good question I don't know
 
02:11:13.609 --> 02:11:13.619 align:start position:0%
I know that there are external agencies
 
02:11:16.070 --> 02:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
where you know let's just say you have a
 
02:11:19.129 --> 02:11:19.139 align:start position:0%
a child in the system uh who has a IEP
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
or something there are places you can go
 
02:11:23.330 --> 02:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
I don't know if the department has I'm
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
sure the department has something
 
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:11:29.570 --> 02:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
I was not privy to the debates on the
 
02:11:31.310 --> 02:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
passage of the bill
 
02:11:33.770 --> 02:11:33.780 align:start position:0%
when it passed a year and a half ago so
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
I don't really know what the
 
02:11:38.689 --> 02:11:38.699 align:start position:0%
um what they think
 
02:11:40.729 --> 02:11:40.739 align:start position:0%
the problem you should talk to education
 
02:11:42.290 --> 02:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
about it though I would definitely this
 
02:11:45.109 --> 02:11:45.119 align:start position:0%
is the problem I'm having I think the
 
02:11:46.669 --> 02:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
previous one should be in division three
 
02:11:48.109 --> 02:11:48.119 align:start position:0%
and I think this one should be in
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
division two and they can they can see
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
if there's duplication between these
 
02:11:56.750 --> 02:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
different departments right so you know
 
02:11:59.570 --> 02:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
it's only here because somehow it's part
 
02:12:02.450 --> 02:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
of you but this is not really part of
 
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
you yeah okay no it's not really part of
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:09.410 --> 02:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
all right thanks I think you have great
 
02:12:09.420 --> 02:12:11.270 align:start position:0%
all right thanks I think you have great
instincts

02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
instincts
 
02:12:13.970 --> 02:12:13.980 align:start position:0%
representative hot I mean sorry uh Mr
 
02:12:13.980 --> 02:12:21.950 align:start position:0%
representative hot I mean sorry uh Mr
Hoffman

02:12:21.950 --> 02:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:24.129 --> 02:12:24.139 align:start position:0%
small organizations
 
02:12:26.689 --> 02:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
the housing appeals board we've got
 
02:12:30.350 --> 02:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:36.729 --> 02:12:36.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
I can talk about land stewardship
 
02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:42.229 align:start position:0%
I can talk about land stewardship
definitely

02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
02:12:44.270 --> 02:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
conservation land stewardship when OSI
 
02:12:46.850 --> 02:12:46.860 align:start position:0%
was broken up what used to be oep was
 
02:12:49.129 --> 02:12:49.139 align:start position:0%
broken up the energy stuff went to
 
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
energy the planning stuff went to
 
02:12:55.850 --> 02:12:55.860 align:start position:0%
Bea I think and there were two leftovers
 
02:12:58.189 --> 02:12:58.199 align:start position:0%
and it's two two very nice people Steve
 
02:13:01.069 --> 02:13:01.079 align:start position:0%
Walker and
 
02:13:03.169 --> 02:13:03.179 align:start position:0%
Charlotte thank you
 
02:13:05.870 --> 02:13:05.880 align:start position:0%
and um and Charlotte who go out and they
 
02:13:08.450 --> 02:13:08.460 align:start position:0%
inspect land it's when when elsip not
 
02:13:11.030 --> 02:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
l-chip but elsip was created under Judd
 
02:13:12.890 --> 02:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
Gregg and we bought a bunch of land
 
02:13:16.069 --> 02:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a trust that is
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
related to walking the land I actually
 
02:13:21.530 --> 02:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
walked the land one day something I did
 
02:13:23.450 --> 02:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
um but um and they go out and inspect
 
02:13:24.950 --> 02:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
and and that's where that money comes
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
from they also administer some
 
02:13:29.990 --> 02:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
properties that are held in trust by
 
02:13:32.810 --> 02:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
I believe fish and game and dncr it's an
 
02:13:35.209 --> 02:13:35.219 align:start position:0%
office of two people they got a room in
 
02:13:37.729 --> 02:13:37.739 align:start position:0%
Johnson Hall which is you know one of
 
02:13:40.370 --> 02:13:40.380 align:start position:0%
our buildings that's kind of a dump and
 
02:13:40.380 --> 02:13:41.270 align:start position:0%
our buildings that's kind of a dump and
um

02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:43.250 --> 02:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
and it's I don't mean in a mean way but
 
02:13:45.290 --> 02:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
you know it's not one of our
 
02:13:47.750 --> 02:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
pristine buildings
 
02:13:50.390 --> 02:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
um and they they uh they go out and they
 
02:13:51.950 --> 02:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
do land inspection and they do a good
 
02:13:58.910 --> 02:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
I believe that somebody's here from
 
02:14:05.149 --> 02:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:05.159 --> 02:14:06.250 align:start position:0%
 
S

02:14:06.250 --> 02:14:06.260 align:start position:0%
S
 
02:14:09.709 --> 02:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
I believe in housing and appealing about
 
02:14:09.719 --> 02:14:19.149 align:start position:0%
I believe in housing and appealing about
that

02:14:19.149 --> 02:14:19.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:21.830 --> 02:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
state your name and if it's difficult to
 
02:14:24.530 --> 02:14:24.540 align:start position:0%
spell for a clerk well I certainly will
 
02:14:27.169 --> 02:14:27.179 align:start position:0%
my name's Elizabeth Fisher it's
 
02:14:27.179 --> 02:14:29.390 align:start position:0%
my name's Elizabeth Fisher it's
f-i-s-c-h-e-r

02:14:29.390 --> 02:14:29.400 align:start position:0%
f-i-s-c-h-e-r
 
02:14:31.930 --> 02:14:31.940 align:start position:0%
and I'm here with Elizabeth Menard
 
02:14:36.169 --> 02:14:36.179 align:start position:0%
and Elizabeth Menard is the clerk of the
 
02:14:38.450 --> 02:14:38.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire housing appeals board and
 
02:14:39.890 --> 02:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
I am the chair of the New Hampshire
 
02:14:42.050 --> 02:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board there are two
 
02:14:44.569 --> 02:14:44.579 align:start position:0%
other individuals within our agency
 
02:14:46.870 --> 02:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
one is attorney Michael class
 
02:14:49.970 --> 02:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
and the other one is a gentleman by the
 
02:14:52.910 --> 02:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
name of Edward Rogers who is a licensed
 
02:14:55.069 --> 02:14:55.079 align:start position:0%
land surveyor and
 
02:14:56.810 --> 02:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
um engineer
 
02:15:00.430 --> 02:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
we're a small agency that was formed
 
02:15:04.510 --> 02:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
about two and a half three years ago
 
02:15:08.330 --> 02:15:08.340 align:start position:0%
we just finished our second anniversary
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
of being in existence it took us a
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
couple of months to get set up we're in
 
02:15:17.870 --> 02:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
Johnson Hall and we actually kind of
 
02:15:19.550 --> 02:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
like it there
 
02:15:21.290 --> 02:15:21.300 align:start position:0%
um it's coming to us plenty of parking I
 
02:15:23.149 --> 02:15:23.159 align:start position:0%
guess that's one of the benefits of the
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
of being over there and our job is to
 
02:15:29.209 --> 02:15:29.219 align:start position:0%
adjudicate disputes between property
 
02:15:33.410 --> 02:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
owners and towns and cities with regards
 
02:15:37.129 --> 02:15:37.139 align:start position:0%
to housing matters for zoning boards
 
02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
planning boards historic district
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
commissions any of the other any of the
 
02:15:43.910 --> 02:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
agencies or organizations and Boards
 
02:15:47.450 --> 02:15:47.460 align:start position:0%
within cities and towns that manage land
 
02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:49.310 align:start position:0%
within cities and towns that manage land
use

02:15:49.310 --> 02:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
use
 
02:15:52.729 --> 02:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
um we are a parallel organization to
 
02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and have all of the
 
02:15:59.149 --> 02:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
authority that Superior Court has
 
02:15:59.159 --> 02:16:00.050 align:start position:0%
authority that Superior Court has
um

02:16:00.050 --> 02:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:02.330 --> 02:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
except that we just deal with housing
 
02:16:05.209 --> 02:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
issues and the legislature saw I guess
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
the wisdom in forming this board because
 
02:16:12.169 --> 02:16:12.179 align:start position:0%
there were projects that were really
 
02:16:14.109 --> 02:16:14.119 align:start position:0%
maybe should have seen the light of day
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
but could not get through the court
 
02:16:19.790 --> 02:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
system the regular superior court system
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh in a timely manner and it was
 
02:16:24.830 --> 02:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
impacting the ability for not only
 
02:16:26.890 --> 02:16:26.900 align:start position:0%
Property Owners to
 
02:16:30.410 --> 02:16:30.420 align:start position:0%
develop their property but also
 
02:16:34.610 --> 02:16:34.620 align:start position:0%
um was impacting cities and towns to be
 
02:16:39.650 --> 02:16:39.660 align:start position:0%
able to plan and and develop properties
 
02:16:42.770 --> 02:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
that they'd like to to develop because
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
of the delays through the court system
 
02:16:48.169 --> 02:16:48.179 align:start position:0%
so there's three of us we come with
 
02:16:51.770 --> 02:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
specific expertise which I think is very
 
02:16:54.169 --> 02:16:54.179 align:start position:0%
very helpful in these particular cases I
 
02:16:56.770 --> 02:16:56.780 align:start position:0%
want to direct you towards our website
 
02:17:01.070 --> 02:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
which all of our orders are posted are
 
02:17:03.770 --> 02:17:03.780 align:start position:0%
decisions are posted and
 
02:17:03.780 --> 02:17:05.150 align:start position:0%
decisions are posted and
um

02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:08.030 --> 02:17:08.040 align:start position:0%
we do that unlike Superior Court who
 
02:17:10.310 --> 02:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't do it we do that for a couple of
 
02:17:11.570 --> 02:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
reasons we want to do it for
 
02:17:14.089 --> 02:17:14.099 align:start position:0%
transparency we want the cities and
 
02:17:15.790 --> 02:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
towns and the applicants to understand
 
02:17:18.770 --> 02:17:18.780 align:start position:0%
the nuances not only of those particular
 
02:17:22.810 --> 02:17:22.820 align:start position:0%
cases but also of land use law and
 
02:17:26.030 --> 02:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
processes within the state and I think
 
02:17:28.129 --> 02:17:28.139 align:start position:0%
it's worked out pretty well from the
 
02:17:30.589 --> 02:17:30.599 align:start position:0%
standpoint of people clearly understand
 
02:17:33.770 --> 02:17:33.780 align:start position:0%
what it is that we have decided and how
 
02:17:36.650 --> 02:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
we've come to the decision we are not a
 
02:17:38.209 --> 02:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
super zoning board we're not a super
 
02:17:40.669 --> 02:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
planning board we basically take What's
 
02:17:43.910 --> 02:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
called the certified record and we take
 
02:17:47.089 --> 02:17:47.099 align:start position:0%
a look at it and we have the individuals
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
the the applicant as well as the
 
02:17:51.889 --> 02:17:51.899 align:start position:0%
defendant which in some cases is the the
 
02:17:53.870 --> 02:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
city or the town or most cases the city
 
02:17:57.709 --> 02:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
and town and we go through the entire
 
02:18:00.830 --> 02:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
case and in some cases it shows up in a
 
02:18:02.690 --> 02:18:02.700 align:start position:0%
one-inch binder and other times
 
02:18:06.830 --> 02:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth has hauled up back boxes of
 
02:18:09.169 --> 02:18:09.179 align:start position:0%
documents that have been tied to
 
02:18:10.849 --> 02:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
particular cases depending on how
 
02:18:13.549 --> 02:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
complex they are and we look at that and
 
02:18:16.910 --> 02:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
we say did the city in town follow the
 
02:18:18.889 --> 02:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
right regulations
 
02:18:21.889 --> 02:18:21.899 align:start position:0%
uh did the developer
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
um prove their case or whatever their
 
02:18:27.410 --> 02:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
issue was and I wanted to also mention
 
02:18:29.389 --> 02:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
that it's not always a developer that's
 
02:18:31.730 --> 02:18:31.740 align:start position:0%
before us in many cases I was looking at
 
02:18:33.530 --> 02:18:33.540 align:start position:0%
some of our stats and in many cases
 
02:18:35.389 --> 02:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
these are one-off Property Owners
 
02:18:38.150 --> 02:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
they're trying to do an extension of
 
02:18:39.650 --> 02:18:39.660 align:start position:0%
their house they want to put a garage on
 
02:18:42.230 --> 02:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
they want to do an Adu which is a a
 
02:18:45.230 --> 02:18:45.240 align:start position:0%
granny flat or a ancillary
 
02:18:49.190 --> 02:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
um rental unit and for whatever the
 
02:18:51.530 --> 02:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
reason is either the community doesn't
 
02:18:55.310 --> 02:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
have the regulations in place in order
 
02:18:58.270 --> 02:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
to do that or there may be some other
 
02:19:01.370 --> 02:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
objections and so the thing doesn't end
 
02:19:04.310 --> 02:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
up maybe being dealt with properly
 
02:19:06.349 --> 02:19:06.359 align:start position:0%
within the city and towns because it's a
 
02:19:08.110 --> 02:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
pretty odd issue
 
02:19:12.530 --> 02:19:12.540 align:start position:0%
so you know I think I'm biased but I
 
02:19:15.650 --> 02:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
think that this housing appeals board is
 
02:19:19.070 --> 02:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
a tool that is available to the citizens
 
02:19:21.889 --> 02:19:21.899 align:start position:0%
of the State of New Hampshire to try and
 
02:19:25.849 --> 02:19:25.859 align:start position:0%
work through the um
 
02:19:29.570 --> 02:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
issues around Land Development in their
 
02:19:29.580 --> 02:19:32.450 align:start position:0%
issues around Land Development in their
communities

02:19:32.450 --> 02:19:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:35.209 --> 02:19:35.219 align:start position:0%
it's worked out fairly well
 
02:19:35.219 --> 02:19:36.469 align:start position:0%
it's worked out fairly well
um

02:19:36.469 --> 02:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:39.070 --> 02:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
we have two hearings this afternoon
 
02:19:42.830 --> 02:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
in which we will uh talk to the for
 
02:19:46.129 --> 02:19:46.139 align:start position:0%
listen to uh individuals with regards to
 
02:19:48.230 --> 02:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
whatever their particular case is so
 
02:19:49.849 --> 02:19:49.859 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire has a question
 
02:19:51.530 --> 02:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much Mr chairman
 
02:19:52.730 --> 02:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
02:19:55.849 --> 02:19:55.859 align:start position:0%
give us some numbers how many cases a
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
year what's your filing fee how many
 
02:20:01.310 --> 02:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
gets settled before you even see them
 
02:20:03.410 --> 02:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
that that kind of stuff well first I
 
02:20:05.630 --> 02:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
have to thank Elizabeth because I asked
 
02:20:07.310 --> 02:20:07.320 align:start position:0%
her in preparation for today's meeting
 
02:20:10.010 --> 02:20:10.020 align:start position:0%
to go through our tracker and and
 
02:20:12.290 --> 02:20:12.300 align:start position:0%
identify those since we've been opened
 
02:20:15.050 --> 02:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
we've had 65 cases
 
02:20:18.410 --> 02:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
in two years so these are lawsuits that
 
02:20:21.590 --> 02:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
have been filed by applicants or a
 
02:20:26.210 --> 02:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
Butters or whoever okay of that 11 cases
 
02:20:29.090 --> 02:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
were either withdrawn or were settled
 
02:20:32.570 --> 02:20:32.580 align:start position:0%
and I'm always pleased when one is
 
02:20:34.130 --> 02:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
withdrawn now it may be that we've
 
02:20:35.690 --> 02:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
already gone through the entire process
 
02:20:37.130 --> 02:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
and we've had the hearing and we're
 
02:20:38.750 --> 02:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
going to deliberate and make a decision
 
02:20:41.870 --> 02:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
but then cooler heads have prevailed and
 
02:20:44.690 --> 02:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
in the community they have recognized
 
02:20:46.969 --> 02:20:46.979 align:start position:0%
that maybe they need to sit down and
 
02:20:49.309 --> 02:20:49.319 align:start position:0%
talk to the individual that's suing them
 
02:20:52.070 --> 02:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
to see if you can find a solution to
 
02:20:54.230 --> 02:20:54.240 align:start position:0%
that within the community so I'm always
 
02:20:56.450 --> 02:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
pleased when that happens and we've had
 
02:20:58.730 --> 02:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
that happening a couple of times and
 
02:21:01.910 --> 02:21:01.920 align:start position:0%
anecdotally have found that it is either
 
02:21:04.309 --> 02:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
based on some of the previous work that
 
02:21:05.870 --> 02:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
we've done and people have now
 
02:21:07.670 --> 02:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
understood what their responsibilities
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
were and in some cases
 
02:21:13.190 --> 02:21:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's just been settled and that's the
 
02:21:14.929 --> 02:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
best place for these kinds of issues to
 
02:21:17.389 --> 02:21:17.399 align:start position:0%
be to be handled is within the
 
02:21:19.570 --> 02:21:19.580 align:start position:0%
individual communities
 
02:21:22.610 --> 02:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
eight of those were appealed to the
 
02:21:24.469 --> 02:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
02:21:27.770 --> 02:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh three of them have been heard by the
 
02:21:29.809 --> 02:21:29.819 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and they affirmed that we
 
02:21:32.210 --> 02:21:32.220 align:start position:0%
got it right and so we were very pleased
 
02:21:33.889 --> 02:21:33.899 align:start position:0%
about that
 
02:21:35.570 --> 02:21:35.580 align:start position:0%
um I believe that there's two or three
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
that are in the process
 
02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
um and then in March there'll be three
 
02:21:42.650 --> 02:21:42.660 align:start position:0%
more that will go to have their original
 
02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
hearings the challenge is if if either
 
02:21:48.650 --> 02:21:48.660 align:start position:0%
party doesn't like the decision that
 
02:21:50.990 --> 02:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
we've made within 30 days they have to
 
02:21:53.150 --> 02:21:53.160 align:start position:0%
do a motion for reconsideration
 
02:21:57.290 --> 02:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
and we may agree or not agree that it
 
02:21:58.849 --> 02:21:58.859 align:start position:0%
should be reconsidered more often than
 
02:22:00.469 --> 02:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
not we don't because we spend a lot of
 
02:22:02.030 --> 02:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
time trying to make the original
 
02:22:02.040 --> 02:22:03.590 align:start position:0%
time trying to make the original
decision

02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:22:05.389 --> 02:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
that preserves their right to go to the
 
02:22:07.190 --> 02:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and of that eight people
 
02:22:10.130 --> 02:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
have eight eight cases have gone up the
 
02:22:12.410 --> 02:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
challenge is that then they get in the
 
02:22:14.870 --> 02:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
queue and it's often a year before it
 
02:22:16.389 --> 02:22:16.399 align:start position:0%
gets resolved
 
02:22:18.950 --> 02:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they're larger projects
 
02:22:21.710 --> 02:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
and sometimes they're the one-offs that
 
02:22:25.550 --> 02:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
folks uh you know want to want to appeal
 
02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:26.630 align:start position:0%
folks uh you know want to want to appeal
um

02:22:26.630 --> 02:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:28.130 --> 02:22:28.140 align:start position:0%
so we're pleased that three have been
 
02:22:29.750 --> 02:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
affirmed we're hoping that the rest of
 
02:22:31.250 --> 02:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
them are
 
02:22:31.260 --> 02:22:32.150 align:start position:0%
them are
um

02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:34.250 --> 02:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
02:22:34.260 --> 02:22:35.349 align:start position:0%
let's see
um

02:22:35.349 --> 02:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:40.130 --> 02:22:40.140 align:start position:0%
calculating around 1500 units have been
 
02:22:44.570 --> 02:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
in play with these 65 cases and I
 
02:22:45.770 --> 02:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
thought it was interesting when I did
 
02:22:48.349 --> 02:22:48.359 align:start position:0%
look at the case tracker that
 
02:22:49.969 --> 02:22:49.979 align:start position:0%
um you would think that there were a lot
 
02:22:53.389 --> 02:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
of big projects and they're not I would
 
02:22:56.630 --> 02:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
say a lot awful lot of our our cases our
 
02:22:59.150 --> 02:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
smaller projects in in some cases two or
 
02:23:00.490 --> 02:23:00.500 align:start position:0%
three units
 
02:23:03.110 --> 02:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
or one unit
 
02:23:06.410 --> 02:23:06.420 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of an interesting piece
 
02:23:06.420 --> 02:23:08.330 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of an interesting piece
um

02:23:08.330 --> 02:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:10.730 --> 02:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
cost 250 dollars
 
02:23:12.790 --> 02:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
to come to us
 
02:23:18.349 --> 02:23:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:21.530 --> 02:23:21.540 align:start position:0%
we've had I believe two or three cases
 
02:23:23.150 --> 02:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
that have come pro se
 
02:23:27.790 --> 02:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
the majority of them do seek counsel
 
02:23:30.710 --> 02:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
and bring counsel to it and so obviously
 
02:23:33.230 --> 02:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
if the applicant has their expense in
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
the city and town has their expense 99
 
02:23:38.870 --> 02:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
of the time the cities and towns have
 
02:23:42.230 --> 02:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
their legal counsel represent them
 
02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:42.950 align:start position:0%
their legal counsel represent them
um

02:23:42.950 --> 02:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
our process is very efficient from the
 
02:23:50.469 --> 02:23:50.479 align:start position:0%
standpoint of you file a case tomorrow
 
02:23:50.479 --> 02:23:52.370 align:start position:0%
standpoint of you file a case tomorrow
within

02:23:52.370 --> 02:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
within
 
02:23:54.590 --> 02:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
um and then Elizabeth will send a notice
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
out to the city of town that says
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
greetings from the housing appeals board
 
02:24:01.370 --> 02:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
you've been sued and within 30 days they
 
02:24:03.830 --> 02:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
need to give us a certified record all
 
02:24:07.010 --> 02:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
right and then within uh 90 days from
 
02:24:10.070 --> 02:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
the beginning of that process we have to
 
02:24:11.630 --> 02:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
hold a hearing
 
02:24:13.730 --> 02:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple of things that
 
02:24:15.790 --> 02:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
happen in the meantime
 
02:24:18.650 --> 02:24:18.660 align:start position:0%
people will provide additional
 
02:24:21.110 --> 02:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
documentation and then we have the
 
02:24:23.270 --> 02:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
hearing and then within 60 days
 
02:24:25.130 --> 02:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
following that we have to issue a
 
02:24:28.010 --> 02:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
decision now sometimes that is altered a
 
02:24:29.710 --> 02:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
02:24:33.530 --> 02:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
from the standpoint of if there is
 
02:24:37.790 --> 02:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
additional information yeah just I just
 
02:24:39.070 --> 02:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
want to
 
02:24:41.809 --> 02:24:41.819 align:start position:0%
slow you down a little bit so
 
02:24:44.630 --> 02:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
um we have another bill to add a judge
 
02:24:48.010 --> 02:24:48.020 align:start position:0%
in this area to to Superior Court
 
02:24:52.370 --> 02:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
okay so 65 cases doesn't sound like so
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
has it been 30 and 30 or is it roughly
 
02:24:57.290 --> 02:24:57.300 align:start position:0%
roughly okay so it's not that nobody
 
02:24:58.969 --> 02:24:58.979 align:start position:0%
knew about you the first year and now
 
02:25:00.889 --> 02:25:00.899 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden there's 50 cases the
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
second year or something like that you
 
02:25:04.670 --> 02:25:04.680 align:start position:0%
know it's interesting the numbers
 
02:25:08.090 --> 02:25:08.100 align:start position:0%
um kind of uh we reached we surpassed
 
02:25:10.190 --> 02:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
our first year
 
02:25:13.070 --> 02:25:13.080 align:start position:0%
uh before the second year ended so I
 
02:25:14.990 --> 02:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
want to say about in November okay I
 
02:25:16.730 --> 02:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
think we matched I understand you're not
 
02:25:18.830 --> 02:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
sure but a little bit but not much okay
 
02:25:21.469 --> 02:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
yeah so let me do you know how many
 
02:25:24.469 --> 02:25:24.479 align:start position:0%
similar cases are going to Superior
 
02:25:26.389 --> 02:25:26.399 align:start position:0%
Court or no we don't know how many
 
02:25:28.370 --> 02:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
similar cases
 
02:25:30.290 --> 02:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
um and part of the challenges is that
 
02:25:32.510 --> 02:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
there's 10 Superior Courts
 
02:25:34.490 --> 02:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
um and so you'd have to go and gather
 
02:25:36.889 --> 02:25:36.899 align:start position:0%
that data from all of those individuals
 
02:25:40.309 --> 02:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
Bureau courts and because it isn't you
 
02:25:42.530 --> 02:25:42.540 align:start position:0%
know specified it's just part of the
 
02:25:44.270 --> 02:25:44.280 align:start position:0%
spirit core docket so you literally have
 
02:25:45.710 --> 02:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
to go through all that so I don't have
 
02:25:47.809 --> 02:25:47.819 align:start position:0%
that information but the main advantage
 
02:25:51.950 --> 02:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
is you are a few months versus could be
 
02:25:54.050 --> 02:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
years it could be a situation
 
02:25:56.690 --> 02:25:56.700 align:start position:0%
anecdotally we've heard that if you were
 
02:25:58.730 --> 02:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
to file a case tomorrow listen to period
 
02:26:00.889 --> 02:26:00.899 align:start position:0%
Court it might be seven months before
 
02:26:04.370 --> 02:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
you uh get a hearing and you may end up
 
02:26:06.889 --> 02:26:06.899 align:start position:0%
with a judge that doesn't have the
 
02:26:09.530 --> 02:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
background with regards to real estate
 
02:26:09.540 --> 02:26:11.090 align:start position:0%
background with regards to real estate
law

02:26:11.090 --> 02:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:26:13.670 --> 02:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
um and that becomes difficult the
 
02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
benefit of the housing appeals board is
 
02:26:17.330 --> 02:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
you've got three individuals that this
 
02:26:19.250 --> 02:26:19.260 align:start position:0%
is our career these are our careers this
 
02:26:20.750 --> 02:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
is what we've always done and this is
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
what we know and so we think that the
 
02:26:25.070 --> 02:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
product that comes out the other end is
 
02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
better but since everybody has attorneys
 
02:26:30.050 --> 02:26:30.060 align:start position:0%
there's there's not much money change
 
02:26:32.990 --> 02:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
difference right the amount of money you
 
02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
would spend going to you versus Superior
 
02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:37.309 align:start position:0%
would spend going to you versus Superior
Court

02:26:37.309 --> 02:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
Court
 
02:26:39.830 --> 02:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
probably about the same you don't know
 
02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
um I can't to answer that question and
 
02:26:41.760 --> 02:26:44.990 align:start position:0%
um I can't to answer that question and
and

02:26:44.990 --> 02:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:49.610 --> 02:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:52.190 --> 02:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
um we we tend to keep our proceedings
 
02:26:53.870 --> 02:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
pretty efficient in that we have a
 
02:26:55.309 --> 02:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
pre-hearing conference that we hold
 
02:26:57.349 --> 02:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
about two weeks prior to our hearing
 
02:26:59.389 --> 02:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
it's our hearing management conference
 
02:27:01.490 --> 02:27:01.500 align:start position:0%
and aside from that everything's
 
02:27:03.650 --> 02:27:03.660 align:start position:0%
primarily correspondence is exchanged
 
02:27:08.889 --> 02:27:08.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:11.150 --> 02:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
so if your attorney's charging by the
 
02:27:12.770 --> 02:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
hour maybe there's fewer hours or
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
something yeah yeah okay all right thank
 
02:27:16.490 --> 02:27:16.500 align:start position:0%
you very much I believe I believe that
 
02:27:18.770 --> 02:27:18.780 align:start position:0%
that they are
 
02:27:21.469 --> 02:27:21.479 align:start position:0%
thought behind the legislation but in
 
02:27:22.610 --> 02:27:22.620 align:start position:0%
all honesty
 
02:27:24.590 --> 02:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
we're busy doing the cases that we're
 
02:27:27.530 --> 02:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
involved with and and haven't calculated
 
02:27:30.530 --> 02:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
that piece of it
 
02:27:32.210 --> 02:27:32.220 align:start position:0%
I think I know where representative
 
02:27:34.190 --> 02:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
McGuire was going because we do have a
 
02:27:36.170 --> 02:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
bill that's before this division as far
 
02:27:38.150 --> 02:27:38.160 align:start position:0%
as the additional Superior Court Judge
 
02:27:41.210 --> 02:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
uh that would specialize in just land
 
02:27:44.090 --> 02:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
cases selling planning cases to try to
 
02:27:46.370 --> 02:27:46.380 align:start position:0%
speed up the process and just kind of
 
02:27:50.270 --> 02:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
like a visual duplication
 
02:27:53.210 --> 02:27:53.220 align:start position:0%
um perhaps with your board if that
 
02:27:55.190 --> 02:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
particular piece of legislation moves
 
02:27:57.650 --> 02:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
forward so you're almost entirely
 
02:28:00.830 --> 02:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
General funded I see based on your uh
 
02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
figures your other funds must be that
 
02:28:06.230 --> 02:28:06.240 align:start position:0%
fee you charge the 250 dollars correct
 
02:28:09.130 --> 02:28:09.140 align:start position:0%
yep and we're familiar with the um
 
02:28:12.469 --> 02:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn's case excuse
 
02:28:14.510 --> 02:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
that he's put forward with regards to
 
02:28:17.690 --> 02:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
the land court and I've said to him and
 
02:28:20.090 --> 02:28:20.100 align:start position:0%
would say to you as well that if there
 
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
was an interest for us to expand Beyond
 
02:28:27.429 --> 02:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
housing and take on these other
 
02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
components commercial
 
02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:30.790 align:start position:0%
components commercial
um

02:28:30.790 --> 02:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
transactions and approvals and those
 
02:28:34.429 --> 02:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
kinds of things then the New Hampshire
 
02:28:36.590 --> 02:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board the have to change
 
02:28:38.929 --> 02:28:38.939 align:start position:0%
the name I guess but um we certainly
 
02:28:41.929 --> 02:28:41.939 align:start position:0%
have the capacity we also have the
 
02:28:41.939 --> 02:28:45.429 align:start position:0%
have the capacity we also have the
expertise

02:28:45.429 --> 02:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:48.650 --> 02:28:48.660 align:start position:0%
are there any further questions on the
 
02:28:50.929 --> 02:28:50.939 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board
 
02:28:55.309 --> 02:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:57.950 --> 02:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
all right so are you happy with the
 
02:29:00.050 --> 02:29:00.060 align:start position:0%
government Governor's recommended budget
 
02:29:02.570 --> 02:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
yeah so we went through
 
02:29:03.950 --> 02:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
um the numbers and there were some
 
02:29:05.750 --> 02:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
adjustments that were made on the
 
02:29:07.790 --> 02:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
governor's budget but we're assuming
 
02:29:10.130 --> 02:29:10.140 align:start position:0%
that the information that
 
02:29:12.469 --> 02:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
um created those adjustments is about a
 
02:29:15.290 --> 02:29:15.300 align:start position:0%
ten thousand dollar reduction in what we
 
02:29:17.389 --> 02:29:17.399 align:start position:0%
had originally requested
 
02:29:18.770 --> 02:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
um we're assuming that those were
 
02:29:22.130 --> 02:29:22.140 align:start position:0%
internal changes with ndoit and within
 
02:29:24.590 --> 02:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
some of the other components because
 
02:29:25.969 --> 02:29:25.979 align:start position:0%
those were the numbers that were
 
02:29:28.790 --> 02:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
originally given by administrative
 
02:29:32.090 --> 02:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
services so as long as it's a not a
 
02:29:33.650 --> 02:29:33.660 align:start position:0%
situation that
 
02:29:35.870 --> 02:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
um the oit is going to be looking for
 
02:29:38.570 --> 02:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
you know additional funds
 
02:29:42.050 --> 02:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
um we're comfortable with it okay we
 
02:29:44.389 --> 02:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
would request that that information you
 
02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:46.800 align:start position:0%
gave us as far as the number of cases
 
02:29:49.010 --> 02:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
your fees like kind of a handout like
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
others have given us that you would
 
02:29:52.730 --> 02:29:52.740 align:start position:0%
forward that to the folks at the LBA and
 
02:29:54.650 --> 02:29:54.660 align:start position:0%
then we can reference it all right in
 
02:29:56.809 --> 02:29:56.819 align:start position:0%
the future happy to do that all right
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
all right thanks so much thank you for
 
02:30:05.210 --> 02:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:10.070 --> 02:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:12.530 --> 02:30:12.540 align:start position:0%
so since the judicial Council can go to
 
02:30:21.530 --> 02:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:25.610 --> 02:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:27.889 --> 02:30:27.899 align:start position:0%
all right I recognize a few characters
 
02:30:40.429 --> 02:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:42.410 --> 02:30:42.420 align:start position:0%
sorry for the delay
 
02:30:42.420 --> 02:30:49.630 align:start position:0%
sorry for the delay
um

02:30:49.630 --> 02:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:52.070 --> 02:30:52.080 align:start position:0%
we'll let everyone get settled and Mr
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
Hoffman the pass out your handout
 
02:31:06.469 --> 02:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:08.690 --> 02:31:08.700 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council for those of you
 
02:31:12.889 --> 02:31:12.899 align:start position:0%
looking at 5 37.
 
02:31:15.230 --> 02:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
I guess I better be on my best behavior
 
02:31:17.809 --> 02:31:17.819 align:start position:0%
now that I see uh Nina Gardner has come
 
02:31:23.690 --> 02:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:26.750 --> 02:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
so if you could introduce yourself and
 
02:31:28.790 --> 02:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
I can't remember if your name is
 
02:31:31.130 --> 02:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
difficult to spell but if it is spell it
 
02:31:33.469 --> 02:31:33.479 align:start position:0%
for our clerk I will do that thank you
 
02:31:35.510 --> 02:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman members of the committee

my name is Richard Sam Peril uh it's
 
02:31:41.450 --> 02:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
spelled s-a-m-d
 
02:31:46.429 --> 02:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
p e r i l I'm the acting executive
 
02:31:48.410 --> 02:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire judicial
 
02:31:48.420 --> 02:31:50.150 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire judicial
Council

02:31:50.150 --> 02:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
Council
 
02:31:50.160 --> 02:31:51.710 align:start position:0%
Council
um

02:31:51.710 --> 02:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
the judicial Council uh is a state
 
02:31:58.370 --> 02:31:58.380 align:start position:0%
agency with three full-time employees
 
02:32:00.889 --> 02:32:00.899 align:start position:0%
the executive director and two staff
 
02:32:03.170 --> 02:32:03.180 align:start position:0%
the council has a number of
 
02:32:05.210 --> 02:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
responsibilities it's charged with
 
02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
overseeing the quality
 
02:32:09.889 --> 02:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
and cost effectiveness of the Indigent
 
02:32:13.250 --> 02:32:13.260 align:start position:0%
defense program training and payment of
 
02:32:15.410 --> 02:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
providers and certain child protection
 
02:32:19.010 --> 02:32:19.020 align:start position:0%
and guardianship cases and engages in
 
02:32:21.790 --> 02:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
Partnerships with non-state agencies
 
02:32:24.410 --> 02:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
entities to provide other legal services
 
02:32:27.710 --> 02:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
to children and to the poor I know that
 
02:32:30.349 --> 02:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
most of you if not all of you are
 
02:32:32.330 --> 02:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
probably very familiar with the agency
 
02:32:35.150 --> 02:32:35.160 align:start position:0%
and what it does but I've included some
 
02:32:37.250 --> 02:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
additional background information on
 
02:32:39.290 --> 02:32:39.300 align:start position:0%
pages two and three of the handout that
 
02:32:42.590 --> 02:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
you've received that would give you some
 
02:32:44.510 --> 02:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
more information or someone who might be
 
02:32:46.670 --> 02:32:46.680 align:start position:0%
new to the committee some background
 
02:32:46.680 --> 02:32:47.929 align:start position:0%
new to the committee some background
here

02:32:47.929 --> 02:32:47.939 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:32:50.170 --> 02:32:50.180 align:start position:0%
the budget before you
 
02:32:53.330 --> 02:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
represents the most significant increase
 
02:32:55.790 --> 02:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
in the council's history
 
02:32:58.670 --> 02:32:58.680 align:start position:0%
an increase which is necessary to
 
02:33:01.130 --> 02:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
address an ongoing Indigent defense
 
02:33:06.110 --> 02:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
crisis the judicial Council has
 
02:33:08.110 --> 02:33:08.120 align:start position:0%
always taken its financial
 
02:33:11.750 --> 02:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility very seriously and it's
 
02:33:15.110 --> 02:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
past budgets I believe reflect this but
 
02:33:17.870 --> 02:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
this is a time when this agency is at a
 
02:33:20.570 --> 02:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
Crossroads and the services it provides
 
02:33:22.969 --> 02:33:22.979 align:start position:0%
are in crisis
 
02:33:25.250 --> 02:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
although funding alone won't resolve
 
02:33:27.650 --> 02:33:27.660 align:start position:0%
these issues it's difficult to see a
 
02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
path forward without that funding
 
02:33:32.630 --> 02:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the requested
 
02:33:35.510 --> 02:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
increase is for court appointed cases in
 
02:33:37.550 --> 02:33:37.560 align:start position:0%
significant part this reflects a long
 
02:33:39.710 --> 02:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
overdue increase in the compensation
 
02:33:41.929 --> 02:33:41.939 align:start position:0%
rate for lawyers who are handling these
 
02:33:45.650 --> 02:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
cases and I'll talk more about that as I
 
02:33:47.929 --> 02:33:47.939 align:start position:0%
proceed but this increase in
 
02:33:50.090 --> 02:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
compensation was necessary to keep
 
02:33:53.710 --> 02:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
lawyers continuing to take these cases
 
02:33:57.170 --> 02:33:57.180 align:start position:0%
and provide the constitutionally and
 
02:33:59.570 --> 02:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
statutorily required services in their
 
02:33:59.580 --> 02:34:01.010 align:start position:0%
statutorily required services in their
representation

02:34:01.010 --> 02:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
representation
 
02:34:03.770 --> 02:34:03.780 align:start position:0%
the council is very appreciative of the
 
02:34:07.090 --> 02:34:07.100 align:start position:0%
support that the governor and his staff
 
02:34:10.969 --> 02:34:10.979 align:start position:0%
have demonstrated in supporting Indigent
 
02:34:13.490 --> 02:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
defense funding as well as the Chief
 
02:34:15.830 --> 02:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Supreme Court and the
 
02:34:18.050 --> 02:34:18.060 align:start position:0%
rest of the Supreme Court in the steps
 
02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
that they've taken in addressing the
 
02:34:24.050 --> 02:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
Indigent defense crisis and some of the
 
02:34:25.790 --> 02:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
articles that you'll see attached to the
 
02:34:29.030 --> 02:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
handout I provided go through in some
 
02:34:31.550 --> 02:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
detail and those are at the end of the
 
02:34:33.770 --> 02:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
attachment those go through in some
 
02:34:36.650 --> 02:34:36.660 align:start position:0%
detail sort of the history of what has
 
02:34:39.230 --> 02:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
happened here in terms of uh Indigent
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
defense funding and the steps that the
 
02:34:44.570 --> 02:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
court has taken to move us towards a
 
02:34:46.309 --> 02:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
better place
 
02:34:48.410 --> 02:34:48.420 align:start position:0%
I'll be talking more about this in
 
02:34:49.849 --> 02:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
detail as we go through the different
 
02:34:52.730 --> 02:34:52.740 align:start position:0%
accounting lines the judicial Council
 
02:34:54.889 --> 02:34:54.899 align:start position:0%
has eight budget lines representing
 
02:34:56.870 --> 02:34:56.880 align:start position:0%
various criminal and civil Legal
 
02:34:59.809 --> 02:34:59.819 align:start position:0%
Services the council has a unique and
 
02:35:02.270 --> 02:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
varied role with each of the individual
 
02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:03.590 align:start position:0%
varied role with each of the individual
programs

02:35:03.590 --> 02:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
programs
 
02:35:06.590 --> 02:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
and as I review the different requests
 
02:35:08.990 --> 02:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
for services I'm happy to take questions
 
02:35:11.270 --> 02:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
I welcome your questions
 
02:35:15.230 --> 02:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
um as I go forward trying to give you
 
02:35:17.929 --> 02:35:17.939 align:start position:0%
the reasoning that has been submitted in
 
02:35:20.389 --> 02:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
support of each of these requests
 
02:35:22.849 --> 02:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
the first one I'd like to talk to you
 
02:35:24.889 --> 02:35:24.899 align:start position:0%
about is the request for additional
 
02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
funding for civil legal services
 
02:35:31.490 --> 02:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
this is Page 541 and 542 of the
 
02:35:33.469 --> 02:35:33.479 align:start position:0%
governor's budget and Page four of the
 
02:35:36.050 --> 02:35:36.060 align:start position:0%
handout that I provided to you
 
02:35:39.170 --> 02:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
the council serves as the pass-through
 
02:35:41.750 --> 02:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
for the state's commitment to civil
 
02:35:44.210 --> 02:35:44.220 align:start position:0%
legal needs of indigent residents
 
02:35:46.730 --> 02:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
through an appropriation through New
 
02:35:49.090 --> 02:35:49.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal assistance
 
02:35:52.130 --> 02:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
additional funding for this would
 
02:35:55.370 --> 02:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
provide funding for New Hampshire legal
 
02:35:57.830 --> 02:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
assistances domestic violence advocacy
 
02:35:57.840 --> 02:35:58.910 align:start position:0%
assistances domestic violence advocacy
project

02:35:58.910 --> 02:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
project
 
02:36:02.330 --> 02:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
the devap was founded over 20 years ago
 
02:36:05.270 --> 02:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
to provide civil legal aid to survivors
 
02:36:07.610 --> 02:36:07.620 align:start position:0%
of domestic violence sexual assault
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
stalking and human trafficking
 
02:36:13.429 --> 02:36:13.439 align:start position:0%
nhla attorneys represent survivors in
 
02:36:15.650 --> 02:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
protective order hearings and related
 
02:36:17.530 --> 02:36:17.540 align:start position:0%
family law matters
 
02:36:20.510 --> 02:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
dbap staff work collaboratively with
 
02:36:23.150 --> 02:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
staff at the domestic violence crisis
 
02:36:25.790 --> 02:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
centers and the majority of the
 
02:36:28.490 --> 02:36:28.500 align:start position:0%
survivors that they are representing are
 
02:36:31.250 --> 02:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
deemed to be high risk individuals
 
02:36:33.730 --> 02:36:33.740 align:start position:0%
people who are in high risk situations
 
02:36:36.469 --> 02:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
that need additional help with
 
02:36:36.479 --> 02:36:37.849 align:start position:0%
that need additional help with
representation

02:36:37.849 --> 02:36:37.859 align:start position:0%
representation
 
02:36:39.950 --> 02:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
they represent clients across the state
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
they can't accept every case with their
 
02:36:46.250 --> 02:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
current Staffing but the focus is again
 
02:36:49.550 --> 02:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
on survivors who are at the highest risk
 
02:36:52.929 --> 02:36:52.939 align:start position:0%
the judicial branches
 
02:36:55.250 --> 02:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
Representatives who are hates to
 
02:36:57.050 --> 02:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
interrupt you but he has a question sure
 
02:36:57.060 --> 02:36:58.130 align:start position:0%
interrupt you but he has a question sure
so

02:36:58.130 --> 02:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:37:01.550 --> 02:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
um why is domestic violence sounds to me
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
to be criminal not civil
 
02:37:06.650 --> 02:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
um so there are certainly domestic
 
02:37:09.290 --> 02:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
violence prosecutions for people who
 
02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
either violate restraining orders or who
 
02:37:14.410 --> 02:37:14.420 align:start position:0%
commit assaults for example uh against
 
02:37:17.690 --> 02:37:17.700 align:start position:0%
domestic Partners or intimate Partners
 
02:37:19.929 --> 02:37:19.939 align:start position:0%
um what we're talking about here are
 
02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
people who want to obtain restraining
 
02:37:26.210 --> 02:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
orders because they're the victims of
 
02:37:28.130 --> 02:37:28.140 align:start position:0%
domestic violence they're survivors of
 
02:37:31.190 --> 02:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
domestic violence before
 
02:37:33.710 --> 02:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
um either some sort of criminal process
 
02:37:36.469 --> 02:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
has taken place or contemporaneous with
 
02:37:41.090 --> 02:37:41.100 align:start position:0%
that process and so while certainly the
 
02:37:43.849 --> 02:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
the criminal representation we'll be
 
02:37:46.849 --> 02:37:46.859 align:start position:0%
talking about in a little bit covers the
 
02:37:48.889 --> 02:37:48.899 align:start position:0%
criminal side of it here we're talking
 
02:37:53.630 --> 02:37:53.640 align:start position:0%
about assisting individuals who need
 
02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
protection need safety in the court
 
02:37:58.250 --> 02:37:58.260 align:start position:0%
process where normally they wouldn't
 
02:37:59.870 --> 02:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
have representation
 
02:38:01.969 --> 02:38:01.979 align:start position:0%
to a restraining order is considered a
 
02:38:04.429 --> 02:38:04.439 align:start position:0%
civil thing not a criminal correct yes
 
02:38:07.010 --> 02:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
that seems weird okay thank you I guess
 
02:38:09.889 --> 02:38:09.899 align:start position:0%
I should just uh and this is I if I'm
 
02:38:11.389 --> 02:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
going too deep in the minutia I
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
apologize but uh in criminal domestic
 
02:38:16.010 --> 02:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
violence cases there are bail orders
 
02:38:20.150 --> 02:38:20.160 align:start position:0%
that also have attached to them a
 
02:38:22.190 --> 02:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
protective order but it's a criminal
 
02:38:24.170 --> 02:38:24.180 align:start position:0%
protective order there are what we're
 
02:38:25.790 --> 02:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
talking about here are civil protective
 
02:38:28.010 --> 02:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
orders that may or may not be related to
 
02:38:34.790 --> 02:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:37.490 --> 02:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
so if someone violated a protective
 
02:38:39.469 --> 02:38:39.479 align:start position:0%
order then they're charged with a crime
 
02:38:42.410 --> 02:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you
 
02:38:46.190 --> 02:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
um but uh and and I uh
 
02:38:48.290 --> 02:38:48.300 align:start position:0%
you know in a criminal proceeding the
 
02:38:50.750 --> 02:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
parties are the state and the defendant
 
02:38:52.610 --> 02:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
so they're
 
02:38:55.250 --> 02:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
um an individual who's actually been uh
 
02:38:56.929 --> 02:38:56.939 align:start position:0%
uh subject to some sort of violence is
 
02:39:00.650 --> 02:39:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:00.660 --> 02:39:01.429 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:39:01.429 --> 02:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:03.889 --> 02:39:03.899 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch uh formed a task
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
force onto the domestic violence cases
 
02:39:09.830 --> 02:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
in their report they noted that uh 15 of
 
02:39:11.809 --> 02:39:11.819 align:start position:0%
survivors have representation and
 
02:39:13.849 --> 02:39:13.859 align:start position:0%
protective order feelings that's a
 
02:39:17.330 --> 02:39:17.340 align:start position:0%
fairly low number uh nhla is committed
 
02:39:18.950 --> 02:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
to that crucial work they've received
 
02:39:21.230 --> 02:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice victims of crime
 
02:39:22.730 --> 02:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
act and violence against women act
 
02:39:25.550 --> 02:39:25.560 align:start position:0%
funding they recently were awarded legal
 
02:39:29.030 --> 02:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
assistance uh I'm sorry a victims Grant
 
02:39:31.250 --> 02:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
um from and uh
 
02:39:35.389 --> 02:39:35.399 align:start position:0%
under new changes uh to existing laws in
 
02:39:37.309 --> 02:39:37.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire under and supreme court
 
02:39:40.190 --> 02:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
rules paraprofessionals paralegals can
 
02:39:42.830 --> 02:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
are authorized to appear with persons in
 
02:39:44.809 --> 02:39:44.819 align:start position:0%
certain Court proceedings so this
 
02:39:46.610 --> 02:39:46.620 align:start position:0%
funding that is being asked for here
 
02:39:50.030 --> 02:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
would support the work of uh additional
 
02:39:53.030 --> 02:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys and paralegals who are focused
 
02:39:55.610 --> 02:39:55.620 align:start position:0%
on this kind of work and significantly
 
02:39:58.790 --> 02:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
increase the critical representation for
 
02:40:05.929 --> 02:40:05.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:08.090 --> 02:40:08.100 align:start position:0%
there's no further questions about that
 
02:40:12.290 --> 02:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
I move on to the next item uh and talk
 
02:40:13.849 --> 02:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
about the various items that are
 
02:40:16.190 --> 02:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
generally fall under the area of child
 
02:40:16.200 --> 02:40:18.650 align:start position:0%
generally fall under the area of child
protection

02:40:18.650 --> 02:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
protection
 
02:40:18.660 --> 02:40:19.429 align:start position:0%
protection
um

02:40:19.429 --> 02:40:19.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:23.809 --> 02:40:23.819 align:start position:0%
the casa line uh which is the governor's
 
02:40:27.230 --> 02:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
budget at page 542 and the handout at
 
02:40:28.690 --> 02:40:28.700 align:start position:0%
page five
 
02:40:31.070 --> 02:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
this is a request for some additional
 
02:40:34.190 --> 02:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
funding for court appointed special
 
02:40:37.389 --> 02:40:37.399 align:start position:0%
Advocates and for Casa of New Hampshire
 
02:40:41.690 --> 02:40:41.700 align:start position:0%
Casa of New Hampshire is the preferred
 
02:40:46.030 --> 02:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
uh provider of gal services in the state
 
02:40:49.309 --> 02:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
they're volunteers uh
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
our Advocates who receive extensive
 
02:40:55.010 --> 02:40:55.020 align:start position:0%
training and supervision
 
02:40:57.290 --> 02:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
there is a public-private partnership
 
02:41:02.090 --> 02:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
here that consists of some funding of
 
02:41:04.510 --> 02:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
that relationship so that children
 
02:41:08.570 --> 02:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
whenever possible can be represented by
 
02:41:10.630 --> 02:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
Casa advocates
 
02:41:15.469 --> 02:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 19 Casa worked with 52
 
02:41:17.389 --> 02:41:17.399 align:start position:0%
children they'd handled 32 different
 
02:41:20.270 --> 02:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
cases who had it to deceased parent and
 
02:41:23.090 --> 02:41:23.100 align:start position:0%
then by fiscal year 22 that number
 
02:41:26.590 --> 02:41:26.600 align:start position:0%
increased to 108 children in 72 cases
 
02:41:29.870 --> 02:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
with deceased parents there are
 
02:41:33.170 --> 02:41:33.180 align:start position:0%
volunteers spent an average in fiscal
 
02:41:37.370 --> 02:41:37.380 align:start position:0%
year 22 of 262 hours per case and
 
02:41:40.490 --> 02:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
conducted multiple visits in connection
 
02:41:41.750 --> 02:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
to that
 
02:41:44.450 --> 02:41:44.460 align:start position:0%
we really can't put a value on the
 
02:41:47.870 --> 02:41:47.880 align:start position:0%
volunteers in their time the value to
 
02:41:49.849 --> 02:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
the state the value to the children that
 
02:41:50.929 --> 02:41:50.939 align:start position:0%
they serve
 
02:41:54.290 --> 02:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
but of course uh in a finance meeting we
 
02:41:56.929 --> 02:41:56.939 align:start position:0%
measure that value in dollars or attempt
 
02:42:00.650 --> 02:42:00.660 align:start position:0%
to and if we were to apply current rates
 
02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
that lawyers were being compensated at
 
02:42:05.570 --> 02:42:05.580 align:start position:0%
and paid Guardians were being
 
02:42:07.550 --> 02:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
compensated at to the volunteer time
 
02:42:09.830 --> 02:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
that costs of volunteers have provided
 
02:42:12.170 --> 02:42:12.180 align:start position:0%
that compensation would probably come
 
02:42:14.150 --> 02:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
out to about eight million dollars
 
02:42:17.389 --> 02:42:17.399 align:start position:0%
so uh the funding that we're asking for
 
02:42:19.309 --> 02:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
here will be used to address certain
 
02:42:22.130 --> 02:42:22.140 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage challenges that cost
 
02:42:25.190 --> 02:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
is facing the increased need that they
 
02:42:27.950 --> 02:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
have for Legal Staffing and the very
 
02:42:29.929 --> 02:42:29.939 align:start position:0%
important continued Recruitment and
 
02:42:41.809 --> 02:42:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr I just like
 
02:42:46.010 --> 02:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
to point out that on both of those pages
 
02:42:49.429 --> 02:42:49.439 align:start position:0%
you're missing a zero I assume or or are
 
02:42:51.170 --> 02:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
we going to reduce the amount in the
 
02:42:53.929 --> 02:42:53.939 align:start position:0%
fiscal year I hope 2024 yeah I really
 
02:42:55.910 --> 02:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate you pointing that out okay
 
02:42:58.309 --> 02:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
just just some yes it's not confused to
 
02:43:02.450 --> 02:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
be 75 000 it's 750 and then in in the
 
02:43:04.190 --> 02:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
case of the casa thing it's two hundred
 
02:43:06.950 --> 02:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
thousand you know I I knew I was going
 
02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
to have something that uh somebody
 
02:43:10.969 --> 02:43:10.979 align:start position:0%
pointed out I appreciate you noting it
 
02:43:12.650 --> 02:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
and uh yes
 
02:43:14.450 --> 02:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
um I mean as you can tell from the
 
02:43:16.429 --> 02:43:16.439 align:start position:0%
governor's actual budget request those
 
02:43:18.349 --> 02:43:18.359 align:start position:0%
are the amounts that we're asking for
 
02:43:24.590 --> 02:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:29.090 --> 02:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
um the next item is non-casa gals this
 
02:43:31.910 --> 02:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
is the governor's budget at page 542 in
 
02:43:36.110 --> 02:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:38.809 --> 02:43:38.819 align:start position:0%
um these are private private Guardians
 
02:43:41.150 --> 02:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
who were assigned when Casa is not
 
02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:41.990 align:start position:0%
who were assigned when Casa is not
available

02:43:41.990 --> 02:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:43:43.849 --> 02:43:43.859 align:start position:0%
sort of it highlights
 
02:43:45.650 --> 02:43:45.660 align:start position:0%
um the importance of additional funding
 
02:43:48.650 --> 02:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
for Casa because of what a great
 
02:43:50.389 --> 02:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
resource they are but when they're not
 
02:43:50.399 --> 02:44:15.910 align:start position:0%
resource they are but when they're not
available

02:44:15.910 --> 02:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
656 and that is
 
02:44:22.790 --> 02:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
should be noted in the page six of the
 
02:44:24.410 --> 02:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
handout that you have
 
02:44:26.809 --> 02:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
so you'll hear me talk a bunch about
 
02:44:29.030 --> 02:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
this but part of the reason
 
02:44:31.490 --> 02:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
the reason that that additional funding
 
02:44:34.130 --> 02:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
is necessary is because the rate change
 
02:44:37.130 --> 02:44:37.140 align:start position:0%
for compensation that has been applied
 
02:44:40.490 --> 02:44:40.500 align:start position:0%
to lawyers who provide services in a
 
02:44:43.849 --> 02:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
range of cases has also been approved
 
02:44:46.370 --> 02:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
and applied for Guardians who are
 
02:44:48.770 --> 02:44:48.780 align:start position:0%
working on these kinds of cases and so
 
02:44:50.809 --> 02:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
that rate has gone from sixty dollars an
 
02:44:52.969 --> 02:44:52.979 align:start position:0%
hour to ninety dollars an hour and
 
02:44:56.389 --> 02:44:56.399 align:start position:0%
that's part of the basis for our request
 
02:45:00.050 --> 02:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
here for additional funds
 
02:45:03.770 --> 02:45:03.780 align:start position:0%
no yes yes thank you so in Casa there's
 
02:45:06.050 --> 02:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
90 000 hours how many hours are there in
 
02:45:07.370 --> 02:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
this one
 
02:45:11.570 --> 02:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer I'm happy to um
 
02:45:13.849 --> 02:45:13.859 align:start position:0%
try to determine that for you can we
 
02:45:16.910 --> 02:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
divide 90 into some number what I can
 
02:45:19.610 --> 02:45:19.620 align:start position:0%
tell you is that um Casa handles about
 
02:45:25.130 --> 02:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
75 percent I believe of the uh cases uh
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
that require appointments accordions so
 
02:45:33.469 --> 02:45:33.479 align:start position:0%
if uh we were to you know do some basic
 
02:45:35.929 --> 02:45:35.939 align:start position:0%
math that means the other 25 percent are
 
02:45:38.570 --> 02:45:38.580 align:start position:0%
going to these non-causage Guardians
 
02:45:41.210 --> 02:45:41.220 align:start position:0%
headline them okay so if class is 90 000
 
02:45:44.330 --> 02:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
hours these are thirty thousand dollars
 
02:45:46.130 --> 02:45:46.140 align:start position:0%
is that I would agree with your math
 
02:45:49.550 --> 02:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
okay and so
 
02:45:51.889 --> 02:45:51.899 align:start position:0%
um are these the more complicated cases
 
02:45:53.990 --> 02:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
or something the more difficult cases or
 
02:45:56.270 --> 02:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
is or is it just random
 
02:45:58.309 --> 02:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily I think
 
02:45:59.929 --> 02:45:59.939 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:46:02.510 --> 02:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
Marty sink who is um here on behalf of
 
02:46:04.610 --> 02:46:04.620 align:start position:0%
Casa may be better able to answer that
 
02:46:06.650 --> 02:46:06.660 align:start position:0%
but I I suspect a lot of it has to do
 
02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
with geography and just a limitation on
 
02:46:11.210 --> 02:46:11.220 align:start position:0%
volunteers yeah it's just a matter of
 
02:46:14.030 --> 02:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
not having a volunteer available you can
 
02:46:18.170 --> 02:46:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:18.180 --> 02:46:23.210 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:46:23.210 --> 02:46:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:26.030 --> 02:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
my name is Marsha sink and I am the CEO
 
02:46:29.330 --> 02:46:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:32.690 --> 02:46:32.700 align:start position:0%
so the when when we do not have a
 
02:46:34.490 --> 02:46:34.500 align:start position:0%
volunteer available regardless of where
 
02:46:37.190 --> 02:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
it is in the state we turn the case back
 
02:46:38.690 --> 02:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
to the court and the court then must
 
02:46:41.450 --> 02:46:41.460 align:start position:0%
appoint a paid Guardian at Leiden to
 
02:46:44.990 --> 02:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
step in our goal is always to grow our
 
02:46:47.690 --> 02:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
capacity to be able to be available for
 
02:46:50.270 --> 02:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
100 of these cases
 
02:46:56.290 --> 02:46:56.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:59.330 --> 02:46:59.340 align:start position:0%
so is this the
 
02:47:02.210 --> 02:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
the Line This is a million dollars is
 
02:47:02.220 --> 02:47:03.230 align:start position:0%
the Line This is a million dollars is
that

02:47:03.230 --> 02:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:47:07.790 --> 02:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:14.990 --> 02:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:21.010 --> 02:47:21.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:24.950 --> 02:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
Caso said the governor's budget at 542
 
02:47:24.960 --> 02:47:26.809 align:start position:0%
Caso said the governor's budget at 542
and

02:47:26.809 --> 02:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:47:31.550 --> 02:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
I believe and uh the web page what page
 
02:47:33.710 --> 02:47:33.720 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:47:38.990 --> 02:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:41.809 --> 02:47:41.819 align:start position:0%
I I think so I'm sorry there's three
 
02:47:41.819 --> 02:47:42.950 align:start position:0%
I I think so I'm sorry there's three
different

02:47:42.950 --> 02:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:47:45.650 --> 02:47:45.660 align:start position:0%
lines here that are covered under sort
 
02:47:48.830 --> 02:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
of a a general Child Protection sort of
 
02:47:52.849 --> 02:47:52.859 align:start position:0%
heading one is Casa okay one is non-casa
 
02:47:57.950 --> 02:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
gals right and then there is a third uh
 
02:48:00.710 --> 02:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
accounting line uh that's entitled
 
02:48:05.150 --> 02:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
Guardian Ad Litem which is neither Casa
 
02:48:08.870 --> 02:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
nor non-casa gals and actually covers a
 
02:48:15.070 --> 02:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:16.969 --> 02:48:16.979 align:start position:0%
guardianships and termination of
 
02:48:19.130 --> 02:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
parental rights cases
 
02:48:19.140 --> 02:48:20.330 align:start position:0%
parental rights cases
and

02:48:20.330 --> 02:48:20.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:23.090 --> 02:48:23.100 align:start position:0%
okay so I haven't found I I see Guardian
 
02:48:24.889 --> 02:48:24.899 align:start position:0%
El item a million dollars
 
02:48:29.929 --> 02:48:29.939 align:start position:0%
so where is Casa is it non-counsel no
 
02:48:33.830 --> 02:48:33.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's line 1101
 
02:48:33.840 --> 02:48:35.150 align:start position:0%
it's it's line 1101
um

02:48:35.150 --> 02:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:37.370 --> 02:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
02:48:45.590 --> 02:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:55.010 --> 02:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:55.020 --> 02:49:12.950 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:49:12.950 --> 02:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:17.210 --> 02:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to help direct you where you
 
02:49:21.110 --> 02:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know to go if I can all right so
 
02:49:24.110 --> 02:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
this is just the expense not for the
 
02:49:25.790 --> 02:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
attorneys but
 
02:49:27.710 --> 02:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
where it says non-cost of four hundred
 
02:49:28.969 --> 02:49:28.979 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:49:31.429 --> 02:49:31.439 align:start position:0%
correct that's the correct line right so
 
02:49:33.830 --> 02:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
is that just your administration of that
 
02:49:36.410 --> 02:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
section as opposed to what we're
 
02:49:38.330 --> 02:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
actually paying the attorneys for their
 
02:49:43.210 --> 02:49:43.220 align:start position:0%
hours so here I just want to be so
 
02:49:46.010 --> 02:49:46.020 align:start position:0%
Guardians might be attorneys but they
 
02:49:49.190 --> 02:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
aren't necessarily attorneys um and this
 
02:49:52.730 --> 02:49:52.740 align:start position:0%
is uh what is actually being paid to
 
02:49:55.969 --> 02:49:55.979 align:start position:0%
them for their service it's not it's not
 
02:49:58.670 --> 02:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
the agency administration of that it's
 
02:50:01.910 --> 02:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's the actual funding for the people
 
02:50:04.550 --> 02:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
who are going to court and representing
 
02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:05.450 align:start position:0%
who are going to court and representing
children

02:50:05.450 --> 02:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:50:08.150 --> 02:50:08.160 align:start position:0%
okay but costs of people are volunteers
 
02:50:11.150 --> 02:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
they're not paid yes correct okay so you
 
02:50:16.370 --> 02:50:16.380 align:start position:0%
said that this is a quarter of the total
 
02:50:19.070 --> 02:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
number of hours
 
02:50:21.469 --> 02:50:21.479 align:start position:0%
but it's a quarter of the total dollars
 
02:50:23.570 --> 02:50:23.580 align:start position:0%
right so so there's something weird
 
02:50:25.250 --> 02:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
going on
 
02:50:25.260 --> 02:50:26.750 align:start position:0%
going on
so

02:50:26.750 --> 02:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:31.370 --> 02:50:31.380 align:start position:0%
um Casa you know I'll defer okay in a
 
02:50:33.469 --> 02:50:33.479 align:start position:0%
second but Casa has a variety of
 
02:50:33.479 --> 02:50:34.790 align:start position:0%
second but Casa has a variety of
different

02:50:34.790 --> 02:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:50:37.070 --> 02:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
funding sources certainly not
 
02:50:39.530 --> 02:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
fully the state it's not funded by the
 
02:50:39.540 --> 02:50:40.610 align:start position:0%
fully the state it's not funded by the
state

02:50:40.610 --> 02:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:50:45.530 --> 02:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
the non-casa gals are completely funded
 
02:50:46.969 --> 02:50:46.979 align:start position:0%
by the state
 
02:50:46.979 --> 02:50:47.830 align:start position:0%
by the state
so

02:50:47.830 --> 02:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:50:47.840 --> 02:50:48.410 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

02:50:48.410 --> 02:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:50:48.420 --> 02:50:48.950 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:50:48.950 --> 02:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:52.130 --> 02:50:52.140 align:start position:0%
this would represent I mean really if
 
02:50:55.730 --> 02:50:55.740 align:start position:0%
this is only 25 of what would be
 
02:50:59.929 --> 02:50:59.939 align:start position:0%
necessary then there would be at least
 
02:50:59.939 --> 02:51:00.530 align:start position:0%
necessary then there would be at least
um

02:51:00.530 --> 02:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:04.190 --> 02:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
12 1.2 million dollars necessary for
 
02:51:10.270 --> 02:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:13.490 --> 02:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
right and I mean at this time or last
 
02:51:16.730 --> 02:51:16.740 align:start position:0%
year we were able to accept 75 of the
 
02:51:19.550 --> 02:51:19.560 align:start position:0%
cases that came into the to the Circuit
 
02:51:21.910 --> 02:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
Court on child abuse and neglect cases
 
02:51:25.250 --> 02:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
the cases that we could not take get
 
02:51:27.349 --> 02:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
returned to the court and then they end
 
02:51:31.490 --> 02:51:31.500 align:start position:0%
up in that non-casa line in the budget
 
02:51:35.389 --> 02:51:35.399 align:start position:0%
so we are constantly recruiting and
 
02:51:37.490 --> 02:51:37.500 align:start position:0%
trying to grow the percentage of cases
 
02:51:39.410 --> 02:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
that we were able to take
 
02:51:41.870 --> 02:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
um prior to the pandemic we were at
 
02:51:45.530 --> 02:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
about 89 percent and that has fallen as
 
02:51:48.349 --> 02:51:48.359 align:start position:0%
a result of the of the pandemic and just
 
02:51:50.270 --> 02:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
the shortage of volunteers we're
 
02:51:52.130 --> 02:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
starting to see that turn around again
 
02:51:55.070 --> 02:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
where there is more interest in folks
 
02:51:57.650 --> 02:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
becoming Casa volunteers so I don't know
 
02:52:02.150 --> 02:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:04.370 --> 02:52:04.380 align:start position:0%
so how many employees do you have to
 
02:52:07.250 --> 02:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
coordinate these volunteers we our
 
02:52:11.210 --> 02:52:11.220 align:start position:0%
entire um we have 39 well the equivalent
 
02:52:15.590 --> 02:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
of about 37 staff paid staff and we last
 
02:52:18.710 --> 02:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
year had over 500 volunteers who were
 
02:52:21.290 --> 02:52:21.300 align:start position:0%
actually providing the direct service to
 
02:52:23.090 --> 02:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
the court to our children
 
02:52:27.110 --> 02:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
okay and and in the non-casa area
 
02:52:31.070 --> 02:52:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:32.450 --> 02:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't
 
02:52:35.690 --> 02:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that because
 
02:52:37.490 --> 02:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
um the judicial Council does not
 
02:52:40.670 --> 02:52:40.680 align:start position:0%
actually appoint those people yeah we
 
02:52:42.889 --> 02:52:42.899 align:start position:0%
only pay the bills
 
02:52:44.389 --> 02:52:44.399 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:52:46.370 --> 02:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
um I could find that out for you if you
 
02:52:47.990 --> 02:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
would like to know but uh yeah find out
 
02:52:50.389 --> 02:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
more about like how many hours these are
 
02:52:51.889 --> 02:52:51.899 align:start position:0%
eternities right and they're not always
 
02:52:55.790 --> 02:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
attorney not always okay so yeah I mean
 
02:52:57.830 --> 02:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's just you would think because one
 
02:53:00.670 --> 02:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
side is volunteers there would be a huge
 
02:53:03.230 --> 02:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
it'd be a lot cheaper
 
02:53:05.870 --> 02:53:05.880 align:start position:0%
but on paper here it looks like they're
 
02:53:07.849 --> 02:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
very close to the same
 
02:53:11.269 --> 02:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
okay so that that's the issue
 
02:53:13.250 --> 02:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
that I don't understand so maybe you can
 
02:53:15.469 --> 02:53:15.479 align:start position:0%
get more details go into the details
 
02:53:21.469 --> 02:53:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:24.290 --> 02:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm uh
 
02:53:26.990 --> 02:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
struggling here in the sense that
 
02:53:29.330 --> 02:53:29.340 align:start position:0%
um you know the amount of cases that are
 
02:53:32.510 --> 02:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
handled by Casa uh is
 
02:53:36.650 --> 02:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of cases and uh but
 
02:53:39.670 --> 02:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
they're doing it at a
 
02:53:43.130 --> 02:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
they're mostly volunteers so they're uh
 
02:53:44.929 --> 02:53:44.939 align:start position:0%
the benefit to the state is is
 
02:53:46.849 --> 02:53:46.859 align:start position:0%
substantial there
 
02:53:49.910 --> 02:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
um and yeah I think I would I believe it
 
02:53:52.250 --> 02:53:52.260 align:start position:0%
but on the paper
 
02:53:54.650 --> 02:53:54.660 align:start position:0%
the non-cost is four hundred thousand
 
02:53:58.130 --> 02:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
dollars right the cost is uh 1.1 million
 
02:54:00.230 --> 02:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
I I
 
02:54:02.389 --> 02:54:02.399 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure where that number's coming
 
02:54:07.429 --> 02:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:11.510 --> 02:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna if I can Mr chairman
 
02:54:13.969 --> 02:54:13.979 align:start position:0%
um uh Nina Gardner who is a
 
02:54:16.849 --> 02:54:16.859 align:start position:0%
the chair of the judicial Council uh the
 
02:54:19.429 --> 02:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
council uh would like to offer some
 
02:54:21.230 --> 02:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
input about this that might help okay
 
02:54:22.370 --> 02:54:22.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:54:25.130 --> 02:54:25.140 align:start position:0%
or just as a heads up I'm probably going
 
02:54:27.050 --> 02:54:27.060 align:start position:0%
to recess this work session until
 
02:54:29.530 --> 02:54:29.540 align:start position:0%
Thursday of next week
 
02:54:31.969 --> 02:54:31.979 align:start position:0%
with the amount of material and again I
 
02:54:34.250 --> 02:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
apologize that we ran so far over we
 
02:54:36.050 --> 02:54:36.060 align:start position:0%
thought we'd have plenty of time with
 
02:54:38.450 --> 02:54:38.460 align:start position:0%
you but we've got another work session
 
02:54:41.750 --> 02:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
with the office of licensure at one
 
02:54:44.269 --> 02:54:44.279 align:start position:0%
o'clock which is going to be very deep
 
02:54:48.050 --> 02:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
and uh to say the least we got 300 Pages
 
02:54:50.330 --> 02:54:50.340 align:start position:0%
there to deal with
 
02:54:52.790 --> 02:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
um on what they want to do so Thursday
 
02:54:55.730 --> 02:54:55.740 align:start position:0%
perhaps at 9 30 a.m would that work for
 
02:54:57.410 --> 02:54:57.420 align:start position:0%
everybody and maybe some of those
 
02:54:59.090 --> 02:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
questions that have been raised can be
 
02:55:00.889 --> 02:55:00.899 align:start position:0%
addressed and then we can also
 
02:55:03.469 --> 02:55:03.479 align:start position:0%
go into your handout which looks very
 
02:55:05.269 --> 02:55:05.279 align:start position:0%
detailed which none of us have had a
 
02:55:09.110 --> 02:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
chance to really dig into yeah
 
02:55:11.570 --> 02:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
and then additionally because of the
 
02:55:13.910 --> 02:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
amount of increase which is fairly
 
02:55:16.790 --> 02:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
substantial before our eyes from last
 
02:55:19.670 --> 02:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
year and a question I had could you also
 
02:55:21.170 --> 02:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
get us a figure I believe you were
 
02:55:23.809 --> 02:55:23.819 align:start position:0%
before fiscal at least twice for some
 
02:55:25.730 --> 02:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
funds that keep you afloat what that
 
02:55:28.010 --> 02:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
amount of money might have been for the
 
02:55:31.790 --> 02:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
last year yeah and I I do reference that
 
02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
in the materials okay I'm happy to talk
 
02:55:37.010 --> 02:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
about that we actually we have had two
 
02:55:39.530 --> 02:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
fiscal items approved and there are two
 
02:55:42.230 --> 02:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
pending two pending okay
 
02:55:46.070 --> 02:55:46.080 align:start position:0%
all right so Thursday at 9 30 a.m will
 
02:55:48.590 --> 02:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
reconvene the work session and again I
 
02:55:50.630 --> 02:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
apologize I I think even if we had an
 
02:55:52.190 --> 02:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
hour we'd probably have to have you come
 
02:55:53.750 --> 02:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
back anyway so
 
02:55:57.950 --> 02:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:00.590 --> 02:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
so again for the public we'll reconvene
 
02:56:05.030 --> 02:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
this at 9 30 this next Thursday
 
02:56:07.250 --> 02:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
and for now the work session is over
 
02:56:19.210 --> 02:56:19.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:21.590 --> 02:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:56:21.600 --> 03:34:49.849 align:start position:0%
thank you
yes

03:34:49.849 --> 03:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:52.910 --> 03:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
here because we gotta deal with a 1092
 
03:34:52.920 --> 03:34:54.290 align:start position:0%
here because we gotta deal with a 1092
positions

03:34:54.290 --> 03:34:54.300 align:start position:0%

is our director of operations Heather
Kelly

03:35:35.690 --> 03:35:35.700 align:start position:0%
Kelly
 
03:35:37.670 --> 03:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
what I'd like to do is start off by
 
03:35:40.190 --> 03:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
doing a brief agency overview I think
 
03:35:41.870 --> 03:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
some of you are very familiar with our
 
03:35:44.929 --> 03:35:44.939 align:start position:0%
agencies some maybe not so much
 
03:35:47.570 --> 03:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
um we are an agency that provides
 
03:35:50.450 --> 03:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
administrative support to 52
 
03:35:52.849 --> 03:35:52.859 align:start position:0%
occupational licensing boards councils
 
03:35:55.490 --> 03:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
and commissions seven of those boards
 
03:35:58.130 --> 03:35:58.140 align:start position:0%
are advisory boards meaning that the
 
03:36:00.590 --> 03:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
agency has regulatory authority over
 
03:36:03.229 --> 03:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
those professions with the advice of
 
03:36:05.990 --> 03:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
those advisory boards the remainder are
 
03:36:08.510 --> 03:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
independent regulatory bodies that have
 
03:36:09.969 --> 03:36:09.979 align:start position:0%
their own
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
strategies policies procedures
 
03:36:15.950 --> 03:36:15.960 align:start position:0%
directives and a different Mission but
 
03:36:18.590 --> 03:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
we essentially support the boards in two
 
03:36:20.769 --> 03:36:20.779 align:start position:0%
ways one of which is licensing
 
03:36:24.229 --> 03:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
individuals and then enforcing matters
 
03:36:26.090 --> 03:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
that come through either as complaints
 
03:36:28.670 --> 03:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
or proactively through the inspection
 
03:36:31.490 --> 03:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
process a couple of Statistics we have
 
03:36:33.769 --> 03:36:33.779 align:start position:0%
over 200 000 occupational licenses
 
03:36:35.650 --> 03:36:35.660 align:start position:0%
within our agency this varies
 
03:36:35.660 --> 03:36:37.330 align:start position:0%
within our agency this varies
substantially

03:36:37.330 --> 03:36:37.340 align:start position:0%
substantially
 
03:36:40.490 --> 03:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
year to year depending on Workforce
 
03:36:43.910 --> 03:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
needs for example we see Trends in real
 
03:36:45.650 --> 03:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
estate when the Market's really hot that
 
03:36:47.650 --> 03:36:47.660 align:start position:0%
we get an influx in applications
 
03:36:50.090 --> 03:36:50.100 align:start position:0%
we've seen greater increases in
 
03:36:53.030 --> 03:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
portability and applicants from out of
 
03:36:54.889 --> 03:36:54.899 align:start position:0%
state so it does vary
 
03:36:56.510 --> 03:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
we historically receive about 100
 
03:36:58.849 --> 03:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
complaints per month that we manage on
 
03:37:00.889 --> 03:37:00.899 align:start position:0%
behalf of the boards and we do conduct
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
over 2 000 inspections annually just in
 
03:37:05.450 --> 03:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
four professions alone that have
 
03:37:05.460 --> 03:37:07.070 align:start position:0%
four professions alone that have
inspectors

03:37:07.070 --> 03:37:07.080 align:start position:0%
inspectors
 
03:37:09.290 --> 03:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
what I think is important to note from a
 
03:37:11.269 --> 03:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
budgetary standpoint is that we are
 
03:37:14.750 --> 03:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
fully self-funded agency and
 
03:37:17.570 --> 03:37:17.580 align:start position:0%
core Supreme Court precedent our fees
 
03:37:21.490 --> 03:37:21.500 align:start position:0%
have to bear relations relationship to
 
03:37:26.630 --> 03:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
the expense that we are we are making on
 
03:37:28.969 --> 03:37:28.979 align:start position:0%
behalf of the agency in other words we
 
03:37:32.210 --> 03:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
can't really be utilizing license fees
 
03:37:34.729 --> 03:37:34.739 align:start position:0%
to fund things that aren't related to
 
03:37:37.490 --> 03:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
the licensure or disciplinary process
 
03:37:39.590 --> 03:37:39.600 align:start position:0%
so if you look on page two this just
 
03:37:41.870 --> 03:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
gives you a brief agency structure and I
 
03:37:44.210 --> 03:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
think this is helpful because we have
 
03:37:47.269 --> 03:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
recently undergone a restructuring of
 
03:37:49.790 --> 03:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
the agency in the last budget cycle in
 
03:37:52.070 --> 03:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
particular we restructured the agency to
 
03:37:54.349 --> 03:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
reflect the two functions that we
 
03:37:56.510 --> 03:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
perform so we have a division of
 
03:37:58.030 --> 03:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
Licensing and board Administration
 
03:38:00.650 --> 03:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
within that we have a Licensing Bureau
 
03:38:03.650 --> 03:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
that really just processes processes the
 
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
licensing applications we also have a
 
03:38:08.690 --> 03:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
bureau of board Administration those are
 
03:38:11.570 --> 03:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
the Liaisons between the boards and
 
03:38:13.370 --> 03:38:13.380 align:start position:0%
basically any other stakeholder
 
03:38:15.050 --> 03:38:15.060 align:start position:0%
including the agency an internal
 
03:38:17.750 --> 03:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholder and external stakeholders
 
03:38:19.670 --> 03:38:19.680 align:start position:0%
we also have a division of enforcement
 
03:38:24.250 --> 03:38:24.260 align:start position:0%
this was new out of hb2 of last biennium
 
03:38:26.870 --> 03:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
and within that division we have a
 
03:38:29.210 --> 03:38:29.220 align:start position:0%
prosecutions bureau which prosecutes all
 
03:38:31.790 --> 03:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
of our cases in investigations Bureau
 
03:38:34.250 --> 03:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
which naturally investigates the cases
 
03:38:36.889 --> 03:38:36.899 align:start position:0%
and a compliance Bureau which is funded
 
03:38:39.290 --> 03:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
by four professions that have
 
03:38:42.910 --> 03:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
inspections or inspection requirements
 
03:38:45.349 --> 03:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
previously prior to the divisions
 
03:38:45.359 --> 03:38:47.210 align:start position:0%
previously prior to the divisions
creation

03:38:47.210 --> 03:38:47.220 align:start position:0%
creation
 
03:38:50.210 --> 03:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
the complaints that were managed in in
 
03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
cases that were prosecuted were largely
 
03:38:54.050 --> 03:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
done by the administrative prosecutions
 
03:38:56.269 --> 03:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
unit at the Department of Justice other
 
03:38:58.610 --> 03:38:58.620 align:start position:0%
boards had a hodgepodge approach whereby
 
03:39:01.210 --> 03:39:01.220 align:start position:0%
they may ask a board member to recuse
 
03:39:03.710 --> 03:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
themselves to prosecute a case and then
 
03:39:05.030 --> 03:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
cases went
 
03:39:07.610 --> 03:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
on prosecuted so this division of
 
03:39:09.410 --> 03:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement has really Consolidated that
 
03:39:11.269 --> 03:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
approach and provided a streamlined
 
03:39:13.610 --> 03:39:13.620 align:start position:0%
mechanism to ensure public protection
 
03:39:15.710 --> 03:39:15.720 align:start position:0%
and then finally we have what we call
 
03:39:17.450 --> 03:39:17.460 align:start position:0%
enroll because it's not a true division
 
03:39:19.010 --> 03:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
as the office of the executive director
 
03:39:20.330 --> 03:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
but it's essentially just all of our
 
03:39:23.090 --> 03:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
operations including the provision of
 
03:39:25.250 --> 03:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
legal counsel and you'll note that we've
 
03:39:28.130 --> 03:39:28.140 align:start position:0%
split up the provision of legal counsel
 
03:39:30.290 --> 03:39:30.300 align:start position:0%
between the agency and the boards and
 
03:39:32.450 --> 03:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
the reason for that is because the
 
03:39:35.630 --> 03:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
boards and the agencies at times have
 
03:39:35.640 --> 03:39:37.429 align:start position:0%
boards and the agencies at times have
conflicts

03:39:37.429 --> 03:39:37.439 align:start position:0%
conflicts
 
03:39:41.150 --> 03:39:41.160 align:start position:0%
um and it is uh you know legally it can
 
03:39:42.710 --> 03:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
become a conflict of interest to have
 
03:39:44.750 --> 03:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
the same attorney representing both
 
03:39:46.490 --> 03:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
parties that do not share the same
 
03:39:48.950 --> 03:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
interests and you know I'm sure we'll
 
03:39:50.150 --> 03:39:50.160 align:start position:0%
see that coming up with some of the
 
03:39:52.190 --> 03:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
changes that are that are suggested by
 
03:39:54.170 --> 03:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
the budget trailer
 
03:39:55.910 --> 03:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
so if you turn to the next piece let me
 
03:39:57.229 --> 03:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
ask a question yes certainly
 
03:40:00.469 --> 03:40:00.479 align:start position:0%
representative I think so
 
03:40:04.309 --> 03:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
um of these 1092 people
 
03:40:06.349 --> 03:40:06.359 align:start position:0%
um I would assume that some of them are
 
03:40:08.870 --> 03:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
specific employees of specific boards
 
03:40:11.090 --> 03:40:11.100 align:start position:0%
right they're they're not sort of
 
03:40:13.429 --> 03:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
general like like general counsel or
 
03:40:16.190 --> 03:40:16.200 align:start position:0%
something like that no actually so of
 
03:40:19.370 --> 03:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
our 83 authorized positions all of them
 
03:40:22.910 --> 03:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
work directly for the oplc
 
03:40:26.389 --> 03:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
um the statute actually uh grants and
 
03:40:28.190 --> 03:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
directs the executive director to Super
 
03:40:30.769 --> 03:40:30.779 align:start position:0%
rise and oversee all of this staff so
 
03:40:33.170 --> 03:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
they do work directly with particular
 
03:40:37.309 --> 03:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
boards but that's based on the needs of
 
03:40:39.290 --> 03:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
the agency and the particular board
 
03:40:40.969 --> 03:40:40.979 align:start position:0%
okay so maybe I'm looking at the wrong
 
03:40:42.710 --> 03:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
line is that it
 
03:40:45.790 --> 03:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
am I looking at General government is
 
03:40:49.250 --> 03:40:49.260 align:start position:0%
1092 is that Mike is that what I'm doing
 
03:40:54.950 --> 03:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:00.410 --> 03:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:04.670 --> 03:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:07.670 --> 03:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay my apologies thank you it's 89 I
 
03:41:11.030 --> 03:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
guess is what you're 83 now 89 and then
 
03:41:12.830 --> 03:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
correct Governor all right thank you
 
03:41:16.690 --> 03:41:16.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:20.269 --> 03:41:20.279 align:start position:0%
foreign so moving on to the next page
 
03:41:22.610 --> 03:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
which I think is Page Three
 
03:41:22.620 --> 03:41:23.450 align:start position:0%
which I think is Page Three
um

03:41:23.450 --> 03:41:23.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:25.969 --> 03:41:25.979 align:start position:0%
many of you know that oplc is a fairly
 
03:41:28.910 --> 03:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
new agency we were established in 2015
 
03:41:31.429 --> 03:41:31.439 align:start position:0%
um through that Budget Trailer
 
03:41:31.439 --> 03:41:32.330 align:start position:0%
um through that Budget Trailer
um

03:41:32.330 --> 03:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:35.030 --> 03:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
and I think for many years just kind of
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
continued to function as the boards had
 
03:41:40.190 --> 03:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
previously functioned without any
 
03:41:42.290 --> 03:41:42.300 align:start position:0%
administrative support from a separate
 
03:41:44.090 --> 03:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
regulatory agency
 
03:41:46.190 --> 03:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
but the role of the agency and the
 
03:41:49.849 --> 03:41:49.859 align:start position:0%
boards is are different the role of the
 
03:41:51.590 --> 03:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
board is to protect the public and the
 
03:41:53.269 --> 03:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
role of the agency is really to ensure
 
03:41:55.309 --> 03:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
that we're assisting them in in meeting
 
03:41:57.050 --> 03:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
their missions in an efficient and
 
03:41:58.550 --> 03:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
economic way
 
03:42:01.250 --> 03:42:01.260 align:start position:0%
so over the last two years we've really
 
03:42:03.889 --> 03:42:03.899 align:start position:0%
undertaken an analysis of where we'd
 
03:42:06.170 --> 03:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
like the agency to go over the next
 
03:42:09.830 --> 03:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
couple of years and Revisited our vision
 
03:42:11.570 --> 03:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
and our mission and really our strategic
 
03:42:14.510 --> 03:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
plan and what we would like to do over
 
03:42:16.190 --> 03:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
the next 10 years if we could accomplish
 
03:42:18.050 --> 03:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
our mission is really to transform and
 
03:42:20.389 --> 03:42:20.399 align:start position:0%
modernize support for our licensing
 
03:42:24.229 --> 03:42:24.239 align:start position:0%
boards as we know uh work licensing does
 
03:42:26.750 --> 03:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
impact Workforce it is a barrier to
 
03:42:28.610 --> 03:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
Workforce entry it's a purposeful
 
03:42:30.349 --> 03:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
barrier to Workforce injury to protect
 
03:42:32.929 --> 03:42:32.939 align:start position:0%
the public but there are many things
 
03:42:34.610 --> 03:42:34.620 align:start position:0%
that we do in the office and that have
 
03:42:36.590 --> 03:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
been done by the boards and previously
 
03:42:38.809 --> 03:42:38.819 align:start position:0%
the board staff that are not necessarily
 
03:42:41.210 --> 03:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
efficient and that are unnecessary
 
03:42:43.550 --> 03:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
barriers to work for so we've we feel a
 
03:42:45.290 --> 03:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
very strong need to really modernize and
 
03:42:47.750 --> 03:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
transform the way we do business in the
 
03:42:49.610 --> 03:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
office and it's going to take some some
 
03:42:52.790 --> 03:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
time our mission as we see it is to
 
03:42:54.050 --> 03:42:54.060 align:start position:0%
create a regulatory environment
 
03:42:55.910 --> 03:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
favorable to Workforce opportunities
 
03:42:57.950 --> 03:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
while protecting the public through
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
these efficient in economic processes
 
03:43:03.170 --> 03:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
and we have four strategic goals over
 
03:43:05.630 --> 03:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
the next two years which we actually
 
03:43:08.690 --> 03:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
began this fiscal year the first is to
 
03:43:10.250 --> 03:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
fulfill statutory and regulatory
 
03:43:13.550 --> 03:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
requirements and that seems obvious
 
03:43:16.670 --> 03:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
um an obvious goal of any agency but
 
03:43:18.530 --> 03:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
we'll always say and I think a lot of
 
03:43:20.870 --> 03:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
the LBA audits that have been conducted
 
03:43:23.210 --> 03:43:23.220 align:start position:0%
among many of our boards in the last 10
 
03:43:25.870 --> 03:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
years reflect is that
 
03:43:29.030 --> 03:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
we inherited a lot of dysfunctional
 
03:43:32.450 --> 03:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
boards in in terms of processes and
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's not to say that it was
 
03:43:35.450 --> 03:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
intentional I think it was just the
 
03:43:38.030 --> 03:43:38.040 align:start position:0%
nature of the volunteer
 
03:43:40.670 --> 03:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
um you know part of the process it was
 
03:43:43.130 --> 03:43:43.140 align:start position:0%
performed by volunteers without a lot of
 
03:43:45.229 --> 03:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
oversight from from State actors who
 
03:43:47.809 --> 03:43:47.819 align:start position:0%
understood administrative processes and
 
03:43:50.570 --> 03:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
so it's not that oplc is just a new
 
03:43:53.690 --> 03:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
agency with a fresh start we really are
 
03:43:56.450 --> 03:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
still in the discovery phase of
 
03:44:00.110 --> 03:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
fixing a lot of processes and procedures
 
03:44:03.950 --> 03:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
that are not consistent with statutory
 
03:44:07.370 --> 03:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
requirements so that has to be our first
 
03:44:09.050 --> 03:44:09.060 align:start position:0%
strategic goal and our plan is to
 
03:44:10.849 --> 03:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
hopefully make sure that we're
 
03:44:12.349 --> 03:44:12.359 align:start position:0%
fulfilling all of our statutory
 
03:44:14.769 --> 03:44:14.779 align:start position:0%
requirements by fy25
 
03:44:16.429 --> 03:44:16.439 align:start position:0%
consistent with the governor's
 
03:44:18.229 --> 03:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
directives we'd like to enhance customer
 
03:44:20.389 --> 03:44:20.399 align:start position:0%
service increase licensure portability
 
03:44:22.809 --> 03:44:22.819 align:start position:0%
that really goes to the workforce
 
03:44:25.250 --> 03:44:25.260 align:start position:0%
barriers that we talked about earlier
 
03:44:27.110 --> 03:44:27.120 align:start position:0%
and to promote public protection which
 
03:44:29.450 --> 03:44:29.460 align:start position:0%
of course is the goal of any regulatory
 
03:44:32.510 --> 03:44:32.520 align:start position:0%
licensure board
 
03:44:35.030 --> 03:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
so if you turn to the next page we
 
03:44:36.410 --> 03:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
really have
 
03:44:39.290 --> 03:44:39.300 align:start position:0%
two types of major initiatives or
 
03:44:40.969 --> 03:44:40.979 align:start position:0%
strategies that are going to help us
 
03:44:44.389 --> 03:44:44.399 align:start position:0%
achieve our strategic goals the first is
 
03:44:46.389 --> 03:44:46.399 align:start position:0%
really leveraging technology
 
03:44:49.429 --> 03:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of the processes that we have
 
03:44:50.929 --> 03:44:50.939 align:start position:0%
observed in the office that are
 
03:44:53.710 --> 03:44:53.720 align:start position:0%
long-standing their legacy processes
 
03:44:57.110 --> 03:44:57.120 align:start position:0%
they are manually they're manually
 
03:45:01.070 --> 03:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
driven require you know intense labor
 
03:45:05.870 --> 03:45:05.880 align:start position:0%
efforts a lot of Staff we that's not
 
03:45:08.570 --> 03:45:08.580 align:start position:0%
sustainable as we know even if we had
 
03:45:11.690 --> 03:45:11.700 align:start position:0%
access to a lot of money which we which
 
03:45:12.950 --> 03:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
03:45:15.710 --> 03:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
um we just can't find the people to
 
03:45:17.510 --> 03:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
perform the job so we need to really
 
03:45:19.910 --> 03:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
leverage technology in a way that's
 
03:45:21.590 --> 03:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
efficient and economic and that will
 
03:45:23.870 --> 03:45:23.880 align:start position:0%
allow us to sustain agency operations
 
03:45:28.130 --> 03:45:28.140 align:start position:0%
moving forward without the need for many
 
03:45:31.910 --> 03:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
staff so we are working right now we're
 
03:45:34.570 --> 03:45:34.580 align:start position:0%
on implementing a new licensing portal
 
03:45:38.690 --> 03:45:38.700 align:start position:0%
this obviously was recommended by many
 
03:45:40.550 --> 03:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
um LBA audits as well it's an Enterprise
 
03:45:42.710 --> 03:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
solution it's fully funded by arpa
 
03:45:45.889 --> 03:45:45.899 align:start position:0%
dollars we started this project actually
 
03:45:48.110 --> 03:45:48.120 align:start position:0%
we had a kickoff meeting this week this
 
03:45:50.570 --> 03:45:50.580 align:start position:0%
is going to take several years
 
03:45:53.630 --> 03:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
um but we do anticipate that hopefully
 
03:45:55.729 --> 03:45:55.739 align:start position:0%
by the end of the next biennium that we
 
03:45:57.170 --> 03:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
will have transitioned to a completely
 
03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
new Solution that's modernized and in
 
03:46:01.969 --> 03:46:01.979 align:start position:0%
providing the customer service that we
 
03:46:05.349 --> 03:46:05.359 align:start position:0%
need we also just recently entered into
 
03:46:08.990 --> 03:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
a question yes thank you Mr chairman
 
03:46:11.809 --> 03:46:11.819 align:start position:0%
what's the what's this current state can
 
03:46:14.710 --> 03:46:14.720 align:start position:0%
most people who are licensed
 
03:46:17.330 --> 03:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
renew their license online and pay
 
03:46:19.910 --> 03:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
online and apply online and things like
 
03:46:22.849 --> 03:46:22.859 align:start position:0%
that or not yet it's really depends on
 
03:46:25.490 --> 03:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
the board we moved all renewal licenses
 
03:46:25.500 --> 03:46:26.929 align:start position:0%
the board we moved all renewal licenses
online

03:46:26.929 --> 03:46:26.939 align:start position:0%
online
 
03:46:26.939 --> 03:46:27.650 align:start position:0%
online
um

03:46:27.650 --> 03:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:30.590 --> 03:46:30.600 align:start position:0%
last session we have not been able to
 
03:46:33.889 --> 03:46:33.899 align:start position:0%
move all initial licenses online mainly
 
03:46:36.830 --> 03:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
because the current system is supported
 
03:46:38.990 --> 03:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
directly by Duit and not vendor
 
03:46:40.670 --> 03:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
supported and they're having their own
 
03:46:43.370 --> 03:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
Staffing challenges there's only two
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
part-time contractors who are able to
 
03:46:48.290 --> 03:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
support the entire State's needs in
 
03:46:50.870 --> 03:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
terms of development work and they only
 
03:46:52.670 --> 03:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
work you know a couple days a week and
 
03:46:54.590 --> 03:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
it's not just oplc it's Lottery it's
 
03:46:56.570 --> 03:46:56.580 align:start position:0%
liquor it's safety all competing for
 
03:46:58.969 --> 03:46:58.979 align:start position:0%
those resources so we have basically put
 
03:47:01.610 --> 03:47:01.620 align:start position:0%
on hold any transition to an electronic
 
03:47:03.950 --> 03:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
platform those initial licenses
 
03:47:07.670 --> 03:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
so this new technology is a um a vendor
 
03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
supported yes okay yes representative
 
03:47:14.389 --> 03:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
so the other type of uh solution that
 
03:47:16.729 --> 03:47:16.739 align:start position:0%
we've entered into is uh continuing
 
03:47:18.590 --> 03:47:18.600 align:start position:0%
education solution
 
03:47:21.410 --> 03:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
um we are a lot of our uh licensing
 
03:47:24.830 --> 03:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
staff spend a lot of time reviewing
 
03:47:26.929 --> 03:47:26.939 align:start position:0%
paper applications micromanaging
 
03:47:30.830 --> 03:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
continuing education of licensees this
 
03:47:33.349 --> 03:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
portal uh which is actually a no cost
 
03:47:36.710 --> 03:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
contract will allow licensees to track
 
03:47:39.530 --> 03:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
their continuing education online search
 
03:47:42.469 --> 03:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
for courses you know provide a visual
 
03:47:44.269 --> 03:47:44.279 align:start position:0%
roadmap as to whether or not they've
 
03:47:44.279 --> 03:47:45.590 align:start position:0%
roadmap as to whether or not they've
satisfied

03:47:45.590 --> 03:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
satisfied
 
03:47:47.809 --> 03:47:47.819 align:start position:0%
um their their needs and at some point
 
03:47:50.090 --> 03:47:50.100 align:start position:0%
we'll interface the two systems so that
 
03:47:51.530 --> 03:47:51.540 align:start position:0%
they speak to each other and we don't
 
03:47:53.090 --> 03:47:53.100 align:start position:0%
have to engage in multiple different
 
03:47:53.100 --> 03:47:54.349 align:start position:0%
have to engage in multiple different
systems

03:47:54.349 --> 03:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
systems
 
03:47:56.630 --> 03:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
but these two solutions which I think
 
03:47:58.849 --> 03:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
are going to be game changers for for
 
03:48:02.150 --> 03:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
both Workforce and for the agency
 
03:48:04.130 --> 03:48:04.140 align:start position:0%
um it requires that we have internal
 
03:48:05.809 --> 03:48:05.819 align:start position:0%
controls and that is a consistent theme
 
03:48:08.510 --> 03:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
that we've seen in all of the LBA audits
 
03:48:10.190 --> 03:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
that have been performed on our boards
 
03:48:13.309 --> 03:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
but also observed by us working in the
 
03:48:16.010 --> 03:48:16.020 align:start position:0%
office there has been a consistent lack
 
03:48:17.450 --> 03:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
of internal controls throughout the
 
03:48:20.750 --> 03:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
agency and the boards and so we are
 
03:48:22.849 --> 03:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
really embarking on a very aggressive
 
03:48:25.190 --> 03:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
effort to establish those internal
 
03:48:25.200 --> 03:48:27.050 align:start position:0%
effort to establish those internal
controls

03:48:27.050 --> 03:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
controls
 
03:48:28.790 --> 03:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
um part of that process has been to
 
03:48:31.070 --> 03:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
inventory all statutory and regulatory
 
03:48:31.080 --> 03:48:32.690 align:start position:0%
inventory all statutory and regulatory
requirements

03:48:32.690 --> 03:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:48:36.349 --> 03:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
our regulatory framework is is huge it's
 
03:48:38.269 --> 03:48:38.279 align:start position:0%
I would say it's about four times the
 
03:48:39.950 --> 03:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
size of Labor
 
03:48:42.710 --> 03:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
um and we have about similar budgets and
 
03:48:44.990 --> 03:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know similar size staff
 
03:48:47.150 --> 03:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
um just because of we have 50-something
 
03:48:49.190 --> 03:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
practice acts plus our own practice acts
 
03:48:52.250 --> 03:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
it's just it's just quite voluminous and
 
03:48:54.530 --> 03:48:54.540 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of conflicts so it has
 
03:48:57.469 --> 03:48:57.479 align:start position:0%
required extensive effort by attorneys
 
03:49:00.469 --> 03:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
to do this work what we've observed in
 
03:49:02.349 --> 03:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
the past is that staff
 
03:49:04.849 --> 03:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
web words have not necessarily
 
03:49:07.010 --> 03:49:07.020 align:start position:0%
interpreted the law correctly and have
 
03:49:09.650 --> 03:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
implemented processes that are contrary
 
03:49:11.030 --> 03:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
to law and so we feel it's very
 
03:49:13.130 --> 03:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
important to get it right and that we
 
03:49:16.490 --> 03:49:16.500 align:start position:0%
transition any new license type into a
 
03:49:18.710 --> 03:49:18.720 align:start position:0%
new system in a manner that reflects
 
03:49:21.590 --> 03:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
what the statutory directives are so we
 
03:49:23.530 --> 03:49:23.540 align:start position:0%
have reviewed all renewal
 
03:49:26.030 --> 03:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
requirements uh both statutory and
 
03:49:28.370 --> 03:49:28.380 align:start position:0%
Regulatory we are now transitioning to
 
03:49:30.889 --> 03:49:30.899 align:start position:0%
renewing uh to reviewing all initial
 
03:49:33.349 --> 03:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
licensing applications and then and we
 
03:49:35.210 --> 03:49:35.220 align:start position:0%
are developing policies and procedures
 
03:49:36.530 --> 03:49:36.540 align:start position:0%
to reflect
 
03:49:36.540 --> 03:49:37.190 align:start position:0%
to reflect
um

03:49:37.190 --> 03:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:39.170 --> 03:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
the intent of the statue to make sure
 
03:49:41.750 --> 03:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
that we have internal controls
 
03:49:43.790 --> 03:49:43.800 align:start position:0%
all of that takes a lot of work and
 
03:49:45.710 --> 03:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
that's why I think this Governor's
 
03:49:48.530 --> 03:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
recommended budget is really intended to
 
03:49:50.990 --> 03:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
permit us to continue to achieve those
 
03:49:51.000 --> 03:49:52.910 align:start position:0%
permit us to continue to achieve those
initiatives

03:49:52.910 --> 03:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
initiatives
 
03:49:52.920 --> 03:49:54.469 align:start position:0%
initiatives
um

03:49:54.469 --> 03:49:54.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:57.170 --> 03:49:57.180 align:start position:0%
we it it does propose an increase in
 
03:50:00.530 --> 03:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
Appropriations primarily and in the
 
03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
following classes Personnel related
 
03:50:06.490 --> 03:50:06.500 align:start position:0%
costs and Class 10 and class 60
 
03:50:09.650 --> 03:50:09.660 align:start position:0%
and then you know as well as some some
 
03:50:12.710 --> 03:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
other related
 
03:50:15.590 --> 03:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
overhead costs you know the lease for
 
03:50:17.450 --> 03:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
example which is contemplated in class
 
03:50:21.110 --> 03:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
22 as well as class 30 which has to do
 
03:50:24.530 --> 03:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
with replacing our depreciated vehicles
 
03:50:27.290 --> 03:50:27.300 align:start position:0%
what I Envision though is that as we
 
03:50:30.830 --> 03:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
gear up we're we're expending great
 
03:50:34.849 --> 03:50:34.859 align:start position:0%
effort utilizing our existing staff to
 
03:50:37.490 --> 03:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
continue to allow the agency to function
 
03:50:40.130 --> 03:50:40.140 align:start position:0%
while cleaning up the mess on the side
 
03:50:43.070 --> 03:50:43.080 align:start position:0%
and then at some point when we get to
 
03:50:45.769 --> 03:50:45.779 align:start position:0%
the end which should be sometime in fy25
 
03:50:48.349 --> 03:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
we will we will realize that we don't
 
03:50:49.849 --> 03:50:49.859 align:start position:0%
need the same amount of administrative
 
03:50:51.550 --> 03:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
support to continue
 
03:50:54.170 --> 03:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
so I fully anticipate that once our
 
03:50:56.150 --> 03:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
initiatives are completed we will see
 
03:50:58.190 --> 03:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
Savings in both class 10 and class 60
 
03:51:01.370 --> 03:51:01.380 align:start position:0%
due to redo reduced staff support that's
 
03:51:04.309 --> 03:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
necessary and we we anticipate achieving
 
03:51:07.309 --> 03:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
that through attrition of course if at
 
03:51:08.570 --> 03:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
all possible
 
03:51:08.580 --> 03:51:09.710 align:start position:0%
all possible
um

03:51:09.710 --> 03:51:09.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:13.010 --> 03:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
so if we go through class items in a
 
03:51:16.429 --> 03:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
little bit greater detail class 10 we
 
03:51:20.210 --> 03:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
are proposing to convert six existing
 
03:51:21.830 --> 03:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
temporary positions to permanent
 
03:51:24.889 --> 03:51:24.899 align:start position:0%
positions so they are already working in
 
03:51:27.530 --> 03:51:27.540 align:start position:0%
the agency on the initiatives that I've
 
03:51:27.540 --> 03:51:28.750 align:start position:0%
the agency on the initiatives that I've
mentioned

03:51:28.750 --> 03:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:51:32.870 --> 03:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
these are higher level positions and on
 
03:51:34.729 --> 03:51:34.739 align:start position:0%
the next page they're they're spelled
 
03:51:36.349 --> 03:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
out there are two business analyst
 
03:51:39.290 --> 03:51:39.300 align:start position:0%
positions those are basically in our I.T
 
03:51:42.769 --> 03:51:42.779 align:start position:0%
group two attorneys an administrator
 
03:51:44.990 --> 03:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
who's dedicated to establishing internal
 
03:51:47.090 --> 03:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
controls and a licensing supervisor
 
03:51:48.590 --> 03:51:48.600 align:start position:0%
which was really just necessary to
 
03:51:52.130 --> 03:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
ensure compliance with the law
 
03:51:55.010 --> 03:51:55.020 align:start position:0%
class 22 was our move to Eagle Square
 
03:51:57.650 --> 03:51:57.660 align:start position:0%
which you may remember we previously
 
03:52:01.250 --> 03:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
were in Philbrook and DHHS needed the
 
03:52:04.250 --> 03:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
building for transitional housing so we
 
03:52:06.830 --> 03:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
left and procured at least space but it
 
03:52:09.410 --> 03:52:09.420 align:start position:0%
was done I would say virtually overnight
 
03:52:12.469 --> 03:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
but it was in 30 days and
 
03:52:15.010 --> 03:52:15.020 align:start position:0%
um our lease is expensive as you can see
 
03:52:18.349 --> 03:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
in class 22 so we are already planning
 
03:52:21.229 --> 03:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
ahead preparing for when that least ends
 
03:52:24.050 --> 03:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
exploring all options as to whether
 
03:52:26.450 --> 03:52:26.460 align:start position:0%
there's any way to reduce our overhead
 
03:52:29.269 --> 03:52:29.279 align:start position:0%
with respect to class 22.
 
03:52:32.290 --> 03:52:32.300 align:start position:0%
class 30 the governor's proposed budget
 
03:52:39.349 --> 03:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
proposes 252 500 dollars in FY 2024 this
 
03:52:41.330 --> 03:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
was largely intended to replace fully
 
03:52:43.190 --> 03:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
depreciated vehicles
 
03:52:46.370 --> 03:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
we do not believe that is that is
 
03:52:50.750 --> 03:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
um still needed as we were able to
 
03:52:50.760 --> 03:52:51.830 align:start position:0%
um still needed as we were able to
um

03:52:51.830 --> 03:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:53.990 --> 03:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
we're we we are able to purchase some
 
03:52:55.849 --> 03:52:55.859 align:start position:0%
Vehicles this year there was a question
 
03:52:57.469 --> 03:52:57.479 align:start position:0%
at the time of the budget it's creation
 
03:52:58.790 --> 03:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
whether Vehicles would be available
 
03:53:00.469 --> 03:53:00.479 align:start position:0%
because that's been a long-standing
 
03:53:02.929 --> 03:53:02.939 align:start position:0%
issue but we do believe that we are
 
03:53:04.429 --> 03:53:04.439 align:start position:0%
going to be able to purchase them this
 
03:53:07.250 --> 03:53:07.260 align:start position:0%
year so the large bulk of the funds that
 
03:53:09.290 --> 03:53:09.300 align:start position:0%
have been proposed in class 30 we don't
 
03:53:12.349 --> 03:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
believe that we will actually need
 
03:53:14.990 --> 03:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
um class 46 the increase there is
 
03:53:17.570 --> 03:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
largely for the Board of Medicine for
 
03:53:17.580 --> 03:53:18.969 align:start position:0%
largely for the Board of Medicine for
Consultants

03:53:18.969 --> 03:53:18.979 align:start position:0%
Consultants
 
03:53:21.349 --> 03:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
their current contract for their
 
03:53:23.150 --> 03:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
statutorily required physician
 
03:53:26.030 --> 03:53:26.040 align:start position:0%
investigator is much more expensive than
 
03:53:27.910 --> 03:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
in years prior
 
03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:53:30.000 --> 03:53:30.889 align:start position:0%
and so
um

03:53:30.889 --> 03:53:30.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
because it's required by Statute you
 
03:53:36.710 --> 03:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
know we we believe that we need to have
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
Appropriations in order to fully fund
 
03:53:41.389 --> 03:53:41.399 align:start position:0%
that statutory requirement
 
03:53:44.570 --> 03:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
of course class 60 benefits and then
 
03:53:46.910 --> 03:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
class 531 I wanted to touch upon this
 
03:53:46.920 --> 03:53:48.190 align:start position:0%
class 531 I wanted to touch upon this
because

03:53:48.190 --> 03:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:53:53.330 --> 03:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
this is a required program for nursing
 
03:53:55.910 --> 03:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's a voluntary program for other
 
03:53:57.590 --> 03:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
health care professions it's the
 
03:53:59.450 --> 03:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
professionals health program
 
03:54:03.830 --> 03:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
what this is is if an individual
 
03:54:03.840 --> 03:54:04.610 align:start position:0%
what this is is if an individual
um

03:54:04.610 --> 03:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:08.210 --> 03:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
has substance use disorder issues
 
03:54:11.870 --> 03:54:11.880 align:start position:0%
um or is in Burnout they can voluntarily
 
03:54:14.150 --> 03:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
enter this program which can essentially
 
03:54:16.130 --> 03:54:16.140 align:start position:0%
assist them in getting back into the
 
03:54:19.010 --> 03:54:19.020 align:start position:0%
workforce in a safe manner on the flip
 
03:54:22.070 --> 03:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
side if we we can order them to
 
03:54:23.870 --> 03:54:23.880 align:start position:0%
participate pursuant to disciplinary
 
03:54:26.889 --> 03:54:26.899 align:start position:0%
action that line item
 
03:54:29.870 --> 03:54:29.880 align:start position:0%
represents the cost of the contract that
 
03:54:31.729 --> 03:54:31.739 align:start position:0%
was approved by governor and Council so
 
03:54:35.469 --> 03:54:35.479 align:start position:0%
that's why there was an increase there
 
03:54:40.849 --> 03:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
and it's fully funded through fees for
 
03:54:43.610 --> 03:54:43.620 align:start position:0%
that specific program and it's held in a
 
03:54:45.530 --> 03:54:45.540 align:start position:0%
dedicated non-lapsing fund so I just
 
03:54:47.990 --> 03:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to make note of that
 
03:54:50.389 --> 03:54:50.399 align:start position:0%
we do plan on utilizing existing agency
 
03:54:53.030 --> 03:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
funding for these increases I think in
 
03:54:55.010 --> 03:54:55.020 align:start position:0%
years past we've we've observed
 
03:54:57.050 --> 03:54:57.060 align:start position:0%
significant lapses to the general fund
 
03:54:59.210 --> 03:54:59.220 align:start position:0%
this budget this proposed budget does
 
03:55:02.630 --> 03:55:02.640 align:start position:0%
not contemplate uh really much of a
 
03:55:05.290 --> 03:55:05.300 align:start position:0%
lapse at all this year
 
03:55:08.030 --> 03:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to protect our Revenue
 
03:55:11.630 --> 03:55:11.640 align:start position:0%
because uh because the licensing renewal
 
03:55:11.640 --> 03:55:13.250 align:start position:0%
because uh because the licensing renewal
Cycles

03:55:13.250 --> 03:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
Cycles
 
03:55:16.550 --> 03:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
um vary but based on prior figures we
 
03:55:19.130 --> 03:55:19.140 align:start position:0%
are projecting a revenue at the close of
 
03:55:21.410 --> 03:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year about 15.4 million
 
03:55:21.420 --> 03:55:22.330 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year about 15.4 million
dollars

03:55:22.330 --> 03:55:22.340 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:55:25.370 --> 03:55:25.380 align:start position:0%
and so consistent with that we believe
 
03:55:28.010 --> 03:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
that we could fully fund this Governor's
 
03:55:29.929 --> 03:55:29.939 align:start position:0%
proposed budget with existing agency
 
03:55:29.939 --> 03:55:32.590 align:start position:0%
proposed budget with existing agency
funds

03:55:32.590 --> 03:55:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:35.510 --> 03:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
we um turning to the next page we
 
03:55:37.849 --> 03:55:37.859 align:start position:0%
discuss the two new positions but I also
 
03:55:40.309 --> 03:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
wanted to note that we had requested
 
03:55:42.650 --> 03:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
that if these positions were not
 
03:55:44.570 --> 03:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
converted to permanent positions that we
 
03:55:46.429 --> 03:55:46.439 align:start position:0%
would need to at least continue them on
 
03:55:50.630 --> 03:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
a temporary full-time basis which is why
 
03:55:50.640 --> 03:55:51.650 align:start position:0%
a temporary full-time basis which is why
um

03:55:51.650 --> 03:55:51.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:53.269 --> 03:55:53.279 align:start position:0%
certain you know certain amount of
 
03:55:56.090 --> 03:55:56.100 align:start position:0%
benefits but as well as class 59 funds
 
03:56:00.170 --> 03:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
were requested if as if those positions
 
03:56:02.450 --> 03:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
are established we do not believe that
 
03:56:03.910 --> 03:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
we would need
 
03:56:09.229 --> 03:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
approximately 368 000 for FY 24 and 378
 
03:56:13.189 --> 03:56:13.199 align:start position:0%
000 for fy25 in class 59 and the
 
03:56:15.349 --> 03:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
corresponding benefits that go along
 
03:56:17.510 --> 03:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
with that we just we just feel like it's
 
03:56:19.490 --> 03:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
very important that we continue to
 
03:56:21.170 --> 03:56:21.180 align:start position:0%
support with the staff that are in
 
03:56:23.389 --> 03:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
existence and in order to achieve those
 
03:56:27.889 --> 03:56:27.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:31.790 --> 03:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so is the ones in the book
 
03:56:35.330 --> 03:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
um 59s or tens
 
03:56:35.340 --> 03:56:36.950 align:start position:0%
um 59s or tens
36.

03:56:36.950 --> 03:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
36.
 
03:56:38.570 --> 03:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
are they
 
03:56:42.830 --> 03:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
they're so actually so 59 now they're 59
 
03:56:45.110 --> 03:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
now and we didn't know if we would we
 
03:56:46.550 --> 03:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
were kind of hedging our bets we didn't
 
03:56:48.250 --> 03:56:48.260 align:start position:0%
know if we would get them in class then
 
03:56:51.830 --> 03:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
and so requested that we can continue to
 
03:56:54.469 --> 03:56:54.479 align:start position:0%
have appropriated funds for class 59
 
03:56:58.189 --> 03:56:58.199 align:start position:0%
but our plan was if that the class 59
 
03:57:00.050 --> 03:57:00.060 align:start position:0%
was really intended to just continue the
 
03:57:03.170 --> 03:57:03.180 align:start position:0%
temporary positions that we have now
 
03:57:05.389 --> 03:57:05.399 align:start position:0%
um but if converted to 10 which they are
 
03:57:06.830 --> 03:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
also included in 10 we wouldn't
 
03:57:08.570 --> 03:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
necessarily need those funds in class
 
03:57:08.580 --> 03:57:13.910 align:start position:0%
necessarily need those funds in class
59.

03:57:13.910 --> 03:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:16.550 --> 03:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
because I I notice maybe these are the
 
03:57:16.560 --> 03:57:17.750 align:start position:0%
because I I notice maybe these are the
ones

03:57:17.750 --> 03:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
ones
 
03:57:21.889 --> 03:57:21.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:21.899 --> 03:57:22.729 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:57:22.729 --> 03:57:22.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:26.450 --> 03:57:26.460 align:start position:0%
licensing board Administration there's a
 
03:57:28.990 --> 03:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
new set of 59s
 
03:57:33.769 --> 03:57:33.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:36.410 --> 03:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
yeah yes and we don't believe that we
 
03:57:38.450 --> 03:57:38.460 align:start position:0%
would need to continue with those funds
 
03:57:42.050 --> 03:57:42.060 align:start position:0%
if these positions were converted
 
03:57:43.670 --> 03:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
um to permanent
 
03:57:45.830 --> 03:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
and it'll be roughly a watch yeah
 
03:57:45.840 --> 03:57:51.530 align:start position:0%
and it'll be roughly a watch yeah
essentially

03:57:51.530 --> 03:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:53.809 --> 03:57:53.819 align:start position:0%
so I did want to address
 
03:57:56.450 --> 03:57:56.460 align:start position:0%
um what we believe may be the
 
03:57:58.849 --> 03:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
anticipated reductions in Revenue
 
03:58:01.429 --> 03:58:01.439 align:start position:0%
um as a result of uh the governor's
 
03:58:04.269 --> 03:58:04.279 align:start position:0%
proposed trailer bill in hb2
 
03:58:06.710 --> 03:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
we've done the analysis as you know the
 
03:58:08.630 --> 03:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
governor has proposed to eliminate
 
03:58:10.790 --> 03:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
certain license types many of which are
 
03:58:14.510 --> 03:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
within oplc we believe that that would
 
03:58:18.290 --> 03:58:18.300 align:start position:0%
result in a reduction of Revenue across
 
03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
the biennium of approximately 953
 
03:58:24.849 --> 03:58:24.859 align:start position:0%
um thousand
 
03:58:26.710 --> 03:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
that said
 
03:58:29.450 --> 03:58:29.460 align:start position:0%
we believe that there are opportunities
 
03:58:32.330 --> 03:58:32.340 align:start position:0%
for potential increases in Revenue so it
 
03:58:34.189 --> 03:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say whether we would
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
actually see a net loss the governor has
 
03:58:40.389 --> 03:58:40.399 align:start position:0%
proposed uh essentially Universal
 
03:58:43.969 --> 03:58:43.979 align:start position:0%
licensure recognition which we do
 
03:58:47.210 --> 03:58:47.220 align:start position:0%
believe would likely result in increased
 
03:58:50.030 --> 03:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
number of applications to our office the
 
03:58:51.950 --> 03:58:51.960 align:start position:0%
only data that I can point to really is
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
the emergency licensing process because
 
03:58:56.269 --> 03:58:56.279 align:start position:0%
we believe that the criteria would be
 
03:58:59.090 --> 03:58:59.100 align:start position:0%
basically the same and we observed 22
 
03:59:00.769 --> 03:59:00.779 align:start position:0%
000 additional licensing applications
 
03:59:04.370 --> 03:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
that year 63 percent of psychologists in
 
03:59:05.929 --> 03:59:05.939 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who are practicing were
 
03:59:07.610 --> 03:59:07.620 align:start position:0%
doing so under only under an emergency
 
03:59:11.090 --> 03:59:11.100 align:start position:0%
license so it is likely that if that
 
03:59:13.070 --> 03:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
change were made we could actually see
 
03:59:16.010 --> 03:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
an increase in Revenue but it's it's
 
03:59:18.889 --> 03:59:18.899 align:start position:0%
it's still unclear because we don't have
 
03:59:21.290 --> 03:59:21.300 align:start position:0%
access to the data
 
03:59:23.809 --> 03:59:23.819 align:start position:0%
so I do have a question on that I'm
 
03:59:25.790 --> 03:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
trying to follow you we're going to lose
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps a million dollars but by
 
03:59:30.950 --> 03:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
allowing people from other states to
 
03:59:33.469 --> 03:59:33.479 align:start position:0%
accept their license why aren't they
 
03:59:35.510 --> 03:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
applying now
 
03:59:39.650 --> 03:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
to become part of the state's system if
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
you will our requirements much more
 
03:59:43.910 --> 03:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
stringent is that why they're not
 
03:59:43.920 --> 03:59:45.229 align:start position:0%
stringent is that why they're not
applying

03:59:45.229 --> 03:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
applying
 
03:59:48.349 --> 03:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
is a fee different
 
03:59:50.330 --> 03:59:50.340 align:start position:0%
I think it's tough to tell to be honest
 
03:59:52.250 --> 03:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
and it varies by profession I will tell
 
03:59:54.710 --> 03:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
you for for example psychology has much
 
03:59:56.689 --> 03:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
more stringent requirements you have to
 
03:59:58.610 --> 03:59:58.620 align:start position:0%
go back and find your supervisor who may
 
03:59:59.929 --> 03:59:59.939 align:start position:0%
be deceased you have to get your
 
04:00:02.330 --> 04:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
transcripts you have to get you know all
 
04:00:05.030 --> 04:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
of this extra stuff even if you've been
 
04:00:07.490 --> 04:00:07.500 align:start position:0%
practicing for 30 years and what's
 
04:00:09.590 --> 04:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
contemplated is that you would just have
 
04:00:11.150 --> 04:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
to present the fact that you have a
 
04:00:12.950 --> 04:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
valid license in another state that's in
 
04:00:15.790 --> 04:00:15.800 align:start position:0%
good standing pay the fee and come on in
 
04:00:18.050 --> 04:00:18.060 align:start position:0%
anecdotally I have you know people have
 
04:00:19.550 --> 04:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
explained they don't like coming to New
 
04:00:21.469 --> 04:00:21.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because the process is so you
 
04:00:24.790 --> 04:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
know ridiculous and their words not mine
 
04:00:27.530 --> 04:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
that said there are other license types
 
04:00:31.070 --> 04:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
within oplc that are that are perfectly
 
04:00:33.110 --> 04:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
um streamlined and efficient so it
 
04:00:36.290 --> 04:00:36.300 align:start position:0%
really is it really is tough to tell
 
04:00:38.870 --> 04:00:38.880 align:start position:0%
so just to follow up to that you're
 
04:00:41.210 --> 04:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
saying this is a streamlining
 
04:00:43.790 --> 04:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
but I see your
 
04:00:46.550 --> 04:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
funds are necessary funds to run your
 
04:00:48.229 --> 04:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
organization will be going up
 
04:00:48.239 --> 04:00:49.969 align:start position:0%
organization will be going up
substantially

04:00:49.969 --> 04:00:49.979 align:start position:0%
substantially
 
04:00:52.670 --> 04:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
and you're adding more staff so
 
04:00:54.650 --> 04:00:54.660 align:start position:0%
help me try to get my head around the
 
04:00:56.870 --> 04:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
fact that it's going to be better for us
 
04:00:58.729 --> 04:00:58.739 align:start position:0%
if we lower the amount of money we're
 
04:01:00.530 --> 04:01:00.540 align:start position:0%
coming in it's increasing costs and
 
04:01:02.389 --> 04:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
we're adding more employees
 
04:01:04.670 --> 04:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
I think one of the challenges with oplc
 
04:01:06.950 --> 04:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
is that it it wasn't set up for success
 
04:01:10.189 --> 04:01:10.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of resources at the beginning
 
04:01:10.199 --> 04:01:10.910 align:start position:0%
in terms of resources at the beginning
um

04:01:10.910 --> 04:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:13.610 --> 04:01:13.620 align:start position:0%
in order to really undo the dysfunction
 
04:01:16.490 --> 04:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
that was the licensing process created
 
04:01:18.170 --> 04:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
by all of these independent regulatory
 
04:01:19.790 --> 04:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
boards that have no expertise in
 
04:01:22.309 --> 04:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
administrative law and procedure we need
 
04:01:25.070 --> 04:01:25.080 align:start position:0%
we need resources to do that I think
 
04:01:27.710 --> 04:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
that's a short-term use of resources and
 
04:01:29.809 --> 04:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
that's why we are proposing this
 
04:01:32.150 --> 04:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
increase in Appropriations to get
 
04:01:33.830 --> 04:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
through these initiatives
 
04:01:36.050 --> 04:01:36.060 align:start position:0%
but like I mentioned I think after those
 
04:01:38.269 --> 04:01:38.279 align:start position:0%
initiatives are completed we will see
 
04:01:40.370 --> 04:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
that we don't need as much staff we
 
04:01:43.130 --> 04:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
don't need as much overhead
 
04:01:44.870 --> 04:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
um it's possible we may not need as much
 
04:01:44.880 --> 04:01:45.969 align:start position:0%
um it's possible we may not need as much
space

04:01:45.969 --> 04:01:45.979 align:start position:0%
space
 
04:01:49.309 --> 04:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
but we won't really know that until we
 
04:01:51.050 --> 04:01:51.060 align:start position:0%
get through these initiatives to really
 
04:01:54.349 --> 04:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
move our processes to an electronic
 
04:01:56.450 --> 04:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
portal that's not a manually driven
 
04:01:56.460 --> 04:01:59.210 align:start position:0%
portal that's not a manually driven
process

04:01:59.210 --> 04:01:59.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:01.070 --> 04:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
I have some more questions but I'll
 
04:02:03.469 --> 04:02:03.479 align:start position:0%
yield to represent camberells thank you
 
04:02:07.130 --> 04:02:07.140 align:start position:0%
Mr chair out of the 1061 positions you
 
04:02:08.809 --> 04:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
04:02:11.450 --> 04:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
that was a mistake okay so out of the
 
04:02:13.790 --> 04:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
positions you currently have
 
04:02:16.189 --> 04:02:16.199 align:start position:0%
um what is the vacancy rate are you
 
04:02:17.990 --> 04:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
fully staffed or we are not fully
 
04:02:20.330 --> 04:02:20.340 align:start position:0%
staffed um well I should say we have
 
04:02:22.550 --> 04:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
many vacant temporary positions right
 
04:02:26.410 --> 04:02:26.420 align:start position:0%
now we have 32 positions that are vacant
 
04:02:28.910 --> 04:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
so with our temporary and our permanent
 
04:02:31.309 --> 04:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
positions combined we actually have 126
 
04:02:33.469 --> 04:02:33.479 align:start position:0%
authorized positions 32 of which
 
04:02:35.750 --> 04:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
combined are vacant
 
04:02:38.510 --> 04:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
we only selected six to try to move to
 
04:02:40.370 --> 04:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
permanent and they are already filled
 
04:02:40.380 --> 04:02:42.530 align:start position:0%
permanent and they are already filled
positions

04:02:42.530 --> 04:02:42.540 align:start position:0%
positions
 
04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah and uh what are your what
 
04:02:48.170 --> 04:02:48.180 align:start position:0%
do you believe are your chances of being
 
04:02:49.849 --> 04:02:49.859 align:start position:0%
successful and not only filling those
 
04:02:52.729 --> 04:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
but putting in the additional positions
 
04:02:55.070 --> 04:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
are you having a hard time hiring right
 
04:02:57.229 --> 04:02:57.239 align:start position:0%
now I think our challenges right now are
 
04:02:59.330 --> 04:02:59.340 align:start position:0%
hiring at our licensing clerk level
 
04:03:00.950 --> 04:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
because it's it's an entry level
 
04:03:00.960 --> 04:03:02.870 align:start position:0%
because it's it's an entry level
position

04:03:02.870 --> 04:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
position
 
04:03:06.050 --> 04:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
um and it it's just a challenge to hire
 
04:03:07.969 --> 04:03:07.979 align:start position:0%
those types of individuals which is why
 
04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
I think it's so critical that we move
 
04:03:13.070 --> 04:03:13.080 align:start position:0%
away from manual processes that require
 
04:03:16.670 --> 04:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
them to you know review the paper and we
 
04:03:19.550 --> 04:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
allow customer self-service through an
 
04:03:21.469 --> 04:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
electronic platform and that's what
 
04:03:23.269 --> 04:03:23.279 align:start position:0%
these initiatives are intended to do is
 
04:03:25.750 --> 04:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
really transform the way we do business
 
04:03:29.030 --> 04:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
the six positions that we are requesting
 
04:03:32.570 --> 04:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
in this budget are currently filled in
 
04:03:34.250 --> 04:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
temporary positions obviously they would
 
04:03:35.870 --> 04:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
have to apply because that's the process
 
04:03:41.750 --> 04:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:50.950 --> 04:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:55.969 --> 04:03:55.979 align:start position:0%
get a feeling that seven advisors
 
04:03:58.610 --> 04:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
what makes a difference
 
04:04:02.630 --> 04:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
certainly so these are boards that
 
04:04:02.640 --> 04:04:03.889 align:start position:0%
certainly so these are boards that
advise

04:04:03.889 --> 04:04:03.899 align:start position:0%
advise
 
04:04:06.050 --> 04:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
04:04:08.809 --> 04:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
um regarding licensure criteria what the
 
04:04:11.150 --> 04:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
rules should be for example massage
 
04:04:14.210 --> 04:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
therapy is an Advisory board so they
 
04:04:16.189 --> 04:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
don't have their independent Authority
 
04:04:18.950 --> 04:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
they have greater State oversight they
 
04:04:21.969 --> 04:04:21.979 align:start position:0%
convene meetings and they review
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
complaints and they make recommendations
 
04:04:26.450 --> 04:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
But ultimately it's the agency's
 
04:04:29.630 --> 04:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
determination about what to do with that
 
04:04:29.640 --> 04:04:30.590 align:start position:0%
determination about what to do with that
complaint

04:04:30.590 --> 04:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
complaint
 
04:04:33.050 --> 04:04:33.060 align:start position:0%
I like that model mainly because it
 
04:04:35.750 --> 04:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
provides the requisite stay oversight
 
04:04:38.689 --> 04:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
um that you know that was deemed
 
04:04:40.429 --> 04:04:40.439 align:start position:0%
necessary out of the Supreme Court case
 
04:04:43.729 --> 04:04:43.739 align:start position:0%
in 2015 North Carolina Dental Delta
 
04:04:43.739 --> 04:04:45.229 align:start position:0%
in 2015 North Carolina Dental Delta
Dental

04:04:45.229 --> 04:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
Dental
 
04:04:47.210 --> 04:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
um essentially you know that said that
 
04:04:49.010 --> 04:04:49.020 align:start position:0%
when you have regulatory boards
 
04:04:51.229 --> 04:04:51.239 align:start position:0%
comprised of active Market participants
 
04:04:54.170 --> 04:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
people in the fields
 
04:04:56.389 --> 04:04:56.399 align:start position:0%
um that the state is not entitled to
 
04:04:59.469 --> 04:04:59.479 align:start position:0%
immunity from antitrust
 
04:05:03.110 --> 04:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
suits and claims unless their state
 
04:05:05.450 --> 04:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
oversight and in the case of advisory
 
04:05:06.889 --> 04:05:06.899 align:start position:0%
boards there is State oversight because
 
04:05:08.809 --> 04:05:08.819 align:start position:0%
there's essentially veto power if for
 
04:05:10.490 --> 04:05:10.500 align:start position:0%
example they would make a decision
 
04:05:12.530 --> 04:05:12.540 align:start position:0%
that's based on anything other than
 
04:05:14.570 --> 04:05:14.580 align:start position:0%
protecting the public and and clear
 
04:05:16.429 --> 04:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
objective standards
 
04:05:19.429 --> 04:05:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
but um I guess I'd like to know a couple
 
04:05:24.830 --> 04:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
of the other boards that are advisory
 
04:05:27.170 --> 04:05:27.180 align:start position:0%
certainly um so it's massage therapy
 
04:05:32.090 --> 04:05:32.100 align:start position:0%
body art Medical Imaging court reporters
 
04:05:44.210 --> 04:05:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:46.070 --> 04:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
I do have a list that I'll give to the
 
04:05:49.309 --> 04:05:49.319 align:start position:0%
entire division they're like 53 54
 
04:05:49.319 --> 04:05:50.570 align:start position:0%
entire division they're like 53 54
different

04:05:50.570 --> 04:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:05:53.870 --> 04:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
areas that we license and just as long
 
04:05:56.870 --> 04:05:56.880 align:start position:0%
as we're on the whole topic once we get
 
04:05:59.809 --> 04:05:59.819 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 with the proposed changes
 
04:06:02.330 --> 04:06:02.340 align:start position:0%
I'm going to send this over to Edna
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
I think some of the problems that we've
 
04:06:06.349 --> 04:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
experienced to be quite candid is that
 
04:06:08.269 --> 04:06:08.279 align:start position:0%
the process was rushed through the
 
04:06:11.150 --> 04:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
finance committee several years ago and
 
04:06:13.490 --> 04:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
so I've reached out to the chair over
 
04:06:16.250 --> 04:06:16.260 align:start position:0%
there to suggest that we move this over
 
04:06:18.290 --> 04:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
they'll have a couple of weeks and give
 
04:06:20.330 --> 04:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
a good look see because I believe there
 
04:06:22.910 --> 04:06:22.920 align:start position:0%
are about 300 pages I was told dealing
 
04:06:25.490 --> 04:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
with these changes and it's a major
 
04:06:28.610 --> 04:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
policy shift for us so I think it should
 
04:06:30.650 --> 04:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
go to the policy committee for their
 
04:06:32.630 --> 04:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations and thoughts
 
04:06:35.030 --> 04:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
so just to let everybody know
 
04:06:35.040 --> 04:06:36.910 align:start position:0%
so just to let everybody know
representative

04:06:36.910 --> 04:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:06:40.570 --> 04:06:40.580 align:start position:0%
representative hatch you have a question
 
04:06:43.490 --> 04:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
that's right representative McGuire
 
04:06:46.370 --> 04:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so to follow up on
 
04:06:48.469 --> 04:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin's question are
 
04:06:51.530 --> 04:06:51.540 align:start position:0%
these boards advising you
 
04:06:53.809 --> 04:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
not so you're the ones that make a
 
04:06:56.750 --> 04:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
decision about uh licensing or not
 
04:06:59.389 --> 04:06:59.399 align:start position:0%
licensing or how to discipline or that
 
04:07:01.309 --> 04:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
sort of stuff is that right correct we
 
04:07:03.530 --> 04:07:03.540 align:start position:0%
we rely heavily on their recommendations
 
04:07:05.630 --> 04:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day and I'll give
 
04:07:08.090 --> 04:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
you a prime example the board of body
 
04:07:10.849 --> 04:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
art practitioners is an Advisory Board a
 
04:07:13.910 --> 04:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
couple years back they decided that they
 
04:07:15.889 --> 04:07:15.899 align:start position:0%
would like to create a license type for
 
04:07:18.490 --> 04:07:18.500 align:start position:0%
microblading which would allow
 
04:07:20.689 --> 04:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
estheticians which are licensed under a
 
04:07:23.750 --> 04:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
different board to perform
 
04:07:25.790 --> 04:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
um provide tattoo services in a certain
 
04:07:27.950 --> 04:07:27.960 align:start position:0%
limited scope they pursued that
 
04:07:29.450 --> 04:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
legislation I believe is with
 
04:07:31.429 --> 04:07:31.439 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
04:07:34.910 --> 04:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
um and uh and it was successful and then
 
04:07:36.590 --> 04:07:36.600 align:start position:0%
it came time to Draft rules and they
 
04:07:38.990 --> 04:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
heard from all of their colleagues in
 
04:07:41.389 --> 04:07:41.399 align:start position:0%
the community who did not want an influx
 
04:07:43.250 --> 04:07:43.260 align:start position:0%
of individuals competing with them and
 
04:07:44.450 --> 04:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
they decided oh I don't want to write
 
04:07:44.460 --> 04:07:45.410 align:start position:0%
they decided oh I don't want to write
rules

04:07:45.410 --> 04:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
rules
 
04:07:48.110 --> 04:07:48.120 align:start position:0%
and the agency was able to say well this
 
04:07:50.090 --> 04:07:50.100 align:start position:0%
is our statutory directive we have to so
 
04:07:51.650 --> 04:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
I would appreciate your advice but
 
04:07:52.670 --> 04:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
otherwise we're just going to move
 
04:07:55.610 --> 04:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
forward and that's what we did and but
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
that's a prime example of why I think
 
04:08:00.849 --> 04:08:00.859 align:start position:0%
State oversight can play a critical role
 
04:08:02.929 --> 04:08:02.939 align:start position:0%
we do have to have a collaborative
 
04:08:04.729 --> 04:08:04.739 align:start position:0%
relationship because you really do need
 
04:08:07.309 --> 04:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
to marry the expertise of the profession
 
04:08:11.150 --> 04:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
with expertise of you know overseeing a
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
state agency but um but it's important I
 
04:08:17.689 --> 04:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
think to have a supervision
 
04:08:21.769 --> 04:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
thank you going back to um this list of
 
04:08:25.130 --> 04:08:25.140 align:start position:0%
reduced Revenue the pink thing
 
04:08:25.140 --> 04:08:26.229 align:start position:0%
reduced Revenue the pink thing
um

04:08:26.229 --> 04:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:29.330 --> 04:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
Booth that's not all Barbers right
 
04:08:30.670 --> 04:08:30.680 align:start position:0%
that's that's
 
04:08:34.490 --> 04:08:34.500 align:start position:0%
no it it's their independent contractors
 
04:08:37.610 --> 04:08:37.620 align:start position:0%
within licensed facilities and we did
 
04:08:39.410 --> 04:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
some legislate we did some research we
 
04:08:41.630 --> 04:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
went to archives and what we could
 
04:08:43.910 --> 04:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
figure out was that
 
04:08:47.510 --> 04:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
we think Booth licensure came about as
 
04:08:49.969 --> 04:08:49.979 align:start position:0%
around the time of you know the 1930s
 
04:08:53.630 --> 04:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
when Mary Kay was popular and um it was
 
04:08:56.710 --> 04:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
a mechanism to really Empower female
 
04:08:59.929 --> 04:08:59.939 align:start position:0%
women to own their own businesses I
 
04:09:03.050 --> 04:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
think and so this is that actually
 
04:09:05.389 --> 04:09:05.399 align:start position:0%
elimination and that repeal is supported
 
04:09:07.490 --> 04:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
by the Board of barbering cosmetology
 
04:09:09.410 --> 04:09:09.420 align:start position:0%
and Aesthetics because it doesn't really
 
04:09:12.590 --> 04:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
serve a purpose because the facility is
 
04:09:14.269 --> 04:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
already inspected so they're just
 
04:09:16.969 --> 04:09:16.979 align:start position:0%
inspecting you know 10 people within the
 
04:09:19.429 --> 04:09:19.439 align:start position:0%
same facility that's inspected it's just
 
04:09:25.010 --> 04:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:26.929 --> 04:09:26.939 align:start position:0%
or other questions
 
04:09:29.450 --> 04:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
yes represent cambrells yes thank you Mr
 
04:09:31.189 --> 04:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
chair just to go back you did say that
 
04:09:33.050 --> 04:09:33.060 align:start position:0%
leasing was an opportunity to maybe
 
04:09:35.269 --> 04:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
reduce costs uh when does the current
 
04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:38.640 --> 04:09:46.429 align:start position:0%
 
2032.

04:09:46.429 --> 04:09:46.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:47.990 --> 04:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
I mean there are always opportunities
 
04:09:49.969 --> 04:09:49.979 align:start position:0%
right for the state to to take a
 
04:09:52.010 --> 04:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
different direction but um we're not in
 
04:09:53.750 --> 04:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
a position right now to do that but we
 
04:09:56.330 --> 04:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
are planning for that
 
04:09:59.630 --> 04:09:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:02.150 --> 04:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
so in addition to potential unknown
 
04:10:04.250 --> 04:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
increases in Revenue lastly I just
 
04:10:06.710 --> 04:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention that we could see a
 
04:10:10.130 --> 04:10:10.140 align:start position:0%
potential decreases in expenditures if
 
04:10:11.990 --> 04:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
what the governor has proposed in house
 
04:10:15.410 --> 04:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
poll 2 were to pass certainly the fact
 
04:10:16.969 --> 04:10:16.979 align:start position:0%
that we have to support a large number
 
04:10:21.530 --> 04:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
of boards has a cost component to it you
 
04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
know through administrative burdens and
 
04:10:24.650 --> 04:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
I think we could see a reduction in
 
04:10:26.330 --> 04:10:26.340 align:start position:0%
those costs
 
04:10:28.670 --> 04:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
um board members also receive per diems
 
04:10:31.130 --> 04:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
they receive other reimbursements we
 
04:10:33.290 --> 04:10:33.300 align:start position:0%
could see a reduction in that and then
 
04:10:34.610 --> 04:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
also see a reduced need for an
 
04:10:36.229 --> 04:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
administrative support in class 10 and
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
class 60 due to streamline licensing and
 
04:10:40.849 --> 04:10:40.859 align:start position:0%
disciplinary procedures and ultimately I
 
04:10:41.990 --> 04:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
think that's where we'll end up
 
04:10:45.830 --> 04:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
regardless of hb2 once we see that our
 
04:10:47.630 --> 04:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
procedures are a little bit more refined
 
04:10:50.689 --> 04:10:50.699 align:start position:0%
after this next biennium we anticipate
 
04:10:52.849 --> 04:10:52.859 align:start position:0%
that with our current staffer or even
 
04:10:54.229 --> 04:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
reduced staff we will be able to
 
04:10:56.210 --> 04:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
maintain agency operations
 
04:10:57.710 --> 04:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
with that I'd be happy to answer any
 
04:11:00.290 --> 04:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
additional questions
 
04:11:02.750 --> 04:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
for the director representative McGuire
 
04:11:05.990 --> 04:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so can I assume that all this
 
04:11:08.870 --> 04:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
new stuff eliminating those licenses and
 
04:11:11.750 --> 04:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
boards and so on is not really reflected
 
04:11:14.809 --> 04:11:14.819 align:start position:0%
in the budget yet is that right no it's
 
04:11:14.819 --> 04:11:15.590 align:start position:0%
in the budget yet is that right no it's
not

04:11:15.590 --> 04:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:11:18.349 --> 04:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
um because what's proposed also is to
 
04:11:21.170 --> 04:11:21.180 align:start position:0%
transfer certain boards to us we've seen
 
04:11:22.849 --> 04:11:22.859 align:start position:0%
those budgets but we don't know what the
 
04:11:25.309 --> 04:11:25.319 align:start position:0%
revenue is for those boards so that
 
04:11:28.189 --> 04:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
would still have to be incorporated
 
04:11:30.050 --> 04:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
you're working on a fiscal note for
 
04:11:34.010 --> 04:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:39.290 --> 04:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:41.689 --> 04:11:41.699 align:start position:0%
some point Mr Hoffman
 
04:11:44.689 --> 04:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
once House Bill 2 was introduced we
 
04:11:48.349 --> 04:11:48.359 align:start position:0%
usually send it to all the agencies
 
04:11:48.359 --> 04:11:49.070 align:start position:0%
usually send it to all the agencies
um

04:11:49.070 --> 04:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:51.650 --> 04:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
we rarely have a completed fiscal note
 
04:11:53.929 --> 04:11:53.939 align:start position:0%
just because the process involves
 
04:12:01.189 --> 04:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:03.349 --> 04:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
for those of you new to finance Mr
 
04:12:05.090 --> 04:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
Hoffman and I were joking earlier that
 
04:12:07.189 --> 04:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
all the balls are just all up in the air
 
04:12:08.809 --> 04:12:08.819 align:start position:0%
right now we hope they fall in the right
 
04:12:11.450 --> 04:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
place in a couple of weeks but they
 
04:12:15.469 --> 04:12:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:17.330 --> 04:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
further questions just representative
 
04:12:22.490 --> 04:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:25.370 --> 04:12:25.380 align:start position:0%
requirement for these categories would
 
04:12:25.380 --> 04:12:26.630 align:start position:0%
requirement for these categories would
be

04:12:26.630 --> 04:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
taken away and otherwise when could they
 
04:12:31.610 --> 04:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
start operating without a license do you
 
04:12:33.469 --> 04:12:33.479 align:start position:0%
have a sense of that I think that would
 
04:12:35.510 --> 04:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
be based on the effective date provided
 
04:12:37.910 --> 04:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
in hp2 I'm just wondering if you yeah
 
04:12:40.370 --> 04:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
but I wondered I mean we hope that we
 
04:12:42.469 --> 04:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
have a budget on July 1 and if that's
 
04:12:44.510 --> 04:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
the case that it's effective on July 1
 
04:12:47.090 --> 04:12:47.100 align:start position:0%
and so we could see some changes at that
 
04:12:47.100 --> 04:12:49.610 align:start position:0%
and so we could see some changes at that
point

04:12:49.610 --> 04:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:52.189 --> 04:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh I do have one
 
04:12:54.410 --> 04:12:54.420 align:start position:0%
more so obviously there's been a lot of
 
04:12:56.630 --> 04:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
discussion among the different boards
 
04:12:58.490 --> 04:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
that you're overseeing now what's been
 
04:13:00.530 --> 04:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
the general reaction
 
04:13:02.389 --> 04:13:02.399 align:start position:0%
nobody is happy
 
04:13:04.969 --> 04:13:04.979 align:start position:0%
nobody is Happy well
 
04:13:06.830 --> 04:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
we have good relationships with a large
 
04:13:09.290 --> 04:13:09.300 align:start position:0%
majority of boards I think many of them
 
04:13:11.590 --> 04:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
understand the changes that are proposed
 
04:13:14.150 --> 04:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
but they do not like them I think
 
04:13:17.389 --> 04:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
another component of licensure is that
 
04:13:19.610 --> 04:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
which is not really reflected in statute
 
04:13:23.030 --> 04:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
is that licensure can be become part of
 
04:13:25.429 --> 04:13:25.439 align:start position:0%
one's professional identity whether it
 
04:13:26.990 --> 04:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
should or should not and so there are
 
04:13:29.090 --> 04:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
some emotions and feelings surrounding
 
04:13:31.309 --> 04:13:31.319 align:start position:0%
discussions about whether licensure is
 
04:13:32.870 --> 04:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
truly needed in order to protect the
 
04:13:34.790 --> 04:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
public or whether or not we can rely on
 
04:13:38.990 --> 04:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
a less restrictive manner to do so
 
04:13:40.849 --> 04:13:40.859 align:start position:0%
um the agency you know just looks
 
04:13:42.410 --> 04:13:42.420 align:start position:0%
forward to collaborating with the
 
04:13:44.150 --> 04:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
legislature on this process and and
 
04:13:45.650 --> 04:13:45.660 align:start position:0%
working with the boards to kind of help
 
04:13:49.070 --> 04:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
them navigate but we do have different
 
04:13:49.080 --> 04:13:49.849 align:start position:0%
them navigate but we do have different
um

04:13:49.849 --> 04:13:49.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:13:52.490 --> 04:13:52.500 align:start position:0%
different statutory missions well you
 
04:13:54.110 --> 04:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
raise a good point because a number of
 
04:13:55.849 --> 04:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
people will say I'm licensed by the
 
04:13:57.229 --> 04:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
state of the New Hampshire so there's
 
04:14:00.110 --> 04:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
some assurance that it could be safe or
 
04:14:02.570 --> 04:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
there'll be good work done or they're
 
04:14:04.729 --> 04:14:04.739 align:start position:0%
not as you know a con artist or
 
04:14:07.250 --> 04:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
something so I can see where people use
 
04:14:09.229 --> 04:14:09.239 align:start position:0%
that as an advantage
 
04:14:11.750 --> 04:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
so certainly and licensure really is
 
04:14:13.429 --> 04:14:13.439 align:start position:0%
just to ensure that minimum standards
 
04:14:17.630 --> 04:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:20.689 --> 04:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
further questions represent McGuire uh
 
04:14:22.550 --> 04:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative hatch yes yes thank you
 
04:14:25.910 --> 04:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:27.889 --> 04:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
back did you have advisory boards and
 
04:14:30.410 --> 04:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
governance boards
 
04:14:32.570 --> 04:14:32.580 align:start position:0%
how involved are you where they have a
 
04:14:33.830 --> 04:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
governance Force it's just
 
04:14:37.010 --> 04:14:37.020 align:start position:0%
administratively primarily or how do you
 
04:14:37.020 --> 04:14:39.610 align:start position:0%
administratively primarily or how do you
intersect

04:14:39.610 --> 04:14:39.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:43.010 --> 04:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
so I think we have a little bit more
 
04:14:45.710 --> 04:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
um in the game other than you know as
 
04:14:47.030 --> 04:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
opposed to an administrative peer
 
04:14:48.590 --> 04:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
administrative attachment
 
04:14:50.269 --> 04:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
because the office over the last couple
 
04:14:52.969 --> 04:14:52.979 align:start position:0%
of years has obtained certain regulatory
 
04:14:55.370 --> 04:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
Authority for example we now have
 
04:14:57.050 --> 04:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
regulatory authority over licensing
 
04:14:59.530 --> 04:14:59.540 align:start position:0%
procedures and investigative procedures
 
04:15:03.110 --> 04:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
we just uh um promulgated rules for
 
04:15:06.110 --> 04:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
investigative procedures and are now
 
04:15:08.389 --> 04:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
um actually today I filed uh the final
 
04:15:11.570 --> 04:15:11.580 align:start position:0%
proposal for licensing procedures
 
04:15:15.290 --> 04:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
part of the challenge with oplc though
 
04:15:17.450 --> 04:15:17.460 align:start position:0%
is that we're we're trying to work
 
04:15:19.490 --> 04:15:19.500 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with the board so we
 
04:15:21.170 --> 04:15:21.180 align:start position:0%
have gone to each one of them and said
 
04:15:23.210 --> 04:15:23.220 align:start position:0%
can you please repeal your investigative
 
04:15:26.150 --> 04:15:26.160 align:start position:0%
rules so we can use ours
 
04:15:28.550 --> 04:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
um and we're making good Headway but it
 
04:15:30.710 --> 04:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
it just takes time and we anticipate
 
04:15:32.210 --> 04:15:32.220 align:start position:0%
that to be the case with the licensing
 
04:15:34.490 --> 04:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
procedures we could say we have
 
04:15:36.530 --> 04:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
statutory Authority
 
04:15:38.150 --> 04:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
um and at some point we may get to that
 
04:15:40.610 --> 04:15:40.620 align:start position:0%
if we have a couple holdouts but so far
 
04:15:42.050 --> 04:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
we've we've preferred to take a
 
04:15:46.250 --> 04:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:49.710 --> 04:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
yes represent evil so um
 
04:15:49.720 --> 04:15:51.229 align:start position:0%
yes represent evil so um
[Music]

04:15:51.229 --> 04:15:51.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:15:53.870 --> 04:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh license types propose to be
 
04:15:57.550 --> 04:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
eliminated did you influence these
 
04:16:00.050 --> 04:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
categories could you give us some
 
04:16:02.090 --> 04:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
background on how these particular ones
 
04:16:04.250 --> 04:16:04.260 align:start position:0%
were selected
 
04:16:06.769 --> 04:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say I influenced I I was
 
04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
consulted the agency is typically
 
04:16:11.330 --> 04:16:11.340 align:start position:0%
consulted with these types of structural
 
04:16:11.340 --> 04:16:12.650 align:start position:0%
consulted with these types of structural
changes

04:16:12.650 --> 04:16:12.660 align:start position:0%
changes
 
04:16:14.510 --> 04:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
um I can I can say that I think the
 
04:16:17.269 --> 04:16:17.279 align:start position:0%
governor's overall goal is really to
 
04:16:18.950 --> 04:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
ensure that
 
04:16:20.870 --> 04:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
um we are only
 
04:16:20.880 --> 04:16:21.550 align:start position:0%
um we are only
um

04:16:21.550 --> 04:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:24.469 --> 04:16:24.479 align:start position:0%
requiring licensure if it's absolutely
 
04:16:26.450 --> 04:16:26.460 align:start position:0%
necessary to protect the public and is
 
04:16:28.729 --> 04:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
the least restrictive means of doing so
 
04:16:31.010 --> 04:16:31.020 align:start position:0%
you know I can I can tell you licensed
 
04:16:33.229 --> 04:16:33.239 align:start position:0%
nursing assistance for example that's
 
04:16:35.090 --> 04:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
just a duplicative process that already
 
04:16:37.130 --> 04:16:37.140 align:start position:0%
exists because we're mandated by the
 
04:16:38.750 --> 04:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
federal government to maintain a nurse
 
04:16:40.969 --> 04:16:40.979 align:start position:0%
aide registry so
 
04:16:42.889 --> 04:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
um while it's proposed that licensed
 
04:16:45.290 --> 04:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
nursing assistance would be repealed we
 
04:16:47.210 --> 04:16:47.220 align:start position:0%
would still be required to maintain the
 
04:16:50.030 --> 04:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
nurse aid registry and have a mechanism
 
04:16:52.090 --> 04:16:52.100 align:start position:0%
for dealing with professional misconduct
 
04:16:55.250 --> 04:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
booths were actually supported by the
 
04:16:56.689 --> 04:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
Board of barbering cosmetology
 
04:16:56.699 --> 04:16:58.150 align:start position:0%
Board of barbering cosmetology
anesthetics

04:16:58.150 --> 04:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
anesthetics
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
and then MRT and med techs those were
 
04:17:03.610 --> 04:17:03.620 align:start position:0%
very recently added
 
04:17:06.950 --> 04:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
and if you look at all of the boards
 
04:17:08.990 --> 04:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
that have license types that are
 
04:17:11.750 --> 04:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
suggested to be repealed we have
 
04:17:14.929 --> 04:17:14.939 align:start position:0%
received few if any complaints and few
 
04:17:17.870 --> 04:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
if any reported actions and so I think
 
04:17:20.330 --> 04:17:20.340 align:start position:0%
the question is whether or not you know
 
04:17:24.530 --> 04:17:24.540 align:start position:0%
in way the bad benefits of licensure to
 
04:17:26.750 --> 04:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
protect the public the risks of
 
04:17:29.330 --> 04:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
potential harm with the workforce
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
barriers and we have significant
 
04:17:32.750 --> 04:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
Workforce needs in this state you know
 
04:17:34.729 --> 04:17:34.739 align:start position:0%
where is that balance and I think we'll
 
04:17:39.290 --> 04:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:41.450 --> 04:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
I'm glad you mentioned Ellen A's because
 
04:17:43.729 --> 04:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
that was one that I was uh interested I
 
04:17:46.490 --> 04:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
mean we've already heard about Foresters
 
04:17:49.729 --> 04:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
could you talk about Foresters
 
04:17:51.650 --> 04:17:51.660 align:start position:0%
I can't talk too much about forcers
 
04:17:53.450 --> 04:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
other than to say that they don't and
 
04:17:55.370 --> 04:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
they haven't received numerous
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
complaints or reported decisions and I
 
04:18:00.769 --> 04:18:00.779 align:start position:0%
think the question is whether or not
 
04:18:02.689 --> 04:18:02.699 align:start position:0%
um there's a national credential or
 
04:18:04.010 --> 04:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
other certification that could
 
04:18:06.170 --> 04:18:06.180 align:start position:0%
reasonably protect the public as opposed
 
04:18:08.570 --> 04:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
to State mandated licensure
 
04:18:11.929 --> 04:18:11.939 align:start position:0%
and what's a natural scientist those are
 
04:18:17.990 --> 04:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:21.710 --> 04:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
further questions I do have one you your
 
04:18:23.389 --> 04:18:23.399 align:start position:0%
group if you will provide some
 
04:18:25.309 --> 04:18:25.319 align:start position:0%
significant funding occasionally back to
 
04:18:27.170 --> 04:18:27.180 align:start position:0%
the general fund how will this impact
 
04:18:30.290 --> 04:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
anything that we get back
 
04:18:30.300 --> 04:18:31.610 align:start position:0%
anything that we get back
so

04:18:31.610 --> 04:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:18:35.349 --> 04:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
um the governor's proposed budget
 
04:18:38.090 --> 04:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
is approximately 50 million dollars our
 
04:18:39.769 --> 04:18:39.779 align:start position:0%
estimated revenue is approximately 15
 
04:18:41.809 --> 04:18:41.819 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
04:18:43.790 --> 04:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
um and so therefore we would anticipate
 
04:18:46.670 --> 04:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
a nearly zero laps while we're on that
 
04:18:46.680 --> 04:18:47.809 align:start position:0%
a nearly zero laps while we're on that
topic

04:18:47.809 --> 04:18:47.819 align:start position:0%
topic
 
04:18:51.229 --> 04:18:51.239 align:start position:0%
um that there is a committee established
 
04:18:54.110 --> 04:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
last year to review PLC finances funding
 
04:18:55.370 --> 04:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
in particular
 
04:18:57.530 --> 04:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
through Senate Bill 330 it was a
 
04:19:00.590 --> 04:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
bipartisan committee and they made three
 
04:19:02.630 --> 04:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
recommendations one of which which is
 
04:19:05.870 --> 04:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
that now oplc's funds should not lapse
 
04:19:07.910 --> 04:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
to the general fund I think that's
 
04:19:09.290 --> 04:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
really important because we have
 
04:19:11.689 --> 04:19:11.699 align:start position:0%
historically lapsed significant sums of
 
04:19:14.030 --> 04:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
money compared to our expenditures and
 
04:19:16.929 --> 04:19:16.939 align:start position:0%
it has essentially amounted to at times
 
04:19:19.490 --> 04:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
attacks and there's a constitutional way
 
04:19:23.510 --> 04:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
to do that which is not this way and
 
04:19:26.030 --> 04:19:26.040 align:start position:0%
um I I really think that if we are going
 
04:19:28.070 --> 04:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
to require licensure which is a
 
04:19:30.110 --> 04:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
Workforce barrier we need to make sure
 
04:19:32.689 --> 04:19:32.699 align:start position:0%
that we're you know extremely efficient
 
04:19:34.370 --> 04:19:34.380 align:start position:0%
in the way we do so we're not creating
 
04:19:36.769 --> 04:19:36.779 align:start position:0%
unnecessary barriers and the resources
 
04:19:39.710 --> 04:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
that we've received through licensing
 
04:19:41.689 --> 04:19:41.699 align:start position:0%
fees should support licensing fees and
 
04:19:44.990 --> 04:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
not other parts of the general fund
 
04:19:47.929 --> 04:19:47.939 align:start position:0%
just one follow-up to that so is there
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
any money included going back to the
 
04:19:51.950 --> 04:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
general fund in the next biennium or is
 
04:19:54.170 --> 04:19:54.180 align:start position:0%
that are you saying that
 
04:19:56.330 --> 04:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
that would no longer occur based on the
 
04:19:58.910 --> 04:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
proposal that's in House Bill too
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
well I think the proposal in House Bill
 
04:20:03.950 --> 04:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
2 also includes a proposal to make our
 
04:20:05.889 --> 04:20:05.899 align:start position:0%
fund non-lapsing
 
04:20:08.570 --> 04:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
if that were not the case and we
 
04:20:10.790 --> 04:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
continued to Labs fund at the end of the
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
biennium we would have to either reduce
 
04:20:16.610 --> 04:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
our expenses or raise our fees in order
 
04:20:18.349 --> 04:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
to laugh some money to the general fund
 
04:20:20.389 --> 04:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
because this proposed budget in-house
 
04:20:22.969 --> 04:20:22.979 align:start position:0%
Bill one is essentially a zero lapse
 
04:20:22.979 --> 04:20:24.469 align:start position:0%
Bill one is essentially a zero lapse
budget

04:20:24.469 --> 04:20:24.479 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:20:26.150 --> 04:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
all right any
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
further questions seeing now we'll
 
04:20:31.010 --> 04:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
probably have you back happy to you
 
04:20:34.130 --> 04:20:34.140 align:start position:0%
anytime the DNA group you have a bite of
 
04:20:35.929 --> 04:20:35.939 align:start position:0%
the Apple thank you very much appreciate
 
04:20:38.689 --> 04:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
your time thank you
 
04:20:41.330 --> 04:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
all right so we have 10 minutes
 
04:20:43.130 --> 04:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
for those of you that weren't here this
 
04:20:43.140 --> 04:20:44.330 align:start position:0%
for those of you that weren't here this
morning

04:20:44.330 --> 04:20:44.340 align:start position:0%
morning
 
04:20:46.490 --> 04:20:46.500 align:start position:0%
we had kind of a robust discussion with
 
04:20:49.849 --> 04:20:49.859 align:start position:0%
a lot of folks and uh
 
04:20:52.189 --> 04:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
we have the judicial Council coming in
 
04:20:55.910 --> 04:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
on Thursday at 9 00 A.M
 
04:20:58.610 --> 04:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
their budget is up substantially over
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
the last budget I mean substantially
 
04:21:05.150 --> 04:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
and they had quite a handout and there
 
04:21:06.650 --> 04:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
were a lot of questions and we kind of
 
04:21:08.990 --> 04:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
ran over with the other little groups
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
that we saw so Thursday at 9 30
 
04:21:15.530 --> 04:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
and representative Bryant I mean I hope
 
04:21:17.929 --> 04:21:17.939 align:start position:0%
Brian Maguire I don't know where that
 
04:21:19.790 --> 04:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
came from oh yeah used to be friendly
 
04:21:21.729 --> 04:21:21.739 align:start position:0%
with him
 
04:21:21.739 --> 04:21:23.389 align:start position:0%
with him
yeah

04:21:23.389 --> 04:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:21:26.030 --> 04:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
yes so um
 
04:21:28.729 --> 04:21:28.739 align:start position:0%
is this is this extra 10 million in the
 
04:21:31.370 --> 04:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
budget is that similar to what they get
 
04:21:32.870 --> 04:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
out of the fiscal committee here
 
04:21:32.880 --> 04:21:35.809 align:start position:0%
out of the fiscal committee here
piecemeal

04:21:35.809 --> 04:21:35.819 align:start position:0%
piecemeal
 
04:21:38.689 --> 04:21:38.699 align:start position:0%
that wasn't I don't think it was oh okay
 
04:21:40.309 --> 04:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
and that's why I asked them how much
 
04:21:41.570 --> 04:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
they had given because it's not
 
04:21:44.090 --> 04:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
reflected in their budget okay so that
 
04:21:46.610 --> 04:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
additional money Mike was about three
 
04:21:49.130 --> 04:21:49.140 align:start position:0%
million dollars for those last two it
 
04:21:51.229 --> 04:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
was like a similar in that neighborhood
 
04:21:53.689 --> 04:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
for two requests and they told us they
 
04:21:55.070 --> 04:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
have to come back for another two
 
04:21:57.769 --> 04:21:57.779 align:start position:0%
requests of fistful so again for those
 
04:30:53.809 --> 04:30:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:57.110 --> 04:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
so it being two o'clock we have the
 
04:30:58.790 --> 04:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
04:31:04.729 --> 04:31:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:11.830 --> 04:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:15.050 --> 04:31:15.060 align:start position:0%
our apologies for not doing that sooner
 
04:31:15.060 --> 04:31:18.410 align:start position:0%
our apologies for not doing that sooner
so

04:31:18.410 --> 04:31:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:20.929 --> 04:31:20.939 align:start position:0%
so it's all yours okay
 
04:31:26.990 --> 04:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:29.750 --> 04:31:29.760 align:start position:0%

04:31:31.610 --> 04:31:31.620 align:start position:0%
record my name is Gordon McDonald and I

Diane Martin
 
04:31:56.090 --> 04:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
and our judicial branch fiscal manager
 
04:31:59.090 --> 04:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
Donna Raymond we are very grateful for
 
04:32:00.769 --> 04:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to present the judicial
 
04:32:02.870 --> 04:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
Branch's proposed budget request for
 
04:32:07.250 --> 04:32:07.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal years 24 and 25. you were all
 
04:32:09.950 --> 04:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
very generous with your time just a
 
04:32:12.769 --> 04:32:12.779 align:start position:0%
couple weeks ago on February 1st when we
 
04:32:15.110 --> 04:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
met with you to discuss our way to
 
04:32:17.269 --> 04:32:17.279 align:start position:0%
caseload study
 
04:32:19.070 --> 04:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
um and and during that time we're able
 
04:32:22.309 --> 04:32:22.319 align:start position:0%
to present basic information about the
 
04:32:24.410 --> 04:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
structure of the judicial branch some of
 
04:32:26.630 --> 04:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
our current initiatives and of course
 
04:32:29.389 --> 04:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
the way to caseload study I'm going to
 
04:32:31.429 --> 04:32:31.439 align:start position:0%
skip all of that in the interest of the
 
04:32:34.370 --> 04:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
efficiency because I think every member
 
04:32:37.550 --> 04:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
was there and for those who weren't and
 
04:32:39.110 --> 04:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
won a copy of our slides from that
 
04:32:41.630 --> 04:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
session I've got them with me I have a
 
04:32:45.110 --> 04:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
much shorter set of slides here for us
 
04:32:45.120 --> 04:32:46.910 align:start position:0%
much shorter set of slides here for us
today

04:32:46.910 --> 04:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:32:49.610 --> 04:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
um and I'd ask you just to go to slide
 
04:32:49.620 --> 04:32:52.849 align:start position:0%
um and I'd ask you just to go to slide
two

04:32:52.849 --> 04:32:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:56.210 --> 04:32:56.220 align:start position:0%
our mission statement and
 
04:32:56.220 --> 04:32:57.469 align:start position:0%
our mission statement and
um

04:32:57.469 --> 04:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:59.929 --> 04:32:59.939 align:start position:0%
the work of our employees all the
 
04:33:01.670 --> 04:33:01.680 align:start position:0%
members of the judicial branch judges
 
04:33:04.970 --> 04:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
and Court staff is rooted in our St in
 
04:33:07.670 --> 04:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
our constitution part one article 35
 
04:33:10.310 --> 04:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
provides that it is quote it is
 
04:33:12.949 --> 04:33:12.959 align:start position:0%
essential to the preservation of the
 
04:33:15.650 --> 04:33:15.660 align:start position:0%
rights of every individual the life
 
04:33:18.529 --> 04:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
liberty property and character that
 
04:33:20.750 --> 04:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
there be an impartial interpretation of
 
04:33:23.330 --> 04:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
the laws and administration of justice
 
04:33:26.269 --> 04:33:26.279 align:start position:0%
is the right of every citizen to be
 
04:33:29.570 --> 04:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
Tried by judges as impartial as the lot
 
04:33:32.029 --> 04:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
of humanity will permit
 
04:33:34.490 --> 04:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
the proper functioning of an independent
 
04:33:37.131 --> 04:33:37.141 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is absolutely essential to our
 
04:33:37.141 --> 04:33:38.810 align:start position:0%
Judiciary is absolutely essential to our
democracy

04:33:38.810 --> 04:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
04:33:43.369 --> 04:33:43.379 align:start position:0%
if you skip a trend to page three
 
04:33:46.010 --> 04:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
you'll remember that we have two trial
 
04:33:48.949 --> 04:33:48.959 align:start position:0%
courts the circuit court and Superior
 
04:33:52.730 --> 04:33:52.740 align:start position:0%
Court and on pages three and four
 
04:33:55.551 --> 04:33:55.561 align:start position:0%
you will remember the volume of cases
 
04:33:57.590 --> 04:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
that we confront in the judicial branch
 
04:34:00.289 --> 04:34:00.299 align:start position:0%
between our two trial courts in excess
 
04:34:03.109 --> 04:34:03.119 align:start position:0%
of 150 000 cases a year
 
04:34:05.449 --> 04:34:05.459 align:start position:0%
meaning that our work directly touches
 
04:34:07.551 --> 04:34:07.561 align:start position:0%
on the lives of so many people in our
 
04:34:10.189 --> 04:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
state in matters of great and immediate
 
04:34:13.070 --> 04:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
accordance to them in the decisions of
 
04:34:15.349 --> 04:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court are binding on us all
 
04:34:18.709 --> 04:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
a responsibility we just discharge with
 
04:34:21.349 --> 04:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
great humility and respect
 
04:34:24.051 --> 04:34:24.061 align:start position:0%
as chairman Weiler said at the last time
 
04:34:25.789 --> 04:34:25.799 align:start position:0%
we were together the legislature has
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
provided in RSA nine colon 4A that as a
 
04:34:33.170 --> 04:34:33.180 align:start position:0%
separate branch of government the
 
04:34:35.830 --> 04:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
judicial branch submits its budget along
 
04:34:40.131 --> 04:34:40.141 align:start position:0%
with uh executive agency branch agency
 
04:34:43.010 --> 04:34:43.020 align:start position:0%
budgets however the governor may not
 
04:34:45.890 --> 04:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
change the budget as submitted but may
 
04:34:48.051 --> 04:34:48.061 align:start position:0%
provide comments as deemed appropriate
 
04:34:50.990 --> 04:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
and as the chairman noted that provides
 
04:34:52.910 --> 04:34:52.920 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for our two branches to
 
04:34:56.510 --> 04:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
engage directly on the needs of the
 
04:34:59.449 --> 04:34:59.459 align:start position:0%
judicial branch the governor provided no
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
comments with our budget and we're here
 
04:35:05.869 --> 04:35:05.879 align:start position:0%
to present what we are proposing to the
 
04:35:07.730 --> 04:35:07.740 align:start position:0%
committee today
 
04:35:10.849 --> 04:35:10.859 align:start position:0%
uh although this division may have some
 
04:35:13.869 --> 04:35:13.879 align:start position:0%
comments but okay
 
04:35:16.730 --> 04:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
of course
 
04:35:16.740 --> 04:35:18.830 align:start position:0%
of course
um

04:35:18.830 --> 04:35:18.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:21.109 --> 04:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
slide six
 
04:35:22.670 --> 04:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
to frame up
 
04:35:25.310 --> 04:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
um basic concepts governing our budget
 
04:35:27.289 --> 04:35:27.299 align:start position:0%
and give you some context
 
04:35:30.529 --> 04:35:30.539 align:start position:0%
number one we are we essentially deliver
 
04:35:33.170 --> 04:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
Professional Services broadly speaking
 
04:35:33.180 --> 04:35:34.131 align:start position:0%
Professional Services broadly speaking
so

04:35:34.131 --> 04:35:34.141 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:37.789 --> 04:35:37.799 align:start position:0%
we are Personnel 73 of our budget is
 
04:35:40.490 --> 04:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
Personnel is committee division well
 
04:35:43.609 --> 04:35:43.619 align:start position:0%
knows those costs are essentially fixed
 
04:35:45.590 --> 04:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
beyond our Personnel costs we have
 
04:35:47.689 --> 04:35:47.699 align:start position:0%
limited control over many of our cost
 
04:35:50.510 --> 04:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
centers we make transfers to our share
 
04:35:54.051 --> 04:35:54.061 align:start position:0%
to the county sheriffs for security and
 
04:35:58.510 --> 04:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
our Superior Courts we transfer
 
04:36:01.189 --> 04:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
funds to the Bureau of Court facilities
 
04:36:05.029 --> 04:36:05.039 align:start position:0%
for the maintenance and
 
04:36:07.131 --> 04:36:07.141 align:start position:0%
the maintenance of our core facilities
 
04:36:10.189 --> 04:36:10.199 align:start position:0%
and I'll note on that we'll get to it a
 
04:36:12.490 --> 04:36:12.500 align:start position:0%
little bit later but
 
04:36:15.709 --> 04:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
that cost a loan this year out of our
 
04:36:19.010 --> 04:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
117 million dollar request is 11.2
 
04:36:20.449 --> 04:36:20.459 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
04:36:23.150 --> 04:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
and that's a 16 increase that we've
 
04:36:25.330 --> 04:36:25.340 align:start position:0%
absorbed this year
 
04:36:28.189 --> 04:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
we also have
 
04:36:30.410 --> 04:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
essentially limited control over
 
04:36:32.631 --> 04:36:32.641 align:start position:0%
technology costs
 
04:36:36.230 --> 04:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
95 of of the judicial branches generally
 
04:36:36.240 --> 04:36:38.330 align:start position:0%
95 of of the judicial branches generally
funded

04:36:38.330 --> 04:36:38.340 align:start position:0%
funded
 
04:36:40.010 --> 04:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
the next slide
 
04:36:40.020 --> 04:36:40.789 align:start position:0%
the next slide
um

04:36:40.789 --> 04:36:40.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
since the budget was prepared and
 
04:36:45.529 --> 04:36:45.539 align:start position:0%
submitted we have some adjustments I'd
 
04:36:48.590 --> 04:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
like to go over with the division
 
04:36:51.709 --> 04:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
number one for both fiscal years we'd
 
04:36:53.929 --> 04:36:53.939 align:start position:0%
ask that 126
 
04:36:56.750 --> 04:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
000 be taken out those were for rental
 
04:36:59.689 --> 04:36:59.699 align:start position:0%
payments we anticipated at one Granite
 
04:37:01.609 --> 04:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
place we anticipated at one time one
 
04:37:04.429 --> 04:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
granted place which is the facility that
 
04:37:06.529 --> 04:37:06.539 align:start position:0%
has houses our trial court Center in
 
04:37:08.689 --> 04:37:08.699 align:start position:0%
Administrative Office of Courts we do
 
04:37:10.730 --> 04:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
not need that
 
04:37:13.750 --> 04:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
um security
 
04:37:17.449 --> 04:37:17.459 align:start position:0%
closed circuit and alarms you'll see
 
04:37:20.990 --> 04:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:23.631 --> 04:37:23.641 align:start position:0%
we are investing in our court security
 
04:37:26.990 --> 04:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
however These funds are covered by an
 
04:37:28.631 --> 04:37:28.641 align:start position:0%
ARP request
 
04:37:31.609 --> 04:37:31.619 align:start position:0%
that was approved earlier in the year or
 
04:37:36.769 --> 04:37:36.779 align:start position:0%
last year so we are asking that 280 000
 
04:37:41.390 --> 04:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 24 and 210 000 in fiscal 25.
 
04:37:43.910 --> 04:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
be removed from our submit our submitted
 
04:37:43.920 --> 04:37:44.990 align:start position:0%
be removed from our submit our submitted
request

04:37:44.990 --> 04:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
request
 
04:37:46.750 --> 04:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
we have
 
04:37:50.090 --> 04:37:50.100 align:start position:0%
salaries that when we constructed the
 
04:37:52.131 --> 04:37:52.141 align:start position:0%
budget we were unsure if there would be
 
04:37:54.109 --> 04:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
Grant funded now we are assured that
 
04:37:56.689 --> 04:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
they are Grant funded so those can come
 
04:37:56.699 --> 04:37:57.470 align:start position:0%
they are Grant funded so those can come
out

04:37:57.470 --> 04:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:38:00.730 --> 04:38:00.740 align:start position:0%
and then finally on benefits
 
04:38:05.349 --> 04:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
when we submitted the budget we used
 
04:38:08.750 --> 04:38:08.760 align:start position:0%
benefit figures provided to us by the
 
04:38:10.869 --> 04:38:10.879 align:start position:0%
department of administrative Services
 
04:38:13.849 --> 04:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
the rates have since been revised
 
04:38:16.189 --> 04:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
however they were revised we received
 
04:38:19.551 --> 04:38:19.561 align:start position:0%
the revisions too late to incorporate in
 
04:38:23.990 --> 04:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
the budget and uh the net of that is we
 
04:38:27.830 --> 04:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
are our health rates have gone down our
 
04:38:29.750 --> 04:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
Dental rates have gone up very slightly
 
04:38:31.330 --> 04:38:31.340 align:start position:0%
and we also
 
04:38:34.429 --> 04:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
are providing for paid family medical
 
04:38:36.890 --> 04:38:36.900 align:start position:0%
leave but the bottom line is for for
 
04:38:39.289 --> 04:38:39.299 align:start position:0%
both of uh the fiscal years you can see
 
04:38:43.131 --> 04:38:43.141 align:start position:0%
where we're asking them 527
 
04:38:46.369 --> 04:38:46.379 align:start position:0%
000 and 559 000 be removed from our
 
04:38:46.379 --> 04:38:48.709 align:start position:0%
000 and 559 000 be removed from our
submission

04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
submission
 
04:38:52.131 --> 04:38:52.141 align:start position:0%
on the next slide you'll see an overview
 
04:38:56.810 --> 04:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
of our request against FY 22 actual and
 
04:38:59.029 --> 04:38:59.039 align:start position:0%
the adjusted authorized for this fiscal
 
04:38:59.039 --> 04:39:00.890 align:start position:0%
the adjusted authorized for this fiscal
year

04:39:00.890 --> 04:39:00.900 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:39:00.900 --> 04:39:02.269 align:start position:0%
year
um

04:39:02.269 --> 04:39:02.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:04.849 --> 04:39:04.859 align:start position:0%
you can see our original budget
 
04:39:07.810 --> 04:39:07.820 align:start position:0%
submission and then less the
 
04:39:10.551 --> 04:39:10.561 align:start position:0%
subtractions that we just went over or
 
04:39:12.289 --> 04:39:12.299 align:start position:0%
total requests for the first year the
 
04:39:16.810 --> 04:39:16.820 align:start position:0%
biennium is 116 million 846
 
04:39:21.910 --> 04:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
7913 dollars that is a 6.1 percent
 
04:39:27.289 --> 04:39:27.299 align:start position:0%
increase over FY 23 adjusted authorized
 
04:39:32.289 --> 04:39:32.299 align:start position:0%
uh for fy25 the request is 120 million
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
377 193 dollars and that is a three
 
04:39:38.990 --> 04:39:39.000 align:start position:0%
percent increase over the first year of
 
04:39:42.350 --> 04:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:46.670 --> 04:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
the next slide uh three basic objectives
 
04:39:48.650 --> 04:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
framed are submission
 
04:39:51.350 --> 04:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
one is to begin to address the needs
 
04:39:53.930 --> 04:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
identified in the way to caseload study
 
04:39:56.990 --> 04:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
the second is to enhance our court
 
04:39:59.868 --> 04:39:59.878 align:start position:0%
security and the third is to respond to
 
04:40:02.510 --> 04:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
employ inflationary pressures affecting
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:09.770 --> 04:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
so the next slide should look somewhat
 
04:40:13.510 --> 04:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
familiar to you this is um copy the
 
04:40:16.310 --> 04:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
picture of the copy of the way to
 
04:40:19.610 --> 04:40:19.620 align:start position:0%
caseload report that was prepared last
 
04:40:22.070 --> 04:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
year and you'll recall that the way the
 
04:40:24.410 --> 04:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
caseload study is an evidence-based
 
04:40:27.350 --> 04:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
assessment of the Personnel that are
 
04:40:29.810 --> 04:40:29.820 align:start position:0%
required to process cases in our two
 
04:40:31.970 --> 04:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
trial courts
 
04:40:35.930 --> 04:40:35.940 align:start position:0%
um and this budget as you will see our
 
04:40:38.570 --> 04:40:38.580 align:start position:0%
request is overwhelmingly the increase
 
04:40:40.970 --> 04:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
that we're asking for is overwhelmingly
 
04:40:46.368 --> 04:40:46.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:49.130 --> 04:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
the next slide should look familiar to
 
04:40:49.140 --> 04:40:50.208 align:start position:0%
the next slide should look familiar to
you

04:40:50.208 --> 04:40:50.218 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:40:50.218 --> 04:40:50.990 align:start position:0%
you
um

04:40:50.990 --> 04:40:51.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
our budget request based on the way to
 
04:40:58.010 --> 04:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
caseload study is for seven new judges
 
04:40:59.810 --> 04:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
in the Circuit Court
 
04:41:03.170 --> 04:41:03.180 align:start position:0%
and as we went over the study concluded
 
04:41:07.130 --> 04:41:07.140 align:start position:0%
we needed 17 and one new Superior Court
 
04:41:10.190 --> 04:41:10.200 align:start position:0%
Judge of the three and a half that study
 
04:41:12.470 --> 04:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
asked for called for
 
04:41:14.868 --> 04:41:14.878 align:start position:0%
with respect to court process case
 
04:41:16.910 --> 04:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
processing staff
 
04:41:19.730 --> 04:41:19.740 align:start position:0%
were asking for 31 new staff in the
 
04:41:20.810 --> 04:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court
 
04:41:24.110 --> 04:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
and in addition to that one new Clerk
 
04:41:26.510 --> 04:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
and in the Superior Court four news
 
04:41:28.970 --> 04:41:28.980 align:start position:0%
staff and in addition to that one new
 
04:41:31.970 --> 04:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:34.430 --> 04:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
I did have a question Mr chief justice
 
04:41:36.288 --> 04:41:36.298 align:start position:0%
is that the courthouse where
 
04:41:38.510 --> 04:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt used to preside
 
04:41:44.690 --> 04:41:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:50.510 --> 04:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:55.010 --> 04:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
uh next slide
 
04:41:57.350 --> 04:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
we need to
 
04:41:59.890 --> 04:41:59.900 align:start position:0%
we need to address Courthouse Security
 
04:42:04.128 --> 04:42:04.138 align:start position:0%
in the budget before you our request
 
04:42:04.138 --> 04:42:04.850 align:start position:0%
in the budget before you our request
um

04:42:04.850 --> 04:42:04.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:07.610 --> 04:42:07.620 align:start position:0%
takes on to is it is what I would
 
04:42:09.650 --> 04:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
characterize an initial investment over
 
04:42:11.570 --> 04:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
this biennium and addressing Courthouse
 
04:42:11.580 --> 04:42:12.708 align:start position:0%
this biennium and addressing Courthouse
security

04:42:12.708 --> 04:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
security
 
04:42:15.708 --> 04:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
just to step back
 
04:42:18.170 --> 04:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
our Courthouse security is provided by
 
04:42:18.180 --> 04:42:19.010 align:start position:0%
our Courthouse security is provided by
two

04:42:19.010 --> 04:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
two
 
04:42:22.368 --> 04:42:22.378 align:start position:0%
two entities one is uh court security
 
04:42:24.530 --> 04:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
officers which are employees of the
 
04:42:26.570 --> 04:42:26.580 align:start position:0%
administrative office of Courts and they
 
04:42:28.970 --> 04:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
provide security in our circuit courts
 
04:42:31.490 --> 04:42:31.500 align:start position:0%
and then in our in our Superior Courts
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
we pay the county sheriffs to provide
 
04:42:38.030 --> 04:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
security in those courthouses for our
 
04:42:40.730 --> 04:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
court security officers
 
04:42:43.070 --> 04:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
um they are not equipped with their own
 
04:42:43.080 --> 04:42:44.390 align:start position:0%
um they are not equipped with their own
weapons

04:42:44.390 --> 04:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
weapons
 
04:42:48.230 --> 04:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
and their own ammunition and we need to
 
04:42:50.750 --> 04:42:50.760 align:start position:0%
get standardized equipment for what I
 
04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
think would be fairly obvious reasons
 
04:42:53.760 --> 04:42:54.288 align:start position:0%
think would be fairly obvious reasons
um

04:42:54.288 --> 04:42:54.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:42:58.128 --> 04:42:58.138 align:start position:0%
we are also investing in additional
 
04:43:00.590 --> 04:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
protective equipment and although it
 
04:43:03.350 --> 04:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
says training here that is that is there
 
04:43:05.208 --> 04:43:05.218 align:start position:0%
are no funds included for training but
 
04:43:07.368 --> 04:43:07.378 align:start position:0%
it is part of a legislative request that
 
04:43:09.708 --> 04:43:09.718 align:start position:0%
we're making uh that you'll see in a
 
04:43:12.650 --> 04:43:12.660 align:start position:0%
separate bill we're asking that our csos
 
04:43:15.730 --> 04:43:15.740 align:start position:0%
and and deputies
 
04:43:17.868 --> 04:43:17.878 align:start position:0%
undertake a
 
04:43:21.230 --> 04:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
course that we're going to work with a
 
04:43:23.990 --> 04:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
training regimen to be undertaken by
 
04:43:26.390 --> 04:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
police standards in training councils so
 
04:43:28.250 --> 04:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
they'll go through a regular training
 
04:43:29.930 --> 04:43:29.940 align:start position:0%
and certification process over there
 
04:43:34.310 --> 04:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:36.788 --> 04:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
next slide
 
04:43:40.368 --> 04:43:40.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:43.610 --> 04:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
increases related to inflation we
 
04:43:45.230 --> 04:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
discussed when we were together last
 
04:43:48.610 --> 04:43:48.620 align:start position:0%
time our difficulty in retaining
 
04:43:52.510 --> 04:43:52.520 align:start position:0%
many of our core processing staff
 
04:43:55.310 --> 04:43:55.320 align:start position:0%
our front line staff dealing with the
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
public court assistance two and three
 
04:44:01.430 --> 04:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
or information center representatives in
 
04:44:04.970 --> 04:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
our our proposal there is to adjust
 
04:44:08.208 --> 04:44:08.218 align:start position:0%
their labor grade labor grades to better
 
04:44:09.850 --> 04:44:09.860 align:start position:0%
to get their
 
04:44:13.070 --> 04:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
compensation to a level where we're just
 
04:44:15.288 --> 04:44:15.298 align:start position:0%
going to be more competitive we are
 
04:44:16.788 --> 04:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
literally as I think judge king
 
04:44:19.430 --> 04:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned when we were together last we
 
04:44:21.708 --> 04:44:21.718 align:start position:0%
were we are losing Court staff to fast
 
04:44:25.310 --> 04:44:25.320 align:start position:0%
food establishments and uh our turnover
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
our efforts to retain and train those
 
04:44:30.650 --> 04:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
staff is is a continual challenge
 
04:44:33.830 --> 04:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
represent Maguire has a question thank
 
04:44:35.390 --> 04:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you Mr chief
 
04:44:38.810 --> 04:44:38.820 align:start position:0%
justice this says per diem are these um
 
04:44:41.270 --> 04:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
folks not on the salary
 
04:44:44.330 --> 04:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
on the next bullet point yeah where it
 
04:44:46.368 --> 04:44:46.378 align:start position:0%
says increase security officer per diem
 
04:44:50.090 --> 04:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
rate from 121. our
 
04:44:53.208 --> 04:44:53.218 align:start position:0%
um court security Personnel are
 
04:44:56.990 --> 04:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly part-time and per diem uh
 
04:45:00.110 --> 04:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
we have 119 per diem officers and I
 
04:45:02.208 --> 04:45:02.218 align:start position:0%
think our total security force is
 
04:45:04.970 --> 04:45:04.980 align:start position:0%
probably 130 we have some full-time and
 
04:45:07.670 --> 04:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
some part-time some full-time one
 
04:45:10.010 --> 04:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
training officer so it's overwhelmingly
 
04:45:11.990 --> 04:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
per diem
 
04:45:15.230 --> 04:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
um and so this increases again to keep
 
04:45:18.230 --> 04:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
us competitive with a really tight labor
 
04:45:20.650 --> 04:45:20.660 align:start position:0%
market for those per diem officers
 
04:45:23.930 --> 04:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
so then there's no benefits correct
 
04:45:25.550 --> 04:45:25.560 align:start position:0%
right and
 
04:45:25.560 --> 04:45:26.530 align:start position:0%
right and
um

04:45:26.530 --> 04:45:26.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:32.030 --> 04:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:38.810 --> 04:45:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:41.628 --> 04:45:41.638 align:start position:0%
we do have I'm sorry I'm being corrected
 
04:45:44.570 --> 04:45:44.580 align:start position:0%
there are some per diem officers who
 
04:45:46.128 --> 04:45:46.138 align:start position:0%
work four and five days who do get
 
04:45:49.128 --> 04:45:49.138 align:start position:0%
benefits gotcha and
 
04:45:52.150 --> 04:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
but the others that are part-time
 
04:45:56.868 --> 04:45:56.878 align:start position:0%
their officers and some town uh police
 
04:46:00.670 --> 04:46:00.680 align:start position:0%
department or state troopers or the most
 
04:46:03.288 --> 04:46:03.298 align:start position:0%
many of them are retired law enforcement
 
04:46:04.730 --> 04:46:04.740 align:start position:0%
I see
 
04:46:08.090 --> 04:46:08.100 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know if we have current law
 
04:46:10.128 --> 04:46:10.138 align:start position:0%
enforcement in our
 
04:46:10.138 --> 04:46:11.810 align:start position:0%
enforcement in our
no

04:46:11.810 --> 04:46:11.820 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:46:14.150 --> 04:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
most most of them are retired law
 
04:46:16.250 --> 04:46:16.260 align:start position:0%
enforcement but certainly not all or
 
04:46:20.330 --> 04:46:20.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:22.070 --> 04:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
so that covers the second bullet point
 
04:46:23.750 --> 04:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
and then three
 
04:46:23.760 --> 04:46:24.470 align:start position:0%
and then three
um

04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:46:26.390 --> 04:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
we're asking for uh
 
04:46:29.390 --> 04:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
increase funds to respond to uh
 
04:46:31.670 --> 04:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
really significant inflationary
 
04:46:37.250 --> 04:46:37.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:40.190 --> 04:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh next slide uh we're just going to
 
04:46:43.190 --> 04:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
cover some other additions in this
 
04:46:44.810 --> 04:46:44.820 align:start position:0%
budget and I'm going to ask chess it's
 
04:46:47.270 --> 04:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
NATO to talk about the drug court
 
04:46:49.250 --> 04:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
thanks everyone I know we talked a
 
04:46:50.810 --> 04:46:50.820 align:start position:0%
little bit about the program last time
 
04:46:52.430 --> 04:46:52.440 align:start position:0%
and I want to
 
04:46:53.990 --> 04:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your time today to
 
04:46:55.610 --> 04:46:55.620 align:start position:0%
listen to me about why we're asking for
 
04:46:58.010 --> 04:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
an increase in the drug court budget as
 
04:47:00.288 --> 04:47:00.298 align:start position:0%
you recall back in 2016 when the
 
04:47:02.150 --> 04:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
legislature created the opioid task
 
04:47:04.010 --> 04:47:04.020 align:start position:0%
force that's where the legislation
 
04:47:06.050 --> 04:47:06.060 align:start position:0%
establishing funding for Statewide drug
 
04:47:08.930 --> 04:47:08.940 align:start position:0%
court was created and since then we have
 
04:47:10.430 --> 04:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
never had an increase in that funding
 
04:47:13.070 --> 04:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
it's been static and we've broken it out
 
04:47:14.890 --> 04:47:14.900 align:start position:0%
into sort of small medium and large
 
04:47:17.570 --> 04:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
courts and they get a capped amount
 
04:47:19.368 --> 04:47:19.378 align:start position:0%
based on the size of the court and how
 
04:47:21.410 --> 04:47:21.420 align:start position:0%
many people they can serve and we've
 
04:47:23.868 --> 04:47:23.878 align:start position:0%
discovered that similar to what's going
 
04:47:25.490 --> 04:47:25.500 align:start position:0%
on in the judicial branch we're seeing a
 
04:47:27.590 --> 04:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
lot of turnover in the therapists and
 
04:47:29.270 --> 04:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
case managers that work in the drug
 
04:47:31.310 --> 04:47:31.320 align:start position:0%
court program the drug court folks that
 
04:47:32.750 --> 04:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with are people that are
 
04:47:34.610 --> 04:47:34.620 align:start position:0%
the most challenging they're people that
 
04:47:36.948 --> 04:47:36.958 align:start position:0%
have had intractable substance use
 
04:47:38.930 --> 04:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
disorders for many years criminal
 
04:47:40.730 --> 04:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
records so they're really tough to deal
 
04:47:43.670 --> 04:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
with and this increase it's about a 25
 
04:47:47.288 --> 04:47:47.298 align:start position:0%
percent increase totaling around 650 000
 
04:47:49.788 --> 04:47:49.798 align:start position:0%
and that would go to enhance the
 
04:47:51.770 --> 04:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
salaries and in some depending on the
 
04:47:54.350 --> 04:47:54.360 align:start position:0%
court and some places maybe add a case
 
04:47:56.330 --> 04:47:56.340 align:start position:0%
manager that they need so they can grow
 
04:47:59.510 --> 04:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
the program a bit and the the reason for
 
04:48:01.430 --> 04:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
that is because when we have turnover
 
04:48:04.610 --> 04:48:04.620 align:start position:0%
that actually results in poorer outcomes
 
04:48:06.708 --> 04:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
for the participants once they establish
 
04:48:08.868 --> 04:48:08.878 align:start position:0%
that Therapeutic Alliance they do better
 
04:48:11.628 --> 04:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
they improve better they progress and
 
04:48:12.948 --> 04:48:12.958 align:start position:0%
when they have that turnover they've
 
04:48:14.390 --> 04:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
actually done studies it takes them a
 
04:48:16.250 --> 04:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
couple of years or not a couple years it
 
04:48:18.170 --> 04:48:18.180 align:start position:0%
takes another year to sort of get used
 
04:48:19.610 --> 04:48:19.620 align:start position:0%
to that therapist and to be able to
 
04:48:21.230 --> 04:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
continue to progress so we'd like to
 
04:48:22.730 --> 04:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
hold on to the good ones and we have
 
04:48:25.010 --> 04:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
having a really hard time doing that the
 
04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
last thing I'll say is that when this
 
04:48:29.750 --> 04:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
funding occurred the judicial Grant is
 
04:48:31.430 --> 04:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
basically sort of the repository for the
 
04:48:34.010 --> 04:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
funding then we contract out with a
 
04:48:36.170 --> 04:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
treatment provider and that funding goes
 
04:48:38.448 --> 04:48:38.458 align:start position:0%
for treatment the coordinator for the
 
04:48:40.430 --> 04:48:40.440 align:start position:0%
court and case management so we're kind
 
04:48:42.830 --> 04:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
of the pass-through and that's what
 
04:48:44.208 --> 04:48:44.218 align:start position:0%
would happen with this money it would be
 
04:48:45.948 --> 04:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
a further investment in the program that
 
04:48:47.750 --> 04:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
you've already created to make sure we
 
04:48:49.430 --> 04:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
can keep hold of those therapists and
 
04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
case managers so I'm happy to answer any
 
04:48:53.770 --> 04:48:53.780 align:start position:0%
questions anything else
 
04:48:56.208 --> 04:48:56.218 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
04:48:57.410 --> 04:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
04:48:58.670 --> 04:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
question sure
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
um so you said treatment so is is the
 
04:49:05.690 --> 04:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
funding for that treatment through the
 
04:49:10.010 --> 04:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
judiciaries budget as opposed to HHS or
 
04:49:11.570 --> 04:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
where I would normally think of as
 
04:49:13.970 --> 04:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
treatment exactly you you the
 
04:49:16.910 --> 04:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
legislature has appropriated that money
 
04:49:19.070 --> 04:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
into our budget we have a line for it
 
04:49:21.050 --> 04:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
drug court budget line so it doesn't get
 
04:49:22.730 --> 04:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
mixed up with everything else and then
 
04:49:25.310 --> 04:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
we contract with an agency to provide
 
04:49:27.530 --> 04:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
the services sort of like HHS would do
 
04:49:29.570 --> 04:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
but it makes a little bit more sense for
 
04:49:31.250 --> 04:49:31.260 align:start position:0%
us because the people we're dealing with
 
04:49:33.590 --> 04:49:33.600 align:start position:0%
are those who have got a lengthy
 
04:49:35.330 --> 04:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
criminal record that might otherwise be
 
04:49:36.948 --> 04:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
headed to State Prison if they didn't
 
04:49:40.190 --> 04:49:40.200 align:start position:0%
have this option so it helps us we have
 
04:49:41.930 --> 04:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
we have memorandums of understanding
 
04:49:44.330 --> 04:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
that we sign with the therapy with the
 
04:49:46.910 --> 04:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
therapists and the team works together
 
04:49:49.368 --> 04:49:49.378 align:start position:0%
so that that is how it's funded through
 
04:49:50.690 --> 04:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
our budget
 
04:49:50.700 --> 04:49:51.890 align:start position:0%
our budget
um

04:49:51.890 --> 04:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:54.530 --> 04:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
so I would assume that you don't have
 
04:49:56.868 --> 04:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
like Medical Offices or something you're
 
04:49:59.330 --> 04:49:59.340 align:start position:0%
you're Contracting with somebody yeah
 
04:50:01.368 --> 04:50:01.378 align:start position:0%
and they go to their office right so
 
04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes people think why are Judges
 
04:50:04.250 --> 04:50:04.260 align:start position:0%
being therapists we are not being
 
04:50:06.410 --> 04:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
therapists so for example the Elliott
 
04:50:09.410 --> 04:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
hospital is our contractor for the uh
 
04:50:10.970 --> 04:50:10.980 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough North drug court program
 
04:50:13.670 --> 04:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
and they have therapists psychiatrists
 
04:50:15.948 --> 04:50:15.958 align:start position:0%
mental health provider case manager and
 
04:50:17.930 --> 04:50:17.940 align:start position:0%
the coordinator and they manage all of
 
04:50:19.310 --> 04:50:19.320 align:start position:0%
the treatment that people go to their
 
04:50:21.288 --> 04:50:21.298 align:start position:0%
facility to receive the treatment they
 
04:50:23.150 --> 04:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
get group therapy individual counseling
 
04:50:25.070 --> 04:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
and they show up in court weekly for
 
04:50:29.690 --> 04:50:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:32.208 --> 04:50:32.218 align:start position:0%
any further questions on the yes
 
04:50:34.190 --> 04:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
represent Weiler
 
04:50:36.230 --> 04:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
04:50:39.050 --> 04:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
judge NATO yes we're not able to get a
 
04:50:41.208 --> 04:50:41.218 align:start position:0%
straight answer how many illegal aliens
 
04:50:43.670 --> 04:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
have been shipped to our state I wonder
 
04:50:45.890 --> 04:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
if you're seeing them in the courts
 
04:50:48.530 --> 04:50:48.540 align:start position:0%
wow that's a good question I you know we
 
04:50:50.750 --> 04:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
are required for example at a plea
 
04:50:53.270 --> 04:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
hearing to make sure the public defender
 
04:50:56.270 --> 04:50:56.280 align:start position:0%
has inquired of their client whether or
 
04:50:58.190 --> 04:50:58.200 align:start position:0%
not a resulting plea would have
 
04:51:00.110 --> 04:51:00.120 align:start position:0%
immigration implications but we don't
 
04:51:04.550 --> 04:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
keep track of of that so we do not know
 
04:51:06.830 --> 04:51:06.840 align:start position:0%
you're not seeing a big up service no no
 
04:51:11.208 --> 04:51:11.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:13.670 --> 04:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
brother questions I guess you're off the
 
04:51:17.090 --> 04:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:20.570 --> 04:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
um still on slide 14. it's uh director
 
04:51:22.670 --> 04:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
Martin come up and talk about the some
 
04:51:26.090 --> 04:51:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:26.100 --> 04:51:29.448 align:start position:0%
 
Editions

04:51:29.448 --> 04:51:29.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:31.368 --> 04:51:31.378 align:start position:0%
um the data management analyst position
 
04:51:34.070 --> 04:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
that's something that we included
 
04:51:36.770 --> 04:51:36.780 align:start position:0%
um the judicial branch is a repository
 
04:51:39.830 --> 04:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
obviously for a lot of information and
 
04:51:41.750 --> 04:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
everybody is interested in that
 
04:51:44.570 --> 04:51:44.580 align:start position:0%
information so we get a lot of requests
 
04:51:49.010 --> 04:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
for for our data from all sources but
 
04:51:50.750 --> 04:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
even from the legislature I think we've
 
04:51:53.810 --> 04:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
had several this week and we only and in
 
04:51:55.610 --> 04:51:55.620 align:start position:0%
addition to that the data is useful to
 
04:51:58.190 --> 04:51:58.200 align:start position:0%
the court and being able to look at its
 
04:52:00.770 --> 04:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
processes who's using them and come up
 
04:52:00.780 --> 04:52:01.730 align:start position:0%
processes who's using them and come up
with

04:52:01.730 --> 04:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:52:04.250 --> 04:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
um better approaches to Things So
 
04:52:06.830 --> 04:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
currently we have a single person only
 
04:52:08.750 --> 04:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
in the Circuit Court who's who is
 
04:52:11.208 --> 04:52:11.218 align:start position:0%
available to do that work and she is not
 
04:52:14.270 --> 04:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
able to keep up with the requests for
 
04:52:16.730 --> 04:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
data so this position would be created
 
04:52:19.430 --> 04:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
Branch wide and it would help to address
 
04:52:22.368 --> 04:52:22.378 align:start position:0%
those requests and other needs for data
 
04:52:24.590 --> 04:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
throughout the branch on a on a
 
04:52:26.930 --> 04:52:26.940 align:start position:0%
branch-wide basis do you want to skip
 
04:52:30.650 --> 04:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
down okay the other mention here that I
 
04:52:31.970 --> 04:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
was going to cover is the grant program
 
04:52:34.788 --> 04:52:34.798 align:start position:0%
expansion so we were fortunate enough to
 
04:52:38.750 --> 04:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
hire a grant manager through the drug
 
04:52:40.788 --> 04:52:40.798 align:start position:0%
court Grant who is excellent she came
 
04:52:43.550 --> 04:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
from doj she has a lot of experience and
 
04:52:46.070 --> 04:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
in order to have her spend some time
 
04:52:47.930 --> 04:52:47.940 align:start position:0%
looking for other potential grants that
 
04:52:50.090 --> 04:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
that we could get to to continue to do
 
04:52:52.730 --> 04:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
good work in the in the drug courts in
 
04:52:55.190 --> 04:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
the family treatment Court mental health
 
04:52:58.368 --> 04:52:58.378 align:start position:0%
courts all of those areas she can't be
 
04:53:00.288 --> 04:53:00.298 align:start position:0%
just working on the drug court Grant
 
04:53:01.610 --> 04:53:01.620 align:start position:0%
because we would have to charge it to
 
04:53:02.930 --> 04:53:02.940 align:start position:0%
that Grant and we're not allowed to do
 
04:53:05.330 --> 04:53:05.340 align:start position:0%
that so this allows us to
 
04:53:08.030 --> 04:53:08.040 align:start position:0%
pay a portion of her salary with General
 
04:53:10.190 --> 04:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
funds for a period of time as we grow
 
04:53:12.650 --> 04:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
the grant program our ultimate goal is
 
04:53:15.288 --> 04:53:15.298 align:start position:0%
to be somewhat like doj and have a Grant
 
04:53:17.030 --> 04:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
Management unit that is completely
 
04:53:19.190 --> 04:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
self-funded so this would allow us to
 
04:53:21.110 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
move in that direction
 
04:53:29.628 --> 04:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:31.930 --> 04:53:31.940 align:start position:0%
judge Ashley's going to talk about
 
04:53:36.770 --> 04:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:39.890 --> 04:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
yes so um obviously the court is
 
04:53:42.050 --> 04:53:42.060 align:start position:0%
required to provide an interpreter to
 
04:53:43.610 --> 04:53:43.620 align:start position:0%
anyone who's participating in a court
 
04:53:43.620 --> 04:53:44.690 align:start position:0%
anyone who's participating in a court
process

04:53:44.690 --> 04:53:44.700 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:53:46.850 --> 04:53:46.860 align:start position:0%
and that's clearly an issue that we
 
04:53:48.288 --> 04:53:48.298 align:start position:0%
don't have control over as far as how
 
04:53:49.910 --> 04:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
many requests that we get we need to
 
04:53:53.510 --> 04:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
provide that we have and it's an it's a
 
04:53:55.368 --> 04:53:55.378 align:start position:0%
critical access to justice issue for
 
04:54:00.050 --> 04:54:00.060 align:start position:0%
folks we have promoted the availability
 
04:54:02.030 --> 04:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
of interpreters by making sure that we
 
04:54:03.650 --> 04:54:03.660 align:start position:0%
have appropriate signage in our courts
 
04:54:05.390 --> 04:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
so that folks understand if they come in
 
04:54:06.530 --> 04:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
they speak a different language that
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
they can make that request for an
 
04:54:10.128 --> 04:54:10.138 align:start position:0%
interpreter what we've seen through the
 
04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
years has been a gradual uptick in the
 
04:54:15.410 --> 04:54:15.420 align:start position:0%
cost of our total budget for
 
04:54:18.110 --> 04:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
interpreters we've made requests for a
 
04:54:20.030 --> 04:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
specific amount of money for
 
04:54:21.288 --> 04:54:21.298 align:start position:0%
interpreters and then you've probably
 
04:54:23.628 --> 04:54:23.638 align:start position:0%
seen us come back Midway through saying
 
04:54:25.368 --> 04:54:25.378 align:start position:0%
that we've run out of that money we need
 
04:54:27.650 --> 04:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
to have some additional money so there's
 
04:54:29.930 --> 04:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
been a big increase if you look between
 
04:54:29.940 --> 04:54:31.690 align:start position:0%
been a big increase if you look between
maybe

04:54:31.690 --> 04:54:31.700 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
04:54:35.030 --> 04:54:35.040 align:start position:0%
2019 and and 2022 went up about a
 
04:54:39.590 --> 04:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
hundred and ten thousand and so that's
 
04:54:41.510 --> 04:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
why our budget is going up on that line
 
04:54:43.730 --> 04:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
item in particular this time around is
 
04:54:45.170 --> 04:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we've got enough money
 
04:54:47.208 --> 04:54:47.218 align:start position:0%
in that pool hopefully to avoid us
 
04:54:48.708 --> 04:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
having to come back again Midway through
 
04:54:51.190 --> 04:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
and say we have run out once again
 
04:54:53.750 --> 04:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
and so that's
 
04:54:55.970 --> 04:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
the issue with interpreters I'm happy to
 
04:54:58.730 --> 04:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
try to answer any questions you may have
 
04:55:00.770 --> 04:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
yes representative Sweeney thank you
 
04:55:02.510 --> 04:55:02.520 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for being here um
 
04:55:04.368 --> 04:55:04.378 align:start position:0%
when you say interpreters are is it
 
04:55:07.368 --> 04:55:07.378 align:start position:0%
mainly foreign language or is it Amer
 
04:55:10.070 --> 04:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
American Sign Language yes
 
04:55:13.010 --> 04:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
absolutely is there a breakdown as to
 
04:55:15.350 --> 04:55:15.360 align:start position:0%
how what's foreign language and what's
 
04:55:17.690 --> 04:55:17.700 align:start position:0%
sign language I don't have that detail
 
04:55:22.610 --> 04:55:22.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:25.368 --> 04:55:25.378 align:start position:0%
body for the hearing impaired language
 
04:55:28.190 --> 04:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:55:28.200 --> 04:55:29.868 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

04:55:29.868 --> 04:55:29.878 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:55:32.448 --> 04:55:32.458 align:start position:0%
yeah so are you are you having to find
 
04:55:35.150 --> 04:55:35.160 align:start position:0%
folks for many different languages now
 
04:55:37.788 --> 04:55:37.798 align:start position:0%
than you used to and are they hard to
 
04:55:40.788 --> 04:55:40.798 align:start position:0%
find sometimes yes and yes
 
04:55:44.330 --> 04:55:44.340 align:start position:0%
um and and frankly the pandemic has as
 
04:55:46.150 --> 04:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
it has impacted many
 
04:55:49.190 --> 04:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
areas in many Industries it certainly
 
04:55:50.930 --> 04:55:50.940 align:start position:0%
has made it more difficult for us to
 
04:55:54.230 --> 04:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
find interpreters for quite a while we
 
04:55:55.990 --> 04:55:56.000 align:start position:0%
had to do hearings
 
04:55:59.150 --> 04:55:59.160 align:start position:0%
remotely and many of our interpreters
 
04:56:01.390 --> 04:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
were doing just that and they have been
 
04:56:03.530 --> 04:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
how shall I say
 
04:56:06.590 --> 04:56:06.600 align:start position:0%
a little reluctant to come back in to do
 
04:56:09.110 --> 04:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
things in person so it's making it much
 
04:56:10.910 --> 04:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
more difficult on our staff to make sure
 
04:56:12.350 --> 04:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
that we've got appropriate interpreters
 
04:56:14.050 --> 04:56:14.060 align:start position:0%
in all of the cases
 
04:56:16.610 --> 04:56:16.620 align:start position:0%
and of course the expansion of of
 
04:56:17.930 --> 04:56:17.940 align:start position:0%
different languages
 
04:56:21.590 --> 04:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
is also an issue so it is a struggle but
 
04:56:22.970 --> 04:56:22.980 align:start position:0%
we continue to make sure that we have
 
04:56:25.128 --> 04:56:25.138 align:start position:0%
someone when we need to have them for
 
04:56:27.788 --> 04:56:27.798 align:start position:0%
any of our hearings
 
04:56:30.110 --> 04:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
are there a couple of particular
 
04:56:32.570 --> 04:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
languages in particular that you've seen
 
04:56:35.208 --> 04:56:35.218 align:start position:0%
an increase in I'm curious because it
 
04:56:37.610 --> 04:56:37.620 align:start position:0%
would be reflective probably of new
 
04:56:39.350 --> 04:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
citizens that are coming I think so I
 
04:56:42.830 --> 04:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
mean clearly you know the yes I mean
 
04:56:46.070 --> 04:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
Spanish is is our primary language that
 
04:56:48.050 --> 04:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
we're seeing interpreters for but there
 
04:56:49.788 --> 04:56:49.798 align:start position:0%
are different immigrant immigrant
 
04:56:51.830 --> 04:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
immigrant populations that we're seeing
 
04:56:53.810 --> 04:56:53.820 align:start position:0%
that we're getting additional inquiries
 
04:56:55.670 --> 04:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
and but there's so many dialects out
 
04:56:57.050 --> 04:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
there that
 
04:56:59.690 --> 04:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
um it it sometimes is difficult to make
 
04:57:01.190 --> 04:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
sure that we've got the the appropriate
 
04:57:02.690 --> 04:57:02.700 align:start position:0%
interpreter for the appropriate language
 
04:57:05.510 --> 04:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
and then to the question about hearing
 
04:57:09.170 --> 04:57:09.180 align:start position:0%
impaired those interpretation
 
04:57:11.090 --> 04:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
um needs are actually
 
04:57:13.250 --> 04:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
um double every time that you have a
 
04:57:15.410 --> 04:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
someone who is hearing impaired we need
 
04:57:17.208 --> 04:57:17.218 align:start position:0%
to have two and that's just because of
 
04:57:19.310 --> 04:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
the process by which they they do that
 
04:57:22.190 --> 04:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
so it's you know sometimes if you have a
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
parenting case and both parents are deaf
 
04:57:26.628 --> 04:57:26.638 align:start position:0%
then you've got four interpreters that
 
04:57:29.090 --> 04:57:29.100 align:start position:0%
you need it can be quite challenging
 
04:57:31.250 --> 04:57:31.260 align:start position:0%
along those lines
 
04:57:33.590 --> 04:57:33.600 align:start position:0%
but we continue to sort of shake the
 
04:57:35.570 --> 04:57:35.580 align:start position:0%
bushes and try to make sure we've got
 
04:57:38.390 --> 04:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
enough folks on board to do these really
 
04:57:39.650 --> 04:57:39.660 align:start position:0%
important work to make sure that people
 
04:57:41.030 --> 04:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
can understand the proceedings that
 
04:57:44.510 --> 04:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:47.090 --> 04:57:47.100 align:start position:0%
yes representing camberells thank you Mr
 
04:57:50.030 --> 04:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
chair just out of curiosity is it a flat
 
04:57:52.910 --> 04:57:52.920 align:start position:0%
fee for any kind of language inter or do
 
04:57:54.590 --> 04:57:54.600 align:start position:0%
you have to pay more money for certain
 
04:57:56.868 --> 04:57:56.878 align:start position:0%
languages another
 
04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
excellent question I'm gonna turn behind
 
04:57:59.520 --> 04:58:04.610 align:start position:0%
excellent question I'm gonna turn behind
me

04:58:04.610 --> 04:58:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:07.670 --> 04:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:09.170 --> 04:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
if it's still somewhere in order to
 
04:58:12.230 --> 04:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
interpret these types of terms sometimes
 
04:58:15.350 --> 04:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
um it's conversational where you you
 
04:58:17.628 --> 04:58:17.638 align:start position:0%
know the latest window I think they get
 
04:58:19.788 --> 04:58:19.798 align:start position:0%
new work they're a very political person
 
04:58:24.770 --> 04:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
in that and I think also more rare types
 
04:58:27.530 --> 04:58:27.540 align:start position:0%
of languages require higher as well so
 
04:58:32.390 --> 04:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:34.490 --> 04:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
04:58:34.500 --> 04:58:36.288 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
Ashley

04:58:36.288 --> 04:58:36.298 align:start position:0%
Ashley
 
04:58:39.530 --> 04:58:39.540 align:start position:0%
so the final slide is Slide 15.
 
04:58:39.540 --> 04:58:43.730 align:start position:0%
so the final slide is Slide 15.
and

04:58:43.730 --> 04:58:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:43.740 --> 04:58:44.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:58:44.810 --> 04:58:44.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:47.090 --> 04:58:47.100 align:start position:0%
the point of this slide is to establish
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
that and and to convey to the committee
 
04:58:52.670 --> 04:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
that that the request our budget is
 
04:58:52.680 --> 04:58:54.110 align:start position:0%
that that the request our budget is
basically

04:58:54.110 --> 04:58:54.120 align:start position:0%
basically
 
04:58:57.830 --> 04:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh is is heavily founded on our
 
04:59:00.110 --> 04:59:00.120 align:start position:0%
evidence-based way State way to caseload
 
04:59:03.890 --> 04:59:03.900 align:start position:0%
study the overall uh increase in our
 
04:59:06.590 --> 04:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
budget as we saw in slide 8 is 6.1
 
04:59:10.070 --> 04:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
percent if you back out our requests
 
04:59:13.070 --> 04:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
related to weighted caseload we're at
 
04:59:14.570 --> 04:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
point four percent we're essentially
 
04:59:16.010 --> 04:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
flat funded
 
04:59:19.010 --> 04:59:19.020 align:start position:0%
so we we're trying to be very prudent
 
04:59:22.250 --> 04:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
stewards and partners in in managing uh
 
04:59:24.350 --> 04:59:24.360 align:start position:0%
public finances
 
04:59:28.010 --> 04:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
um but we're here we're here asking for
 
04:59:30.288 --> 04:59:30.298 align:start position:0%
the legislature to support this division
 
04:59:33.230 --> 04:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
support in in meeting the needs that
 
04:59:35.090 --> 04:59:35.100 align:start position:0%
were identified in the way to caseload
 
04:59:35.100 --> 04:59:37.310 align:start position:0%
were identified in the way to caseload
study

04:59:37.310 --> 04:59:37.320 align:start position:0%
study
 
04:59:39.948 --> 04:59:39.958 align:start position:0%
with with that Mr chairman respectfully
 
04:59:39.958 --> 04:59:43.550 align:start position:0%
with with that Mr chairman respectfully
submitted

04:59:43.550 --> 04:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:46.128 --> 04:59:46.138 align:start position:0%
I don't see any questions other than
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire to my left but I
 
04:59:52.430 --> 04:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
I do have one for Donna out there I no
 
04:59:55.128 --> 04:59:55.138 align:start position:0%
she's she could tell us how many pencils
 
04:59:58.190 --> 04:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
that you ordered or pens and from past
 
05:00:00.170 --> 05:00:00.180 align:start position:0%
history I don't think I would
 
05:00:02.990 --> 05:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
like you'll see there you go
 
05:00:07.250 --> 05:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
so on page 198 of your budget
 
05:00:10.970 --> 05:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
there's a line 27 22 it says Court
 
05:00:19.128 --> 05:00:19.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:22.670 --> 05:00:22.680 align:start position:0%
back in 2012 now how time flies
 
05:00:25.128 --> 05:00:25.138 align:start position:0%
um that accounting unit existed and I
 
05:00:26.868 --> 05:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
asked about it and at the time the
 
05:00:28.970 --> 05:00:28.980 align:start position:0%
judicial branch was primarily generally
 
05:00:31.070 --> 05:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
funded as the chief justice has spoken
 
05:00:32.448 --> 05:00:32.458 align:start position:0%
about we're trying to build a grants
 
05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
management division but grants were
 
05:00:36.650 --> 05:00:36.660 align:start position:0%
pretty much an afterthought it was
 
05:00:39.770 --> 05:00:39.780 align:start position:0%
really General funds and I believe
 
05:00:41.510 --> 05:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
there may have been a few grants that we
 
05:00:43.788 --> 05:00:43.798 align:start position:0%
had at the time but this accounting unit
 
05:00:45.890 --> 05:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
was created to sort of be representative
 
05:00:49.310 --> 05:00:49.320 align:start position:0%
of the federal grants that we had there
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
was some discussion with this go around
 
05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
to maybe in a in an effort to be more
 
05:00:56.990 --> 05:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
transparent to maybe list those
 
05:00:58.970 --> 05:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
accounting units for the federal grants
 
05:01:00.590 --> 05:01:00.600 align:start position:0%
that we get on a regular basis they're
 
05:01:02.448 --> 05:01:02.458 align:start position:0%
not a lot of money but we do get them
 
05:01:04.430 --> 05:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
year after year a lot of the other
 
05:01:06.890 --> 05:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
grants that we have now tend to be
 
05:01:08.510 --> 05:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
competitive grants so we're never sure
 
05:01:10.970 --> 05:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
that we're going to get them and the
 
05:01:12.770 --> 05:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
timing sometimes isn't right but we have
 
05:01:15.410 --> 05:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
had discussions about maybe updating
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
that and not just have this one
 
05:01:19.070 --> 05:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
accounting unit to be representative of
 
05:01:21.770 --> 05:01:21.780 align:start position:0%
our federal grants it caught my eye
 
05:01:24.650 --> 05:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
because it had gone from 350 to over 800
 
05:01:27.288 --> 05:01:27.298 align:start position:0%
000 so it kind of stuck out yes and
 
05:01:29.510 --> 05:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's because we a lot of it is the
 
05:01:32.448 --> 05:01:32.458 align:start position:0%
salaries and benefits so basically
 
05:01:35.330 --> 05:01:35.340 align:start position:0%
people who staff whom we have now that
 
05:01:36.948 --> 05:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
are funded through these federal grants
 
05:01:39.230 --> 05:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
they go into that accounting unit bucket
 
05:01:41.090 --> 05:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
if you will
 
05:01:43.368 --> 05:01:43.378 align:start position:0%
yes any questions uh further
 
05:01:46.010 --> 05:01:46.020 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
05:01:47.628 --> 05:01:47.638 align:start position:0%
thank you none of them this specific
 
05:01:50.810 --> 05:01:50.820 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah all right thank you so yeah
 
05:01:52.368 --> 05:01:52.378 align:start position:0%
this question might might be better
 
05:01:55.070 --> 05:01:55.080 align:start position:0%
directed at judge NATO I think
 
05:01:57.530 --> 05:01:57.540 align:start position:0%
um because about Superior Court
 
05:02:00.050 --> 05:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
um so I'm looking on page four
 
05:02:09.250 --> 05:02:09.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:11.448 --> 05:02:11.458 align:start position:0%
22 yep
 
05:02:16.628 --> 05:02:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:19.310 --> 05:02:19.320 align:start position:0%
we have we have 21
 
05:02:22.490 --> 05:02:22.500 align:start position:0%
associate Justice one chief justice the
 
05:02:24.708 --> 05:02:24.718 align:start position:0%
weighted caseload study called for three
 
05:02:27.350 --> 05:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
and a half new judges I see and we're
 
05:02:29.930 --> 05:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
asking for one dungeon all right so
 
05:02:31.850 --> 05:02:31.860 align:start position:0%
let's call it 20 then
 
05:02:35.570 --> 05:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
all right so does does a does a judge
 
05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
yes the new case filings a year so
 
05:02:47.270 --> 05:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
they're not always working on all of
 
05:02:49.250 --> 05:02:49.260 align:start position:0%
them at all times so for example one day
 
05:02:52.128 --> 05:02:52.138 align:start position:0%
they may have from 9 to 10 o'clock 10
 
05:02:55.368 --> 05:02:55.378 align:start position:0%
plea hearings and then from 10 to 4 a
 
05:02:56.810 --> 05:02:56.820 align:start position:0%
jury trial or a bench trial or
 
05:02:59.090 --> 05:02:59.100 align:start position:0%
significant evidentiary hearing so but
 
05:03:00.890 --> 05:03:00.900 align:start position:0%
they are they are creeping up I remember
 
05:03:03.490 --> 05:03:03.500 align:start position:0%
when I first started as cheap in 2011
 
05:03:06.590 --> 05:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
the average number of cases new case
 
05:03:08.750 --> 05:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
filings per judge per year was between
 
05:03:11.270 --> 05:03:11.280 align:start position:0%
five and six hundred and now it's up to
 
05:03:11.280 --> 05:03:13.690 align:start position:0%
five and six hundred and now it's up to
900.

05:03:13.690 --> 05:03:13.700 align:start position:0%
900.
 
05:03:16.430 --> 05:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
so so you could really handle a felony
 
05:03:18.410 --> 05:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
in 10 minutes or something like that I
 
05:03:20.448 --> 05:03:20.458 align:start position:0%
mean I know I don't pretend I'm tend to
 
05:03:22.010 --> 05:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
understand the methadone apology behind
 
05:03:23.448 --> 05:03:23.458 align:start position:0%
the whole weighted caseload study but I
 
05:03:25.610 --> 05:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
do trust it so it depends I think
 
05:03:27.650 --> 05:03:27.660 align:start position:0%
they're including not just a jury trial
 
05:03:30.410 --> 05:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
but you know a felony plea if it's a
 
05:03:32.628 --> 05:03:32.638 align:start position:0%
simple one can take five to ten minutes
 
05:03:34.970 --> 05:03:34.980 align:start position:0%
or 15 minutes depending on the judge
 
05:03:36.590 --> 05:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
some judges take longer some judges take
 
05:03:38.868 --> 05:03:38.878 align:start position:0%
shorter so they're folding in all the
 
05:03:41.530 --> 05:03:41.540 align:start position:0%
plays plus the trials and probably
 
05:03:44.868 --> 05:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
95 of cases end up in a negotiated
 
05:03:46.970 --> 05:03:46.980 align:start position:0%
resolution and five percent go to trial
 
05:03:49.730 --> 05:03:49.740 align:start position:0%
I see so for those 95 it's mostly
 
05:03:51.350 --> 05:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
reading and signing a piece of paper
 
05:03:53.390 --> 05:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
seeing them
 
05:03:55.190 --> 05:03:55.200 align:start position:0%
extend your rights and
 
05:03:57.530 --> 05:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
sorry do you review the facts and I see
 
05:03:59.090 --> 05:03:59.100 align:start position:0%
that's interesting
 
05:04:01.368 --> 05:04:01.378 align:start position:0%
um so so we're talking about adding a
 
05:04:03.830 --> 05:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
judge yes a land use judge right right
 
05:04:07.010 --> 05:04:07.020 align:start position:0%
and which you we we agreed is is the
 
05:04:08.990 --> 05:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
judge right what is the extra judge all
 
05:04:09.000 --> 05:04:09.948 align:start position:0%
judge right what is the extra judge all
right

05:04:09.948 --> 05:04:09.958 align:start position:0%
right
 
05:04:13.310 --> 05:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
how many land use cases do you expect
 
05:04:24.410 --> 05:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:25.970 --> 05:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
we're from
 
05:04:30.110 --> 05:04:30.120 align:start position:0%
you know 35 to 50 of their time on the
 
05:04:31.368 --> 05:04:31.378 align:start position:0%
land use docket it's a little bit
 
05:04:33.708 --> 05:04:33.718 align:start position:0%
unclear right now but then because the
 
05:04:35.868 --> 05:04:35.878 align:start position:0%
way to caseload study says we could use
 
05:04:37.550 --> 05:04:37.560 align:start position:0%
three and a half then we will use the
 
05:04:39.590 --> 05:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
rest of that judge's time to help manage
 
05:04:41.270 --> 05:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
the docket probably in Hills North
 
05:04:43.010 --> 05:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
because it's the busiest
 
05:04:46.128 --> 05:04:46.138 align:start position:0%
okay so all right so a halftime judge
 
05:04:48.650 --> 05:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
could handle all the land use cases
 
05:04:48.660 --> 05:04:49.850 align:start position:0%
could handle all the land use cases
roughly

05:04:49.850 --> 05:04:49.860 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
05:04:51.530 --> 05:04:51.540 align:start position:0%
well we don't have any halftime judges
 
05:04:53.690 --> 05:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
no I know part-time judges
 
05:04:55.788 --> 05:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
you want to go ahead you can I wanted to
 
05:04:59.510 --> 05:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
ask so my question is I assume a land
 
05:05:01.730 --> 05:05:01.740 align:start position:0%
use case is not a 10-minute case right
 
05:05:03.770 --> 05:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
it's a they're they're long they're
 
05:05:03.780 --> 05:05:06.650 align:start position:0%
it's a they're they're long they're
complicated

05:05:06.650 --> 05:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:08.150 --> 05:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
it's another reason why we think this
 
05:05:09.590 --> 05:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
would be a good move because it could
 
05:05:12.230 --> 05:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
help move that docket along so right now
 
05:05:14.090 --> 05:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
all the judges handle all you know
 
05:05:15.470 --> 05:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
planning board appeals zoning board
 
05:05:16.970 --> 05:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
appeals and if they've got an
 
05:05:18.830 --> 05:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
incarcerated afsa they've got to take
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
that first so the land you stock it
 
05:05:23.030 --> 05:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
would be able to prioritize the land use
 
05:05:25.610 --> 05:05:25.620 align:start position:0%
cases and keep them moving right and do
 
05:05:27.590 --> 05:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
you do you under do you have an idea of
 
05:05:29.750 --> 05:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
how many that is because and the reason
 
05:05:31.430 --> 05:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you the reason I'm asking is
 
05:05:33.708 --> 05:05:33.718 align:start position:0%
we heard today from the housing appeals
 
05:05:33.718 --> 05:05:34.670 align:start position:0%
we heard today from the housing appeals
board

05:05:34.670 --> 05:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
board
 
05:05:37.490 --> 05:05:37.500 align:start position:0%
okay which is the alternative right in
 
05:05:39.050 --> 05:05:39.060 align:start position:0%
in a lot of cases right they could go to
 
05:05:40.670 --> 05:05:40.680 align:start position:0%
Superior Court or they could go to the
 
05:05:40.680 --> 05:05:43.490 align:start position:0%
Superior Court or they could go to the
house

05:05:43.490 --> 05:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:46.310 --> 05:05:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's what we heard so they've had it
 
05:05:49.350 --> 05:05:49.360 align:start position:0%
in two years 65 cases
 
05:05:49.360 --> 05:05:55.430 align:start position:0%
in two years 65 cases
[Laughter]

05:05:55.430 --> 05:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:57.350 --> 05:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
the zoning board appeals land use
 
05:06:01.250 --> 05:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
appeals tax abatement well tax is tax
 
05:06:03.350 --> 05:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
and land appeal support right so that's
 
05:06:04.610 --> 05:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
slightly different
 
05:06:07.250 --> 05:06:07.260 align:start position:0%
be the land you stock it would be a
 
05:06:09.470 --> 05:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
zoning board Appeals
 
05:06:11.810 --> 05:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
of those taxes
 
05:06:15.050 --> 05:06:15.060 align:start position:0%
okay yeah but I mean it's probably more
 
05:06:18.830 --> 05:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
like on the order of you know 200 to 500
 
05:06:20.750 --> 05:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
cases or something they're all going to
 
05:06:23.868 --> 05:06:23.878 align:start position:0%
that land use docket board I see yeah
 
05:06:26.930 --> 05:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
yeah gotcha all right so you think the
 
05:06:29.150 --> 05:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
Judge half time
 
05:06:32.810 --> 05:06:32.820 align:start position:0%
could do these 200 cases and then the
 
05:06:40.010 --> 05:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:42.890 --> 05:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
300 kids okay I understand exactly thank
 
05:06:45.530 --> 05:06:45.540 align:start position:0%
you very much thank you
 
05:06:47.448 --> 05:06:47.458 align:start position:0%
I believe where representative McGuire
 
05:06:49.368 --> 05:06:49.378 align:start position:0%
was going as we did have some debate
 
05:06:51.230 --> 05:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
earlier about the housing appeals board
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
right and their budgets nearly 900 000
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
for 65 cases for two years and it's all
 
05:07:00.350 --> 05:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
General funded
 
05:07:03.530 --> 05:07:03.540 align:start position:0%
so with this additional position which
 
05:07:05.208 --> 05:07:05.218 align:start position:0%
was approved by the legislature
 
05:07:06.948 --> 05:07:06.958 align:start position:0%
announced before our division next
 
05:07:09.770 --> 05:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
Friday I believe
 
05:07:11.930 --> 05:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
we were just trying to get a handle on
 
05:07:14.690 --> 05:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
do we need housing appeals board is this
 
05:07:17.270 --> 05:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
particular Justice become full-time land
 
05:07:20.510 --> 05:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
use housing type of thing
 
05:07:23.930 --> 05:07:23.940 align:start position:0%
and they roughly cost the same each the
 
05:07:27.470 --> 05:07:27.480 align:start position:0%
judge and and staff versus the housing
 
05:07:29.390 --> 05:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
appeals board and staff are each about
 
05:07:33.410 --> 05:07:33.420 align:start position:0%
500 000 a year I can try I can get you a
 
05:07:34.910 --> 05:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
better number but it is in the hundreds
 
05:07:37.550 --> 05:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
gotcha thank you representative Sweeney
 
05:07:39.170 --> 05:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you again
 
05:07:40.970 --> 05:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
both for for being here everyone here
 
05:07:43.010 --> 05:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
taking questions talked about security
 
05:07:46.250 --> 05:07:46.260 align:start position:0%
uh mainly in the courtrooms I I would
 
05:07:47.990 --> 05:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
imagine and I'm not sure if this has
 
05:07:49.730 --> 05:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
been an issue in the past or it might be
 
05:07:52.490 --> 05:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
in the future uh but judges in their
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
execution of their duties
 
05:07:56.570 --> 05:07:56.580 align:start position:0%
become public figures some of their
 
05:07:57.890 --> 05:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
cases are heated
 
05:07:59.930 --> 05:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
heightened security outside of the
 
05:08:02.030 --> 05:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
courtroom does that fall on the judicial
 
05:08:05.510 --> 05:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
branch to provide or or the state police
 
05:08:08.208 --> 05:08:08.218 align:start position:0%
step in how does that work with the
 
05:08:09.490 --> 05:08:09.500 align:start position:0%
being a separate branch of government
 
05:08:12.410 --> 05:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
and if there is a security risk for a
 
05:08:15.170 --> 05:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
judge or potentially even a jury in a
 
05:08:17.208 --> 05:08:17.218 align:start position:0%
case yeah so the our court security
 
05:08:17.218 --> 05:08:19.368 align:start position:0%
case yeah so the our court security
officers

05:08:19.368 --> 05:08:19.378 align:start position:0%
officers
 
05:08:19.378 --> 05:08:20.090 align:start position:0%
officers
um

05:08:20.090 --> 05:08:20.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:23.570 --> 05:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
uh are in our courtrooms and they secure
 
05:08:24.970 --> 05:08:24.980 align:start position:0%
our buildings
 
05:08:28.610 --> 05:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
when there's an event involving that
 
05:08:31.250 --> 05:08:31.260 align:start position:0%
extends beyond the four corners of our
 
05:08:33.410 --> 05:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
building we will involve local law
 
05:08:35.208 --> 05:08:35.218 align:start position:0%
enforcement and when appropriate State
 
05:08:35.218 --> 05:08:39.530 align:start position:0%
enforcement and when appropriate State
Police

05:08:39.530 --> 05:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:41.330 --> 05:08:41.340 align:start position:0%
further questions from the division
 
05:08:43.550 --> 05:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
representative evil I actually want to
 
05:08:45.590 --> 05:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
go back to the housing appeals board so
 
05:08:48.490 --> 05:08:48.500 align:start position:0%
you implied more of the folks are
 
05:08:51.288 --> 05:08:51.298 align:start position:0%
tending to still go to the superior
 
05:08:53.810 --> 05:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
court that is clear yes
 
05:08:56.690 --> 05:08:56.700 align:start position:0%
yes I have no idea why that's really
 
05:08:56.700 --> 05:08:58.788 align:start position:0%
yes I have no idea why that's really
interesting

05:08:58.788 --> 05:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
05:09:01.970 --> 05:09:01.980 align:start position:0%
um idea I would only be speculating
 
05:09:03.770 --> 05:09:03.780 align:start position:0%
it may be that that's what they're used
 
05:09:05.868 --> 05:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
to and it may be that that's where it
 
05:09:08.150 --> 05:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
feels most final you know I'm not
 
05:09:10.550 --> 05:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable yeah comfortable
 
05:09:12.470 --> 05:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
because they appeal from the housing
 
05:09:15.170 --> 05:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
appeals board to the superior to the
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court right they said they'd had
 
05:09:20.510 --> 05:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
about four or five cases there and I
 
05:09:23.510 --> 05:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
think three went to the superior Supreme
 
05:09:25.550 --> 05:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
Court said three of them went upheld
 
05:09:27.948 --> 05:09:27.958 align:start position:0%
yeah two are still in this was still in
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
works in the middle
 
05:09:34.010 --> 05:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
interesting part of it might be
 
05:09:36.170 --> 05:09:36.180 align:start position:0%
um commercial cases can't go to the
 
05:09:38.090 --> 05:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
housing appeals for it so I don't know
 
05:09:41.628 --> 05:09:41.638 align:start position:0%
if if you know most of those cases in
 
05:09:43.910 --> 05:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
the spirit Court are commercial and not
 
05:09:43.920 --> 05:09:45.350 align:start position:0%
the spirit Court are commercial and not
residential

05:09:45.350 --> 05:09:45.360 align:start position:0%
residential
 
05:09:45.360 --> 05:09:47.990 align:start position:0%
residential
commercial

05:09:47.990 --> 05:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:50.690 --> 05:09:50.700 align:start position:0%
real estate type stuff I don't I mean I
 
05:09:53.890 --> 05:09:53.900 align:start position:0%
think it's a big mix okay big mix
 
05:09:56.090 --> 05:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
I've heard a lot of talk about how
 
05:09:57.770 --> 05:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
important it was to have this and how
 
05:09:59.990 --> 05:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
lengthy it was to go to court this is
 
05:10:02.390 --> 05:10:02.400 align:start position:0%
what we really need I heard that for two
 
05:10:04.490 --> 05:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
years we finally passed it and it's kind
 
05:10:05.930 --> 05:10:05.940 align:start position:0%
of fizzy
 
05:10:07.910 --> 05:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like you're going to take
 
05:10:10.910 --> 05:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
up the physical note on the housing on
 
05:10:16.730 --> 05:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:18.410 --> 05:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
that's the separate bill we're talking
 
05:10:22.070 --> 05:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:22.080 --> 05:10:23.628 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:10:23.628 --> 05:10:23.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:10:25.490 --> 05:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
well if it's helpful to the division
 
05:10:27.470 --> 05:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll we can refine these numbers
 
05:10:33.288 --> 05:10:33.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:33.298 --> 05:10:35.810 align:start position:0%
 
yep

05:10:35.810 --> 05:10:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:35.820 --> 05:10:36.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:10:36.590 --> 05:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:10:41.868 --> 05:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
it has been the customary practice of
 
05:10:43.850 --> 05:10:43.860 align:start position:0%
this division as long as I've been here
 
05:10:46.670 --> 05:10:46.680 align:start position:0%
this will be my eighth term to approve
 
05:10:49.850 --> 05:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch budget as presented
 
05:10:52.910 --> 05:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
again we do ask some questions
 
05:10:55.610 --> 05:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
don't want to take up my totally Off The
 
05:10:58.628 --> 05:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
Hook from providing the answers but
 
05:11:01.490 --> 05:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
it's been moved is it second and
 
05:11:04.010 --> 05:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
seconded is there any further discussion
 
05:11:05.150 --> 05:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
on that
 
05:11:07.490 --> 05:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
seeing none those in favor of the clerk
 
05:11:09.110 --> 05:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
will call the role and the acceptance of
 
05:11:10.910 --> 05:11:10.920 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
 
05:11:10.920 --> 05:11:13.850 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch
budget

05:11:13.850 --> 05:11:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:16.128 --> 05:11:16.138 align:start position:0%
and I assume it's also will be
 
05:11:18.770 --> 05:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
supporting representative Lynn's
 
05:11:18.780 --> 05:11:21.890 align:start position:0%
supporting representative Lynn's
suggestion

05:11:21.890 --> 05:11:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:22.970 --> 05:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
I think it passed the house
 
05:11:25.250 --> 05:11:25.260 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly didn't it representative
 
05:11:25.260 --> 05:11:26.330 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly didn't it representative
Lynn

05:11:26.330 --> 05:11:26.340 align:start position:0%
Lynn
 
05:11:30.770 --> 05:11:30.780 align:start position:0%
your house additional yes three four
 
05:11:39.470 --> 05:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
by a very large margin well this this
 
05:11:44.330 --> 05:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
brings up a question right is that extra
 
05:11:47.628 --> 05:11:47.638 align:start position:0%
judge already in no that's this would be
 
05:11:49.430 --> 05:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
the the position it would become that
 
05:11:59.230 --> 05:11:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:06.050 --> 05:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:09.350 --> 05:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
well I'd also find unusual is they come
 
05:12:11.448 --> 05:12:11.458 align:start position:0%
back from our first one and so we're
 
05:12:12.470 --> 05:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
going to cut here we're going to cut
 
05:12:14.510 --> 05:12:14.520 align:start position:0%
there we're going to cut here what other
 
05:12:16.850 --> 05:12:16.860 align:start position:0%
what other agency or Department ever
 
05:12:20.270 --> 05:12:20.280 align:start position:0%
does that they want us to add well
 
05:12:20.280 --> 05:12:21.430 align:start position:0%
does that they want us to add well
but

05:12:21.430 --> 05:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:12:24.530 --> 05:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
obviously obviously the the full budget
 
05:12:25.970 --> 05:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
is going to be more but they're still
 
05:12:28.010 --> 05:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
working every minute to try to keep it
 
05:12:31.368 --> 05:12:31.378 align:start position:0%
at a minimum and I appreciate that I
 
05:12:33.530 --> 05:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
think that's a good sign that's why we
 
05:12:36.350 --> 05:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
are more likely to say yes pass it
 
05:12:38.570 --> 05:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
through they've done their job
 
05:12:41.448 --> 05:12:41.458 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman Mary I
 
05:12:45.170 --> 05:12:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:58.150 --> 05:12:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:02.030 --> 05:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
nobody wants your position no chance of
 
05:13:04.368 --> 05:13:04.378 align:start position:0%
that please do it
 
05:13:10.128 --> 05:13:10.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:13.128 --> 05:13:13.138 align:start position:0%
by your name and appear in favor and you
 
05:13:14.510 --> 05:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
can't sell by saying anything if you're
 
05:13:17.410 --> 05:13:17.420 align:start position:0%
opposed to your same name
 
05:13:17.420 --> 05:13:19.368 align:start position:0%
opposed to your same name
yeah

05:13:19.368 --> 05:13:19.378 align:start position:0%

05:13:26.100 --> 05:13:30.890 align:start position:0%
 
yes

05:13:30.890 --> 05:13:30.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:33.288 --> 05:13:33.298 align:start position:0%
