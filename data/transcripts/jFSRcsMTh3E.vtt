means I'd like to thank you for the

courtesy extended to me due to the
 
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
scheduling of another bill in another
 
00:09:05.949 --> 00:09:05.959 align:start position:0%
committee at nearly the same time this
 
00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
morning uh special helps thanks to
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative Susan elme for
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
introducing hb23 on my behalf like
 
00:09:17.310 --> 00:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
anyone not directly involved with the
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
participating Charities or gambling
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
facilities I was not aware that rent was
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
being charged and the Charity's proceeds
 
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
reduced by hundreds of dollars
 
00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:29.240 align:start position:0%
considering that the benefit to the
 
00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:31.760 align:start position:0%
Charities was in large part why the
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
legislature allowing charitable game
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
rooms was approved it seems
 
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720 align:start position:0%
contradictory to charge them rent I
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
understand that an amendment to sb12
 
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
containing language that ends this
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
practice and that this was approved by
 
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
this committee and that further action
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
is pending in view of this I'm
 
00:09:53.389 --> 00:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
requesting that
 
00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:56.440 align:start position:0%
hb123 be reviewed and held in the event
 
00:09:58.870 --> 00:09:58.880 align:start position:0%
it is needed representative Michael K

00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
being held in Senate Ways and
 
00:10:12.959 --> 00:10:14.790 align:start position:0%
being held in Senate Ways and

Alysa margolin and I'm here on behalf of

00:11:02.430 --> 00:11:02.440 align:start position:0%

and um work uh to provide um excellent
 
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
programming and to be serve as a voice
 
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
for the charitable sector we would like
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
to express our support for um
 
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:16.760 align:start position:0%
hb123 we also supported um
 
00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:19.959 align:start position:0%
representative duet's uh uh proposal and
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
amendment to s sp12 that um repeals
 
00:11:25.230 --> 00:11:25.240 align:start position:0%
friends charged to charity and
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming and um we also wanted
 
00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:29.800 align:start position:0%
to register our support for
 
00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:32.920 align:start position:0%
representative kahill's proposal as well
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
um just uh taking this opportunity to
 
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:40.480 align:start position:0%
share some key points uh about the why
 
00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
we support rent repeal um just a good
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
reminder every now and then that we have
 
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
gaming in New Hampshire to support the
 
00:11:52.069 --> 00:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
charitable sector um and uh that is why
 
00:11:55.629 --> 00:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
um we are uh allowed to engage in gaming
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
to support on our Charities and these
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
are charities who are providing
 
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
essential services and enriching our
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
communities um in many ways the growth
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
of gaming the revenue going to Charities
 
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
has become um integral to uh Mission
 
00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
delivery and um A disruption in that
 
00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:16.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue stream at this point would be
 
00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
highly disruptive to the charitable
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
sector the charging of rents um uh has
 
00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:25.720 align:start position:0%
been uneven across the state uh in some
 
00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:28.360 align:start position:0%
places a a very small percentage of the
 
00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800 align:start position:0%
overall overall Revenue received from
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming in some places has
 
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
been up to
 
00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:37.240 align:start position:0%
50% um we've heard reports from some of
 
00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:39.560 align:start position:0%
our members and stakeholders that they
 
00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:41.560 align:start position:0%
were not aware that they were going to
 
00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
be charged rent and in some place some
 
00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
uh times receiving an invoice only after
 
00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:48.519 align:start position:0%
the fact I'm very
 
00:12:52.949 --> 00:12:52.959 align:start position:0%
surprised um charitable uh sponsors of
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
gaming operators often feel like they
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
don't have a strong voice in the
 
00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
transaction they're obviously um in a
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
position uh where they're uh very
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
grateful to um access this uh this
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue um and so push back becomes
 
00:13:14.150 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
difficult in those uh situations and so
 
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
it's even more important that the New
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Center for nonprofits can give
 
00:13:19.389 --> 00:13:19.399 align:start position:0%
voice to these
 
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
Charities um and uh for those reasons um
 
00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
we urge your support for this bill and
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for um for holding it uh in a
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
in a way that uh sustains this uh
 
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
important proposal thank you and I'm
 
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions thank you do
 
00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
Le thank you um my question is about
 
00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
your statement at the end that Charities
 
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
kind of hesitate to ask questions they
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
feel like they don't have a strong hand
 
00:13:53.949 --> 00:13:53.959 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
conversation um to your understanding
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
how did the Charities get selected Ed to
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
participate so um our understanding is
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
that once the Charities are licensed
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
they apply to uh they seek out um
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
available days with gaming operators um
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
in some places particularly where there
 
00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
is a lot of Revenue available there are
 
00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
waiting lists and it's um it's not clear
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh how those are prioritized um in uh in
 
00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:26.839 align:start position:0%
other places there are available days
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
particularly the smaller gaming
 
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.430 align:start position:0%
particularly the smaller gaming
operators

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
operators
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
and um the gaming operators and
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
Charities really need each other right
 
00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
cuz you need a a charitable sponsor um
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
but the there um there is a lack of
 
00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
transparency around the selection
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
process and often can take some advocacy
 
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
um to to secure those days once those
 
00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
are secured and up up to 10 days um you
 
00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
know Charities often renew uh you know
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
cultivate that relationship with the
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
gaming operator and and try to renew
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
those every year here may I have a
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
followup followup
 
00:15:07.189 --> 00:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
so the is it would the fear on the
 
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
Charity's part be if I ask too many
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
questions or if I push back or if I get
 
00:15:15.509 --> 00:15:15.519 align:start position:0%
this invoice and am taking a in call and
 
00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
complain or ask a question maybe I will
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
get pushed to the end of the line on
 
00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
waiting or maybe I won't be selected to
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
participate at all that's an excellent
 
00:15:27.389 --> 00:15:27.399 align:start position:0%
observation representative in fact we've
 
00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:30.040 align:start position:0%
heard of cases where where um Charities
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
have been called to um where the um the
 
00:15:36.829 --> 00:15:36.839 align:start position:0%
gaming operator is asking who plans to
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
to uh hold an event at our facility this
 
00:15:42.990 --> 00:15:43.000 align:start position:0%
year just checking as we you know and I
 
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
I honestly think that um there's no
 
00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:47.839 align:start position:0%
malevolence there I think that they're
 
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
trying to engage in good marketing
 
00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:52.120 align:start position:0%
practices and that it's kind of up to us
 
00:15:54.189 --> 00:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
to kind of clarify those relationships
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
and and put some sunlight in the process
 
00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
um but yes I mean uh just like any um
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
kind of corporate donor relationship you
 
00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:06.279 align:start position:0%
know you're really looking to um to to
 
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
ensure uh you know uh a a solid um uh
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
partnership there um yet sometimes we
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
forget that it's the Charities that
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
legally are carrying that license so
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
that we can engage in gaming operations
 
00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:22.000 align:start position:0%
and then you know in many ways that are
 
00:16:24.269 --> 00:16:24.279 align:start position:0%
the gaming operators who have done the
 
00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:26.560 align:start position:0%
investing and the capital development so
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
that more Revenue can be to uh can flow
 
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
to charity so there's an appreciation
 
00:16:34.829 --> 00:16:34.839 align:start position:0%

how many
 
00:17:26.669 --> 00:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
uh on legislators are on the boards
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
of of ch ities that get perhaps
 
00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:37.720 align:start position:0%
preferentially um um slotted into to a
 
00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:39.400 align:start position:0%
week to 10
 
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
days I have I have no idea I can't
 
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
answer that question thank you
 
00:17:46.510 --> 00:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
representative thank you representative
 
00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:48.720 align:start position:0%
Southworth uh thank you for taking my
 
00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:50.440 align:start position:0%
question it may be for the group as a
 
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:52.360 align:start position:0%
whole too um has anyone tried to
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
estimate how much money is lost to the
 
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
Charities uh under the current rent
 
00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
practices I think that's a great
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
question I don't know the answer perhaps
 
00:18:01.029 --> 00:18:01.039 align:start position:0%
someone from the New Hampshire lottery
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
does I know that we have Representatives
 
00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
here today thank you thank you yes
 
00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.070 align:start position:0%
here today thank you thank you yes
representative

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm when I look at this bill it makes
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
me wonder how many of the uh casinos
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
that are
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
currently um operating on behalf of the
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
Charities are going to just stop because
 
00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get the revenue
 
00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:32.600 align:start position:0%
from the rent this says that um they
 
00:18:34.789 --> 00:18:34.799 align:start position:0%
they can't charge for use of their
 
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:37.120 align:start position:0%
equipment so I'm
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
wondering how how how is this going to
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
impact it overall do you think yeah
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and as I just
 
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know obviously there's a
 
00:18:46.669 --> 00:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
reciprocal relationship here those
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
gaming operators have invested in the
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
machinery and the locations and all the
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
marketing um my understanding and it
 
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
would probably be better to ask them but
 
00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that the gaming
 
00:18:59.270 --> 00:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
operators Association supports rent
 
00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:03.200 align:start position:0%
repeal and that was uh shared uh during
 
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
um representative uh duet's amendment to
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
sp12 yes that's it's a good thing to
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
point out we so when we went over
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
representative duett's Amendment on sp12
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
the retain bill
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
sp12 um we passed that out of committee
 
00:19:22.190 --> 00:19:22.200 align:start position:0%
and it is now in the we passed it on the
 
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
house floor as well it's in the Senate
 
00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
so this this and we're going to hear a
 
00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
couple of other bills they are
 
00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
components of what is in the retain Bill
 
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
you and we'd like to find the
 
00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
whereabouts of that pink card I um
 
00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
anywhere um yeah so I hate to have you
 
00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
fill out another one but uh if we can't
 
00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.870 align:start position:0%
fill out another one but uh if we can't
find

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:57.080 align:start position:0%
it uh is there anyone else I don't have
 
00:20:09.149 --> 00:20:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes good morning my name is Valerie King
 
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire lottery I just had
 
00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:17.000 align:start position:0%
two things I do have one copy of
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
document that uh separates how much rent
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
is compared to their overall I can
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
provide this if you'd like it ranges I
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
only have it by room not a total average
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
but it ranged from about 5% to some of
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
the bigger rooms to as much as 50% to
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
some of the smaller rooms so I can
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
provide that um the other thing I just
 
00:20:39.029 --> 00:20:39.039 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out is in
 
00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:43.760 align:start position:0%
um in reenacting section 19 the writer
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
inadvertently remove the requirement
 
00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:49.360 align:start position:0%
that 35% go to charity so they'll want
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
to put that back in otherwise it doesn't
 
00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:58.830 --> 00:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
statute which bill
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
so this is this is for um it's RSA 287
 
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
d19 Roman number number two parenthesis
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
a is where the current language is where
 
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
it refers to the 35% going to charity
 
00:21:17.789 --> 00:21:17.799 align:start position:0%
they'll want I I it also refers to the
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
rent and I think they took the whole
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
thing out rather than just the rental
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
piece what what Bill did that oh this is
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%

today I'm here as sponsor in a bill that
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
would allow local uh lottery winners to
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
remain anonymous this issue was brought
 
01:08:24.829 --> 01:08:24.839 align:start position:0%
to my attention by a constitu
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
currently 18 states allow lottery
 
01:08:28.789 --> 01:08:28.799 align:start position:0%
winners to remain anonymous some have
 
01:08:30.430 --> 01:08:30.440 align:start position:0%
restrictions and some have no limits at
 
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
all for example in Delaware any prize
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
amount is Anonymous in Virginia it has
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
to be over 10
 
01:08:39.110 --> 01:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
million uh there are several positive
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
outcomes uh to remaining Anonymous um it
 
01:08:43.550 --> 01:08:43.560 align:start position:0%
can protect the winners from being
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
targeted by criminals and unscrupulous
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
people asking for money it can prevent
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
fraud and Corruption by ensuring
 
01:08:51.669 --> 01:08:51.679 align:start position:0%
integrity and transparency in the
 
01:08:53.950 --> 01:08:53.960 align:start position:0%
lottery system it can protect winners
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
privacy and personal safety as well as
 
01:08:59.110 --> 01:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
their mental and emotional well-being it
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
limits the powers of others by
 
01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
controlling what they know and how they
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
use their personal data it protects
 
01:09:06.349 --> 01:09:06.359 align:start position:0%
winners reputations and social
 
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
boundaries think about it if you won the
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
lottery would you want to have an
 
01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to remain
 
01:09:14.189 --> 01:09:14.199 align:start position:0%
anonymous if you choose to tell people
 
01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:15.199 align:start position:0%
that's your
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
choice um there's several tragic stories
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
where lottery winners have lost their
 
01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
lives or face danger um after people
 
01:09:25.269 --> 01:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
find out out that they won the
 
01:09:27.990 --> 01:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
lottery one example in 2009 a man who
 
01:09:30.789 --> 01:09:30.799 align:start position:0%
won $30 million was shot and killed by a
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
woman who befriended him and tried to
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
take his money in 2016 a man won 400,000
 
01:09:38.829 --> 01:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
in the Georgia Lottery and was shot and
 
01:09:40.829 --> 01:09:40.839 align:start position:0%
killed in a home invasion when the
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
robbers demanded his
 
01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:46.359 align:start position:0%
winnings these are just some examples um
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
privacy is essentially who we are as
 
01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.630 align:start position:0%
privacy is essentially who we are as
human

01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
human
 
01:09:53.349 --> 01:09:53.359 align:start position:0%
beings we make decisions about every day
 
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
private is also a key element of
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
ensuring human dignity safety and
 
01:10:00.149 --> 01:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
self-determination the Fifth Amendment
 
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.320 align:start position:0%
of the United States Constitution
 
01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:04.040 align:start position:0%
protects rights of individuals to avoid
 
01:10:05.790 --> 01:10:05.800 align:start position:0%
self-incrimination which means that they
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
do not have to reveal information that
 
01:10:10.229 --> 01:10:10.239 align:start position:0%
could be used against them in a criminal
 
01:10:13.270 --> 01:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
case revealing Lottery wom's identity
 
01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:15.640 align:start position:0%
could expose them to harassment threats
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
lawsuits this could amount to a form of
 
01:10:20.669 --> 01:10:20.679 align:start position:0%
self-incrimination James Madison
 
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:22.440 align:start position:0%
supported privacy and the Bill of Rights
 
01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
he believed that the constitution
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
separation of
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
powers already protected personal
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
freedoms but he wanted to add an extra
 
01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
layer of security by adding the biller
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
rights Madison is the father of
 
01:10:34.189 --> 01:10:34.199 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the main author of the
 
01:10:36.350 --> 01:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights supported privacy and the
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights of people to remain
 
01:10:40.550 --> 01:10:40.560 align:start position:0%

01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:42.080 align:start position:0%

01:10:43.270 --> 01:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
them represent PL yes thank you uh M
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative done I saw you reading
 
01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
from a script may I have that
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
sure and I put an asteris next to your
 
01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
name testimony provided
 
01:11:02.149 --> 01:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
sure representative elme thank you um I
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
think I heard you mention that this
 
01:11:06.590 --> 01:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
would improve the Integrity of the
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
lottery how would it do that since it
 
01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
would um make it possible for someone
 
01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:15.560 align:start position:0%
that was the friend of the head of the
 
01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
lottery for instance to win five times
 
01:11:20.590 --> 01:11:20.600 align:start position:0%
in a
 
01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
row thank you for the question I think
 
01:11:26.350 --> 01:11:26.360 align:start position:0%
that it would allow people people
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
remaining Anonymous would allow them not
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
to I guess
 
01:11:36.030 --> 01:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
be exposed to corruption or people that
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh try to do bad things to them so I
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
think that would improve the Integrity
 
01:11:41.470 --> 01:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
of it but I guess it depends on how you
 
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
it

01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
yes represent elbow thank you Mr
 
01:11:51.709 --> 01:11:51.719 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
question I'd like to ask you to play
 
01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
devil's advocate for a moment why should
 
01:12:00.110 --> 01:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
we not allow privacy here what are the
 
01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
privacy I would say that's what we allow
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
now so it allows I would say to Devil's
 
01:12:13.709 --> 01:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
Advocate the M own bill is it
 
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
transparency you're recording who has
 
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:18.040 align:start position:0%
won the
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:24.669 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:12:24.669 --> 01:12:24.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
I mean it does seem from representative
 
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
aly's uh question
 
01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
that you don't you don't have
 
01:12:34.870 --> 01:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
transparency on on the lottery side of
 
01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
things now because if we don't know who
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
won is there a concern that we don't
 
01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:40.870 align:start position:0%
won is there a concern that we don't
know

01:12:40.870 --> 01:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
how transparent how correct the whole
 
01:12:46.470 --> 01:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
process is working because there there'd
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
be no no one would ever know did anyone
 
01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
oh somebody won and we have no idea I
 
01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
mean how would you address that concern
 
01:12:56.310 --> 01:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh right now
 
01:12:59.629 --> 01:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
it's working in 16 other states
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
and I guess it's just a different
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
opinion I just feel like it allows um
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
privacy of the of the individual um so
 
01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
they choose they get to choose whether
 
01:13:10.629 --> 01:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
or not they disclose what or not they
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:16.040 align:start position:0%
not representative ORS thank you Mr
 
01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question
 
01:13:20.629 --> 01:13:20.639 align:start position:0%
representative so I know we had a case
 
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire a couple years ago
 
01:13:27.390 --> 01:13:27.400 align:start position:0%
I believe and judge Charlie Temple was
 
01:13:31.070 --> 01:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
the judge on that case and the
 
01:13:33.189 --> 01:13:33.199 align:start position:0%
couple I don't know if it was a couple
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
the person that won wanted this privacy
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
issue so is there a way to maybe have
 
01:13:41.790 --> 01:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
the courts or somebody certify that
 
01:13:44.830 --> 01:13:44.840 align:start position:0%
there is a winner to answer the question
 
01:13:49.709 --> 01:13:49.719 align:start position:0%
that's coming from rep Aly or PL that at
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
least we know there is a winner it's
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
been certified by somebody in the court
 
01:13:55.709 --> 01:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
you you know the documents are sealed so
 
01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
maybe that would be a good amendment to
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
this thank you for the question I would
 
01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:02.600 align:start position:0%
have no objection to that sir okay thank
 
01:14:05.709 --> 01:14:05.719 align:start position:0%
you uh representative fellows thank you
 
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um when I read this it it's a
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
little bit confusing to me and I think
 
01:14:14.229 --> 01:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
it's because of what happens when you
 
01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
try to not mess with the existing
 
01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
language too much and stick something in
 
01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
there but it it almost reads to me as if
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
if suppose a person signs a form they
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
don't want their name released totally
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
understand that but it the way I read it
 
01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
it seems like they can't the lottery
 
01:14:36.629 --> 01:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
can't release the date of the prize and
 
01:14:40.110 --> 01:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:42.350 --> 01:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
was thank you for the question any
 
01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
wording that you object to I would have
 
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
no problem amending it's just what the
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
what the lawyers told me we had to have
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
in it so yeah
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
maybe if you could if you could just
 
01:14:57.110 --> 01:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
follow up with them on that and see if
 
01:14:59.790 --> 01:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
you know if they understand what I was
 
01:15:00.950 --> 01:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
you understand what I was saying
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
absolutely and just make that clear I
 
01:15:04.709 --> 01:15:04.719 align:start position:0%
think may I think maybe it could be re
 
01:15:05.990 --> 01:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
it could be written better I'd
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely do that thanks thank you
 
01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
representative El me thank you on do you
 
01:15:15.229 --> 01:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
know how long the states that are doing
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
this have been doing it and is anybody
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
studied uh the effect of it other than
 
01:15:26.310 --> 01:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
cre creating privacy for the individual
 
01:15:28.629 --> 01:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I know the
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
states but I don't know how long but I'd
 
01:15:31.990 --> 01:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
certainly willing to find that out for
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
you and get that information back to the
 
01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
committee representative PL yes
 
01:15:41.830 --> 01:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
representative done uh are there audits
 
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
taking place of the lottery and uh would
 
01:15:47.629 --> 01:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
would an audit uh provide uh I guess
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
some light of day if if if was some
 
01:15:51.830 --> 01:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
inside game we were operating with
 
01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
Lottery employ won several times
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that come to light a day yes it
 
01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
would thank you for the question yes it
 
01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:02.189 align:start position:0%
would thank you for the question yes it
would

01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.790 --> 01:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
sir yes representative roachford thank
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um just looking at the
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
bill and
 
01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
um the way I have read it thus far I
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
mean there is the ability for confidenti
 
01:16:17.629 --> 01:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
confid confidentiality as is says you
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
know the payment of prize as provided in
 
01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
the section shall be
 
01:16:24.430 --> 01:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
confidential and they won't be subject
 
01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
to RSA
 
01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:28.760 align:start position:0%
91a and they shouldn't be they they
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
won't be released until upon written
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
request so way I read that it looks like
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
it's you're just adding a different form
 
01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
that has to be filled out in order
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
to to authorize the Lottery Commission
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
but the way I understand it now the
 
01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission can only release that
 
01:16:50.430 --> 01:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
and they're here today maybe they'll be
 
01:16:53.310 --> 01:16:53.320 align:start position:0%
testifying unless the winner does
 
01:16:56.669 --> 01:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
authorize them to do so is that I guess
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you know what what
 
01:17:02.070 --> 01:17:02.080 align:start position:0%
further steps you're um you know lines 8
 
01:17:05.149 --> 01:17:05.159 align:start position:0%
through 12 do to to provide for that
 
01:17:07.270 --> 01:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I will defer
 
01:17:08.430 --> 01:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
to someone that has more knowledge than
 
01:17:11.629 --> 01:17:11.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
do yes represent Mr chairman will the
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
director of the lottery be yes
 
01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:20.760 align:start position:0%
presenting thank you I'll wait till his
 
01:17:23.590 --> 01:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
okay sounds good saying no other
 
01:17:29.629 --> 01:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
you and uh next I do have the director
 
01:17:41.790 --> 01:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
McIntyre uh good morning Mr chairman
 
01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm Charlie
 
01:17:47.790 --> 01:17:47.800 align:start position:0%
McIntyre director Lottery uh good
 
01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
morning um I find myself in the position
 
01:17:53.709 --> 01:17:53.719 align:start position:0%
of opposing this bill certainly um it'll
 
01:17:56.629 --> 01:17:56.639 align:start position:0%
make our job more difficult and
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
obviously less transparent and what I
 
01:18:00.629 --> 01:18:00.639 align:start position:0%
mean by that is more difficult for
 
01:18:03.030 --> 01:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
example there are a number of games we
 
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
run which we do promotions or drawings
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
publicly uh we've done a number at the
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
NASCAR track where a bunch of folks are
 
01:18:16.629 --> 01:18:16.639 align:start position:0%
pulled from a larger pool on stage and
 
01:18:18.950 --> 01:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
somebody wins a million dollars on stage
 
01:18:22.270 --> 01:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
super fun event super popular super not
 
01:18:24.990 --> 01:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
possible with this law um because then
 
01:18:26.350 --> 01:18:26.360 align:start position:0%
I'd have to I don't have to disclose
 
01:18:29.229 --> 01:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
them put have a blank screen over them I
 
01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know how to do that um so we'd
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
stop doing those um moreover this bill
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
would suggest that I'm able to hand out
 
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars annually
 
01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:40.870 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of dollars annually
in

01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:18:43.709 --> 01:18:43.719 align:start position:0%
secret um and obviously as you folks may
 
01:18:45.229 --> 01:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
or may not know there was a process by
 
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
which a number of ways folks can go
 
01:18:52.229 --> 01:18:52.239 align:start position:0%
through and claim the prize via trust
 
01:18:55.510 --> 01:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
and that is is not subject to disclosure
 
01:18:58.189 --> 01:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
in terms of the trust done correctly and
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
we assist people on that way and to
 
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
representative AR point about the um
 
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
lawsuit we had uh we had suggested to
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
the winner that they file suit only
 
01:19:10.310 --> 01:19:10.320 align:start position:0%
because we had received word from the
 
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:11.840 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office that because
 
01:19:13.070 --> 01:19:13.080 align:start position:0%
they had signed the back of the ticket
 
01:19:15.270 --> 01:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
in person that that was their remedy we
 
01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
didn't wasn't a adversarial litigation
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
it was just you should go to court and
 
01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
get an order if you get an order we
 
01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
happily comply with it
 
01:19:24.950 --> 01:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
due diligence was done to make sure the
 
01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
person was eligible to win because there
 
01:19:29.149 --> 01:19:29.159 align:start position:0%
are a number of individuals who are
 
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:31.480 align:start position:0%
ineligible to win as you can imagine the
 
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
folks who work with me at the lottery
 
01:19:35.830 --> 01:19:35.840 align:start position:0%
are ineligible to play the lottery who
 
01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
would believe I won Powerball fairly
 
01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
right you know let's be honest here um
 
01:19:43.149 --> 01:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
and more importantly my mom who you know
 
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:45.360 align:start position:0%
has passed but used to play the lottery
 
01:19:48.110 --> 01:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
uh who would believe she won fairly um
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
and so for all those reasons I I would
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
suggest we were not in favor of this
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
bill at this time time um for those

statements I have to admit I don't know
 
01:20:32.669 --> 01:20:32.679 align:start position:0%

01:20:36.709 --> 01:20:36.719 align:start position:0%
don't know this refers to okay thank you
 
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
Mr followup question Mr chairman follow

up will you send us a to the chairman
 
01:20:46.030 --> 01:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
the answer to that yeah of course what
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
course representative roachford yes
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
so going back to my question I had with
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
the um Prime sponsor the the way I
 
01:21:01.070 --> 01:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
understand it there is the option and I
 
01:21:02.550 --> 01:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
may understand it incorrectly that would
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
not be the first time um the way I
 
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
understand there it appears that there
 
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
is an option for confidentiality as as
 
01:21:13.229 --> 01:21:13.239 align:start position:0%
is correct now is that with the trust or
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
is that even over aside from the trust
 
01:21:19.470 --> 01:21:19.480 align:start position:0%
well certainly the there's the technical
 
01:21:20.629 --> 01:21:20.639 align:start position:0%
and then there's the real reason if
 
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
somebody walked in here and said listen
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
I'm a victim of domestic violence please
 
01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
don't release my information we wouldn't
 
01:21:27.830 --> 01:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
do that just as a matter of courtesy and
 
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
second we talk to folks when they come
 
01:21:30.950 --> 01:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
and claim and say you you have the
 
01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
rights to not if you don't if it's a
 
01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
problem please tell us and they that's
 
01:21:38.350 --> 01:21:38.360 align:start position:0%
respected okay so during and we claims
 
01:21:41.110 --> 01:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine we cut thousands of
 
01:21:42.669 --> 01:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
checks a year so this is a conversation
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
held repeatedly so follow follow so if I
 
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
happen to stop at Cumberland Farms on my
 
01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
way home tonight buy a lottery ticket
 
01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
yes win the $100 Million jackpot I could
 
01:22:01.830 --> 01:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.110 --> 01:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
you question oh represent ORS thank you
 
01:22:08.070 --> 01:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
Mr chair thanks for taking my question
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
so if I understand correctly if they
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
choose to remain anonymous don't sign
 
01:22:14.990 --> 01:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
the back of the ticket whatever it's
 
01:22:17.189 --> 01:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
Anonymous correct okay if you sign the
 
01:22:19.550 --> 01:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
back of the ticket well there are prizes
 
01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
for which Anonymous so everything over
 
01:22:25.550 --> 01:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
$600 we have
 
01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:28.719 align:start position:0%
to announce to the IRS that you've won
 
01:22:31.709 --> 01:22:31.719 align:start position:0%
over $600 okay it's there's technical
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
reason but six no over $5,000 we have to
 
01:22:37.629 --> 01:22:37.639 align:start position:0%
withhold 24% of the prize winnings pay
 
01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
on behalf of you tell the IRS you and
 
01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
then send you a w2g so it's not
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
Anonymous the IRS knows you've won yeah
 
01:22:47.669 --> 01:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
um but yeah okay very good thank you I
 
01:22:49.350 --> 01:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
mean as you can imagine we don't want to
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
cause a problem obviously but we also
 
01:22:53.110 --> 01:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
want to promote the fact that folks
 
01:22:55.950 --> 01:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
actually win that it's not
 
01:22:58.350 --> 01:22:58.360 align:start position:0%
secret so we're trying to it's as you
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
can imagine it's a tough Balancing Act
 
01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
we understand that there are issues
 
01:23:03.870 --> 01:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
related to it but you know knock on wood
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
because I'm superstitious uh we haven't
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
had any issues like that in in this
 
01:23:09.950 --> 01:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
state that I'm aware of we've had three
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
winners in the last six years over
 
01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:12.950 align:start position:0%
winners in the last six years over
hundred

01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
hundred
 
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
million and um and over a billion
 
01:23:18.590 --> 01:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
dollars and winnings candidly uh and
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
certainly no major issues like that I
 
01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
will tell you
 
01:23:26.430 --> 01:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
99 out of 100 times the person gives
 
01:23:29.229 --> 01:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
themselves up before we ever do because
 
01:23:32.350 --> 01:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
when you buy a Ferrari it or you lease a
 
01:23:35.229 --> 01:23:35.239 align:start position:0%
gulf stream it it tends to show so
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
that's usually the issue not us it's
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
they bought a really nice car or you
 
01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:42.159 align:start position:0%
know they bought a house Etc so so what
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
is the process for staying Anonymous I
 
01:23:46.310 --> 01:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
mean do you fill out a form or usually
 
01:23:48.030 --> 01:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
that's done over claims when the claims
 
01:23:49.270 --> 01:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
process when you come in and talk to the
 
01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
people um and obviously for the larger
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
ones we end
 
01:23:56.270 --> 01:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
up um Mr Shaheen has built a wonderful
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
business for himself and his Law Firm
 
01:23:59.350 --> 01:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
they represented a number of large
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
winners they come in and file a trust
 
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:04.120 align:start position:0%
there's a specific way to do it uh that
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
Shields you from acknowledgement so um
 
01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
but we there's a conversation held
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
during the process and folks we we do
 
01:24:13.350 --> 01:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
alert folks that you may your name may
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
be known is that okay um over a counter
 
01:24:18.510 --> 01:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
when they claim okay thank you yes
 
01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:20.760 align:start position:0%

01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair would you believe that Dave
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
roachford and I are gonna become great
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:34.679 align:start position:0%
represent shamber thank you Mr chairman
 
01:24:36.669 --> 01:24:36.679 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
that they can remain anonymous what
 
01:24:42.229 --> 01:24:42.239 align:start position:0%
happens if within your the directory
 
01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
they are the ones that release the name
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
someone within your organization is
 
01:24:50.030 --> 01:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
there a a disciplinary
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
procedure I if somebody has made made
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
reference to not wanting to be published
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
Anonymous I don't it's never happened so
 
01:25:00.669 --> 01:25:00.679 align:start position:0%
I there was no process in place
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
currently I'm aware
 
01:25:05.229 --> 01:25:05.239 align:start position:0%
of represent fellows can you tell me
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
what other states do to um prevent names
 
01:25:13.990 --> 01:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
being released the process that they use
 
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh it varies by state I'd have to get
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
you list I haven't checked on it
 
01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:21.440 align:start position:0%
recently uh this is an issue with across
 
01:25:24.030 --> 01:25:24.040 align:start position:0%
the country this up every so often um
 
01:25:25.709 --> 01:25:25.719 align:start position:0%
the most famous case is there's a case
 
01:25:27.910 --> 01:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
out of Australia where a boy was held
 
01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
Ransom um it's called Grahams law it's
 
01:25:35.390 --> 01:25:35.400 align:start position:0%
in Australia um I tend to favor on the
 
01:25:39.149 --> 01:25:39.159 align:start position:0%
side of transparency um but I I can get
 
01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:40.760 align:start position:0%
you a list of whatever each state does
 
01:25:42.430 --> 01:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
it certainly
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
try follow up I I'm just
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
asking um other states have a process
 
01:25:53.229 --> 01:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
for a person to remain a non onymous
 
01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
some I'm looking for something that
 
01:25:58.990 --> 01:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
might be easier than telling them they
 
01:26:02.310 --> 01:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
have to set up a trust okay I I can get
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
you that
 
01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
yes I mean certainly the easiest process
 
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
would be so if I could suggest um have a
 
01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
box on the claim form saying I don't
 
01:26:14.189 --> 01:26:14.199 align:start position:0%
want to be anonymous I don't want to be
 
01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
that would be an easier process less
 
01:26:19.910 --> 01:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
intrusive than a sheet 14o letters and
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
never having a public event like that
 
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
would be less but I can certainly list
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.109 --> 01:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
like any other
 
01:26:37.270 --> 01:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:40.030 --> 01:26:40.040 align:start position:0%
you that's all I have for pin cards is
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%

testify oh
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%

okay I may have found it once you
introduce

01:27:00.390 --> 01:27:00.400 align:start position:0%

01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
sometimes we hear noises outside we look
 
01:27:26.590 --> 01:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
outside the window um maybe something's
 
01:27:29.750 --> 01:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
out there maybe something's not um we
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
get you know sometimes if we get really
 
01:27:33.229 --> 01:27:33.239 align:start position:0%
concerned that there's people around our
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
house we rely on friends and family um
 
01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
but sometimes you can be put in a
 
01:27:42.709 --> 01:27:42.719 align:start position:0%
situation where you're not sure really
 
01:27:44.790 --> 01:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
who to trust what to do and you can be
 
01:27:47.189 --> 01:27:47.199 align:start position:0%
in a panic situation when they say the
 
01:27:48.669 --> 01:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
winning the lottery should change your
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
life it shouldn't in that fashion people
 
01:27:53.189 --> 01:27:53.199 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be scared scared after they
 
01:27:56.070 --> 01:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
get something good people shouldn't have
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
to look over their shoulder or wonder
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
when their mom is calling or a cousin or
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
something is there an ulterior motive um
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
when you look up on the New York Post um
 
01:28:09.149 --> 01:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations for winning lottery one
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
of the recommendations is change your
 
01:28:13.950 --> 01:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
address change your phone number get a
 
01:28:16.709 --> 01:28:16.719 align:start position:0%
PO Box these are recommendations that
 
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
people have to do um this bill the the
 
01:28:23.109 --> 01:28:23.119 align:start position:0%
intention of it is only so you can win
 
01:28:26.070 --> 01:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
the lottery there's no public disclosure
 
01:28:28.510 --> 01:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
of who you are behind the scenes people
 
01:28:30.709 --> 01:28:30.719 align:start position:0%
can still take a look and do all the
 
01:28:32.550 --> 01:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to keep the lottery as secure
 
01:28:34.310 --> 01:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
as it is today and the lottery is very
 
01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:35.629 align:start position:0%
as it is today and the lottery is very
secure

01:28:35.629 --> 01:28:35.639 align:start position:0%
secure
 
01:28:38.950 --> 01:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
today um just not having your name out
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
there not having to fear for those
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
things I think would make a a vast
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
difference in people's lives yes we
 
01:28:46.790 --> 01:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
haven't had an incident in this state um
 
01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
I get the lottery is a statistical
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
anomaly in itself um but we've had three
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
win here what happens if we have the
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
fourth and we get a case like Australia
 
01:28:57.790 --> 01:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
do we want to look like the state that
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
we could have did something here and we
 
01:29:03.229 --> 01:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
didn't do anything to prevent that um
 
01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:04.719 align:start position:0%
one of my favorite things from the New
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution so article 2B in
 
01:29:10.229 --> 01:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
our Bill of Rights right to privacy an
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
individual's right to live free from
 
01:29:14.350 --> 01:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
government intrusion in public or
 
01:29:16.390 --> 01:29:16.400 align:start position:0%
personal information is natural
 
01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent that is one of my
 
01:29:20.830 --> 01:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
favorite Clauses in this Bill of Rights
 
01:29:22.870 --> 01:29:22.880 align:start position:0%
added in 2018
 
01:29:25.109 --> 01:29:25.119 align:start position:0%
and that I think is what separates us
 
01:29:27.629 --> 01:29:27.639 align:start position:0%
from many other states there's 18 states
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
that are ahead of us on this issue and
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
they've found a way to do this and still
 
01:29:36.350 --> 01:29:36.360 align:start position:0%
maintain the Integrity of their Lottery
 
01:29:38.070 --> 01:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
um when you have things like public
 
01:29:39.790 --> 01:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
displays where someone's coming up and
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
you have something you know at say the
 
01:29:44.229 --> 01:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
Nascar event and someone comes up on
 
01:29:46.590 --> 01:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
stage I think that could be a different
 
01:29:48.390 --> 01:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
exception to this that's not the same
 
01:29:49.990 --> 01:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
thing as buying a lottery ticket and
 
01:29:51.910 --> 01:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
having something where there's no public
 
01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:54.320 align:start position:0%
public display um some states have
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
gotten around that by having a certain
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
dollar value they put conditions on how
 
01:30:02.350 --> 01:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
you collect anonymously so maybe that
 
01:30:04.310 --> 01:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
could be an amendment to this but I
 
01:30:06.669 --> 01:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
think just to protect our citizens to
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
protect our constitutional right for
 
01:30:10.470 --> 01:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
privacy in the state this is a very
 
01:30:12.189 --> 01:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
important thing to get worked out and
 
01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
not leave as is I don't think an
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
individual to exercise their rights of
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
privacy should have to get a trust I
 
01:30:21.310 --> 01:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
don't think they should have to um go to
 
01:30:23.910 --> 01:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
a lawyer who could financially benefit
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
from setting up these trusts um it could
 
01:30:29.310 --> 01:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
be said that getting recommended to a
 
01:30:31.270 --> 01:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
certain law office every time could be a
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
sign of something where there's a little
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
bit of funny business underneath the
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
hood so I ask you to support this bill
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
um maybe it could use some amendments
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
but we have a constitutional right to
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
privacy and I'd like to keep it that way
 
01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you um I guess my
 
01:30:49.270 --> 01:30:49.280 align:start position:0%
immediate question and you may not have
 
01:30:51.030 --> 01:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
been able to think about this earlier
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
because we just heard testimony from
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
director McIntyre but he is saying that
 
01:30:57.870 --> 01:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
you can win the lottery and remain
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
anonymous so does that change your
 
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
opinion of the necessity um if you are
 
01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
able to Lin the lottery without going
 
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
through a trust because I'm well aware
 
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
of that um you can go through and set up
 
01:31:12.109 --> 01:31:12.119 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of legal hassle to have to
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
go through and yes you could argue well
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
the person can afford it they just won
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
the lottery but I don't think we should
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
have extra conditions on exercising
 
01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:22.750 align:start position:0%
have extra conditions on exercising
rights

01:31:22.750 --> 01:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
rights
 
01:31:24.030 --> 01:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
well I guess my question is why would
 
01:31:26.149 --> 01:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
you have to set up a trust there's no
 
01:31:28.189 --> 01:31:28.199 align:start position:0%
requirement oh that was my understanding
 
01:31:30.229 --> 01:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
of what he said maybe he I could be
 
01:31:31.709 --> 01:31:31.719 align:start position:0%
wrong on that but my understanding was
 
01:31:34.149 --> 01:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
the path to privacy includes setting up
 
01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
a trust that's that's the way to set it
 
01:31:37.830 --> 01:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
up where you are Anonymous the trust
 
01:31:40.030 --> 01:31:40.040 align:start position:0%
wins the lottery not you that just my
 
01:31:41.189 --> 01:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
understanding all right well we'll we'll
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
check on that thank you okay uh anyone
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
else have
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
all thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:31:53.229 --> 01:31:53.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:31:56.470 --> 01:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
the issue that seems
 
01:32:00.550 --> 01:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
to arise is whether or not the winner of
 
01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:02.189 align:start position:0%
to arise is whether or not the winner of
the

01:32:02.189 --> 01:32:02.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:32:04.990 --> 01:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
lottery in order to maintain
 
01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
transparency of the action of the
 
01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
lottery should be identified as a person
 
01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.030 align:start position:0%
lottery should be identified as a person
or

01:32:12.030 --> 01:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
entity so that people know somebody one
 
01:32:19.149 --> 01:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
who and it wasn't just paid out to
 
01:32:22.109 --> 01:32:22.119 align:start position:0%
somebody else M what what is your
 
01:32:25.270 --> 01:32:25.280 align:start position:0%
opinion on that position and individual
 
01:32:30.149 --> 01:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
privacy because our right to privacy is
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
limited I think that all the mechanisms
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes that are currently
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
ensuring Integrity could keep ensuring
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
that Integrity so I'm not I'm not
 
01:32:40.910 --> 01:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
worried about because I I've talked to
 
01:32:42.750 --> 01:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
some people about this too and I think
 
01:32:45.149 --> 01:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
the biggest concern is that well what if
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know my brother wins every single
 
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
year um there should be mechanisms
 
01:32:51.709 --> 01:32:51.719 align:start position:0%
already to prevent that not just the
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
announcement if that's the sole thing
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:02.669 --> 01:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
problems representative roer thank you
 
01:33:04.229 --> 01:33:04.239 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for coming in
 
01:33:08.109 --> 01:33:08.119 align:start position:0%
today um and I and I certainly can can
 
01:33:09.430 --> 01:33:09.440 align:start position:0%
well I can't understand it I've never
 
01:33:12.149 --> 01:33:12.159 align:start position:0%
won the lottery uh but if I ever were to
 
01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
won win the lottery I I agree with you I
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
would I wouldn't want the whole world to
 
01:33:18.189 --> 01:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
know and and you know all of a sudden
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
everyone's your family member and coming
 
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
out of the woodwork um but I look at the
 
01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
law as it is currently and I'm just
 
01:33:28.109 --> 01:33:28.119 align:start position:0%
wondering if this is if the law now is
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
not sufficient I don't know what this
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
bill is going to do so the way the law
 
01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
reads right now payment of a prize as
 
01:33:37.189 --> 01:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
provided in this section shall be
 
01:33:39.109 --> 01:33:39.119 align:start position:0%
confidential and then it goes on to say
 
01:33:42.310 --> 01:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
unless a release is signed so that's the
 
01:33:45.350 --> 01:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
way it is now so what if we were to to
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
pass what we have here today before us
 
01:33:51.189 --> 01:33:51.199 align:start position:0%
what how much more will that do I mean
 
01:33:54.390 --> 01:33:54.400 align:start position:0%
it it it to me I mean I it sounds like
 
01:33:56.350 --> 01:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
we we can have confidentiality without
 
01:33:58.350 --> 01:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
doing a trust uh without setting up a
 
01:34:01.109 --> 01:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
trust or whatnot um I just wonder what
 
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
your your thoughts are on that yeah I
 
01:34:05.430 --> 01:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
think that's some sorry this is in the
 
01:34:07.149 --> 01:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
way but I think that's something that
 
01:34:09.149 --> 01:34:09.159 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked into as we look at
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
this bill um because if you look at the
 
01:34:13.669 --> 01:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
states that you can win the lottery
 
01:34:15.109 --> 01:34:15.119 align:start position:0%
privately we're we're definitely not
 
01:34:17.790 --> 01:34:17.800 align:start position:0%
listed there's not anywhere that lists
 
01:34:21.070 --> 01:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
Us in any shape or form so I imagine the
 
01:34:28.350 --> 01:34:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.070 --> 01:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
you to um I don't have any other pink
 
01:34:39.070 --> 01:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
cards now this point is anyone else like
 
01:34:43.310 --> 01:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:45.629 --> 01:34:45.639 align:start position:0%
1389 all right seeing that I guess I'd
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
like to call director McIntyre back up
 
01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
to answer the question about the trust
 
01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:01.030 --> 01:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
not certainly I know we've talked to
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
staff who do claims there's a number of
 
01:35:04.990 --> 01:35:05.000 align:start position:0%
people who claims but it's been a number
 
01:35:06.189 --> 01:35:06.199 align:start position:0%
of folks who've gone through that
 
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
process I will confirm with them that
 
01:35:09.550 --> 01:35:09.560 align:start position:0%
they check with people that they're okay
 
01:35:10.910 --> 01:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
with their name being
 
01:35:12.990 --> 01:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
disclosed but I do know trust is
 
01:35:15.109 --> 01:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
obviously the way guaranteed I'll
 
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
confirm for the members of the committee
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
that indeed it's still being done um as
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
I had suggested so I'll answer with the
 
01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
questions as well that I've been asked
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
the number I've been asked as well for
 
01:35:29.149 --> 01:35:29.159 align:start position:0%
the committee to confirm that okay
 
01:35:29.159 --> 01:35:30.149 align:start position:0%
the committee to confirm that okay
represent

01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
elme thank you uh what Extra Protection
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
does a trust
 
01:35:38.109 --> 01:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
provide um obviously there are tax
 
01:35:38.119 --> 01:35:40.550 align:start position:0%
provide um obviously there are tax
benefits

01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
01:35:43.109 --> 01:35:43.119 align:start position:0%
um it does shield the sort of the
 
01:35:45.149 --> 01:35:45.159 align:start position:0%
knowledge of it um we've had a number of
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
trust candidly the vast majority of
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
prizes we we don't publicize because we
 
01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:52.040 align:start position:0%
don't it's not worthy of a$1 th000
 
01:35:55.270 --> 01:35:55.280 align:start position:0%
winner to be publicized obviously um
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
there may be Legacy benefits in terms of
 
01:36:01.950 --> 01:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
um inherit U estate planning um I went
 
01:36:04.030 --> 01:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
to the wrong side of the law school so I
 
01:36:06.109 --> 01:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
don't trust law is not what I practice
 
01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
we have a chief compliance officer who
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
reviews all trusts that come in uh who
 
01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
is a former Assistant Attorney General
 
01:36:15.990 --> 01:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
so I i' refer to him in terms of trust
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
benefits I'd way outside my over my skis
 
01:36:22.270 --> 01:36:22.280 align:start position:0%
on that one yes follow
 
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
on you do have to still tell the IRS
 
01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:27.109 align:start position:0%
on you do have to still tell the IRS
though

01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
though
 
01:36:30.510 --> 01:36:30.520 align:start position:0%
right um that the trust um all of the
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
trust that we get of that level all have
 
01:36:35.830 --> 01:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
a tax ID number and so the trust pays
 
01:36:39.189 --> 01:36:39.199 align:start position:0%
the taxes as for the folks who that are
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
the ultimate winners I do know who they
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
are uh and have been ordered either
 
01:36:45.830 --> 01:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
through the trust or through court order
 
01:36:48.109 --> 01:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
to keep that a secret to make to make
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
sure that it isn't once again an
 
01:36:55.229 --> 01:36:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:57.030 --> 01:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh yes represent
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
ellerie thank you Mr chair um Mr
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
McIntyre the trusts that are that are
 
01:37:06.990 --> 01:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
have made claims on that have been paid
 
01:37:09.550 --> 01:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
out are those revocable or irrevocable
 
01:37:12.629 --> 01:37:12.639 align:start position:0%
trusts in the primary if I recall
 
01:37:13.709 --> 01:37:13.719 align:start position:0%
correctly representative thank you for
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
the question I think they're both
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
because there's been a number of them uh
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
we've had fundamentally every prize
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
almost that we've had over a million
 
01:37:24.990 --> 01:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
dollars has claimed as a trust and those
 
01:37:26.709 --> 01:37:26.719 align:start position:0%
are the ones as you can imagine we
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
actually publicized the trust I know
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
that sounds awkward but we'll often have
 
01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:32.360 align:start position:0%
the lawyers sit with a check and hold it
 
01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:35.560 align:start position:0%
and say hey thanks um so that
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
it's um they like so no we we public
 
01:37:41.310 --> 01:37:41.320 align:start position:0%
like you know the representative Ry
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
trust won $10 million actually not
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
um the reason follow up follow the
 
01:37:52.109 --> 01:37:52.119 align:start position:0%
reason I asked that question is because
 
01:37:54.070 --> 01:37:54.080 align:start position:0%
an irrevocable trust is just to flow
 
01:37:58.550 --> 01:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
through there is no separate Ein um or t
 
01:38:00.910 --> 01:38:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh for the revocable trust whereas on
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
the irrevocable trust it's an entity
 
01:38:05.470 --> 01:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
that takes on a life well both of them
 
01:38:08.669 --> 01:38:08.679 align:start position:0%
have a life beyond my life from my my
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
wife's life
 
01:38:13.629 --> 01:38:13.639 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
01:38:15.709 --> 01:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
it's they don't need it because it's
 
01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:18.800 align:start position:0%
just a flow through and after the
 
01:38:22.910 --> 01:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
primaries um die then the trust is wiped
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
out or it goes to the other the next
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
person and they keep spending it down
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
unless they put money into it I mean
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%
that would be the same case of an
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
individual who was a person who passed
 
01:38:36.750 --> 01:38:36.760 align:start position:0%
you would the by the law of whether they
 
01:38:39.430 --> 01:38:39.440 align:start position:0%
had a will or into in testy you you
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
transfer ownership of the winnings to
 
01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:43.719 align:start position:0%
the next in line like for example if you
 
01:38:46.229 --> 01:38:46.239 align:start position:0%
want a Lucky for Life The Lucky for Life
 
01:38:49.149 --> 01:38:49.159 align:start position:0%
if you we guarantee we pay you 20 years
 
01:38:51.669 --> 01:38:51.679 align:start position:0%
if you pass in five then the
 
01:38:53.910 --> 01:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
laws of intestacy or by your will or
 
01:38:55.790 --> 01:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
your trust would pass to the next on
 
01:38:58.430 --> 01:38:58.440 align:start position:0%
line but certainly tax law once again
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
also not in my area so I leave it and
 
01:39:05.229 --> 01:39:05.239 align:start position:0%
nor trust law representative spillsbury
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um Mr McIntyre
 
01:39:11.229 --> 01:39:11.239 align:start position:0%
we've talked around this question uh
 
01:39:14.149 --> 01:39:14.159 align:start position:0%
with the last several witnesses and I'm
 
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:15.760 align:start position:0%
struggling to
 
01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
find in the existing statutory language
 
01:39:23.470 --> 01:39:23.480 align:start position:0%
that I see here with in the bill to see
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
what language would allow the commission
 
01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
to withhold the identity of the winner I
 
01:39:34.990 --> 01:39:35.000 align:start position:0%
I I grant that the creation of a trust
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
allows uh a vehicle to Shield the
 
01:39:41.030 --> 01:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
identity of the individual
 
01:39:46.229 --> 01:39:46.239 align:start position:0%
but this first sentence lines 3 to five
 
01:39:48.589 --> 01:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
doesn't in my reading say that the
 
01:39:51.589 --> 01:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
payment shall be confidential
 
01:39:56.189 --> 01:39:56.199 align:start position:0%
it says the financial tax trust or
 
01:39:56.199 --> 01:39:58.350 align:start position:0%
it says the financial tax trust or
personal

01:39:58.350 --> 01:39:58.360 align:start position:0%
personal
 
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
records shall be confidential those
 
01:40:04.669 --> 01:40:04.679 align:start position:0%
financial tax trust or personal
 
01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
records that are in connection with the
 
01:40:11.470 --> 01:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
payment so I don't see in that sentence
 
01:40:14.510 --> 01:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
or any else anywhere else here what
 
01:40:20.229 --> 01:40:20.239 align:start position:0%
would allow for um for the commission to
 
01:40:23.149 --> 01:40:23.159 align:start position:0%
maintain an anity even if the winner
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
specifically asked for it is there a
 
01:40:27.669 --> 01:40:27.679 align:start position:0%
different statute that might get to that
 
01:40:32.070 --> 01:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
or is this the one um I'd have to refer
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
back to because there the lottery exists
 
01:40:36.709 --> 01:40:36.719 align:start position:0%
into two separate sections of the RSA
 
01:40:40.310 --> 01:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
284 and 287 so it have to refer back to
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
284 uh I don't know that we did a fiscal
 
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
note on maybe we could follow up on this
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
and I know it's a question of
 
01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
interpretation it is but my reading I
 
01:40:51.510 --> 01:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't see a basis for
 
01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:54.400 align:start position:0%
maintaining anonymity in the existing
 
01:40:56.830 --> 01:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
law I certainly I don't know that the
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
law requires us to disclose absent it
 
01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
being a 91a request which candidly I
 
01:41:05.350 --> 01:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
don't think we ever get other than in
 
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
certain circumstances which really
 
01:41:12.030 --> 01:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
here that's an interesting point
 
01:41:19.109 --> 01:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
um in line
 
01:41:22.470 --> 01:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
six uh the Third sent following the
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
91a says the commission may release the
 
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
name I suppose that's not mandatory um
 
01:41:32.030 --> 01:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
so does that get to the question of
 
01:41:35.149 --> 01:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
discretion uh in terms of the lottery
 
01:41:36.950 --> 01:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
commission's practice it does I think
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
the certainly the the
 
01:41:41.229 --> 01:41:41.239 align:start position:0%
onus the benefit to the state is
 
01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639 align:start position:0%
obviously disclosure of winners that
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
indeed were paying winners that aren't
 
01:41:46.669 --> 01:41:46.679 align:start position:0%
related to me or my or the folks I work
 
01:41:48.990 --> 01:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
with so um but there's no requirement I
 
01:41:51.910 --> 01:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
think that we disclose absent 91a where
 
01:41:54.149 --> 01:41:54.159 align:start position:0%
we were would see for example a press
 
01:41:56.629 --> 01:41:56.639 align:start position:0%
inquiry of that
 
01:41:59.550 --> 01:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
respect follow up so again on
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
interpretation the May means you
 
01:42:07.750 --> 01:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
can you're not required to but it also
 
01:42:09.229 --> 01:42:09.239 align:start position:0%
means that the
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:16.280 align:start position:0%
it from this reading it's correct but
 
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a statutory requirement it
 
01:42:21.270 --> 01:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
would be coming upon us to sort of honor
 
01:42:22.830 --> 01:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
wishes thank you well to follow up on
 
01:42:27.950 --> 01:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
that I mean this isn't the
 
01:42:30.550 --> 01:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
complete uh law right in terms of
 
01:42:32.709 --> 01:42:32.719 align:start position:0%
disclosure so there still maybe another
 
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:34.760 align:start position:0%
section then that yeah and certainly 91a
 
01:42:37.229 --> 01:42:37.239 align:start position:0%
as well as 284 uh which I will send back
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
and compare I don't think we were asked
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
to do a fiscal note on this one so okay
 
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:42.800 align:start position:0%
certainly happy to answer the questions
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
back to you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
committee the number of questions that
 
01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
have been asked yes to you through the
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
clerk thank
 
01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr clerk yes after reviewing the law
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
as it is now if there's any Avenue where
 
01:43:01.030 --> 01:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
somebody against their will would have
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
the their winnings
 
01:43:05.790 --> 01:43:05.800 align:start position:0%
publicized is there something is there
 
01:43:08.189 --> 01:43:08.199 align:start position:0%
some way mechanism you could work with
 
01:43:11.669 --> 01:43:11.679 align:start position:0%
the sponsor of this bill so that that is
 
01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
closed uh in a manner that that you
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
don't object
 
01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
to Absolutely I'll look at that there's
 
01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:21.480 align:start position:0%
no we want to be trans arent but we also
 
01:43:23.070 --> 01:43:23.080 align:start position:0%
want to respect somebody's wishes that
 
01:43:25.629 --> 01:43:25.639 align:start position:0%
are that are founded in fear so
 
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely I mean in terms of that
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
question um he he doesn't necessarily
 
01:43:33.149 --> 01:43:33.159 align:start position:0%
work with the the sponsor of the bill he
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
can answer the questions the committee
 
01:43:36.830 --> 01:43:36.840 align:start position:0%
the committee will potentially propose
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
an amendment if it makes
 
01:43:41.310 --> 01:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
sense yes representative fellows th this
 
01:43:44.430 --> 01:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
is right along the same whole issue this
 
01:43:47.470 --> 01:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
the more I read it I think this is not
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
where this belongs in the statute
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
because I mean one of the things is it
 
01:43:56.030 --> 01:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
said it it says the records are not
 
01:43:57.870 --> 01:43:57.880 align:start position:0%
public records and then it says upon
 
01:44:00.350 --> 01:44:00.360 align:start position:0%
request the commission may release
 
01:44:04.270 --> 01:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
something I mean May release upon whose
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
request you know you think that's
 
01:44:09.310 --> 01:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
usually the press and the last sentence
 
01:44:11.950 --> 01:44:11.960 align:start position:0%
Financial financial statements filed
 
01:44:13.870 --> 01:44:13.880 align:start position:0%
with the commission I'm wondering what
 
01:44:17.149 --> 01:44:17.159 align:start position:0%
those even are so just I just it just
 
01:44:19.589 --> 01:44:19.599 align:start position:0%
looks like it's in the wrong
 
01:44:19.599 --> 01:44:21.990 align:start position:0%
looks like it's in the wrong
place

01:44:21.990 --> 01:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:44:24.270 --> 01:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
um what is the question is it in the
 
01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:26.390 align:start position:0%
um what is the question is it in the
wrong

01:44:26.390 --> 01:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
place will you check on that yes no
 
01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
certainly following up but represent
 
01:44:31.870 --> 01:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
shamberg I think regarding financial
 
01:44:34.589 --> 01:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
statements that's the same question so
 
01:44:38.990 --> 01:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
19678 so it's an old law that need to be
 
01:44:46.189 --> 01:44:46.199 align:start position:0%
worked representative do set thank you
 
01:44:49.149 --> 01:44:49.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chair just a quick question have we
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
ever experienced litigation a in
 
01:44:53.790 --> 01:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
relation to releasing a name I say we
 
01:44:56.350 --> 01:44:56.360 align:start position:0%
the lottery the
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
state just the once the Powerball winner
 
01:45:02.350 --> 01:45:02.360 align:start position:0%
from meramac um I shudder to disclose
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
even the nature of the ownership whether
 
01:45:06.950 --> 01:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
it be a couple or a person um we were
 
01:45:09.149 --> 01:45:09.159 align:start position:0%
sued but it was not an adversarial
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
lawsuit we the AG because that person
 
01:45:13.629 --> 01:45:13.639 align:start position:0%
had signed the back of the ticket as you
 
01:45:14.830 --> 01:45:14.840 align:start position:0%
can imagine a ticket worth half a
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
billion dollars you'd probably want to
 
01:45:18.550 --> 01:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
sign uh they signed it in their name and
 
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to disclose their name
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
so they came they went to court judge
 
01:45:24.629 --> 01:45:24.639 align:start position:0%
Temple ordered me to not disclose her
 
01:45:27.149 --> 01:45:27.159 align:start position:0%
name ever and I had never have so that
 
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
would be the issue related to that
 
01:45:32.669 --> 01:45:32.679 align:start position:0%
follow up and and just in relation to
 
01:45:34.550 --> 01:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
this I know you said it would make your
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
job tougher and you gave an example
 
01:45:38.910 --> 01:45:38.920 align:start position:0%
whatever but would you be against
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
setting a bar like we heard $10 million
 
01:45:44.070 --> 01:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
you you know don't release and I'm just
 
01:45:47.990 --> 01:45:48.000 align:start position:0%
curious sake of argument no certainly um
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
as you can imagine represent thank you
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
the question thousand we're not
 
01:45:53.030 --> 01:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
promoting that big it's not a big win
 
01:45:55.109 --> 01:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
obviously for us but 10 million 100
 
01:45:57.390 --> 01:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
million um we'd love to promote those
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
but certainly I would submit to you that
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of the player
 
01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
base agrees with they would want to be
 
01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
not known
 
01:46:08.030 --> 01:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
to it is a little tough to hide in New
 
01:46:09.070 --> 01:46:09.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire winning a couple hundred
 
01:46:13.310 --> 01:46:13.320 align:start position:0%
million just is folks and you know they
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
once you you tell friends and it's not
 
01:46:17.310 --> 01:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
us it's usually the friends and family
 
01:46:19.470 --> 01:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
that know because you tell somebody but
 
01:46:22.750 --> 01:46:22.760 align:start position:0%
we don't have no objection to that point
 
01:46:24.790 --> 01:46:24.800 align:start position:0%
representative I I totally understand
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
it's a marketing Bonanza for the
 
01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
commission I I get it I'm just trying to
 
01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:31.870 align:start position:0%

01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
ery since uh representative PL didn't

question you have permission to use my
 
01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:49.400 align:start position:0%

um to be real brief with this and we've
 
01:47:48.390 --> 01:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
seen um a few components this this uh
 
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
1525 is in relation to the uh so-called
 
01:47:54.229 --> 01:47:54.239 align:start position:0%
moratorium on
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
HHR uh and we spoke about uh Senate Bill
 
01:48:01.629 --> 01:48:01.639 align:start position:0%
112 this morning briefly I'm going to uh
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
ask that we we hold on to this I noted a
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh a drafting error in
 
01:48:10.109 --> 01:48:10.119 align:start position:0%
this as I read it this
 
01:48:13.270 --> 01:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
morning uh and it will have to be
 
01:48:15.589 --> 01:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
amended and we can revisit it but I
 
01:48:17.910 --> 01:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
think we're all pretty well versed on
 
01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:18.750 align:start position:0%
think we're all pretty well versed on
this

01:48:18.750 --> 01:48:18.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:48:21.310 --> 01:48:21.320 align:start position:0%
particular component
 
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
uh relative to testimony we've heard in
 
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
the past but this specifically to point
 
01:48:29.709 --> 01:48:29.719 align:start position:0%
out the uh drafting eror if you
 
01:48:32.750 --> 01:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
recall excuse me if you
 
01:48:35.950 --> 01:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
recall uh the amendment to Senate Bill
 
01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:38.840 align:start position:0%
112 it spoke to
 
01:48:42.189 --> 01:48:42.199 align:start position:0%
those uh that have applied for an HHR
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
license up and until October
 
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
18th and in this there's a drafting
 
01:48:51.589 --> 01:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
error that says those approved for an
 
01:48:54.669 --> 01:48:54.679 align:start position:0%
HHR license so there may be some people
 
01:48:57.669 --> 01:48:57.679 align:start position:0%
in the in the process and we allotted
 
01:49:00.430 --> 01:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
for that in that amendment that we all
 
01:49:03.629 --> 01:49:03.639 align:start position:0%
voted on so this will have to
 
01:49:03.639 --> 01:49:06.070 align:start position:0%
voted on so this will have to
be

01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:49:09.149 --> 01:49:09.159 align:start position:0%
amended any questions which line was
 
01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
that on um I'm sorry maybe in two places
 
01:49:18.750 --> 01:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.990 --> 01:49:23.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and May apply in line8 also I have
 
01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:28.950 align:start position:0%
yeah and May apply in line8 also I have
to

01:49:28.950 --> 01:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
look a line8 might be okay yeah
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
yeah any questions for representative
 
01:49:39.109 --> 01:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
jet representative fellows so so where
 
01:49:42.669 --> 01:49:42.679 align:start position:0%
it approved it says it says approved if
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
if we just basically change that to mean
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
that they'd applied for that's what it's
 
01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to say right then repres the
 
01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:52.229 align:start position:0%
supposed to say right then repres the
bill

01:49:52.229 --> 01:49:52.239 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
correct it seems to me this may just be
 
01:49:59.390 --> 01:49:59.400 align:start position:0%
a simple drafting error represent
 
01:50:04.109 --> 01:50:04.119 align:start position:0%
Aly what about line 9 to 11 a game
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
operator employer holding a license
 
01:50:16.430 --> 01:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:18.990 --> 01:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
eligible I think that's current language
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
if I recall correctly I think so yeah
 
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
does that interfere
 
01:50:29.669 --> 01:50:29.679 align:start position:0%
with that's not contrary to the to this
 
01:50:29.679 --> 01:50:35.070 align:start position:0%
with that's not contrary to the to this
bill

01:50:35.070 --> 01:50:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:37.629 --> 01:50:37.639 align:start position:0%

ducet thank you Mr chairman uh Fred
 
02:04:28.830 --> 02:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
ducet representing Rockingham 25 the
 
02:04:30.549 --> 02:04:30.559 align:start position:0%
town of
 
02:04:34.790 --> 02:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
Salem hb1 1549 is is fairly specific and
 
02:04:36.229 --> 02:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
it's specific
 
02:04:38.790 --> 02:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
to um charal
 
02:04:41.830 --> 02:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
gaming uh and more specific to
 
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
tournament poker
 
02:04:47.830 --> 02:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
play uh Last by Anum we raised the max
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
byy in I'm trying to look up that
 
02:04:52.629 --> 02:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
legislation but we can't seem to find it
 
02:04:55.310 --> 02:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
but we raised that maximum Buy in to
 
02:04:57.069 --> 02:04:57.079 align:start position:0%
$2500 at
 
02:05:01.069 --> 02:05:01.079 align:start position:0%
present those facilities that choose to
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
participate or hold uh non-monetary chip
 
02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
value tournaments so if you buy in for a
 
02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
$100 tournament the statute calls for a
 
02:05:16.030 --> 02:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
20% rake and that's what the state the
 
02:05:19.910 --> 02:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
Charities and The Operators take as
 
02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
the the revenue from those particular
 
02:05:28.030 --> 02:05:28.040 align:start position:0%
games excuse me not every room offers
 
02:05:30.669 --> 02:05:30.679 align:start position:0%
tournament poker play it's fairly
 
02:05:33.589 --> 02:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
limited but in those rooms that offer
 
02:05:36.790 --> 02:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
the tournament poker play it's very well
 
02:05:39.030 --> 02:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
received there's a demographic of poker
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
players uh in the state and uh in this
 
02:05:45.470 --> 02:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
geographic location we get a lot of
 
02:05:47.549 --> 02:05:47.559 align:start position:0%
people from northern Massachusetts into
 
02:05:51.189 --> 02:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
the Southern Tier State uh
 
02:05:54.750 --> 02:05:54.760 align:start position:0%
rooms what this does in effect is it
 
02:05:57.629 --> 02:05:57.639 align:start position:0%
still allows for the
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
20% to be captured for tournament poker
 
02:06:05.310 --> 02:06:05.320 align:start position:0%
play as a rake but if for some reason a
 
02:06:09.910 --> 02:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
room chose to go to that maximum bet of
 
02:06:12.470 --> 02:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
$2500 they wanted to hold a Super Bowl
 
02:06:15.830 --> 02:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
of Poker type event and that Super Bowl
 
02:06:19.069 --> 02:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
of Poker type event would draw very
 
02:06:21.350 --> 02:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
specific I I play poker myself I would
 
02:06:25.549 --> 02:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
never play a $2,500 poker tournament but
 
02:06:27.470 --> 02:06:27.480 align:start position:0%
there are people that would do that if
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
the rooms chose to do so but the rake on
 
02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
that at present would be
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
$500 for a $2500 event so it's kind of
 
02:06:42.189 --> 02:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
twofold here the Charities would want
 
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:45.360 align:start position:0%
the traffic to come in and and take that
 
02:06:47.510 --> 02:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue if you can pull a 100 people in
 
02:06:50.270 --> 02:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
and get the 250 this would cap it at 250
 
02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
for those larger you know it would be
 
02:06:56.350 --> 02:06:56.360 align:start position:0%
whatever the lesser amount is 20% or I
 
02:06:58.350 --> 02:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
believe it's stated the lesser amount so
 
02:07:01.709 --> 02:07:01.719 align:start position:0%
we'd still get to 20% up and into
 
02:07:05.030 --> 02:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
tournaments that would exceed $250 of
 
02:07:08.430 --> 02:07:08.440 align:start position:0%
rake so we cap The Rake basically at
 
02:07:11.629 --> 02:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
$250 I don't suspect and somebody from
 
02:07:14.629 --> 02:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
the industry maybe can speak to it but I
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
don't suspect we'd see a lot of that at
 
02:07:19.629 --> 02:07:19.639 align:start position:0%
present I'm aware of
 
02:07:22.310 --> 02:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
I think there's a monthly tournament at
 
02:07:25.589 --> 02:07:25.599 align:start position:0%
$250 there may be one that's bonly at
 
02:07:28.069 --> 02:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
like $500 there's only certain rooms
 
02:07:30.669 --> 02:07:30.679 align:start position:0%
that hold these tournaments on certain
 
02:07:33.430 --> 02:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
nights of the week and whatnot but this
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
allows the availability if if a operator
 
02:07:42.189 --> 02:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
chose to do so to go to that Max um
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
buying level that we approved Last by
 
02:07:47.310 --> 02:07:47.320 align:start position:0%
Anum and this would just uh cap that
 
02:07:51.750 --> 02:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
$50 okay thank you any questions
 
02:07:57.229 --> 02:07:57.239 align:start position:0%
representative PL what is a
 
02:07:57.239 --> 02:08:01.910 align:start position:0%
representative PL what is a
rake

02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:04.950 --> 02:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
okay come on represented PL you've been
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
here a long it's it's the take on the
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
these aren't chips of value when you go
 
02:08:13.589 --> 02:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
to play a tournament you buy in say it's
 
02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
a $100 entry fee for a
 
02:08:19.030 --> 02:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
tournament the Chari
 
02:08:21.629 --> 02:08:21.639 align:start position:0%
the operators in the state have to make
 
02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
revenue from that so in statute right
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
now it's built out at
 
02:08:28.910 --> 02:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
20% so
 
02:08:33.470 --> 02:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
$20 of that $100 would be what is the
 
02:08:36.510 --> 02:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
revenue for those non-monetary chips for
 
02:08:40.149 --> 02:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
a poker tournament so those are the
 
02:08:42.910 --> 02:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
dollars made for holding that particular
 
02:08:45.709 --> 02:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
event for that particular player dollars
 
02:08:49.830 --> 02:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
made by home I I I'm totally office in
 
02:08:52.589 --> 02:08:52.599 align:start position:0%
this getting the money who's getting the
 
02:08:53.709 --> 02:08:53.719 align:start position:0%
money the
 
02:08:56.350 --> 02:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
20% well it's the break same breakdown
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
35% goes to the Charities it's the same
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
as any other table
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
game but un unlike if you sit at a poker
 
02:09:09.790 --> 02:09:09.800 align:start position:0%
table and play and $2 poker there's no
 
02:09:13.470 --> 02:09:13.480 align:start position:0%
monetary value if you if you play and I
 
02:09:14.750 --> 02:09:14.760 align:start position:0%
understand it gets confusing
 
02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
representative when you you buy in for
 
02:09:20.589 --> 02:09:20.599 align:start position:0%
one particular doll amount $100 bill and
 
02:09:23.790 --> 02:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
you get a stack of you know 10 chips
 
02:09:25.109 --> 02:09:25.119 align:start position:0%
let's call
 
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
it and you play other players and at the
 
02:09:29.950 --> 02:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
end of the day the money is pulled and
 
02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
you come in first second third you get x
 
02:09:36.229 --> 02:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars to hold that event
 
02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
there has to be revenue for the state
 
02:09:41.069 --> 02:09:41.079 align:start position:0%
for The Operators and mo most
 
02:09:44.189 --> 02:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
importantly the Charities so the the
 
02:09:46.549 --> 02:09:46.559 align:start position:0%
$100 Buy
 
02:09:52.350 --> 02:09:52.360 align:start position:0%
in 20% of that is taken put aside the
 
02:09:56.549 --> 02:09:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:00.189 --> 02:10:00.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:02.830 --> 02:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
rake uh yes representative Le
 
02:10:05.549 --> 02:10:05.559 align:start position:0%
please so I just want to make sure I've
 
02:10:08.069 --> 02:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
understood this correctly so it sounds
 
02:10:09.669 --> 02:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
like what you're
 
02:10:14.310 --> 02:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
proposing means that the rake would be
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
capped so it wouldn't the 20% wouldn't
 
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
just keep growing um the charity would
 
02:10:22.589 --> 02:10:22.599 align:start position:0%
still get
 
02:10:28.430 --> 02:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
35% of that so if the rake is not
 
02:10:32.870 --> 02:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to expand at the 20% rate the
 
02:10:37.229 --> 02:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
state would get less money and the
 
02:10:40.589 --> 02:10:40.599 align:start position:0%
game operator
 
02:10:44.310 --> 02:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
employer so instead of the rake being
 
02:10:48.589 --> 02:10:48.599 align:start position:0%
$500 in the example you gave of the $25
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
$500 game uh it would be capped at
 
02:10:56.709 --> 02:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
$250 correct so the game operator and
 
02:10:56.719 --> 02:10:57.750 align:start position:0%
$250 correct so the game operator and
the

02:10:57.750 --> 02:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:11:01.390 --> 02:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
state and the charity would get less
 
02:11:05.149 --> 02:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
money by definition absolutely okay but
 
02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
I got it my contention is that it
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't happen that tournament
 
02:11:11.709 --> 02:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
wouldn't happen this gives them a
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
vehicle to if they chose to do so it
 
02:11:17.790 --> 02:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
would happen at $500 rake at a $2500 Buy
 
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
in these poker players aren't going to
 
02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
play that so it gives them the Avail not
 
02:11:24.870 --> 02:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
only the The Operators but the players
 
02:11:26.990 --> 02:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
the availability to play something as
 
02:11:30.310 --> 02:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
large as as that and it caps it at that
 
02:11:32.629 --> 02:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
250 so it doesn't change the percentages
 
02:11:35.430 --> 02:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
that go to the Charities or the state
 
02:11:38.350 --> 02:11:38.360 align:start position:0%
but in that specific circumstance it
 
02:11:42.350 --> 02:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
would cap it at 250 okay yeah thank you
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
represent elme thank you I think I
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
remember you saying
 
02:11:51.229 --> 02:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
previously in another situation that um
 
02:11:55.310 --> 02:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
these highlevel gamblers go from state
 
02:12:00.149 --> 02:12:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:02.069 --> 02:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
games thank you for the question
 
02:12:05.870 --> 02:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
representative and I'm familiar and I
 
02:12:08.109 --> 02:12:08.119 align:start position:0%
pay attention I watch a lot of the TV
 
02:12:10.390 --> 02:12:10.400 align:start position:0%
stuff in relation to Poker and there are
 
02:12:14.830 --> 02:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
people that travel to play bigger stake
 
02:12:17.709 --> 02:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
tournaments um but this would definitely
 
02:12:21.189 --> 02:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
a a break it at $500 on on $2500 it
 
02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
would negate that tournament ever
 
02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
happening so this allows for the
 
02:12:28.030 --> 02:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity for that I don't suspect
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a long line of rooms
 
02:12:31.990 --> 02:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
that do this and some like I said
 
02:12:34.189 --> 02:12:34.199 align:start position:0%
somebody else can speak to that but it
 
02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
makes it available because we changed
 
02:12:41.510 --> 02:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:45.149 --> 02:12:45.159 align:start position:0%
so representative ORS thank you Mr chair
 
02:12:46.950 --> 02:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
question so as trying to figure it out
 
02:12:52.830 --> 02:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
if the rake of 20% comes off the top
 
02:12:55.589 --> 02:12:55.599 align:start position:0%
Charities get 35% off the
 
02:12:59.030 --> 02:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
top how how would they lose money I
 
02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
guess 35% of the 20 oh they get 35% of
 
02:13:05.629 --> 02:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
the 20 got it answer my question thank
 
02:13:08.510 --> 02:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you so I I don't really
 
02:13:15.589 --> 02:13:15.599 align:start position:0%
understand why you want to do this one
 
02:13:18.870 --> 02:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
of the things I notice is if the um um
 
02:13:24.189 --> 02:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:24.199 --> 02:13:26.430 align:start position:0%
 
1,250

02:13:26.430 --> 02:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
1,250
 
02:13:29.589 --> 02:13:29.599 align:start position:0%
then that's equal you know that's where
 
02:13:33.149 --> 02:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
you have it capped and so between a Buy
 
02:13:34.030 --> 02:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
in of
 
02:13:38.109 --> 02:13:38.119 align:start position:0%
1,250 and the max of
 
02:13:42.149 --> 02:13:42.159 align:start position:0%
2,500 there's not any the both of those
 
02:13:46.109 --> 02:13:46.119 align:start position:0%
send the same amount to be the rake that
 
02:13:48.910 --> 02:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
split between the Charities and the
 
02:13:51.790 --> 02:13:51.800 align:start position:0%
State why I
 
02:13:54.709 --> 02:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
mean so I guess the the people that are
 
02:13:56.750 --> 02:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
sitting at the table would like that
 
02:13:58.589 --> 02:13:58.599 align:start position:0%
because they're GNA whoever wins is
 
02:14:00.390 --> 02:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
going to get a little bit more
 
02:14:03.790 --> 02:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
money but other than that
 
02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
why thank you for the
 
02:14:10.270 --> 02:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
question and like I said before and and
 
02:14:13.069 --> 02:14:13.079 align:start position:0%
maybe uh somebody can testify to the
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
fact that th this is an opportunity to
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
drive traffic and the more people that
 
02:14:20.149 --> 02:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
go and
 
02:14:23.549 --> 02:14:23.559 align:start position:0%
participate in tournament play if they
 
02:14:26.310 --> 02:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
can draw a 100 people in at even at the
 
02:14:28.350 --> 02:14:28.360 align:start position:0%
1250 or
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
1,500 it's revenue for the Charities
 
02:14:35.189 --> 02:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
hard stop the there's at present very
 
02:14:38.669 --> 02:14:38.679 align:start position:0%
limited tournament play this allows for
 
02:14:38.679 --> 02:14:39.470 align:start position:0%
limited tournament play this allows for
the

02:14:39.470 --> 02:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:42.189 --> 02:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have those higher level
 
02:14:45.030 --> 02:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
games and promote them and get the
 
02:14:47.870 --> 02:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
peripheral business also but spe
 
02:14:49.510 --> 02:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
specifically to
 
02:14:53.470 --> 02:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
this at 20% with that's that's probably
 
02:14:55.549 --> 02:14:55.559 align:start position:0%
one of the high and again somebody in
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
the industry can speak to but that's
 
02:14:59.549 --> 02:14:59.559 align:start position:0%
that's a substantial
 
02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
rake okay coming from a poker table and
 
02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
when you st getting into these higher uh
 
02:15:09.950 --> 02:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
higher fee tournaments to to go beyond
 
02:15:12.990 --> 02:15:13.000 align:start position:0%
the 250 it just would negate the
 
02:15:15.350 --> 02:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
possibility of somebody hosting that so
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
it's it's not as if
 
02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
we we have to do this it allows for not
 
02:15:25.830 --> 02:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
only the players to possibly participate
 
02:15:27.750 --> 02:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
in that but it allows for maybe some
 
02:15:29.990 --> 02:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
more traffic to get Revenue to the
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
Charities the state The Operators it
 
02:15:35.189 --> 02:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a carot and stick thing you
 
02:15:37.750 --> 02:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
know it's up to them to promote it I
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
again my personal opinion I was
 
02:15:42.390 --> 02:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
approached with this by by the industry
 
02:15:45.629 --> 02:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
and by players because I play poker
 
02:15:48.390 --> 02:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
myself um
 
02:15:51.109 --> 02:15:51.119 align:start position:0%
it it gives them the availability
 
02:15:54.109 --> 02:15:54.119 align:start position:0%
because we now by Statute can go up to a
 
02:15:56.950 --> 02:15:56.960 align:start position:0%
Max buying of $2500 but it's never going
 
02:16:00.390 --> 02:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
to happen a tournament at $2,500 just
 
02:16:04.830 --> 02:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
isn't feasible with a $500 rake it's
 
02:16:08.470 --> 02:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
just follow up yeah can it's I've never
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
been to a poker tournament so can you
 
02:16:14.830 --> 02:16:14.840 align:start position:0%
give me some kind of um help
 
02:16:18.310 --> 02:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is is this five or people
 
02:16:21.229 --> 02:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
sitting at one table is or is it do they
 
02:16:24.549 --> 02:16:24.559 align:start position:0%
have multiple tables at the same time
 
02:16:27.109 --> 02:16:27.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm just trying to figure out like
 
02:16:30.950 --> 02:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
how many players would there be who are
 
02:16:33.469 --> 02:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
are playing you know doing buying into
 
02:16:36.309 --> 02:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
it sure sure and in my experience thank
 
02:16:38.110 --> 02:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
you for the question in my experience
 
02:16:40.270 --> 02:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
the more the merrier the more people we
 
02:16:43.549 --> 02:16:43.559 align:start position:0%
want everybody benefits everybody
 
02:16:44.830 --> 02:16:44.840 align:start position:0%
including the
 
02:16:48.150 --> 02:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
player um if you're play in a tournament
 
02:16:51.389 --> 02:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
normally it's a table of nine people and
 
02:16:53.270 --> 02:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
they'll have depending on the size of
 
02:16:56.230 --> 02:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
the particular facility and the draw for
 
02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
that particular tournament um somebody
 
02:17:00.870 --> 02:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
else can speak more intelligently to
 
02:17:04.349 --> 02:17:04.359 align:start position:0%
what kind of numbers they're drawing but
 
02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
um if you get five or 10 tables on a
 
02:17:10.030 --> 02:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
weekend T that's that's great because
 
02:17:13.629 --> 02:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
the prize pool grows and it makes people
 
02:17:14.990 --> 02:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
want to come and play that game because
 
02:17:17.790 --> 02:17:17.800 align:start position:0%
it's a bigger prize to play for and it's
 
02:17:22.110 --> 02:17:22.120 align:start position:0%
a it's in an elimination kind of event
 
02:17:25.750 --> 02:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
so the type of Poker we play here in New
 
02:17:28.150 --> 02:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's an all-in kind of Texas
 
02:17:30.270 --> 02:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
hold them Allin once you lose your chips
 
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
you're done you move on to the next and
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
whoever's left remaining depending on
 
02:17:38.469 --> 02:17:38.479 align:start position:0%
the prize pool they pay out accordingly
 
02:17:40.429 --> 02:17:40.439 align:start position:0%
so the the more players the better for
 
02:17:44.030 --> 02:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
all involved follow up so so if you
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
start out with like five tables of nine
 
02:17:49.990 --> 02:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
MH when you get to the it's not who wins
 
02:17:54.110 --> 02:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
per table it's it's like okay
 
02:17:57.709 --> 02:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
so okay so they keep consolidating to
 
02:18:00.790 --> 02:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
down to you know two tables one table
 
02:18:05.070 --> 02:18:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:06.990 --> 02:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
thanks anybody
 
02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
else thank you thank
 
02:18:15.190 --> 02:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
you okay next I have a card here for um
 
02:18:15.200 --> 02:18:16.509 align:start position:0%
you okay next I have a card here for um

02:18:28.589 --> 02:18:28.599 align:start position:0%
hello Mr chairman members of the
 
02:18:30.190 --> 02:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
committee thank you my name is Alicia
 
02:18:31.790 --> 02:18:31.800 align:start position:0%
Preston I represent the New Hampshire
 
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming operators Association
 
02:18:35.669 --> 02:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
and we are in support of this bill for
 
02:18:37.070 --> 02:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
several of the reasons that
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
representative duet explained last year
 
02:18:41.389 --> 02:18:41.399 align:start position:0%
when Senate Bill 120 was passed it
 
02:18:43.150 --> 02:18:43.160 align:start position:0%
increased the buying amount for
 
02:18:44.990 --> 02:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
tournament poker to
 
02:18:49.110 --> 02:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
$2,500 which leaves that 20% rake um as
 
02:18:52.750 --> 02:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
the rule however at a $500 Rake The
 
02:18:53.910 --> 02:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
Players simply aren't going to play
 
02:18:55.270 --> 02:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
these games so they're not happening
 
02:18:56.669 --> 02:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
they're hasn't been one Tournament of
 
02:18:58.190 --> 02:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
that level in the state of New Hampshire
 
02:19:00.669 --> 02:19:00.679 align:start position:0%
since that law was passed we believe it
 
02:19:02.469 --> 02:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
will actually increase the revenue to
 
02:19:04.030 --> 02:19:04.040 align:start position:0%
the Charities The Operators and there by
 
02:19:06.030 --> 02:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
the state because there will be more
 
02:19:09.150 --> 02:19:09.160 align:start position:0%
higher level um tournaments like this so
 
02:19:11.030 --> 02:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
we'll bring in more people and there
 
02:19:13.150 --> 02:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
will be more tournaments happening I'm
 
02:19:14.469 --> 02:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
not sure you're going to see very many
 
02:19:16.509 --> 02:19:16.519 align:start position:0%
$2,500 tournaments but you may
 
02:19:18.509 --> 02:19:18.519 align:start position:0%
occasionally see
 
02:19:20.349 --> 02:19:20.359 align:start position:0%
you know a high-end special event at a
 
02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
facility but this just makes it so that
 
02:19:24.190 --> 02:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
there is a draw for players being
 
02:19:26.429 --> 02:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
willing to participate if a facility
 
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
end uh represent
 
02:19:34.750 --> 02:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you have there been
 
02:19:38.910 --> 02:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
tournaments at 1500 and 12
 
02:19:41.950 --> 02:19:41.960 align:start position:0%
1250 to my knowledge no to my knowledge
 
02:19:44.150 --> 02:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
the highest tournament to date that I'm
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
aware of is
 
02:19:46.439 --> 02:19:52.670 align:start position:0%
aware of is
$500

02:19:52.670 --> 02:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:57.550 --> 02:19:57.560 align:start position:0%
questions representative PL yes if uh
 
02:20:00.070 --> 02:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
$250 a cap for
 
02:20:03.670 --> 02:20:03.680 align:start position:0%
$2500 uh game that's a 10% rather than
 
02:20:07.230 --> 02:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
20% rake is there a problem at $500 with
 
02:20:09.389 --> 02:20:09.399 align:start position:0%
a 20%
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
rake no be that's what people are
 
02:20:13.870 --> 02:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
playing now so if there's a $500 table
 
02:20:16.030 --> 02:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
there's a 20% rake people are willing to
 
02:20:17.950 --> 02:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
pay that it kind of just becomes
 
02:20:20.469 --> 02:20:20.479 align:start position:0%
you're putting up $2,500 knowing 500 of
 
02:20:22.469 --> 02:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
that is coming right off the top that's
 
02:20:24.550 --> 02:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
undesirable for a
 
02:20:28.230 --> 02:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
player and I would imagine um there's
 
02:20:29.830 --> 02:20:29.840 align:start position:0%
some competition with other states as
 
02:20:31.710 --> 02:20:31.720 align:start position:0%
you get into those higher numbers if
 
02:20:34.270 --> 02:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
we're at that level people will probably
 
02:20:36.030 --> 02:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
figureing okay if I'm a higher level
 
02:20:37.750 --> 02:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
player I'll go somewhere else is that
 
02:20:39.389 --> 02:20:39.399 align:start position:0%
true oh absolutely and our surrounding
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
states do have legalized gambling so if
 
02:20:43.910 --> 02:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
they can go to a $2,500 tournament in
 
02:20:46.270 --> 02:20:46.280 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and only pay $ 250 to buy
 
02:20:47.309 --> 02:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
in that's where they're going to choose
 
02:20:48.510 --> 02:20:48.520 align:start position:0%
choose to go as opposed to in New
 
02:20:50.429 --> 02:20:50.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when that price is doubled
 
02:20:53.070 --> 02:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thank you represent El
 
02:20:56.030 --> 02:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
me thank you uh what if we amended the
 
02:21:02.309 --> 02:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:04.710 --> 02:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
$500 of the Buy in
 
02:21:07.510 --> 02:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
amount to make the buyin amount a
 
02:21:11.030 --> 02:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
minimum I'm sorry the 500 seems not to
 
02:21:13.590 --> 02:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
barrier the $500 rake on a $2,500
 
02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:18.630 align:start position:0%
barrier the $500 rake on a $2,500
tournament

02:21:18.630 --> 02:21:18.640 align:start position:0%
tournament
 
02:21:22.750 --> 02:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
Buy in Buy in amount to make 20% it's
 
02:21:22.760 --> 02:21:24.349 align:start position:0%
Buy in Buy in amount to make 20% it's
now

02:21:24.349 --> 02:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:21:27.309 --> 02:21:27.319 align:start position:0%
250 it would be
 
02:21:30.389 --> 02:21:30.399 align:start position:0%
500 of the Buy in amount collected from
 
02:21:33.110 --> 02:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
the players whichever is less well I
 
02:21:35.950 --> 02:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
think the 500 is the barrier that's why
 
02:21:37.830 --> 02:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
these tournaments aren't being conducted
 
02:21:39.590 --> 02:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
I thought you said that they were being
 
02:21:42.389 --> 02:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
conducted at 500 oh a $500 buying I'm
 
02:21:45.150 --> 02:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm not understanding exactly so
 
02:21:48.510 --> 02:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
20 well it's at 20% for the 5 00 I guess
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what are you talking about
 
02:21:53.830 --> 02:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
the rake amount or the buying amount I'm
 
02:21:56.469 --> 02:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
talking about what it says right here a
 
02:22:00.630 --> 02:22:00.640 align:start position:0%
minimum of 20% or instead of 250 of the
 
02:22:03.469 --> 02:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
buyin amount collected from players the
 
02:22:06.190 --> 02:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
500 of the buyin
 
02:22:08.590 --> 02:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
amount well that's that's what's been
 
02:22:10.070 --> 02:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
prohibitive that's what's been
 
02:22:11.950 --> 02:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
prohibitive to the players if it's 500
 
02:22:14.590 --> 02:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
it it now as current law stands for a
 
02:22:18.710 --> 02:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
$2,500 tournament the break on the buyin
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
would be $500 and that's what players
 
02:22:25.070 --> 02:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
are unwilling to play to pay yes follow
 
02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
but you're talking about a $500
 
02:22:31.309 --> 02:22:31.319 align:start position:0%
tournament I thought that's what the 250
 
02:22:35.150 --> 02:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
of the buyin amount meant no the 250
 
02:22:38.349 --> 02:22:38.359 align:start position:0%
referenced here is regarding the rake so
 
02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
the rake for $500 tournament for
 
02:22:42.670 --> 02:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
instance the rake would be a would be
 
02:22:45.550 --> 02:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
20% this is saying everything stays at
 
02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
20% except it's cap at 250 so no more
 
02:22:54.469 --> 02:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:58.110 --> 02:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
rake yes represent s uh thank you um
 
02:22:59.710 --> 02:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
would this put us more in line with
 
02:23:02.670 --> 02:23:02.680 align:start position:0%
other states as far as their rakes are
 
02:23:05.590 --> 02:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
concerned um I will have to get back
 
02:23:06.950 --> 02:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
detailed information for you I certainly
 
02:23:08.309 --> 02:23:08.319 align:start position:0%
can for surrounding states but I will
 
02:23:10.309 --> 02:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
tell you it's very very uncommon in the
 
02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
industry to have a rake that would be
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:16.080 --> 02:23:19.190 align:start position:0%
 
table

02:23:19.190 --> 02:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:21.990 --> 02:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank
 
02:23:25.110 --> 02:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
you I have no more pink cards now um is
 
02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
there anyone else who would like to
 
02:23:31.710 --> 02:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:34.269 --> 02:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
1549 okay seeing none we will close the
 
02:23:34.279 --> 02:23:39.150 align:start position:0%
1549 okay seeing none we will close the
public

02:23:39.150 --> 02:23:39.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:42.790 --> 02:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
hearing all right that uh that concludes
 
02:23:46.230 --> 02:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
today's agenda um tomorrow as you all
 
02:23:48.349 --> 02:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
know we've got we're starting at 9:30
 
02:23:50.750 --> 02:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow just to keep that in mind we
 
02:23:54.269 --> 02:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
are going to hear on six different bills
 
02:23:57.630 --> 02:23:57.640 align:start position:0%
and depending on how things flow um we
 
02:24:00.030 --> 02:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
we may have to have a lunch break um and
 
02:24:01.990 --> 02:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
continue in the afternoon but uh we will
 
02:24:04.469 --> 02:24:04.479 align:start position:0%
start with the current schedule at 9:30
 
02:24:07.349 --> 02:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
going every half an hour on those bills
 
02:24:10.110 --> 02:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
and then my plan um for schedule after
 
02:24:11.710 --> 02:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
that after tomorrow we'll be done with
 
02:24:13.990 --> 02:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
all the public hearings uh for the bills
 
02:24:16.630 --> 02:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
we currently have in ways and means and
 
02:24:16.640 --> 02:24:17.510 align:start position:0%
we currently have in ways and means and
so

02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:20.910 --> 02:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
um next week I need to get um the
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
schedule in for next week by tomorrow um
 
02:24:26.469 --> 02:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
I'm planning on trying to I mean I don't
 
02:24:27.910 --> 02:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
know if all of you know I think we've
 
02:24:29.910 --> 02:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
talked about it this room being a double
 
02:24:32.990 --> 02:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
room we share with criminal justice and
 
02:24:35.590 --> 02:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
we have uh Mondays and Tuesdays
 
02:24:37.469 --> 02:24:37.479 align:start position:0%
allocated to us in general and they have
 
02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
Wednesdays through Friday so I what I'll
 
02:24:44.030 --> 02:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
be doing is trying to schedule mostly
 
02:24:46.070 --> 02:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
Mondays and Tuesdays when we have a
 
02:24:47.830 --> 02:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
Wednesday like we do tomorrow it's only
 
02:24:51.030 --> 02:24:51.040 align:start position:0%
because uh the chair of criminal justice
 
02:24:53.910 --> 02:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
has been nice enough to allow us to use
 
02:24:57.030 --> 02:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
that day so um having said that I'm
 
02:24:58.830 --> 02:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
going to try to schedule mostly Mondays
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
and Tuesdays through February accepting
 
02:25:03.429 --> 02:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
the last week which is a school vacation
 
02:25:06.550 --> 02:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
week um so we will we will be meeting
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
next Monday and
 
02:25:10.309 --> 02:25:10.319 align:start position:0%
Tuesday uh I don't know the exact St
 
02:25:11.389 --> 02:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
you'll have to watch the calendar I
 
02:25:12.309 --> 02:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
don't know yet whether I'm going to
 
02:25:16.070 --> 02:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
start at 9:30 or 10: but um that's
 
02:25:18.389 --> 02:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
that's pretty much what we'll try to do
 
02:25:22.790 --> 02:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
so okay questions well on
 
02:25:25.670 --> 02:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
Tuesday is a democratic can't hear you
 
02:25:29.030 --> 02:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
can't there's a I was just point out
 
02:25:32.870 --> 02:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
that uh FYI I guess that the leadership
 
02:25:34.870 --> 02:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
group in the on the Democratic side
 
02:25:39.429 --> 02:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
meets on Tuesdays from 9: to 10: so at 9
 
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
9:30 a.m. start time would be would
 
02:25:45.590 --> 02:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
would interfere with that okay just so
 
02:25:47.950 --> 02:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
you know all right thank thank you
 
02:25:49.790 --> 02:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
representative Aly I'm sorry let me go
 
02:25:51.990 --> 02:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
to representative fellow sh yeah I just
 
02:25:55.830 --> 02:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
have a going forward on Mondays I don't
 
02:25:58.750 --> 02:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
have any concern about that except for
 
02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
just this coming Monday because it
 
02:26:03.269 --> 02:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
hasn't been in the calendar yet and
 
02:26:05.269 --> 02:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
personally I already booked something
 
02:26:09.309 --> 02:26:09.319 align:start position:0%
for that day so it does it apply to that
 
02:26:11.710 --> 02:26:11.720 align:start position:0%
and is it in the morning or are we going
 
02:26:14.950 --> 02:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
to do mornings or afternoons or well
 
02:26:17.150 --> 02:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's I mean we're going to be doing what
 
02:26:21.269 --> 02:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
I'm planning on doing is listing um
 
02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:24.160 align:start position:0%
several work sessions uh I'll also be
 
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
listing an exec session just in case we
 
02:26:30.830 --> 02:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
are able to exec something um and so it
 
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
yeah it'll start in the morning and
 
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
um uh you know either I mean given what
 
02:26:40.429 --> 02:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
representative Ames just said I'll try
 
02:26:43.710 --> 02:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
to start Tuesday at 10 o'clock um and
 
02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
Monday I'm not sure yet maybe we'll
 
02:26:47.590 --> 02:26:47.600 align:start position:0%
start at 9:30
 
02:26:48.910 --> 02:26:48.920 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:26:51.429 --> 02:26:51.439 align:start position:0%
if yeah I
 
02:26:54.790 --> 02:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
mean it's tough because I there's just
 
02:26:56.990 --> 02:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
because particularly because it's so
 
02:26:59.870 --> 02:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
short notice and then people don't
 
02:27:02.630 --> 02:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
nobody knows it outside that this room
 
02:27:04.030 --> 02:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
and they're not going to see it in the
 
02:27:05.870 --> 02:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
calendar until
 
02:27:08.750 --> 02:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
Friday they'll see it on Friday correct
 
02:27:10.429 --> 02:27:10.439 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to try to schedule the next
 
02:27:14.389 --> 02:27:14.399 align:start position:0%
two weeks a challenge um for this um
 
02:27:14.399 --> 02:27:15.349 align:start position:0%
two weeks a challenge um for this um
yeah

02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:27:20.150 --> 02:27:20.160 align:start position:0%
I repr of all me I also I have an
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
appointment at 1110 for dentist on
 
02:27:28.469 --> 02:27:28.479 align:start position:0%
Monday next Monday the
 
02:27:31.469 --> 02:27:31.479 align:start position:0%
5th I okay I'm good for and it's been
 
02:27:33.870 --> 02:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
there for a long time and it'll probably
 
02:27:36.630 --> 02:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
be April before I can get another
 
02:27:39.990 --> 02:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
sometime I won't know when I can get it
 
02:27:43.550 --> 02:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
I know uh I mean I personally um have
 
02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
scheduled things on Mondays and Fridays
 
02:27:48.870 --> 02:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
um but given this this double room
 
02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:51.560 align:start position:0%
scenario it's we have this challenge of
 
02:27:53.790 --> 02:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
working with the other let me just get
 
02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
represent Southworth because half the
 
02:27:57.870 --> 02:27:57.880 align:start position:0%
time I don't see I know push it out as
 
02:27:59.670 --> 02:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
far as I can yeah so we want to give him
 
02:28:01.070 --> 02:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
a chance I think it is going to be
 
02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
tricky to schedule either way but maybe
 
02:28:05.630 --> 02:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
one thing if you could put the execs on
 
02:28:08.349 --> 02:28:08.359 align:start position:0%
Tuesday which we're already planning on
 
02:28:09.750 --> 02:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
um I think that would really help the
 
02:28:11.429 --> 02:28:11.439 align:start position:0%
execs if they're on the day we already
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
thought we had whereas n on a Monday
 
02:28:15.870 --> 02:28:15.880 align:start position:0%
might be tricky but just something to
 
02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
think about okay yeah we will try to
 
02:28:21.510 --> 02:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
there is a myriad of of issues to
 
02:28:23.950 --> 02:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
navigate when scheduling and try to keep
 
02:28:26.110 --> 02:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
that in mind as well uh representative
 
02:28:28.670 --> 02:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
leapley thank you Mr chair I I just
 
02:28:30.870 --> 02:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify
 
02:28:33.510 --> 02:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
afternoons I just trying to clarify no I
 
02:28:34.510 --> 02:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
didn't say anything about Tuesday
 
02:28:37.389 --> 02:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
afternoon no we I think most likely it's
 
02:28:39.030 --> 02:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
going to be um we're going to have a
 
02:28:41.389 --> 02:28:41.399 align:start position:0%
lunch break both those days because
 
02:28:42.830 --> 02:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
we'll have to probably do morning and
 
02:28:45.510 --> 02:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon to start getting through this
 
02:28:49.230 --> 02:28:49.240 align:start position:0%
um thank you so yes
 
02:28:54.590 --> 02:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:57.309 --> 02:28:57.319 align:start position:0%
is I and I would agree that we should
 
02:28:59.429 --> 02:28:59.439 align:start position:0%
try to do all the exing on Tuesday since
 
02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
we've already pretty well set that up if
 
02:29:04.790 --> 02:29:04.800 align:start position:0%
that were possible but if it turns out
 
02:29:07.830 --> 02:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
that there aren't a lot of other things
 
02:29:11.269 --> 02:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
going on on a second day that would be
 
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
necessary would it be possible to just
 
02:29:17.950 --> 02:29:17.960 align:start position:0%
plan one very long day on Tuesday you
 
02:29:20.469 --> 02:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
know starting at 9:30 and then going to
 
02:29:23.710 --> 02:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
5: or 6 or something like
 
02:29:28.710 --> 02:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
that um some of it is the difficulty
 
02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
early on here is going to be
 
02:29:35.150 --> 02:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
that we don't know I I mean we can guess
 
02:29:36.910 --> 02:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
which bills might be might be quick but
 
02:29:39.389 --> 02:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
once we get into the work sessions I I
 
02:29:41.389 --> 02:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
know all of us at times are surprised by
 
02:29:43.510 --> 02:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
how long something can take so I
 
02:29:45.469 --> 02:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
probably will list U work sessions and
 
02:29:47.429 --> 02:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
exec sessions but I'll try to keep in
 
02:29:49.630 --> 02:29:49.640 align:start position:0%
mind that given the short notice on this
 
02:29:51.750 --> 02:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
Monday we'll try to not
 
02:29:53.590 --> 02:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
EXA I don't want to say we're not going
 
02:29:56.150 --> 02:29:56.160 align:start position:0%
to EXA anything on Monday I I right now
 
02:29:58.030 --> 02:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
I've got to reserve that but we'll try
 
02:30:00.950 --> 02:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
to stay come Monday can't come Monday
 
02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
it's too late to tell My
 
02:30:07.269 --> 02:30:07.279 align:start position:0%
DST okay
 
02:30:11.230 --> 02:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
um yes slightly different question do
 
02:30:14.469 --> 02:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
you know which um for the work sessions
 
02:30:16.510 --> 02:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
do you know which ones were're going
 
02:30:19.750 --> 02:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
going to start with a list of which of
 
02:30:22.309 --> 02:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
the bills are you going to do them sit
 
02:30:24.230 --> 02:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
down and talk about all of them all at
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
once or well you know take the go
 
02:30:27.120 --> 02:30:27.990 align:start position:0%
once or well you know take the go
through

02:30:27.990 --> 02:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:30:30.870 --> 02:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
the that's part of that's part of what
 
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
I'm working on this afternoon to figure
 
02:30:35.870 --> 02:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
out which bills um this will start
 
02:30:37.750 --> 02:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
getting more clear this this first pass
 
02:30:39.389 --> 02:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
is a little more difficult to get going
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
but we'll
 
02:30:44.349 --> 02:30:44.359 align:start position:0%
um I yeah so the answer is I don't know
 
02:30:54.070 --> 02:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:57.309 --> 02:30:57.319 align:start position:0%
yes anything
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
else lunch okay thank you everyone we'll
 
02:31:12.349 --> 02:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:12.359 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
tomorrow
