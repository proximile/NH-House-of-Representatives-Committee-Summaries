okay the time being

you have before you or you should all
 
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
have it as an
 
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
LSR um that was put together
 
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
that basically has the revenue estimates
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
that we voted on last week and uh you'll
 
00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 align:start position:0%
see that on uh page two and Page Three
 
00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 align:start position:0%
um I uh verified that those numbers were
 
00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 align:start position:0%
what we agreed to but certainly uh I
 
00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 align:start position:0%
welcome all you guys to to check those
 
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
numbers as well um this we'll be voting
 
00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 align:start position:0%
on this to um to approve this and then
 
00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 align:start position:0%
this will go into this will be assigned
 
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
a house resolution number and um
 
00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 align:start position:0%
actually uh why don't I let uh cret give
 
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
us an update on this so as represent J
 
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
was saying that similar to an LSR that
 
00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:44.199 align:start position:0%
you might file you sign off on that LSR
 
00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
and then it goes up to the clerk and
 
00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
they clerk assigns a number to it once
 
00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 align:start position:0%
this LSR goes up to the clerk he will
 
00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520 align:start position:0%
assign a house resolution number to it
 
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
and then um include it in the calendar
 
00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
for the next meeting so you won't see it
 
00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
tomorrow at your session but you'll see
 
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 align:start position:0%
it on March
 
00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:04.600 align:start position:0%
6 and you'll um at that point I think
 
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:06.280 align:start position:0%
representative Jinan and others may
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
speak to the resolution and then um in
 
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
the past it's been tabled um once it's
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
been uh passed and spoken
 
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
to that's that's it anyone have any
 
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
or okay s yes represent elme
 
00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:35.080 align:start position:0%
I have had questions from a couple of
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
people who probably should know better
 
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
but on when we put that on the
 
00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:47.160 align:start position:0%
table it automatically goes onto the end
 
00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
of the budget correct or is there any
 
00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
law about this anywhere or it's just
 
00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 align:start position:0%
tradition uh no there's no law for that
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
basically what our office does is takes
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
what this committee agrees to Revenue
 
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
estimates and then we amend um House
 
00:07:04.749 --> 00:07:04.759 align:start position:0%
Bill one under usually the finance
 
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:07.800 align:start position:0%
chair's name uh to put the unrestricted
 
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:09.360 align:start position:0%
revenues to reflect what this committee
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
on so we we're depending on
 
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
tradition well yeah yes and I'm not
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
aware that that's going to change I mean
 
00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 align:start position:0%
that would be our recommendation to the
 
00:07:25.869 --> 00:07:25.879 align:start position:0%
finance chair I think rbson Wier would
 
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
agree with us because that's how he's
 
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
done it in the past yes exactly uh in
 
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
fact he made a comment to that effect
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
yesterday I believe in full Finance yeah
 
00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:36.879 align:start position:0%
some some people I hadn't maybe that was
 
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
after a lunch and conversation I had
 
00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
thank you and my understanding is that
 
00:07:44.469 --> 00:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
if we see some major changes on the
 
00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:46.360 align:start position:0%
upside or downside whatever the case may
 
00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
be we can propose pulling it off the
 
00:07:52.749 --> 00:07:52.759 align:start position:0%
table and introducing new estimates yeah
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely it's it The house's desire or
 
00:08:12.149 --> 00:08:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative YY would you like to
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah wrong room so I got to get
 
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.629 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah wrong room so I got to get
everything

00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
together uh I would move to that the
 
00:08:26.039 --> 00:08:27.550 align:start position:0%
together uh I would move to that the
uh

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:27.560 align:start position:0%

00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
reflect
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
that I still believe the business taxes
 
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
estimates are too high and should be
 
00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
only about in the $900 million range
 
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
that is my estimation but I do support
 
00:09:19.829 --> 00:09:19.839 align:start position:0%

00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
governor's office the estimates we just

00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
um once everyone has that he can explain
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.509 align:start position:0%
 
detail

00:12:14.509 --> 00:12:14.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.519 --> 00:12:16.910 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
just yes uh everyone has a handout now
 
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh Chris you wanted to so it's a it's a
 
00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
two-page double-sided document the first
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
page is a shows you the general fund
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
education trust fund combined it's a
 
00:13:11.189 --> 00:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
comparison what the governor's estimates
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
are to the house and ways estimates and
 
00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:14.839 align:start position:0%
then the last three columns would be the
 
00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
difference so it's house estimate minus
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
the governor's
 
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
estimate the second column in would be
 
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
the plan number for fiscal year
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
25 and you'll notice that about 2third
 
00:13:30.230 --> 00:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
of the way down you'll see see and bold
 
00:13:32.350 --> 00:13:32.360 align:start position:0%
on the left side changes to current law
 
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
so everything above that would be
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
current law to current law or Apples to
 
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:36.990 align:start position:0%
current law to current law or Apples to
Apples

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
Apples
 
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
comparison below that is the new Revenue
 
00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
that the governor is proposing um that
 
00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
we're aware of in House Bill 2 which is
 
00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:46.760 align:start position:0%
the vid video Lottery terminals in there
 
00:13:48.829 --> 00:13:48.839 align:start position:0%
you'll see the governor's proposing um
 
00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
they'll earn or collect $10 million in
 
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue in fiscal year 26 and $117
 
00:13:57.069 --> 00:13:57.079 align:start position:0%
million in
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
27 this isn't included um in the house
 
00:14:02.189 --> 00:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
estimates because the house has not
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
weighed in on this issue and has not
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
voted on it so if the house were to vote
 
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
and agree with the governor our office
 
00:14:11.749 --> 00:14:11.759 align:start position:0%
would carry the revenue projections on
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
the Surplus statement it wouldn't change
 
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
estimates and then the next two pages is
 
00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
just a breakout of the general fund and
 
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:23.320 align:start position:0%
the education trust
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
fund similar to the split paper that I
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
worksheet I provided you last week again
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
following the same format with the
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
governor's estimates the house ways and
 
00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
mean estimates and the difference um
 
00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
house minus Governors again you'll see
 
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.509 align:start position:0%
house minus Governors again you'll see
that

00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
um it's current law compared to current
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
law and then at the lower half of the
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
table you'll see changes to current law
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
the VT revenue is being split 50% to the
 
00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
general fund 50% to the education trust
 
00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:53.560 align:start position:0%
fund so you'll see that reflected on the
 
00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:56.120 align:start position:0%
first line after the changes to current
 
00:14:58.150 --> 00:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
law heading and then the next three
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
lines the business tax splits tobacco
 
00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:02.720 align:start position:0%
splits and R splits the governor is
 
00:15:04.629 --> 00:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
proposing to change the splits between
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
the general fund and the education trust
 
00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:09.320 align:start position:0%
fund for those three uh revenue streams
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
to be 66% to the general fund 34% to the
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
education trust fund so as you move
 
00:15:18.829 --> 00:15:18.839 align:start position:0%
over you can see the adjustments that
 
00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:20.839 align:start position:0%
would happen um for instance the
 
00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
business tax would have 84 and $87
 
00:15:26.629 --> 00:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
million respectively going to the
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
general fund instead of the education
 
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:30.920 align:start position:0%
trust fund in 2016 and 27 and then you
 
00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
would see a negative corresponding entry
 
00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
on the education trust fund sheet um and
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
so that's similar work for the tobacco
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
split and the r split the red is a
 
00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
little bit different in the sense that
 
00:15:46.269 --> 00:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
um typically we did a 67% to 30 uh 3%
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
split and that's why you see a negative
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
on the general fund and then a positive
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
on the education trust fund again it's
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
below the current uh below the current
 
00:15:58.269 --> 00:15:58.279 align:start position:0%
law estimates so again if the house
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't do this it goes
 
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
away and then the last page is just your
 
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
fund repres elme yeah could I ask I
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
think you said that currently we're
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
splitting education trust fund and
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
general fund 5050 I thought it was
 
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
totally different uh 5050 for the video
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
Lottery the new Revenue source is 50/50
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
currently the business tax split for the
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
general fund education trust fund is um
 
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
59 41% so 59% of the business taxes go
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
to the general fund and um 41% go to the
 
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
fund and and that's all I have unless
 
00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:54.560 align:start position:0%
there's any questions but I just wanted
 
00:16:55.829 --> 00:16:55.839 align:start position:0%
to make sure the committee had this
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
since you'll be hearing about this uh
 
00:17:00.189 --> 00:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
probably the next few days
 
00:17:00.199 --> 00:17:01.509 align:start position:0%
probably the next few days
representative

00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
opal Chris what what's currently the
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
tobacco split is that also 5941 uh
 
00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:11.079 align:start position:0%
tobacco is not uh an easy percentage to
 
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
do so right now we have to back out
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
about 17% of it which is the OTP other
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
than tobacco products because that all
 
00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
goes to the general fund and then the
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
balance is split
 
00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:26.029 align:start position:0%
balance is split
um

00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh 60 it's not 6 40 but it's close to
 
00:17:33.549 --> 00:17:33.559 align:start position:0%
6040 and then we add back the piece that
 
00:17:35.669 --> 00:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
we put the uh the other than tobacco
 
00:17:37.870 --> 00:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
products back into the general fund so
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit more complex of a a
 
00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
calculation um this would make it more
 
00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
clear as to how you're splitting those
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
funds followup but but it would reduce
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund amount by was
 
00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.120 align:start position:0%
four and a half million each year the
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
yes represent ORS thank you Mr chairman
 
00:18:05.549 --> 00:18:05.559 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question Chris
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
could you just give us those percentages
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
again I guess I'm I'm not clicking yet
 
00:18:13.590 --> 00:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
on what what's happened here so for the
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
business tax currently VT business tax
 
00:18:19.070 --> 00:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
tobacco right so the VT The Proposal is
 
00:18:20.909 --> 00:18:20.919 align:start position:0%
that 50% of that Revenue go to the
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
general fund yep 50% go to the education
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
trust fund okay and the others for the
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
business taxes 59% goes to the general
 
00:18:33.310 --> 00:18:33.320 align:start position:0%
fund currently 41% to the education
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
trust fund tobacco tobacco is not an
 
00:18:36.559 --> 00:18:37.630 align:start position:0%
trust fund tobacco tobacco is not an
even

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
even
 
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
percentage okay that's where I was just
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
discussing where we have to back out and
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
then add something back in y for reddits
 
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
we do 6733 67%
 
00:18:53.149 --> 00:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
you we all
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
set repres el me your light is on but
 
00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
now it's off okay very good thank you
 
00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:31.029 --> 00:19:31.039 align:start position:0%
okay now we will start our executive
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
session um I'll open the executive
 
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
669 and recognize representative ulery
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
for a motion I'm move
 
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
uh would you like to speak to your
 
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
but this number one we have a a separate
 
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
committee that is dealing specifically
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
with education funding um this bill as I
 
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
read it and as the committee read it
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
or at least most of the committee read
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
it would do nothing more than increase
 
00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:39.640 align:start position:0%
taxes and uh not necessarily
 
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate the uh fundes in the manner
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
in which would best Su serve our our
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
constituents and therefore I'm moving
 
00:20:52.909 --> 00:20:52.919 align:start position:0%
itl any other
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
discussion yes represent
 
00:20:58.990 --> 00:20:59.000 align:start position:0%
elme yes I do I was struck by by the
 
00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
fact that uh Dan Maguire who is on the
 
00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.190 align:start position:0%
fact that uh Dan Maguire who is on the
school

00:21:04.190 --> 00:21:04.200 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:06.600 align:start position:0%
funding um
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
program and Doug Hall who I've respected
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
for as many years as I've known him
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
which is a long time um felt that it
 
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
would be worthwhile keeping this uh oh
 
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
shoot just
 
00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
apologies um felt that it was important
 
00:21:47.269 --> 00:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
to keep this concept the pieces of the
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
concept alive
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere uh rather than just it Ling
 
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:56.440 align:start position:0%
them while the

necessary to do that in order to
 
00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:11.520 align:start position:0%

ORS would you like to speak to your
 
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
motion yes thank you Mr chairman we
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
heard testimony uh reasons to and
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
against uh raising the tax tax we derive
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
a substantial amount of
 
00:25:35.669 --> 00:25:35.679 align:start position:0%
Revenue um on the cigarette
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
tax although this has a component for
 
00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
the electronic and vape products it's my
 
00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
understanding there's a piece of
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
legislation in the other body that's
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
going to address uh some of the issues
 
00:25:52.549 --> 00:25:52.559 align:start position:0%
that we heard in testimony relative to
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh pirated issues and and taxes being
 
00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:58.750 align:start position:0%
uh uh pirated issues and and taxes being
collected

00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
collected
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
so uh seeing that you know this is part
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire Advantage keeping
 
00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
taxes low and in bringing those revenues
 
00:26:11.909 --> 00:26:11.919 align:start position:0%
in uh that's why I support the
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
else uh I see everyone pointing to
 
00:26:21.549 --> 00:26:21.559 align:start position:0%
somebody else representative Shamburg uh
 
00:26:25.269 --> 00:26:25.279 align:start position:0%
um Southworth oh stayed
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh when we heard the discussion uh
 
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham who had made
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
the presentation had listened intently
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
to what was being said about vaping and
 
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
cigarette taxes coming in under the same
 
00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
bill he had provided with to me two
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
amendments that maybe would
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
address the
 
00:27:01.149 --> 00:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
amount of Revenue that might be able to
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
go into the general fund for this year
 
00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
would 20250
 
00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:16.039 align:start position:0%
0468 H that would effective upon passage
 
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
and we're looking at a revenue deficit
 
00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
and he uh was hoping that this committee
 
00:27:27.549 --> 00:27:27.559 align:start position:0%
would at least take a look at that and
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
say okay let's we have not had an
 
00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:33.640 align:start position:0%
increase since 2013
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
a178 we have not kept up with inflation
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
it would still be the lowest tax on
 
00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
cigarettes in the surrounding states the
 
00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
other amendment that he was proposing
 
00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
was don't pass the immediate passage but
 
00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
pass the second amendment that would
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
deal with if main passes theirs which
 
00:27:58.669 --> 00:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
would be in the $3 range that the State
 
00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire would then have a bill
 
00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:04.519 align:start position:0%
here that could address raising their
 
00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
rate to
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
278 uh
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
which is going to put more Revenue into
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
um I feel that that we should at least
 
00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:21.880 align:start position:0%
try to address this uh it's not going to
 
00:28:25.110 --> 00:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
affect Massachusetts at
 
00:28:28.269 --> 00:28:28.279 align:start position:0%
$341 I think on uh uh cigarette tax
 
00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
right now uh and even at 278 they're
 
00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:33.760 align:start position:0%
still going to come across the border
 
00:28:36.110 --> 00:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
and we're going to at least put more
 
00:28:39.029 --> 00:28:39.039 align:start position:0%
Revenue in into our general
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
fund so just wanted to let you know that
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
that's out there that thought process
 
00:28:45.509 --> 00:28:45.519 align:start position:0%
was out
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
there thank you representative Spire
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
thank you I thought it was 2009 but
 
00:28:53.789 --> 00:28:53.799 align:start position:0%
maybe it was 2013 when the it was raised
 
00:28:56.509 --> 00:28:56.519 align:start position:0%
a178 and I am concerned because of
 
00:28:58.950 --> 00:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
inflation that you know the dollar 78
 
00:29:00.509 --> 00:29:00.519 align:start position:0%
then is not certainly not worth that
 
00:29:03.269 --> 00:29:03.279 align:start position:0%
today it's probably 60 C so yes it has
 
00:29:05.549 --> 00:29:05.559 align:start position:0%
gone down but we do need to I think keep
 
00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
it up with inflation because uh it's
 
00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:10.279 align:start position:0%
eroding you know overall our budget and
 
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
I am concerned about the fact that I
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
understand that the governor is planning
 
00:29:15.789 --> 00:29:15.799 align:start position:0%
on taking from the rainy day fund
 
00:29:17.509 --> 00:29:17.519 align:start position:0%
because of the deficit this year and if
 
00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:19.200 align:start position:0%
her deficit is her deficit and our
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
deficit is our deficit it's going to be
 
00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
substantially more she's going to be
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
taking from the rainy day fund and uh I
 
00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
think this helps to stem it by raising
 
00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:30.440 align:start position:0%
this uh fee to at least keep with
 
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
inflation uh yes
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
represent thank you Mr chair uh just
 
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
want to say that I was not here in body
 
00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:41.799 align:start position:0%
last week but I watched every second of
 
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
the meetings last week it was
 
00:29:45.509 --> 00:29:45.519 align:start position:0%
fascinating to watch it not be able to
 
00:29:48.509 --> 00:29:48.519 align:start position:0%
participate uh I would have preferred to
 
00:29:51.669 --> 00:29:51.679 align:start position:0%
be here uh I would like to just comment
 
00:29:54.710 --> 00:29:54.720 align:start position:0%
on representative duet's statement about
 
00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:56.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Advantage with low
 
00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
taxes and as I I uh mentioned before a
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
couple of weeks ago state taxes may be
 
00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:06.200 align:start position:0%
lower but the property taxes that our
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
constituents are concerned
 
00:30:12.669 --> 00:30:12.679 align:start position:0%
about have been brought to the attention
 
00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:15.519 align:start position:0%
not only of the Democrats here but I'm
 
00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
sure that some of you as Republicans are
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
also hearing the concerns about high
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
property taxes we are not providing a
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire advantage to our local
 
00:30:30.269 --> 00:30:30.279 align:start position:0%
property taxes by continuing to cut or
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
not increase Revenue that comes in on
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
the state level so I uh will oppose this
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
ideal represent yeah just to respond
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
briefly we we've all heard that
 
00:30:45.710 --> 00:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
messaging the problem with this
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
the clients the customer the customer
 
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
base is doing this and a lot a lot of
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
effort myself included I quit smoking so
 
00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
we we have Revenue doing this right now
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
if we jack a tax on this at a dollar a
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
pack we're going to lose what Revenue we
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
have in the state I know I made a
 
00:31:13.509 --> 00:31:13.519 align:start position:0%
promise when I ran for office that I
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
would not approve or support any new
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
taxes and I stand by
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
that the the local property tax rate is
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
dictated at the local level that should
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
be addressed at the local level
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
represent elme thank you I don't want to
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
get into a conversation about the uh
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
difficulty of towns and uh addressing
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
State problems but um I do want to
 
00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
suggest that we consider on
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative stringham's second uh
 
00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
idea which is
 
00:31:58.549 --> 00:31:58.559 align:start position:0%
to to um pass something
 
00:32:02.509 --> 00:32:02.519 align:start position:0%
now which could become automatic if
 
00:32:04.509 --> 00:32:04.519 align:start position:0%
repres Aly we're talking about an itl
 
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
motion right now yes I know on you're
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about iing it instead of
 
00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
considering uh the effectiveness of
 
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
being able to add to that tax if
 
00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.190 align:start position:0%
being able to add to that tax if
Maine

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
Maine
 
00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
uh uh decides to become uh uh to
 
00:32:31.629 --> 00:32:31.639 align:start position:0%
increase its taxes as it's been talking
 
00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:34.200 align:start position:0%
about but not
 
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.750 align:start position:0%
about but not
otherwise

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:32:39.549 --> 00:32:39.559 align:start position:0%
on inflation has taken away a huge part
 
00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:41.720 align:start position:0%
of the effectiveness of this for
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
stopping people smoking which is one
 
00:32:46.029 --> 00:32:46.039 align:start position:0%
side of the equation the other side of
 
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
the equation is that um we're losing
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
Revenue because of the inflation that's
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
been going on for quite some time now
 
00:33:02.669 --> 00:33:02.679 align:start position:0%
and this is one place that uh it it uh
 
00:33:05.549 --> 00:33:05.559 align:start position:0%
addresses two problems one of which is
 
00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
our revenues and the other of which is
 
00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
on the health of our of our citizens so
 
00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
representative Spar um with respect to
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
representative ducet uh most of our tax
 
00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:22.279 align:start position:0%
revenue comes from sources that are a
 
00:33:24.830 --> 00:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
percentage and if uh your pledge is no
 
00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:26.840 align:start position:0%
new taxes then those other ones should
 
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:29.559 align:start position:0%
not be a percentage should be a flat fee
 
00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:31.440 align:start position:0%
so we're just trying to keep this up
 
00:33:33.110 --> 00:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
with inflation at a minimum and I think
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
that makes a lot of sense because it's
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
basically continue to deescalate or at
 
00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
least decline excuse me and uh I don't
 
00:33:43.549 --> 00:33:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
perspective I mean to me representativ
 
00:33:49.389 --> 00:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
duet's um point about how less and less
 
00:33:51.310 --> 00:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
people are smoking it's interesting this
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
a higher tax could trigger um several
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
people many people to say you know what
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
I'm done now I'll quit that would be
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
part of my concern representative ulery
 
00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:04.519 align:start position:0%
and that was my concern speaking to the
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
percentage when you um increase the
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
percentage on a declining population
 
00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
then you're also decreasing the amount
 
00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
of Revenue that is being
 
00:34:18.270 --> 00:34:18.280 align:start position:0%
generated represent op U did you I would
 
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
just like and I don't think there's any
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
way to predict how many people will uh
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
stop smoking or see smoking and how much
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
that dollar an extra pack will offset
 
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
that it could be be actually more even
 
00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:30.560 align:start position:0%
with a decrease of people so that's not
 
00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
that's not easy to predict and I don't
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
think there's any way we can but uh I
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
would uh still think it's a a worthy
 
00:34:38.829 --> 00:34:38.839 align:start position:0%
goal to at least keep it with where it
 
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
was at a178 back in 2009 which would be
 
00:34:44.790 --> 00:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
substantially more than what it is
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
representative opal well like
 
00:34:48.829 --> 00:34:48.839 align:start position:0%
representative du said I'm a former
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
smoker um and I'm assuming my colleague
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
um is glad that he made that decision um
 
00:35:00.310 --> 00:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
as I I think most people should maybe
 
00:35:04.349 --> 00:35:04.359 align:start position:0%
all people should um uh two points
 
00:35:06.990 --> 00:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
though one specific to the revenue
 
00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:08.440 align:start position:0%
argument which is that we have an
 
00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:10.599 align:start position:0%
estimate uh on the fiscal note saying
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
that this will generate uh 87 and a half
 
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars if I'm reading the table
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
correctly in in um in each year of the
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
bium I believe so at least through the
 
00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:25.079 align:start position:0%
next two years next two fiscal years
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
there should be an increase um
 
00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
concurrently with that though um and I
 
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
know it's not necessarily A purview of
 
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
this committee it's more appropriate in
 
00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
finance but any decline in
 
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
smoking um is going to have uh a a
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
similar decline in the cost of health
 
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:48.280 align:start position:0%
care for those for those
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
individuals um and you know I think I
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
think that's just you know that's going
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
to that's going to have an impact on the
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
state's budget as well well on on the on
 
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
the expenditure side thank you Mr okay
 
00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:04.560 align:start position:0%
one more one more representative do yeah
 
00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:06.640 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to belabor it and I
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate it but as as an
 
00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
ex-smoker um to me adding a dollar per
 
00:36:15.750 --> 00:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
pack would kill the market kill our
 
00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
see simple economics if I smoke and
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
choose to continue to
 
00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
smoke is it worth me spending $8 in gas
 
00:36:30.870 --> 00:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
to come up to New Hampshire to buy my
 
00:36:33.069 --> 00:36:33.079 align:start position:0%
cotton of cigarettes I'll stay in
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%

whether or not the EFA is taxable to
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
as this the issue hasn't been a problem
 
00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:14.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry uh R Murphy I didn't get a
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
second um do I have a second on this
 
00:39:19.430 --> 00:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
representative sod second it you may
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
sorry um so only an individual family
 
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
can determine whether or not an EFA is
 
00:39:28.190 --> 00:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
taxable to them or not based on their
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
individual tax situation not the state
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
through broad legislation of this and
 
00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
that's usually in consultation with a
 
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
tax professional this issue hasn't been
 
00:39:38.309 --> 00:39:38.319 align:start position:0%
a problem yet because efas currently
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
restrict the program to low-income
 
00:39:43.430 --> 00:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
families who typically um you know file
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
very basic tax returns where they're not
 
00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
itemizing or in some cases don't pay any
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
taxes at all I'm concerned that the bill
 
00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
as it currently is written might result
 
00:39:55.230 --> 00:39:55.240 align:start position:0%
in unintended consequences and so I feel
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
it's in expedient to legislate thank you
 
00:39:57.359 --> 00:39:58.190 align:start position:0%
it's in expedient to legislate thank you
than

00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
00:40:03.750 --> 00:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
elme thank you uh I sent you but I
 
00:40:08.309 --> 00:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
didn't get anything back on a proposal
 
00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:12.160 align:start position:0%
to amend this and to amend it in a way
 
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
inform uh the people that have
 
00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
EFA that they are immune from New
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxes but uh may be subject to
 
00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
Federal taxation I think that that cures
 
00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
bill uh it it would replace the the
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
sentence that we all agree is is
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
misleading but it would um would allow
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:40:54.270 --> 00:40:54.280 align:start position:0%
um the state to avoid any liability from
 
00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:56.480 align:start position:0%
telling people that they are immune from
 
00:40:58.230 --> 00:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
all taxes
 
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
uh which is what we do now uh and it
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
would be an extremely simple fix so I
 
00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
would just like to put that out into the
 
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:11.960 align:start position:0%
conversation since we haven't had a
 
00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
conversation together yet so thank you
 
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.510 align:start position:0%
conversation together yet so thank you
any

00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
other comments representative Southworth
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
um just briefly I did have a chance and
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
I sent it to some um to get the handbook
 
00:41:28.230 --> 00:41:28.240 align:start position:0%
for the efas and if you haven't seen it
 
00:41:30.030 --> 00:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
it's really interesting it's very
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
detailed very well organized handbook
 
00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
but it has a clear list especially for
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers what they can and cannot
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
use their wallet money for and that list
 
00:41:43.950 --> 00:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
does not match up with a list of what is
 
00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
taxable so it's pretty easy if you put
 
00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:48.800 align:start position:0%
up the two lists to see that there are
 
00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:50.440 align:start position:0%
things on their list that you can
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
definitely get with your EFA homeschool
 
00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
money that are definitely taxable so I
 
00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:58.280 align:start position:0%
do think um looking to the Future it
 
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
would be possible or preferable to look
 
00:42:03.550 --> 00:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
into this a little bit longer and one
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
thing that's been reported you cannot
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
use efas um for theme parks because I've
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%

00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%

would you like to speak to your motion
representative

00:44:59.349 --> 00:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
tney this is a very short
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
Bill uh the main uh part of this one is
 
00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
that the scholarship organization that
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
handles uh the EFA accounts uh is to be
 
00:45:17.069 --> 00:45:17.079 align:start position:0%
incorporated in this state it is not
 
00:45:18.630 --> 00:45:18.640 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in this state it's
 
00:45:21.309 --> 00:45:21.319 align:start position:0%
Incorporated in the state of New York
 
00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:23.960 align:start position:0%
and by saying it has to be done here I
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
believe it would be in violation of the
 
00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
US Constitution
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause and that's why I made
 
00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:32.030 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause and that's why I made
the

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:34.440 align:start position:0%

00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you I uh passed out to
 
00:45:40.990 --> 00:45:41.000 align:start position:0%
everybody something that is rather
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
difficult to read it is from the 10 the
 
00:45:51.630 --> 00:45:51.640 align:start position:0%
uh 990 for the new New York State on on
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
what do they call it
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:01.390 --> 00:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
family children's Children's scholarship
 
00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:06.839 align:start position:0%
fund that's it on the only piece of it
 
00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
that I could find at any rate that has
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
anything to do with uh our program is
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%

00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%

inform them about the EFA program and
 
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
and then it says that during fiscal year
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%

00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
um that sounds like a
 
00:47:39.390 --> 00:47:39.400 align:start position:0%
contract rather than that we
 
00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.309 align:start position:0%
contract rather than that we
are

00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
program isn't part of an incorporation
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
anywhere and I would like us
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
to look a little further into this
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:15.670 --> 00:48:15.680 align:start position:0%
correct so I would like I would not want
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
to kill this bill I would like to retain
 
00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:20.839 align:start position:0%
it represent
 
00:48:20.839 --> 00:48:22.630 align:start position:0%
it represent
opal

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
opal
 
00:48:25.470 --> 00:48:25.480 align:start position:0%
um based on what I was reading about the
 
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
um the governor's budget presid
 
00:48:28.349 --> 00:48:28.359 align:start position:0%
presentation I thought this piece of
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
legislation was in keeping with her
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
um desire to try and uh Target outof
 
00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.270 align:start position:0%
um desire to try and uh Target outof
State

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
contractors um and so it seemed like
 
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
this might be in keeping with that
 
00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.750 align:start position:0%
this might be in keeping with that
initiative

00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.950 --> 00:48:47.960 align:start position:0%

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
motion the motion would be retained
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
motion would be retain I'm not sure if
 
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
we're allowed to say retain in which
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%

representative Smith knows the answer
 
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
yeah retain is a committee function not
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
a committee report so that's not not
 
00:50:55.349 --> 00:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate okay thank you that makes
 
00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:57.280 align:start position:0%
sense all right all right I'm going to
 
00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:00.720 align:start position:0%
open the executive session on HB
 
00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:06.040 align:start position:0%
503 and recognize representative ORS for
 
00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:09.160 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman I make the
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
motion to itl this legislation HB 503 F
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
second representative do set seconds
 
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
it would you like to speak to your
 
00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
motion representative ORS yes Mr
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
so this legislation amends how tax
 
00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
revenues are allocated to both the
 
00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:36.640 align:start position:0%
general trust fund and the education
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
trust fund and it increases many
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
taxes uh and tax rates business profits
 
00:51:46.950 --> 00:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
tax business Enterprise tax meals and
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
rooms and reestablishes the indd
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
tax what's amazing to me also is that
 
00:51:56.910 --> 00:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
the other party ran on a position of no
 
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
new taxes I would quote Joyce Craig many
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
times but in the interest of time I will
 
00:52:06.190 --> 00:52:06.200 align:start position:0%
not however it's obvious uh that
 
00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:08.799 align:start position:0%
somebody didn't get the message because
 
00:52:11.589 --> 00:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
all we have here are many tax
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
increases versus what was actually
 
00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
pledged uh all these new
 
00:52:22.789 --> 00:52:22.799 align:start position:0%
taxes uh the intent is on some of these
 
00:52:26.789 --> 00:52:26.799 align:start position:0%
of course is also to reduce the funds
 
00:52:29.789 --> 00:52:29.799 align:start position:0%
the revenues to the general fund which
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
again is surprising to me when I've
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
heard a lot of angst about there's not
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
going to be enough money for the general
 
00:52:39.309 --> 00:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
fund which I personally believe we are
 
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
going to be just fine so therefore I am
 
00:52:45.309 --> 00:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
uh again I am recommending itl on this
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you and I think
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
representative schenberg has something
 
00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
to say could you tell that by the way I
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
was pushing the button before he
 
00:52:54.270 --> 00:52:54.280 align:start position:0%
finished you were you were very anxious
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
there thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:52:58.670 --> 00:52:58.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
503 uh would redirect over $700 million
 
00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:05.960 align:start position:0%
back to the state coffers by
 
00:53:09.069 --> 00:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
2027 as uh stated by the state director
 
00:53:12.349 --> 00:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
of national Federation of Independent
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
Business uh and it comes back to the uh
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
State because of the tax cuts that have
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
been going on since
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
2015 it's a bill designed
 
00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
to go raise the present tax
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
rates back to their original number like
 
00:53:38.750 --> 00:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
the BPT from 7.5 it's at now to
 
00:53:44.589 --> 00:53:44.599 align:start position:0%
8.5 the 0.5 on B to
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
75 uh the meals and rooms from 8.5 to 9
 
00:53:53.270 --> 00:53:53.280 align:start position:0%
and the newly named recommendation at
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
the Dr told me to change the interest
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
and dividend to something else so I
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
Chang it to Market distribution Revenue
 
00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
all 5% of that uh the additional
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
percentage that would be added on would
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
strictly go back into the education
 
00:54:12.789 --> 00:54:12.799 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
and I feel that it would help address
 
00:54:20.069 --> 00:54:20.079 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that we've had about
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
funding and property tax
 
00:54:27.789 --> 00:54:27.799 align:start position:0%
relief um our present public policy on
 
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
funding public education and property
 
00:54:33.630 --> 00:54:33.640 align:start position:0%
tax relief I
 
00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.510 align:start position:0%
tax relief I
think

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
exacerbates what is going on by doing
 
00:54:40.549 --> 00:54:40.559 align:start position:0%
this I think we
 
00:54:44.109 --> 00:54:44.119 align:start position:0%
mitigate a crisis
 
00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
so I feel
 
00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:49.160 align:start position:0%
that this is something that would help
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
address uh our budget
 
00:54:55.030 --> 00:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
and my colleague down here to the right
 
00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:57.510 align:start position:0%
and my colleague down here to the right
uh

00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
it does not reduce the general fund of
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
presently what is going to come into
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
it the all the percentage increases put
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
the money into the education trust
 
00:55:13.309 --> 00:55:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.069 --> 00:55:17.079 align:start position:0%
chairman I just I just would I I can't
 
00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
um I know how my constituents would
 
00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
react to all these tax increases how do
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
you feel like your constituents would
 
00:55:26.109 --> 00:55:26.119 align:start position:0%
react to knowing that there's so many
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
tax tax increases on the table when
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
people are struggling right
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
now people are uh these taxes other than
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
the meals and rooms these taxes are not
 
00:55:41.870 --> 00:55:41.880 align:start position:0%
affecting the everyday
 
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.470 align:start position:0%
affecting the everyday
homeowner

00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
homeowner
 
00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
or or property owner these would help
 
00:55:51.630 --> 00:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
adjust bring their property taxes down I
 
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
don't have many constituents that
 
00:55:59.309 --> 00:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
own uh uh uh the the big businesses that
 
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:01.480 align:start position:0%
are missing out paying on this paying
 
00:56:04.789 --> 00:56:04.799 align:start position:0%
into supporting the market supporting
 
00:56:04.799 --> 00:56:06.029 align:start position:0%
into supporting the market supporting
our

00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:06.039 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:56:06.039 --> 00:56:08.990 align:start position:0%
our
infrastructure

00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
00:56:13.150 --> 00:56:13.160 align:start position:0%
uh I I do not believe that the folks of
 
00:56:14.589 --> 00:56:14.599 align:start position:0%
wilmet and
 
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
Sutton would say you're raising it on a
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
multinational business by a percent it's
 
00:56:23.029 --> 00:56:23.039 align:start position:0%
going to go into the education trust
 
00:56:25.069 --> 00:56:25.079 align:start position:0%
fund which then is going to be able to
 
00:56:28.270 --> 00:56:28.280 align:start position:0%
use for funding for public education and
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
reduce my property taxes I I don't see
 
00:56:34.829 --> 00:56:34.839 align:start position:0%
that coming across from my
 
00:56:36.750 --> 00:56:36.760 align:start position:0%
constituents well the thing that would
 
00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
concern me I have a lot of in Salem and
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
I'm sure in Wilmont too there's a lot of
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
small businesses who have llc's who
 
00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:46.240 align:start position:0%
would be subject to these taxes as
 
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
well uh representative ORS thank you
 
00:56:52.349 --> 00:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
again Mr chairman having anticipated my
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleagues remarks I saved the
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
best for last
 
00:56:59.549 --> 00:56:59.559 align:start position:0%
and that we have seen repeatedly over
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
the years as we have cut the BPT tax the
 
00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:07.880 align:start position:0%
BET tax etc etc that our revenues have
 
00:57:10.990 --> 00:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
gone up so much for so that in the case
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
of educational trust fund those monies
 
00:57:17.029 --> 00:57:17.039 align:start position:0%
going in increase from 25% of that fund
 
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
to 39% which we have seen in the
 
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
presentations that were provided to us
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
earlier in the year and therefore I
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
totally disagree that we would increase
 
00:57:31.510 --> 00:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
the general fund with new taxes this
 
00:57:33.910 --> 00:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
money is not going to flow in this money
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
is going to be walking away again as
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
we've cut the tax we've increased the
 
00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:42.520 align:start position:0%
revenue and just like the tobacco taxes
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
and so on that are uh so ra outrageously
 
00:57:47.910 --> 00:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
high as presented I mean this whole idea
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
is going up in smoke thank
 
00:57:54.270 --> 00:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
you representative shamur hopefully I've
 
00:57:56.789 --> 00:57:56.799 align:start position:0%
got the best one at the end here to
 
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm not done
 
00:58:04.069 --> 00:58:04.079 align:start position:0%
yet uh there is no proven theory that
 
00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:07.760 align:start position:0%
when you cut the tax rate that revenues
 
00:58:10.589 --> 00:58:10.599 align:start position:0%
increase that has been demonstrated by
 
00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
the uh budget uh that comes out of
 
00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.990 align:start position:0%
the uh budget uh that comes out of
Washington

00:58:15.990 --> 00:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
Washington
 
00:58:19.549 --> 00:58:19.559 align:start position:0%
DC uh it seems when you cut
 
00:58:21.750 --> 00:58:21.760 align:start position:0%
Revenue deficits
 
00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:25.400 align:start position:0%
increase when you have a proper tax
 
00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:27.039 align:start position:0%
system set up
 
00:58:31.190 --> 00:58:31.200 align:start position:0%
up revenues come in and you have to you
 
00:58:34.349 --> 00:58:34.359 align:start position:0%
you will have less deficit because you
 
00:58:36.870 --> 00:58:36.880 align:start position:0%
don't have to borrow as much
 
00:58:40.109 --> 00:58:40.119 align:start position:0%
money represent
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you and I believe on that the
 
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
representative has
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
uh has many good and important things to
 
00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
say in this
 
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
bill but
 
00:59:04.069 --> 00:59:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh these taxes have been around for a
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
long time and
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
they should not be going
 
00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
back in the same way that they were
 
00:59:19.630 --> 00:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
there before uh if uh the legislature
 
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
lived up to the fact that we need the
 
00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:27.000 align:start position:0%
same amount of Revenue
 
00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:30.760 align:start position:0%
adjusted for inflation that we had back
 
00:59:33.309 --> 00:59:33.319 align:start position:0%
10 years ago when the taxes started to
 
00:59:33.319 --> 00:59:34.430 align:start position:0%
10 years ago when the taxes started to
be

00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
cut um there this is a long-term project
 
00:59:42.349 --> 00:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
it's not something that uh obviously
 
00:59:44.349 --> 00:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
that could happen
 
00:59:47.710 --> 00:59:47.720 align:start position:0%
today and the idea that it would all go
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund when the
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
general fund does enormous work needed
 
00:59:58.270 --> 00:59:58.280 align:start position:0%
to keep the this state together and to
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
keep families together and to keep
 
01:00:00.319 --> 01:00:01.309 align:start position:0%
keep families together and to keep
people

01:00:01.309 --> 01:00:01.319 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
healthy um is
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
um is difficult so I will be voting no
 
01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:11.829 align:start position:0%
um is difficult so I will be voting no
on

01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:00:17.549 --> 01:00:17.559 align:start position:0%
this and uh see how everyone else goes
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you represent ORS thank
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
you again Mr chairman so once again my
 
01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:26.680 align:start position:0%
esteemed colleague to my left
 
01:00:28.829 --> 01:00:28.839 align:start position:0%
uh mentioned how when we cut taxes in
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
Washington DC the uh things don't go the
 
01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
way they seem they should go well
 
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
there's a good reason for that a two
 
01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
things one we're not talking about
 
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
Washington DC we're talking about facts
 
01:00:41.950 --> 01:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
provided by the state of New Hampshire
 
01:00:44.589 --> 01:00:44.599 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire and as the tax
 
01:00:47.069 --> 01:00:47.079 align:start position:0%
revenues the tax rates have
 
01:00:51.069 --> 01:00:51.079 align:start position:0%
increased have been cut the revenues
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
increase the other thing I like to say
 
01:00:55.029 --> 01:00:55.039 align:start position:0%
is the reason we don't see cost
 
01:00:58.270 --> 01:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
expenditures going down in Washington DC
 
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:00.280 align:start position:0%
is because of all the waste Fraud and
 
01:01:02.710 --> 01:01:02.720 align:start position:0%
Abuse that dogee has uncovered like
 
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars going for condoms
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
and stuff like that for the terrorists
 
01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
you represent El me thank you we have a
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
very strong narrative now on
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
that has been backed up with facts that
 
01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
shows that when we increased the revenu
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
when we decreased the revenues was after
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
when we got the stimulus money that is
 
01:01:44.309 --> 01:01:44.319 align:start position:0%
various different kinds of stimulus
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
money the first one was tax cuts and
 
01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:48.630 align:start position:0%
money the first one was tax cuts and
jobs

01:01:48.630 --> 01:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
jobs
 
01:01:51.870 --> 01:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
act the time before that was just New
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire caping catching up with every
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
other state because it takes is longer
 
01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
than it takes any other state to uh to
 
01:02:05.109 --> 01:02:05.119 align:start position:0%
get get to where our revenues are where
 
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
they were before the Great
 
01:02:07.799 --> 01:02:09.349 align:start position:0%
they were before the Great
Recession

01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
Recession
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh that was the burst we had in
 
01:02:15.990 --> 01:02:16.000 align:start position:0%
16 uh I'm not going to go on further
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
about that but in each case on we cut
 
01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
the taxes just about the same time that
 
01:02:28.589 --> 01:02:28.599 align:start position:0%
the revenue was being formed already
 
01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:31.400 align:start position:0%
that went into our taxes the year or two
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
after that's the way our tax system
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
works uh
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
so what would happen if we did a bad tax
 
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
reform what would happen if we did a
 
01:02:48.789 --> 01:02:48.799 align:start position:0%
good tax reform is something that we may
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
discover someday but we will find we
 
01:02:54.029 --> 01:02:54.039 align:start position:0%
will uh it has nothing to do with
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
whether uh
 
01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
whether the idea itself is important for
 
01:03:05.829 --> 01:03:05.839 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire or not thank
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
you um I just want to take one more
 
01:03:10.829 --> 01:03:10.839 align:start position:0%
because I think we can see where this is
 
01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
headed uh representative elberger had
 
01:03:14.789 --> 01:03:14.799 align:start position:0%
her hand up
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
first thank you Mr chair and I I I'm not
 
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
sure that the conversation has really
 
01:03:22.430 --> 01:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
changed anyone's mind to be fair uh I
 
01:03:27.069 --> 01:03:27.079 align:start position:0%
will point out um three things one is
 
01:03:29.470 --> 01:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
that to the best of my knowledge
 
01:03:32.029 --> 01:03:32.039 align:start position:0%
property taxes have gone up somewhere in
 
01:03:36.549 --> 01:03:36.559 align:start position:0%
the 35 to 38% rate in the Statewide over
 
01:03:38.309 --> 01:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
the last few
 
01:03:42.910 --> 01:03:42.920 align:start position:0%
years whatever property decreases have
 
01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:46.480 align:start position:0%
happened on the state level property
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
taxes have gone up the response of well
 
01:03:50.829 --> 01:03:50.839 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
local uh decision making and people
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
should just want Less in their
 
01:04:01.870 --> 01:04:01.880 align:start position:0%
communities um well education
 
01:04:04.670 --> 01:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
firefighters police officers getting our
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
roads plowed in the
 
01:04:09.309 --> 01:04:09.319 align:start position:0%
winter this year particularly all of
 
01:04:11.470 --> 01:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
those things come out of local property
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
taxes the addition
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
of the costs being downshifted has been
 
01:04:19.789 --> 01:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
really damaging so that's number one
 
01:04:21.510 --> 01:04:21.520 align:start position:0%
number two and I I may have mentioned
 
01:04:24.150 --> 01:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
this before um my husband and I like
 
01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
going out to diners and we particularly
 
01:04:31.029 --> 01:04:31.039 align:start position:0%
enjoy su's in uh Hudson uh which is in
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
representative 's district I was talking
 
01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
to a waitress there and asking her
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
if the uh meals tax were to drop how she
 
01:04:44.789 --> 01:04:44.799 align:start position:0%
would feel about that she said she'd
 
01:04:47.069 --> 01:04:47.079 align:start position:0%
like that because sometimes she goes out
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
to eat I said if you had to choose
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
between the meal tax going down and your
 
01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:54.279 align:start position:0%
property taxes going down which would
 
01:04:57.109 --> 01:04:57.119 align:start position:0%
you prefer no question in her mind she
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
would rather have her property taxes
 
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
down and lastly one of the things that
 
01:05:05.309 --> 01:05:05.319 align:start position:0%
I've learned is that saying that we are
 
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
going to continue to do things just
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%

one oh I see if it's itl it can go on
 
01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
cons right so there's no allocation
 
01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:25.719 align:start position:0%

01:14:06.550 --> 01:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
it would you like to speak to your
 
01:14:11.790 --> 01:14:11.800 align:start position:0%
motion again if if the commission
 
01:14:13.910 --> 01:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
chooses to do so this is an issue that
 
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
can be brought
 
01:14:19.590 --> 01:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
up with uh with that commission
 
01:14:23.430 --> 01:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
um personally I I think it it singles
 
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
out a a specific
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
entity for an exorbitant
 
01:14:32.669 --> 01:14:32.679 align:start position:0%
tax which can you know it talks about a
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
th000 machines you know they can put in
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
999 machines this this is something that
 
01:14:41.629 --> 01:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
although I may or may not agree
 
01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
with the spirit of this I think it's
 
01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
something that should be addressed at
 
01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
the upcoming
 
01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
other thoughts comments
 
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
representative ORS did you why your
 
01:14:59.350 --> 01:14:59.360 align:start position:0%
light is on I don't know if that's by
 
01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
accident representa
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
elberger I uh thank you Mr chair I find
 
01:15:06.550 --> 01:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
myself in agreement with representative
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
ducet here and hoping that uh when the
 
01:15:12.790 --> 01:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
commission takes a look at it they can
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
look at graduated levels of machines you
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
know this range and this range and this
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
range thank you thank you represent
 
01:15:25.709 --> 01:15:25.719 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you um that's about where I am
 
01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
and this
 
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
is rather more money I think for uh
 
01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
than than we should be asking for from a
 
01:15:42.629 --> 01:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
large casino but uh we do have large
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
casinos now instead of one large casino
 
01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
that we were fighting about and
 
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
everybody objected to first uh and um
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
they are getting away with a lot more
 
01:15:56.159 --> 01:15:57.510 align:start position:0%
they are getting away with a lot more
money

01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
than than um
 
01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
is is
 
01:16:06.310 --> 01:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
available uh on the southern side of our
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
border for
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
instance uh so um we're I'm I'm voting
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
itl also but but I just wanted to say
 
01:16:20.870 --> 01:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
that representative opal Mr chairman I I
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
just have a question honestly um
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
representative duet I think correctly
 
01:16:26.629 --> 01:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
has ident identified a myriad of
 
01:16:30.750 --> 01:16:30.760 align:start position:0%
questions that hopefully the uh the
 
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
newly formed when it gets approved will
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
address but I'm wondering if the house
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
or this legislature has the ability to
 
01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
provide any guidance to that Commission
 
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of questions that we would like
 
01:16:46.510 --> 01:16:46.520 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
addressed well go ahead repr thank you
 
01:16:52.229 --> 01:16:52.239 align:start position:0%

to come back on Friday um I know many of
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
you are
 
01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
disappointed um and uh extra 50 bucks
 
01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:38.440 align:start position:0%
next week uh next week um there's no
 
01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
house session as you all should know and
 
01:20:43.629 --> 01:20:43.639 align:start position:0%
I also am not scheduling any uh meetings
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
next week as well so uh the next meeting
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
will probably Monday um whatever the
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
first Monday in March Monday and Tuesday
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
potentially in March uh will be and
 
01:20:56.189 --> 01:20:56.199 align:start position:0%
that'll be out and um not this current
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
calendar probably the next
 
01:21:00.510 --> 01:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
calendar question not
 
01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
Wednesday no I don't think we need to
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
meet we're after today we basically uh
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
if my count is uh correct we only have
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
eight bills left after this so with
 
01:21:13.229 --> 01:21:13.239 align:start position:0%
eight bills left all our early bills are
 
01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
done um and we have till March 20th to
 
01:21:19.270 --> 01:21:19.280 align:start position:0%
get the last eight bills out our Revenue
 
01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
estimates are done uh so we're in good
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
shape um so two two meetings the first
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
can March at the most at this point uh
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
yes represent opal is it is it the
 
01:21:32.629 --> 01:21:32.639 align:start position:0%
chair's intent to maintain just for
 
01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
planning purposes will we will we be
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
planning on Monday Tuesday the rest of
 
01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:40.520 align:start position:0%
the month through the through the 20
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
it's the 20th probably now we may not
 
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
need every Monday and Tuesday um and if
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
we only need one day um I may try to
 
01:21:50.430 --> 01:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
default to
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays uh because I know a lot of
 
01:21:55.830 --> 01:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
people try to make a point s2i on
 
01:21:58.990 --> 01:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
Mondays and Fridays um
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
so yes it'll be it'll be Monday Andor
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
Tuesday but probably Tuesday if only one
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
day but but first week of March Monday
 
01:22:10.830 --> 01:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
and Tuesday um unfortunately I don't
