00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
my study in hampstead
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm alone and unfortunately i'm
 
00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.390 align:start position:0%
and i'm alone and unfortunately i'm
douglas

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:05.840 align:start position:0%
and that completes the roll call
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
so christina what do you have for us
 
00:08:11.830 --> 00:08:11.840 align:start position:0%
well i just wanted to introduce myself
 
00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.790 align:start position:0%
well i just wanted to introduce myself
to

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
folks on the committee i'll be your
 
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:16.400 align:start position:0%
researcher i know
 
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
representative pearson asked asked me to
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
give a little overview of what it is
 
00:08:19.599 --> 00:08:20.309 align:start position:0%
give a little overview of what it is
that

00:08:20.309 --> 00:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
that i do i believe house community
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
services will be giving a more formal
 
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
presentation about everything that they
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
do at a later date
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
but my main tasks i can actually
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
put something up for you to take a quick
 
00:08:35.599 --> 00:08:37.509 align:start position:0%
put something up for you to take a quick
look

00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
look
 
00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
so this is sort of an overview of what
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
committee research services does
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
so any research requests that you might
 
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:46.800 align:start position:0%
have about bills that do come in
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
you can certainly ask for but they must
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
be coordinated through the chair and
 
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
vice chair
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
so this could include any historical
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
comparative data
 
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
um research like any subject matter
 
00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
legislative history
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
um several comparisons um side by sides
 
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh for senate bills um and then some
 
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.269 align:start position:0%
uh for senate bills um and then some
tracking

00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
tracking
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
um you know i work hard to
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's some sort of
 
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
smooth workflow and i try to attend all
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
meetings and subcommittee work sessions
 
00:09:17.829 --> 00:09:17.839 align:start position:0%
to make sure everything flows smoothly
 
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
um as you'll as you'll note you'll be
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
completing minority majority reports i
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
will also be proofing and editing those
 
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that those are
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
um look good when they come out in the
 
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
calendar during your your sessions
 
00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:34.839 align:start position:0%
um and you know i also serve as a guide
 
00:09:34.839 --> 00:09:36.230 align:start position:0%
um and you know i also serve as a guide
for

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
procedure if you have questions on that
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
my email is i think you all have it now
 
00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.110 align:start position:0%
my email is i think you all have it now
i

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
emailed you multiple times but that's
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
in a nutshell what i'm doing it's also
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
important that i like to note that i
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
am that our office is uh non-partisan
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
so all of the information that comes is
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
for both parties
 
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
um and comes in and is an attempt to be
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
a brief overview of the materials
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
that can help you in your analysis of
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
the bills
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
and if there's any questions please let
 
00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:10.240 align:start position:0%
me know
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
would you explain just in case any of
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
the new members
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
don't know what a side-by-side is
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
and how helpful it is absolutely um so a
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
side by side
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
might be for example a previous bill
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
there are certain versions an amendment
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
that might have come through
 
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
it would be quite literally a side by
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
side of
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
each of those amendments next to each
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
other and any of the changes
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
that might have happened through the
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
text i would highlight those changes
 
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
and the certain the outcome of those
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
particular changes
 
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
that can also be used when we go to
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
committee of conference in senate
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
for senate bills so you can take a look
 
00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:54.399 align:start position:0%
at what the senate version looks like
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
and what the
 
00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:57.360 align:start position:0%
house version looks like and that should
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
help you
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
kind of parse through the data to figure
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
out what the differences are
 
00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
we will be getting some uh
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
redos or refilings of builds that we've
 
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:08.949 align:start position:0%
redos or refilings of builds that we've
seen

00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
before partially because they didn't
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
pass last time
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
and the sponsor wants to try it again
 
00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:16.150 align:start position:0%
and the sponsor wants to try it again
sometimes

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:16.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
because the bills got to the senate and
 
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959 align:start position:0%
they didn't get attached to anything so
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
they died on the table and we're back
 
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.670 align:start position:0%
they died on the table and we're back
again

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
in some cases the bills will be the same
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
as we saw last time or the time before
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
but i know with a couple of my bills i
 
00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
took the occasion
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
to make some slight changes would it be
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
possible for us to request side by sides
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
with one side being last time and the
 
00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
other side being this time
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
you could certainly do that i do like to
 
00:11:49.829 --> 00:11:49.839 align:start position:0%
note that i am staffing five committees
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
at the moment um so um certainly happy
 
00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
to help as much as possible i do also
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
have all the bill files
 
00:11:59.190 --> 00:11:59.200 align:start position:0%
from last session so if you're looking
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
at bills that have already gone through
 
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
a public hearing that died on the table
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
because of our session
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
last um last spring i can also take all
 
00:12:09.269 --> 00:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
of that testimony and
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
you could take a look at the bill file
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
as it exists um
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
from last time so we want to be kind to
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
you and do it
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
only when we really think it's necessary
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
and not just because we like to generate
 
00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.590 align:start position:0%
and not just because we like to generate
work

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that okay
 
00:12:28.069 --> 00:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
um what now of the
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
secretary that used to be in the
 
00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
committee office
 
00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
and the various things she did i know
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
when i was clerk there are numbers of
 
00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:35.829 align:start position:0%
when i was clerk there are numbers of
things

00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
where she and i would have to meet and
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
i recalled that the various chairs
 
00:12:46.389 --> 00:12:46.399 align:start position:0%
did similar since we're not there and
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
sure and i read that the offices
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
committee offices are not
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
open uh what of
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
uh some of the things we used to do with
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
her now go to you or what
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
so uh your committee assistant this year
 
00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.120 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh take a look it's going to be lindsey
 
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.190 align:start position:0%
uh take a look it's going to be lindsey
forcier

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
forcier
 
00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh and so you know she would be working
 
00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
on electronic amendments and they're
 
00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
we're working on getting an electronic
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
bill file together
 
00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:16.840 align:start position:0%
um and then so any um
 
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:18.790 align:start position:0%
um and then so any um
[Music]

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
any i.t issues that you might be having
 
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:21.829 align:start position:0%
any i.t issues that you might be having
any

00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
um well typically copying
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
you know that sort of thing um providing
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
up those
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
paper copies that again is
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
being worked out as of right now the
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
fourth floor is completely closed
 
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
um so uh there will be there won't be
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
any contact if there's something that
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
you need
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
from from us or from the clerical staff
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
then you can call
 
00:13:48.230 --> 00:13:48.240 align:start position:0%
271 3600
 
00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
and make your request there um for those
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
of you who may actually go in purpose
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
in person excuse me if there's something
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
that you need um
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
we request that you give us some notice
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
and you call up to the the fourth floor
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
at 3600
 
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
let them know that you need something
 
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
and then we'll filter it down that way
 
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
will we go up to get it or will it be
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
there on
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
the table in the double wide committee
 
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:12.949 align:start position:0%
the table in the double wide committee
room

00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
it would be downstairs on the table so
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
the goal is to limit
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
exposure um and anything that's
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
requested would be
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
in the committee room available to you
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
that those of us who may not have an
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
immediate printer
 
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:29.440 align:start position:0%
availability should look into that i
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
have one at my office office
 
00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
but i don't have a working one at my
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
home office but i just put that on my
 
00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:35.990 align:start position:0%
home office but i just put that on my
to-do

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
to-do
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
list because if we ask for something you
 
00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.680 align:start position:0%
might send us a link and we'd have to
 
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:43.519 align:start position:0%
print it out
 
00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%

thirty six hundred because i know
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of phones are not being answered
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
as people are not working there is that
 
00:14:54.629 --> 00:14:54.639 align:start position:0%
one that people actually answer during
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:56.880 align:start position:0%

pharmacist
 
00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
in several different arenas the last one
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
was at mary hitchcock memorial hospital
 
00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:34.640 align:start position:0%
known as dartmouth hitchcock medical
 
00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.750 align:start position:0%
known as dartmouth hitchcock medical

committee is that i think it fits very
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
well with my
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%

expertise in my background in pharmacy
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%

and i wound up moving up to new
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire in 1994 where i was a
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
worked in high tech and i was i was in a

a lot of them medical related so that's
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
why i started gaining
 
00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
medical knowledge and then i was an i.t
 
00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
director for
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
a busy medical firm for many years uh
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
which gave me the
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
the knowledge of insurance billing and
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
the how the systems work in the
 
00:27:18.149 --> 00:27:18.159 align:start position:0%

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
have a lot of
 
00:27:23.990 --> 00:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
background in that which gives you a
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
good basis to move forward but in
 
00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:26.070 align:start position:0%
good basis to move forward but in
general

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
my reason for being here
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
is to represent
 
00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
the the um working parents that's
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
something that
 
00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
that um got me elected here in my town i
 
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
won by almost two-thirds
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
boat and got out spent 30 to one um but
 
00:27:45.909 --> 00:27:45.919 align:start position:0%
i i focus on
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
representing working parents and also um
 
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:51.760 align:start position:0%

00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
of topics
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh related to mental health and work
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
very closely with that but i also just
 
00:44:08.309 --> 00:44:08.319 align:start position:0%
in healthcare in general it's
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%

00:44:31.829 --> 00:44:31.839 align:start position:0%
started a group called the bipartisan
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
mental health caucus
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
the purpose was to move ahead the
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
10-year mental health plan that was
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
put forward in 2008 in the hope that we
 
00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:41.030 align:start position:0%
put forward in 2008 in the hope that we
could

00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
could
 
00:44:43.910 --> 00:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
educate legislators and other community
 
00:44:45.510 --> 00:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
leaders to make sure that
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
plan moves ahead the last 10-year plan
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
we had never really did move ahead
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
so we don't want to keep some attention
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
on that plan and get people's
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
motivation to move it along but we've
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
been running some
 
00:45:01.270 --> 00:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
in-service programs prior to covid
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
that were well attended by members of
 
00:45:04.870 --> 00:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature from both parties
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
and we hope to resume that once we're
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
past all this isolation that we're
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
involved in right now and
 
00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
other than that i'm really looking
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
forward to my fourth term in the
 
00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:15.990 align:start position:0%
forward to my fourth term in the
committee

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you so much ken lucy weber
 
00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i'm lucy weber
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
i live in walpole
 
00:45:33.270 --> 00:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
and i represent walpole westmoreland
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
chesterfield and hinsdale so the lower
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
left-hand corner of the state
 
00:45:42.309 --> 00:45:42.319 align:start position:0%
um i started out i was
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh grew up in new york city which i
 
00:45:45.119 --> 00:45:46.150 align:start position:0%
uh grew up in new york city which i
hated

00:45:46.150 --> 00:45:46.160 align:start position:0%
hated
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
because it was urban we had a summer
 
00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
camp in northern new jersey that was
 
00:45:52.309 --> 00:45:52.319 align:start position:0%
very rudimentary
 
00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
and which i loved a lot more so
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
when i had control over where i lived i
 
00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:58.870 align:start position:0%
when i had control over where i lived i
i

00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:46:01.109 --> 00:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
my residence was new jersey rather than
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
new york and from there i came to
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
vermont and from there
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
i crossed the river i was just just on
 
00:46:07.990 --> 00:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
the other side of the river in
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
brattleboro and then
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
before that in the upper valley so i've
 
00:46:13.270 --> 00:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
lived my adult life
 
00:46:15.109 --> 00:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
up and down both sides of the
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
connecticut river basically
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
and it's very interesting to see how
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
much the connecticut river valley
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
is not a part of either new hampshire or
 
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.550 align:start position:0%
is not a part of either new hampshire or
vermont

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
and is equally neglected by both of the
 
00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.069 align:start position:0%
and is equally neglected by both of the
states

00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
there belonged to i
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
started out as a teacher i went to law
 
00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:34.790 align:start position:0%
started out as a teacher i went to law
school

00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
my practice wound up being in elder law
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
so the problems of an aging population
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
are something that i
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
really am fascinated by so i am
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh the committee's token attorney but
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
i'm good at drafting stuff and i'm glad
 
00:46:51.510 --> 00:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
to help
 
00:46:53.910 --> 00:46:53.920 align:start position:0%
everybody with wordsmithing whether i
 
00:46:56.630 --> 00:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
agree with the sentiment or not
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
and i have
 
00:47:03.589 --> 00:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
served on judiciary edna children and
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
family law legislative administration
 
00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
but this really feels like my home i've
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
spent two and a half
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
terms here eight terms in the house
 
00:47:13.119 --> 00:47:14.470 align:start position:0%
terms here eight terms in the house
entirely

00:47:14.470 --> 00:47:14.480 align:start position:0%
entirely
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh but this really does feel like my
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
home and
 
00:47:20.790 --> 00:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
um i think
 
00:47:24.069 --> 00:47:24.079 align:start position:0%
that's it i will say that um i i
 
00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:26.720 align:start position:0%
was very sad when our vice chair from
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
last time polly campion decided not to
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
because she not only was very able
 
00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
she brought the perspective of a nurse
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm glad we have another nurse
 
00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.240 align:start position:0%
who is going to continue that point of
 
00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.430 align:start position:0%
who is going to continue that point of
view

00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
view
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
and uh i guess in terms of
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
family i have
 
00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
no children but i have an enormous
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
extended family both because my sister
 
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
used up my allocation of children
 
00:47:59.430 --> 00:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
and so i've got lots of nieces and
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
nephews and because my late husband came
 
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
with a very large family before i
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
met him i will also add that i
 
00:48:09.109 --> 00:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
looked after my husband in his last
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
illness which was prostate cancer and he
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
was quite ill for four years
 
00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
and so i bring the perspective of a
 
00:48:20.069 --> 00:48:20.079 align:start position:0%
caregiver of a sick relative
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
and i know that the other thing that all
 
00:48:23.829 --> 00:48:23.839 align:start position:0%
of us bring
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
are our own life experiences with our
 
00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:27.270 align:start position:0%
are our own life experiences with our
own

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
family members and the care that we need
 
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:31.030 align:start position:0%
family members and the care that we need
to

00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
give both to them and to our communities
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
and uh it's why this is such a rich
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
a committee that is so rich in
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
experience of
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
all kinds and and they're all uh
 
00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
both listened to and valued and it's why
 
00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:48.160 align:start position:0%
i like serving here
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%

king
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.069 --> 00:49:18.079 align:start position:0%
sorry about that okay um good morning
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh and thank you mr chairman for um
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
allowing me to introduce myself and uh
 
00:49:26.710 --> 00:49:26.720 align:start position:0%
give you a little background
 
00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:30.400 align:start position:0%
i'm uh bill king and i'm from uh milford
 
00:49:33.430 --> 00:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh which is hillsborough district 23
 
00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
for those um keeping track of that
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
um i am a transplant from new york but
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
i'm from the
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
upstate adirondack area of new york
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
which is very very similar to the new
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
england area
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
so when i moved to new hampshire
 
00:49:59.349 --> 00:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
in 93 it was a very easy transition
 
00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
so um i spent
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
after high school i spent four years in
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
the navy and which
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
helped pay for my college education i
 
00:50:09.750 --> 00:50:09.760 align:start position:0%
became an engineer
 
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:12.720 align:start position:0%
and i've worked in manufacturing for
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
over 30 years
 
00:50:18.230 --> 00:50:18.240 align:start position:0%
and um i'm not
 
00:50:21.349 --> 00:50:21.359 align:start position:0%
very well uh suited for corporate
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
so um when the chance came i
 
00:50:24.839 --> 00:50:25.990 align:start position:0%
so um when the chance came i
semi-retired

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
semi-retired
 
00:50:30.069 --> 00:50:30.079 align:start position:0%
and now i'm in legislation so
 
00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
um uh i've
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
uh i've got four kids which you can see
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
in the picture by the way
 
00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason uh i don't know if
 
00:50:40.470 --> 00:50:40.480 align:start position:0%
it's a firewall here
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
where i am um but i can't actually turn
 
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
my camera on
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
but um the picture is uh
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
of my four kids and i've got three boys
 
00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
and a daughter
 
00:50:55.589 --> 00:50:55.599 align:start position:0%
um all basically of um
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
legal age and um
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
that's left me to dabble in
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
uh in different things we did lose my
 
00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:05.910 align:start position:0%
uh in different things we did lose my
wife

00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
wife
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh four years ago to sarcoma
 
00:51:11.829 --> 00:51:11.839 align:start position:0%
and um this picture actually was taken

our committee
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%

00:55:54.069 --> 00:55:54.079 align:start position:0%
tile view that
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
i am sitting immediately next to you so
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
i can
 
00:56:00.069 --> 00:56:00.079 align:start position:0%
give you the elbow for those who are new
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
mark sat next to me and we always
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
elbowed each other mostly he elbowed me
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you well all right then i want to
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
tell one concern of the former chair
 
00:56:12.789 --> 00:56:12.799 align:start position:0%
who has a very good um
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
ability with the hairy eyeball because i
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
used to teach second
 
00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
grade too which is often why i took my
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
glasses off but i do want to say one
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
story about representative penarch and i
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
there was an issue and i forget what it
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
was but you wound up
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
arguing to the right it was it was to
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
prohibit conversion therapy and we've
 
00:56:34.230 --> 00:56:34.240 align:start position:0%
we argued opposite sides we opposite
 
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:34.950 align:start position:0%
we argued opposite sides we opposite
argued

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:34.960 align:start position:0%
argued
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
we argued opposite to our party ideology
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
because somebody needed to bring up the
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
other side and it just seemed to be fair
 
00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:43.109 align:start position:0%
other side and it just seemed to be fair
so

00:56:43.109 --> 00:56:43.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
this kind of thing i'm not sure how many
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
committees this could happen
 
00:56:49.349 --> 00:56:49.359 align:start position:0%
and but it will happen in hours and
 
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:50.720 align:start position:0%
kotowski couldn't take
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
our elbowing any longer which is why he
 
00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
made me clerk one years to separate us
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
yeah actually just a real quick thing
 
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
and the conversion therapy the other
 
00:56:59.670 --> 00:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
story i liked and this is for this whole
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
committee to understand
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
mark and i argued because i was with my
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
side on that one and
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
mark was with his side we argued at the
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
well we saw each other at lunch and gave
