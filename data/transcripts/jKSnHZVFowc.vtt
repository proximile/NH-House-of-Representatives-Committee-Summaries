public input unless requested
 
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh we that F at the end of that
 
00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:15.540 align:start position:0%
We Will We Will exec
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
we'll start executing we'll exec 184 and
 
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
then uh we'll be executing uh bill from
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
the bills that are still that are that
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
that have that are still
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll continue doing that until 11
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
o'clock then we will have a full that we
 
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.670 align:start position:0%
o'clock then we will have a full that we
will

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:42.660 align:start position:0%
uh have full committee will go and have
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
hearings on 397 and noon we will break
 
00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
for lunch and at one o'clock we will do
 
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
4 46 and then we will go back into
 
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
executive session to finish up all the
 
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
executive session to finish up all the
bills

00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:56.170 align:start position:0%

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
good morning can you hear me now yes yes
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
we can yeah and can you see me as well I
 
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:49.500 align:start position:0%
was never sure
 
00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.290 align:start position:0%
was never sure
uh

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh yeah because all I see is a whole yes
 
00:10:55.509 --> 00:10:55.519 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
all right um I guess I have information
 
00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
to share with you you've received the
 
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
packet I believe and you received a
 
00:11:03.170 --> 00:11:03.180 align:start position:0%
couple naps so I will reference one map
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
but I just want to take about five
 
00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:07.019 align:start position:0%
minutes to go over
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
some of the specific things that were
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
asked before
 
00:11:11.569 --> 00:11:11.579 align:start position:0%
um you have in your pack it reports
 
00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:13.380 align:start position:0%
which describe Damage Done by personal
 
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:15.240 align:start position:0%

best way to support
 
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:31.740 align:start position:0%

Mark areas where personal watercraft are
 
00:11:36.170 --> 00:11:36.180 align:start position:0%
not appropriate I'm sure you've gone
 
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
through the information yourself but
 
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
there are a few highlights that I'd like
 
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
to bring forth from these reports from
 
00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:43.980 align:start position:0%
thrillcraft there's a report on the
 
00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:45.899 align:start position:0%

of the shore
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
the best way to avoid disturbing the
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
local ecosystem is to stay in the marks
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
channels and the deeper areas of a lake
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%

their migration periods birds will
 
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
typically fly away from disturbing

especially in narrow streams and inlets
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
this organization recognizing the damage
 
00:13:17.269 --> 00:13:17.279 align:start position:0%
that can be done cautions PWC users to
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
avoid such areas it can be very
 
00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:21.420 align:start position:0%
difficult to not know which areas are
 
00:13:23.329 --> 00:13:23.339 align:start position:0%
sensitive and which are not to have
 
00:13:25.430 --> 00:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
clear signage about areas of particular
 
00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
sensitivity can help direct PWC users
 
00:13:30.590 --> 00:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
away from these areas
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
from the University of Vermont a study
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
concludes that when the unburned fuel is
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
released into the water tiny organisms
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
absorb the chemicals and become
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
extremely sensitive to light and
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
occurrence called phototoxicity
 
00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
the daylight Sun then kills the organism
 
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
which collapses causes a collapse of the
 
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
food chain as food sources slowly become
 
00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.590 align:start position:0%
food chain as food sources slowly become
eliminated

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
00:13:53.449 --> 00:13:53.459 align:start position:0%
finally from environmental guide for
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
watercraft operators there's a list of
 
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
all the various types of damage
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
including turbidity vegetation noise
 
00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
erosion and sea grasses again the guide
 
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
recommends staying away from such areas
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
clearly demarcating the areas provides
 
00:14:11.629 --> 00:14:11.639 align:start position:0%
guidance to PWC users who typically do
 
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
not want to damage the environment
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
there was a concern that a restriction
 
00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:17.459 align:start position:0%
would adversely affect particular
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
businesses it is in my view rather
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
absurd to think that someone is going to
 
00:14:24.829 --> 00:14:24.839 align:start position:0%
be deterred from purchasing a jet ski
 
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:26.700 align:start position:0%
because they cannot use it in a few
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
hundred square yards of wetlands out of
 
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
the miles and miles of navigable
 
00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:34.860 align:start position:0%
waterways surrounding us
 
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
I also want to mention that this is a
 
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
constituent-driven bill by the residents
 
00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:41.579 align:start position:0%
who live in Rye and in Newcastle the
 
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
people who are directly affected by the
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
impact of the jet skis and see by and
 
00:14:48.889 --> 00:14:48.899 align:start position:0%
large on a daily basis the fragility and
 
00:14:50.810 --> 00:14:50.820 align:start position:0%
the sensitivity of the area in which
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
they live
 
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
operators are not always aware of their
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
surroundings and having having these
 
00:14:58.610 --> 00:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
sensitive areas clearly marked as to
 
00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
everyone's benefit the residents of rye
 
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:03.540 align:start position:0%
and Newcastle the wildlife that lives
 
00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:05.940 align:start position:0%
and breeds in these shallow Waters and
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
the PWC users who are generally
 
00:15:10.009 --> 00:15:10.019 align:start position:0%
respectful and glad to know where the
 
00:15:12.889 --> 00:15:12.899 align:start position:0%
areas are that should be avoided
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
these are the people who are
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
particularly concerned this all benefits
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
these individuals and these constituents
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
this pass unanimously last session and
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
was derailed due to covid the
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
constituents of Ryan Newcastle very much
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
want to see this past again
 
00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at the map
 
00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:35.220 align:start position:0%
that has it's kind of an expanded map
 
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
which particularly shows a protected
 
00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.230 align:start position:0%
which particularly shows a protected
area

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:42.060 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Suzanne I had mine up oops
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
let me
 
00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:45.660 align:start position:0%
um can you go to the other one
 
00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:48.420 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah that's clear
 
00:15:49.930 --> 00:15:49.940 align:start position:0%
do you have another one
 
00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.850 --> 00:15:57.860 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:05.220 align:start position:0%
one yeah that one
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
um the one that Suzanne had put up
 
00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
before shows a larger area and even
 
00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:11.160 align:start position:0%
again if you look at a larger map this
 
00:16:13.370 --> 00:16:13.380 align:start position:0%
is a very small area this is in
 
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.569 align:start position:0%
is a very small area this is in
particularly

00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:14.579 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
the the best blow up that we have and
 
00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:18.899 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
00:16:18.899 --> 00:16:19.850 align:start position:0%
you can see
um

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:19.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
where the Blue Line starts
 
00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
at the end of The Causeway between I
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
think that's now I forget if it's gold
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
Island and uh see that's not CV
 
00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
and it goes around
 
00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:33.769 align:start position:0%
and it goes around
um

00:16:33.769 --> 00:16:33.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
those two big areas in the middle are
 
00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:38.100 align:start position:0%
Pest and leech
 
00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
and then I can't get down to the bottom
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
but perhaps you can it stops at the edge
 
00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:45.660 align:start position:0%
of the bridge on the New Castle there
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
thank you on the New Castle side
 
00:16:48.899 --> 00:16:49.670 align:start position:0%
thank you on the New Castle side
um

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
the what were what we call the Wentworth
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
Rye Bridge
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
Vehicles can get under that bridge and
 
00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
get out into the larger passage into
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
what's considered a little Harbor here
 
00:17:00.829 --> 00:17:00.839 align:start position:0%
you can also see from there that they
 
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:03.180 align:start position:0%
can go up Sagamore Creek and go to BG's
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
and access all the whatever there is up
 
00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.949 align:start position:0%
and access all the whatever there is up
there

00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
um so it's restricting just this small
 
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.150 align:start position:0%
um so it's restricting just this small
area

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:17:14.210 --> 00:17:14.220 align:start position:0%
from the bridge at the causeway on one
 
00:17:17.090 --> 00:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
beat to the beginning of the Newcastle
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
Rye bridge in there it's a small air you
 
00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
can see that there are a lot of islands
 
00:17:22.850 --> 00:17:22.860 align:start position:0%
that ought to give you an idea that it's
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
a very very shallow area right now I
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
could lift up my laptop and put it out
 
00:17:28.789 --> 00:17:28.799 align:start position:0%
the window and you could see that it's
 
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
basically totally mud flats right now
 
00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.230 align:start position:0%
basically totally mud flats right now
um

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:35.150 --> 00:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
so that's pretty much all that I'd have
 
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
to say as I said it passed unanimously
 
00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:39.480 align:start position:0%
last time people had a chance to come
 
00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:41.460 align:start position:0%
out here and see what it's like if you'd
 
00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080 align:start position:0%
like I could lift up I could move my
 
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
laptop and look out yeah please huh I
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
got you back up I turned the maps off if
 
00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:50.640 align:start position:0%
you could just avoid your camera out the
 
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
window that'd be great alrighty I I is
 
00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
that working do I need to switch
 
00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
something around or I need to turn the
 
00:17:59.510 --> 00:17:59.520 align:start position:0%
computer around
 
00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:03.890 align:start position:0%
computer around
okay

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:06.780 align:start position:0%
there you go tell me
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
what you're seeing
 
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
oh beautiful perfect
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
you got it
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
yep so that's the area you can see I you
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
can see the mud perhaps you can see a
 
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
very Wiggly channel in the middle which
 
00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
is where lavender Creek comes out
 
00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
um if we were lucky you'd see deer
 
00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:31.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.310 --> 00:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
does that seek does that help
 
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:35.270 align:start position:0%
does that seek does that help
yep

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
that helps a lot thanks a lot yes
 
00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
that helps a lot thanks a lot yes
okay

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:39.690 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.690 align:start position:0%
okay
[Music]

00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:44.700 align:start position:0%
okay and that's the uh that's the extent
 
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
of your testimony at the moment that's
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
it for now I'm glad to answer questions
 
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
but I go on it in
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
it it says
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
important to constituents here and that
 
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
in doing the research
 
00:18:59.930 --> 00:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
um so many of the the bank of the
 
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
professional literature as you were as
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
you as you may have consider
 
00:19:06.529 --> 00:19:06.539 align:start position:0%
um for personal watercraft users are
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
also very keen about sensitive areas and
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
to say mark it off so that they don't
 
00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
they know that this is not where they
 
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
should go
 
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
um and you can see um just looking out
 
00:19:18.169 --> 00:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
my window I guess it's a reasonably
 
00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:21.299 align:start position:0%
small area when it is high tide it's
 
00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
still shallow but it's very difficult
 
00:19:24.529 --> 00:19:24.539 align:start position:0%
you know when you're on the water to
 
00:19:28.450 --> 00:19:28.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559 align:start position:0%
I would help this to questions I think
 
00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:32.330 align:start position:0%
I would help this to questions I think
um

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
any member
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh the committee uh are there any
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
questions for the
 
00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:40.460 align:start position:0%
for the app
 
00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:52.020 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.630 --> 00:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.810 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
testify

00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:23.090 --> 00:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
this should be up now
 
00:20:27.289 --> 00:20:27.299 align:start position:0%
hello can the committee hear me yes
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for allowing me the
 
00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak
 
00:20:33.529 --> 00:20:33.539 align:start position:0%
um and and I did get a chance to look at
 
00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
this protected area that representative
 
00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:39.059 align:start position:0%
Murray has proposed uh to ban all uh
 
00:20:42.049 --> 00:20:42.059 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft from going into
 
00:20:42.059 --> 00:20:43.130 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft from going into
um

00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
she's she I I agree with with the with
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
the representative that uh that those
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
areas are sensitive and I do agree that
 
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.570 align:start position:0%
areas are sensitive and I do agree that
um

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:52.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
that uh that they you know they should
 
00:20:57.130 --> 00:20:57.140 align:start position:0%
be protected in one way or another
 
00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:00.660 align:start position:0%
however I I still my my understanding
 
00:21:01.909 --> 00:21:01.919 align:start position:0%
these wave Runners that she's talking
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
about these watercraft uh the my my
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
extensive history with them and I've
 
00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:10.500 align:start position:0%
been doing this for 27 years
 
00:21:12.529 --> 00:21:12.539 align:start position:0%
um the wakes that they create are
 
00:21:15.830 --> 00:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
significantly Less in comparison to
 
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
whatever boat might be traveling through
 
00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
there not only that they do not have
 
00:21:21.169 --> 00:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
lower units on them that they don't have
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
Rudders they don't have propellers uh
 
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
that protrude down into the down down
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
into the water uh you know sometime in
 
00:21:30.649 --> 00:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
circumstances of such as three feet
 
00:21:33.049 --> 00:21:33.059 align:start position:0%
which these are shallow areas and if
 
00:21:34.850 --> 00:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
these propellers were to come contact
 
00:21:36.890 --> 00:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
with the substrate they would cause
 
00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
intense turbidity uh and you would see
 
00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:40.860 align:start position:0%
the damage
 
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
um so the concern that I have is that
 
00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
the looking in this area the message
 
00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
that it's going to send is that this
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
this area has a lot of Moorings boat
 
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.310 align:start position:0%
this area has a lot of Moorings boat
Moorings

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
Moorings
 
00:21:54.230 --> 00:21:54.240 align:start position:0%
um a lot of people Park their boats or
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
I'm actually looking at a satellite
 
00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
picture of it right now and I can see
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
all the boat Moorings in there
 
00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:00.900 align:start position:0%
um people like to travel back and forth
 
00:22:03.289 --> 00:22:03.299 align:start position:0%
to their boats using their wave Runners
 
00:22:05.529 --> 00:22:05.539 align:start position:0%
uh using their watercraft
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
they will go through those areas and at
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
idle speed as they should which is the
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
law they have to go through their at
 
00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:15.059 align:start position:0%
Headway speed they cannot create a wake
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
through there if they do it is already
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
an offense
 
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
um it is already against the law
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
so Banning the wave runners in that area
 
00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
you know the concern that I have is that
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
the message is going to send and with
 
00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:30.900 align:start position:0%
what the general population will will
 
00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
learn is that they're just not welcome
 
00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:35.940 align:start position:0%
here and while I do think that
 
00:22:38.029 --> 00:22:38.039 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection is important
 
00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
the the structure of these watercraft
 
00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:42.780 align:start position:0%
the way they're built if they're
 
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
operated lawfully
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
should and I and I say this with 27
 
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
years of experience should not be
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
creating the disturbance that the
 
00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:54.720 align:start position:0%
representative is talking about uh they
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
should be creating a lot less
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
disturbance and represent a lot less
 
00:23:00.890 --> 00:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
risk than boats in that area of which I
 
00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:02.520 align:start position:0%
am looking at a mooring field that
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
probably has about 20 or 30 boats in
 
00:23:06.649 --> 00:23:06.659 align:start position:0%
there that people will no longer be able
 
00:23:08.690 --> 00:23:08.700 align:start position:0%
to go to their boats uh on their
 
00:23:10.669 --> 00:23:10.679 align:start position:0%
WaveRunners to take a quick trip out
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
there to get something
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
um you know to to just hop on their way
 
00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
runner go over there get something on or
 
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
off their boat transport back and forth
 
00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
Shore uh they just won't be able to do
 
00:23:23.690 --> 00:23:23.700 align:start position:0%
that anymore and you know
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
wave runners in those areas is something
 
00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
that you know a lot of people that use
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
these products because the water is
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
relatively calm and it's relaxing and
 
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
there the those areas do access the the
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
BG boat house to get through there to
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
get to BG Boathouse you would have to
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
skirt those areas you could easily go
 
00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:43.140 align:start position:0%
into one of those protected areas by
 
00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:45.419 align:start position:0%
accident on a wave runner because she's
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
protected the whole area which goes to
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
those areas so
 
00:23:50.090 --> 00:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
the concern that I would have would be
 
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.409 align:start position:0%
the concern that I would have would be
enforcement

00:23:51.409 --> 00:23:51.419 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:54.419 align:start position:0%
um you know uh as far as you know
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
someone just taking a regular trip out
 
00:23:58.250 --> 00:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
to their boat or going to somewhere in
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
the play one of the destinations the
 
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:02.220 align:start position:0%
businesses that they would go and visit
 
00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:02.810 align:start position:0%
businesses that they would go and visit
um

00:24:02.810 --> 00:24:02.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
any of those purposes you'd be basically
 
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
Banning wave Runners now everyone would
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
have to go out and get a boat to do it
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
and boats have lower units they have
 
00:24:12.770 --> 00:24:12.780 align:start position:0%
propellers they have
 
00:24:14.390 --> 00:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
they they they're just they're
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
structurally they're a lot higher risk
 
00:24:19.549 --> 00:24:19.559 align:start position:0%
to the environment and are the ones that
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
are creating the damage that the
 
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:23.400 align:start position:0%
representatives talking about
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
um so that's my concern and I just don't
 
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
fully understand how Banning those would
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to the environment
 
00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:33.720 align:start position:0%
um given that you know they're just not
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
if they're a lot if they're operated
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
lawfully they would be creating less
 
00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
damage to the environment than any boat
 
00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
any questions uh for uh Mr cook from the
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
command members of the committee
 
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
Susan Smith raise your enhancer
 
00:24:58.610 --> 00:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:00.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
taking my question Mr cook
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
um I wondered if you had seen on since
 
00:25:09.289 --> 00:25:09.299 align:start position:0%
you're on the call uh were you able to
 
00:25:12.169 --> 00:25:12.179 align:start position:0%
see the map which shows the designated
 
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
area that would be closed off in the
 
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
back Channel yes I did what I did was I
 
00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
when I saw it come up on my screen I
 
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
took a picture of it with my cell phone
 
00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:22.740 align:start position:0%
so I have it here in front of me and I
 
00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:25.020 align:start position:0%
can see your uh satellite picture as
 
00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:26.090 align:start position:0%
can see your uh satellite picture as
well

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
it seems to me when I'm looking at the
 
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
satellite picture that that area is very
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
very shallow anyway and I don't see any
 
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
Moorings I don't know what you're are
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
you looking at a picture from the summer
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
or well no you have to go to the north
 
00:25:47.450 --> 00:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh you see leeches Island and pest
 
00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
Island no no that go north give me a
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
second slide it down
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
there you go see that area right there
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
that see the where the 1B there's Goat
 
00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
Island at the top of the screen and then
 
00:26:01.010 --> 00:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
as you proceed to the left you see one B
 
00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
that's that bridge right there that is a
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
main channel that most marine traffic
 
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
that passes through here goes through
 
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
and what happens is a lot of that Marine
 
00:26:12.830 --> 00:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
Traffic will travel and you can actually
 
00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
kind of see the channel
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh where it is you know in this
 
00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
satellite picture it's actually pretty
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
telling because the mud flats are all
 
00:26:21.529 --> 00:26:21.539 align:start position:0%
around and it gets really really shallow
 
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
in those areas but if you stay in the
 
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
channel you're okay and and um so if
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
you're you can already see a boat
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
traveling underneath the bridge in the
 
00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:32.460 align:start position:0%
satellite picture uh under 1B that boat
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
is heading through the channel now if
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
you look at her protected area
 
00:26:39.169 --> 00:26:39.179 align:start position:0%
um it is right there at the beginning of
 
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
that bridge
 
00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
okay so if any Wave Runner were to pass
 
00:26:45.710 --> 00:26:45.720 align:start position:0%
through there it would be very very easy
 
00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
for one of those wave Runners to Veer
 
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
off to the left-hand side and go into
 
00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:50.940 align:start position:0%
the protected area now where you're
 
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
bringing your mouse pointer right now
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's a large Channel area where there
 
00:26:57.890 --> 00:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
are a lot of boats moored uh you can if
 
00:26:59.149 --> 00:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
you go in there I don't know you're
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
counting 10 20 boats that are moored in
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
there so any person that owns a wave
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
runner that maybe live on the water in
 
00:27:09.649 --> 00:27:09.659 align:start position:0%
Newcastle or live up in Portsmouth or
 
00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:12.419 align:start position:0%
Dover or anyone that wants to go to
 
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
their boat now they can no longer do
 
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
that if you protect that entire area and
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
given that those areas are that that
 
00:27:21.409 --> 00:27:21.419 align:start position:0%
area where those boats are more it stays
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
fairly deep uh it it just it it takes
 
00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:29.340 align:start position:0%
out an entire it just it what it does is
 
00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
it takes out the entire ability of
 
00:27:33.890 --> 00:27:33.900 align:start position:0%
citizens to use that and to get back and
 
00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.210 align:start position:0%
citizens to use that and to get back and
forth

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
forth
 
00:27:39.769 --> 00:27:39.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:45.529 --> 00:27:45.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
so you have two questions stand by
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative Cohen uh
 
00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:53.900 align:start position:0%
representative Colin for a question
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chairperson thank you Mr
 
00:27:59.210 --> 00:27:59.220 align:start position:0%
cook thank you very much for your
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
testimony I just need a slight bit of
 
00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
clarification please
 
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
we talked about
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
um your observations and your
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
experiences for approximately 25 years
 
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
could you just let me know are you
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
coming to this as a soil or Marine
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
expert are you coming to this as a use
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
of the area a resident just what is your
 
00:28:21.769 --> 00:28:21.779 align:start position:0%
experience open I can understand where
 
00:28:24.409 --> 00:28:24.419 align:start position:0%
it's coming from okay so my experiences
 
00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
in the use and operation of these jet
 
00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
skis these watercraft but I also do
 
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
happen to have
 
00:28:33.890 --> 00:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
um a pretty large amount of experience I
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
live up River in Dover and you know I
 
00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
recently expanded my doc and uh I went
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
back and forth with the Department of
 
00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:43.740 align:start position:0%
Environmental survey for services and
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we ended up having to go
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know into the court system and we
 
00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:50.039 align:start position:0%
actually won and we were able to expand
 
00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:52.320 align:start position:0%
our dock in doing that I learned all
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
about the turbidity issues created by
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
docking structures by wave Runners by
 
00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:00.059 align:start position:0%
boats by by everything that's passing
 
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
through the area
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
um I had a chance to really you know to
 
00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:05.700 align:start position:0%
meet with I've met with marine biologist
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
Adel fiorello over at Normandale

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:18.440 align:start position:0%
engineer officials uh I've had
 
00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:20.940 align:start position:0%
consultation with Wetland scientists of
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
numerous different uh
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
surveying companies on the Seacoast so I
 
00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
have you know some experience uh
 
00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
learning about you know turbidity issues
 
00:29:33.409 --> 00:29:33.419 align:start position:0%
Uh current issues uh environmental
 
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
issues that are you know that are in the
 
00:29:36.649 --> 00:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
river I know about the eelgrass issues
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
that they were having in Great Bay I
 
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
know about the nitrogen levels that
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth and
 
00:29:44.690 --> 00:29:44.700 align:start position:0%
um Portsmouth and Dover were being were
 
00:29:47.269 --> 00:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
being uh reviewed for with regard to
 
00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
their you know to what they were
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
discharging into the into the river
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
so I have some experience there I guess
 
00:29:57.230 --> 00:29:57.240 align:start position:0%
enough to be dangerous but but uh most
 
00:29:59.570 --> 00:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
of my experiences with wave Runners uh
 
00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:03.299 align:start position:0%
boats uh and even Jet Boats as well uh
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
so remember they do have there are boats
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
out there that are powered the same way
 
00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:07.799 align:start position:0%
as wave Runners have the same structural
 
00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
makeup that wave Runners do
 
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:14.220 align:start position:0%

um for low areas
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:45.419 align:start position:0%

markers in the channel however it is not
 
00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:52.260 align:start position:0%
very well marked uh it's not hard for
 
00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
for any boat or wave runner to

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
seen very many people who access more
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%

00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:18.420 align:start position:0%
um the area specifically to Clampett
 
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
Island leeches those areas are are not
 
00:36:24.470 --> 00:36:24.480 align:start position:0%
marked uh by by any specific Channel
 
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.450 align:start position:0%
marked uh by by any specific Channel
markers

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
markers
 
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
um and and part of that is due to tide
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
fluctuations and the ability for these
 
00:36:33.710 --> 00:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
Channel markers to stay on station with
 
00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
as far as your questions to sediment I
 
00:36:43.609 --> 00:36:43.619 align:start position:0%
as as I was being given permission to to
 
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
to enter this hearing
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
um I I missed some of you the second
 
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
part of your questions for me
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
could you repeat your uh questions of
 
00:36:55.069 --> 00:36:55.079 align:start position:0%
Representative Smith
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
yeah no the uh the sediment part was uh
 
00:37:00.050 --> 00:37:00.060 align:start position:0%
going to be directed to Des if they came
 
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
on board
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
um but the the question I had was the uh
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
no we just heard from um a person who
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
testified about all the Moorings and
 
00:37:12.170 --> 00:37:12.180 align:start position:0%
that people use often uh personal
 
00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:14.220 align:start position:0%
watercraft to get to their Moorings and
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
they would not be able to get to The
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
Moorings if this law passed if this bill
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
passed and I just wondered um
 
00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
you know how the people who
 
00:37:28.069 --> 00:37:28.079 align:start position:0%
wore their boats there would be able to
 
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:36.180 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh we see a variety of ways
 
00:37:38.450 --> 00:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
that people access Moorings and and
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
specifically for that area along the
 
00:37:43.490 --> 00:37:43.500 align:start position:0%
causeway out to Newcastle there are
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
several pull-offs uh we see people
 
00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:49.020 align:start position:0%
launching all types of of craft there at
 
00:37:51.109 --> 00:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
those pull-offs
 
00:37:52.849 --> 00:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
um if you were to drive down there as
 
00:37:55.310 --> 00:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
you approach Newcastle island in the the
 
00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
cemetery which is the first property
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
that sort of greets you when you arrive
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
on the island there are numerous little
 
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
dinghies and row boats along the
 
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
shoreline there as well as row boats
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
with with outboard motors
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
um I have seen personal watercraft
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
access Moorings in the past uh not
 
00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:14.820 align:start position:0%
necessarily in that area but that's not
 
00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:17.940 align:start position:0%
to say uh that people don't use them at
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
those launch sites along the causeway uh
 
00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:27.609 --> 00:38:27.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:30.530 --> 00:38:30.540 align:start position:0%
uh are there any other questions from
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for Captain
 
00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:37.569 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for Captain
Dunleavy

00:38:37.569 --> 00:38:37.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.310 --> 00:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
all right representative gunski and
 
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.470 align:start position:0%
all right representative gunski and
representative

00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:47.870 --> 00:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh Captain I'm
 
00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:51.530 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh Captain I'm
leaving

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
just a follow-up from representative
 
00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.140 align:start position:0%
Smith's question
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
would this legislation have passed
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
prohibit an individual on a personal
 
00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft from accessing from
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
the boring field in that area
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
yes as as the language that is proposed
 
00:39:12.349 --> 00:39:12.359 align:start position:0%
would prohibit the operation of personal
 
00:39:15.109 --> 00:39:15.119 align:start position:0%
watercraft in that designated area
 
00:39:19.130 --> 00:39:19.140 align:start position:0%
so from basically from those maps that
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
you saw earlier that that uh blue line
 
00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:25.320 align:start position:0%
that was designated uh if that is
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
included in the language of the bill
 
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
then we will post that area and and no
 
00:39:31.670 --> 00:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft would be able to
 
00:39:33.970 --> 00:39:33.980 align:start position:0%
operate at any speed in that area
 
00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up
 
00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
and that would be a follow-up I'm sorry
 
00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.810 align:start position:0%
and that would be a follow-up I'm sorry
uh

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:41.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
so if we took a Headway if we
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
would it be possible to access that area
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:54.599 --> 00:39:56.450 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
thinking about that
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
modifying the bill possibly
 
00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
in your opinion would it be disrupted
 
00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
for an individual to enter that area in
 
00:40:10.849 --> 00:40:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
I can't speak to the environmental
 
00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
mental impacts uh for the operation in
 
00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:17.640 align:start position:0%
the shallow water when a vesicles at
 
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
Headway speed that's just outside of my
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
purview and expertise but I will say
 
00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:23.940 align:start position:0%
that I believe it was a Mr cook that
 
00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:27.180 align:start position:0%
that spoke earlier uh to other statutes
 
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
that are in place that depending upon
 
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
the tide and specifically where they are
 
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:34.680 align:start position:0%
in that that designated area
 
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
uh I would say that the overwhelming
 
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:39.900 align:start position:0%
majority of that area would already
 
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
require the boats to be traveling at no
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
wake speed just due to the approximity
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
from a shoreline whether it's an island
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
or the main Shoreline line of Newcastle
 
00:40:54.290 --> 00:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
now certainly at low tide uh there's
 
00:40:56.450 --> 00:40:56.460 align:start position:0%
more shoreline and and the lower the
 
00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:58.619 align:start position:0%
tide the less area that they could
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
operate if they were more than 150 feet
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
from Shore
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
at high tide there might be a little
 
00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:06.660 align:start position:0%
more water certainly deeper water for
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
them to operate but the majority of that
 
00:41:11.089 --> 00:41:11.099 align:start position:0%
area would be in proximity to Shoreline
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
requiring Headway speed only
 
00:41:15.829 --> 00:41:15.839 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you Captain
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
oh thank you chair um Captain Dunleavy I
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
just wanted some clarification on the
 
00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.050 align:start position:0%
just wanted some clarification on the
definition

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:26.700 align:start position:0%
um continuing in the same vein of
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft does that include
 
00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
row boats
 
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
which is typical for accessing a boat to
 
00:41:35.210 --> 00:41:35.220 align:start position:0%
a mooring
 
00:41:37.490 --> 00:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
is that where
 
00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:39.140 align:start position:0%
can you speak to that please thanks
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for your question
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
no it would not include rowboats
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft are uh defined as
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
being less than 13 feet in length they
 
00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
must be jet propelled or powered by a
 
00:41:54.349 --> 00:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
jet pump versus a propeller
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
and it is a type of craft that you would
 
00:41:59.930 --> 00:41:59.940 align:start position:0%
sit on or straddle rather than sit in
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:05.450 --> 00:42:05.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
sir representative post for a question
 
00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
uh representative poster question
 
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
yes thank you again Mr chairman for
 
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:15.660 align:start position:0%
alarming the question and thank you Mr
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
Bellamy for um speaking up today
 
00:42:21.589 --> 00:42:21.599 align:start position:0%
um and answering our questions uh I
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
would like to know if we are going to
 
00:42:26.750 --> 00:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
protect this one area if that is going
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
to lead to all the other areas
 
00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:31.859 align:start position:0%
um wanting to protect themselves in the
 
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
same way because when I look at these
 
00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
um Google Maps
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
um it looks about the same in other
 
00:42:39.119 --> 00:42:40.910 align:start position:0%
um it looks about the same in other
areas

00:42:40.910 --> 00:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if those other areas are
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
currently protected and and this is just
 
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
an addition to that so can you speak to
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
that that whole inner area
 
00:42:56.329 --> 00:42:56.339 align:start position:0%
stay there in the room as to whether
 
00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
there would be restrictions for those
 
00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
areas uh who knows I know that this
 
00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
committee heard and and the legislature
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
passed a similar Bill a couple of years
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
ago for the uh the title flats and
 
00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
marshes in Hampton and Seabrook uh and
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
this is a a similar Bill certainly our
 
00:43:18.290 --> 00:43:18.300 align:start position:0%
Seacoast particularly as you go into
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
Great Bay and and up the piscataqua
 
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:23.400 align:start position:0%
river uh as well as as the areas around
 
00:43:26.089 --> 00:43:26.099 align:start position:0%
Rye Harbor and and in the in in the
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
Seabrook and Hampton
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
there are tidal Flats up and down our
 
00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
coast and so certainly there is similar
 
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
habitat that you're going to see in the
 
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
Newcastle channel that if if folks uh
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
and constituents wish to pursue this
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
type of restriction uh could certainly
 
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
do so
 
00:43:47.569 --> 00:43:47.579 align:start position:0%
we'll follow up please or a follow-up
 
00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
yes are there currently any risk
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
Universal southern area
 
00:43:53.930 --> 00:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
in the other town
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I want to get the Piscataway River
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
and um up by round Island and
 
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:05.220 align:start position:0%
um that area
 
00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
there are not the only ones we have uh
 
00:44:10.490 --> 00:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
currently are are the the the marshlands
 
00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:13.140 align:start position:0%
of Ryan I mean of Hampton and Seabrook
 
00:44:15.890 --> 00:44:15.900 align:start position:0%
and and now this one uh that is proposed
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
before you today
 
00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:24.420 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:26.940 align:start position:0%
No Hands racing there being No Hands
 
00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:29.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Captain uh chair would
 
00:44:34.089 --> 00:44:34.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:37.140 align:start position:0%
who is also a part of
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh representative Smith's question uh
 
00:44:42.410 --> 00:44:42.420 align:start position:0%
representative Smith could uh you may uh
 
00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
We've re-asked the question to Mr deers
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
that you were originally closed so I can
 
00:44:53.089 --> 00:44:53.099 align:start position:0%
so the chair is able to catch his
 
00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:56.220 align:start position:0%
ketchup I forget easily
 
00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
its age
 
00:45:03.050 --> 00:45:03.060 align:start position:0%
the um I was asking about the um value
 
00:45:07.670 --> 00:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
of eelgrass and other uh aquatic plants
 
00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
growing in the shallow Waters of the
 
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
marshlands along the Seacoast as well as
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh what happens when a jet propelled
 
00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:21.300 align:start position:0%
craft goes through uh and and how
 
00:45:23.809 --> 00:45:23.819 align:start position:0%
shallow and deep the whatever anyway
 
00:45:27.349 --> 00:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
erosion and turbidity would be the would
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
be the concerns
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair can you hear me uh yo
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
uh can you hear me open here this little
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
bit uh could you also uh identify uh who
 
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
well you know yourself as far as your
 
00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:46.200 align:start position:0%
expertise as well sure for the record my
 
00:45:47.809 --> 00:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
name is Ted deers and I'm the
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
administrator of the watershed
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
management Bureau at the Department of
 
00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:52.740 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
um I have been with the Department uh or
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
the state for about 24 years I
 
00:46:00.349 --> 00:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
previously worked in the coastal program
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
I was a coastal program director and for
 
00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
about eight years I worked on salt marsh
 
00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
restoration work uh in the Seacoast so I
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
am uh pretty familiar uh with the
 
00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
marshes in and around New Hampshire
 
00:46:16.730 --> 00:46:16.740 align:start position:0%
Seacoast so
 
00:46:18.589 --> 00:46:18.599 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair members of the committee
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
it's a tremendous pleasure to be in
 
00:46:22.010 --> 00:46:22.020 align:start position:0%
front of you today although virtually
 
00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.630 align:start position:0%
front of you today although virtually
and

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:26.099 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the the question from
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:46:31.190 --> 00:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh when I worked on I worked also on the
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
bill in Hampton back when that was going
 
00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:34.980 align:start position:0%
on and I will just say that the the
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
primary issue that occurs relative to
 
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
the this issue of personal watercraft
 
00:46:43.849 --> 00:46:43.859 align:start position:0%
out on the marshes is um it tends to be
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
really a high tide issue
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
so the the really fun thing to do I
 
00:46:52.609 --> 00:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
think uh with a personal watercraft is
 
00:46:55.010 --> 00:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
When the tide is very high it covers the
 
00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:55.910 align:start position:0%
When the tide is very high it covers the
marsh

00:46:55.910 --> 00:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
marsh
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
on an order of about 10 Tides a month or
 
00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:02.940 align:start position:0%
so it fully inundates the marsh
 
00:47:05.809 --> 00:47:05.819 align:start position:0%
and that allows for about to truly
 
00:47:05.819 --> 00:47:06.950 align:start position:0%
and that allows for about to truly
travel

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
travel
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
um pretty much wherever and and it's
 
00:47:10.609 --> 00:47:10.619 align:start position:0%
really interesting it's fun I know that
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
I've been out on canoes and and such in
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
those kinds of conditions kayaks
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
where it's really fun to go places you
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
normally can't go
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
um and it is a tremendous expanse of
 
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.250 align:start position:0%
um and it is a tremendous expanse of
water

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:22.260 align:start position:0%
water
 
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
um I would imagine it allows you to have
 
00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:27.180 align:start position:0%
um you know be able to go out and and
 
00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
move around and and you know I don't
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
know exactly how that would relate back
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
to things like you know uh Headway
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
speeds when you see the entire surface
 
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
of the water is surface of the marsh is
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
actually covered with water so you know
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
at what point where are the channels you
 
00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:47:46.730 --> 00:47:46.740 align:start position:0%
um and but yet the marsh is really only
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
a few inches deep it's uh six you know
 
00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
seven maybe eight inches below you
 
00:47:54.170 --> 00:47:54.180 align:start position:0%
except on extremely high tides and so
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
certainly was the case in Hampton where
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
we had significant Marsh damage
 
00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
occurring because of the jetting that
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
was going through those those jet Motors
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
out on the surface of the marsh and you
 
00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:06.480 align:start position:0%
could actually you know there there were
 
00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
I think Sue foot from from uh the uh
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
Seabrook Conservation Commission
 
00:48:12.890 --> 00:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
testified that you could go out and you
 
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
could find places and the marsh had been
 
00:48:17.809 --> 00:48:17.819 align:start position:0%
really torn up Marsh accrets at
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
something on the order of two
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
millimeters a year so if you dig a
 
00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:25.560 align:start position:0%
couple inch hole in a marsh you can do
 
00:48:27.290 --> 00:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
the calculations is how long that would
 
00:48:30.349 --> 00:48:30.359 align:start position:0%
take for that to heal back up so marshes
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
are these are our living sort of
 
00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
creatures more or less they're living
 
00:48:37.609 --> 00:48:37.619 align:start position:0%
ecosystems that are um already under
 
00:48:39.010 --> 00:48:39.020 align:start position:0%
stress they're in a stressful condition
 
00:48:41.569 --> 00:48:41.579 align:start position:0%
that is they are you know inundated
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
twice a day and we also have advanced
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
sea level rise going on right now sea
 
00:48:48.890 --> 00:48:48.900 align:start position:0%
level rise is about two or three times
 
00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
what it has been over the past average
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
over the past thousand years or so and
 
00:48:56.510 --> 00:48:56.520 align:start position:0%
so marshes are already challenged to try
 
00:48:57.950 --> 00:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
to keep up with that
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
we also have challenges increasing
 
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:02.220 align:start position:0%
science showing that we have challenges
 
00:49:04.970 --> 00:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
of nutrients that impact our marshes
 
00:49:06.829 --> 00:49:06.839 align:start position:0%
this is certainly the case around the
 
00:49:08.329 --> 00:49:08.339 align:start position:0%
Great Bay marshes where we see some of
 
00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
those marshes having some deterioration
 
00:49:13.309 --> 00:49:13.319 align:start position:0%
uh both as a result of excess new
 
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
excessive nutrients and sea level rise
 
00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:18.780 align:start position:0%
so um certainly the protection of
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
marshes is really important they're
 
00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:23.220 align:start position:0%
incredibly important ecosystems they're
 
00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:26.060 align:start position:0%
rare relatively rare in New Hampshire
 
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
and they provide habitat to lots and
 
00:49:31.309 --> 00:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
lots of Critters so um you know I think
 
00:49:32.809 --> 00:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
for those reasons it's important to
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
protect them
 
00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:35.940 align:start position:0%
um and certainly you know adding
 
00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
additional wave action and agile
 
00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:39.359 align:start position:0%
additional you know certainly those
 
00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:42.060 align:start position:0%
certainly at those high tide issues is
 
00:49:44.390 --> 00:49:44.400 align:start position:0%
really a challenge for the marshes
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
um make it clear that the department has
 
00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
not taken a position on this bill I'm
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
just providing trying to provide a an
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
answer to what I've sort of seen and
 
00:49:53.809 --> 00:49:53.819 align:start position:0%
learned over the years to representative
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:03.470 --> 00:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chair uh
 
00:50:05.089 --> 00:50:05.099 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr Peters for taking my question
 
00:50:06.770 --> 00:50:06.780 align:start position:0%
just wanted to follow up on what we were
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
discussing earlier about the accessing
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
The Mooring field in a no-weight type
 
00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:12.770 align:start position:0%
The Mooring field in a no-weight type
condition

00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
condition
 
00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
if you give me your thoughts on what
 
00:50:17.809 --> 00:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
type of disruption maybe a one of these
 
00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft would have going
 
00:50:22.730 --> 00:50:22.740 align:start position:0%
into a mooring field uh under no way
 
00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:23.690 align:start position:0%
into a mooring field uh under no way

00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I I can thank you uh
 
00:50:29.089 --> 00:50:29.099 align:start position:0%
representative I appreciate the question
 
00:50:32.150 --> 00:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
um certainly not my expertise in how uh
 
00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:36.420 align:start position:0%
boats move around uh I'm not a boater I
 
00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:39.660 align:start position:0%
would just refer back to to Captain
 
00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.270 align:start position:0%
would just refer back to to Captain
dunleavy's

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
dunleavy's
 
00:50:44.089 --> 00:50:44.099 align:start position:0%
um response that it totally depends on
 
00:50:44.099 --> 00:50:45.470 align:start position:0%
um response that it totally depends on
tide

00:50:45.470 --> 00:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
tide
 
00:50:45.480 --> 00:50:46.069 align:start position:0%
tide
um

00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
one of the interesting things uh being
 
00:50:49.970 --> 00:50:49.980 align:start position:0%
out there and if it and I encourage
 
00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
anyone who who really wants to have a
 
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
really enjoyable uh few hours uh of just
 
00:50:58.490 --> 00:50:58.500 align:start position:0%
a little Marsh bathing is to really
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
watch how the how the how the tide comes
 
00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:02.220 align:start position:0%
in and out
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
um it isn't sort of linear uh where you
 
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:07.619 align:start position:0%
have a channel that's there and it gets
 
00:51:09.290 --> 00:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
smaller and smaller it really sort of
 
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:12.240 align:start position:0%
happens almost uh their their point in
 
00:51:13.790 --> 00:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
some point in the tide it sort of
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
disappears and it would be at those
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
points where the where those Creeks gets
 
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:20.220 align:start position:0%
get smaller and smaller and you can't
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
really tell until they're essentially
 
00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
gone uh where you start to have
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
challenges and as far as where the
 
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:28.140 align:start position:0%
Moorings are and where the docks are
 
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
that I I am not familiar with that but I
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
just think that it is very challenging
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
to to
 
00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
um to know where you're at and how deep
 
00:51:40.370 --> 00:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
things are in these Mars situations just
 
00:51:43.130 --> 00:51:43.140 align:start position:0%
because they become very turbid uh at at
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr representative
 
00:51:51.049 --> 00:51:51.059 align:start position:0%
close to the question uh representative
 
00:51:53.210 --> 00:51:53.220 align:start position:0%
post for a question
 
00:51:57.049 --> 00:51:57.059 align:start position:0%
yes thank you again Mr chairman and um
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
um Mr Pierce for being here today and
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
speaking with us
 
00:52:06.109 --> 00:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
um is I just wanted to clarify and I'm
 
00:52:07.309 --> 00:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
not quite sure if you're hearing me
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
because I think the screen has frozen I
 
00:52:13.849 --> 00:52:13.859 align:start position:0%
can hear you oh okay thank you
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
um uh are you saying at high tides it's
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
less destructive for those types of
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft to be using the area
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
or are you saying that's when the most
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
damage occurs
 
00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative I think um I
 
00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:34.619 align:start position:0%
was I was trained as an economic as an
 
00:52:37.190 --> 00:52:37.200 align:start position:0%
economist so all my answers are it
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
depends uh that is the the time-honored
 
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
tradition as an economist that that is
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
the answer to all questions
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
so I will I will say it depends in as
 
00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
you're in during the high as the tide is
 
00:52:50.870 --> 00:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
coming up if you can sort of picture
 
00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
this you have the channels that are
 
00:52:53.809 --> 00:52:53.819 align:start position:0%
filling up with water
 
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
until it sort of spills over the top of
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
the channel and out onto the surface of
 
00:52:59.930 --> 00:52:59.940 align:start position:0%
the marsh it gets deeper and deeper and
 
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
deeper and those channels would be less
 
00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:03.180 align:start position:0%
likely to have erosion in them as they
 
00:53:05.089 --> 00:53:05.099 align:start position:0%
get deeper and deeper and deeper so if a
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
TR if a you know some sort of a of a
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
vessel was moving through them
 
00:53:13.010 --> 00:53:13.020 align:start position:0%
um it would tend to have less impact as
 
00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
they fill up with water as they fill as
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
they go down you're going to have more
 
00:53:18.530 --> 00:53:18.540 align:start position:0%
impact because it's going to be stirring
 
00:53:20.210 --> 00:53:20.220 align:start position:0%
things up you have less you have more
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
more of that Shoreline exposed it's
 
00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
lower you have undercurrents that come
 
00:53:27.410 --> 00:53:27.420 align:start position:0%
up and eat at the marsh
 
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
now that that is true until you get to
 
00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:31.260 align:start position:0%
the point until there's water until the
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
water actually goes all the way up over
 
00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:35.540 align:start position:0%
the marsh and covers the marsh surface
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
with again it can be two three four six
 
00:53:42.530 --> 00:53:42.540 align:start position:0%
eight inches of water and once you once
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's completely covered and TR and and
 
00:53:47.870 --> 00:53:47.880 align:start position:0%
vessels can now Traverse the entirety of
 
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
the marsh that becomes very destructive
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
to have those Vehicles out on what would
 
00:53:54.589 --> 00:53:54.599 align:start position:0%
be the flooded now flooded surface of
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
the marsh and I will tell you again I I
 
00:53:58.370 --> 00:53:58.380 align:start position:0%
really encourage you sometime to put on
 
00:54:00.410 --> 00:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
your Wellies and go out and walk around
 
00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
on a marsh as the tide is is coming over
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
it as you walk through the you the mummy
 
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
chogs the sticklebacks these little fish
 
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
that are in there are just as you kick
 
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
your feet along in the water they're
 
00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
just flying out of the water thousands
 
00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
and thousands and thousands of them and
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
so it's a really again I really
 
00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
encourage you to get out there and have
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
that experience
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
um it lets you understand sort of how
 
00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
alive these uh these marshes are
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
thank you sir I appreciate your
 
00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:36.849 align:start position:0%
thank you sir I appreciate your
clarification

00:54:36.849 --> 00:54:36.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
let's not see if there's any more
 
00:54:38.819 --> 00:54:41.170 align:start position:0%
let's not see if there's any more
questions

00:54:41.170 --> 00:54:41.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
uh no other questions for uh Mr deers
 
00:54:48.530 --> 00:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh thank you
 
00:54:50.690 --> 00:54:50.700 align:start position:0%
representative gumski you have a
 
00:54:54.170 --> 00:54:54.180 align:start position:0%
question for the captain dunlevitt thank
 
00:54:57.290 --> 00:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair tonight there seems to be a
 
00:54:58.730 --> 00:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
little bit of concern that I put based
 
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
on the questions on Warrington give me
 
00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
access to more information
 
00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:05.940 align:start position:0%
all right it's under a low tide
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
condition would you normally access that
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:12.770 --> 00:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:13.910 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
question

00:55:13.910 --> 00:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:15.780 align:start position:0%
um certainly there are certain Moorings
 
00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
that are in deep enough water where you
 
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
could be accessing them uh at all time
 
00:55:24.049 --> 00:55:24.059 align:start position:0%
all tide cycles certainly there are
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
times where some of the Moorings on our
 
00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:27.180 align:start position:0%
Seacoast and particularly in this area
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
where the boat itself that is on a
 
00:55:32.089 --> 00:55:32.099 align:start position:0%
mooring is resting high and dry on the
 
00:55:34.549 --> 00:55:34.559 align:start position:0%
mud flat or on the marsh so it all
 
00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
depends on on the location of The
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
Mooring and and the water depth or how
 
00:55:41.210 --> 00:55:41.220 align:start position:0%
close in proximity it is that that
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:53.640 align:start position:0%
no one else
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
all right I'm sure you have uh
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
representative Smith from the question
 
00:55:58.970 --> 00:55:58.980 align:start position:0%
representative Smith for a question of
 
00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
Captain Dunlap yes thank you very much
 
00:56:03.829 --> 00:56:03.839 align:start position:0%
and thank you Captain Don Levy
 
00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:04.549 align:start position:0%
and thank you Captain Don Levy
um

00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
the you mentioned previously uh today
 
00:56:11.329 --> 00:56:11.339 align:start position:0%
that the jet skis or the personal
 
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
watercraft have a jet propulsion system
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
and how does what happens to the you
 
00:56:21.890 --> 00:56:21.900 align:start position:0%
know an outboard motor the water the
 
00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
propeller shoots the water out the back
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
and then in a jet ski or a personal
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
watercraft what what as that happens
 
00:56:33.589 --> 00:56:33.599 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the water that is
 
00:56:35.930 --> 00:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
powering through
 
00:56:37.609 --> 00:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
I don't think I'm saying it correctly
 
00:56:37.619 --> 00:56:38.569 align:start position:0%
I don't think I'm saying it correctly
but

00:56:38.569 --> 00:56:38.579 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:56:40.849 --> 00:56:40.859 align:start position:0%
I I thank you representative I could do
 
00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:42.780 align:start position:0%
a quick comparison
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
with an outboard motor a traditional
 
00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
outboard motor or an inboard outboard
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
motor you've got the propeller that is
 
00:56:51.049 --> 00:56:51.059 align:start position:0%
is spinning in the water providing
 
00:56:51.059 --> 00:56:52.490 align:start position:0%
is spinning in the water providing
thrust

00:56:52.490 --> 00:56:52.500 align:start position:0%
thrust
 
00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:55.500 align:start position:0%
uh and and by turning the motor is how
 
00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
you turn direction you're directing that
 
00:56:57.660 --> 00:56:58.730 align:start position:0%
you turn direction you're directing that
thrust

00:56:58.730 --> 00:56:58.740 align:start position:0%
thrust
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
it is a very similar process with uh
 
00:57:05.390 --> 00:57:05.400 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft in that instead of
 
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
the propeller
 
00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:09.900 align:start position:0%
uh being exposed to the to the water and
 
00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:12.599 align:start position:0%
and spinning providing the thrust
 
00:57:15.890 --> 00:57:15.900 align:start position:0%
the jet pump simply has an internal
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
impeller they call it it's not exposed
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
but it's a similar device where it is
 
00:57:23.150 --> 00:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
sucking water through the bottom of the
 
00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.109 align:start position:0%
sucking water through the bottom of the
hull

00:57:24.109 --> 00:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
hull
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
going through this propeller system
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
and and and the water itself is then
 
00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
being pushed out through this nozzle
 
00:57:36.530 --> 00:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
it's a way jet pump and it is that that
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
thrust of water that is propelling the
 
00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:39.890 align:start position:0%
thrust of water that is propelling the
vessel

00:57:39.890 --> 00:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
vessel
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
and again the nozzle turns just like an
 
00:57:43.370 --> 00:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
outboard motor
 
00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:46.380 align:start position:0%
providing direction as you turn to and
 
00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:47.390 align:start position:0%
providing direction as you turn to and
from

00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
in the case of of
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
jet propulsion
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
it is typically very directional
 
00:57:56.089 --> 00:57:56.099 align:start position:0%
straight back from the machine there are
 
00:57:58.430 --> 00:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
some slight angle changes on some of the
 
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
machines and more modern machines
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
we're an outboard motor you have what
 
00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:04.440 align:start position:0%
you call power trim where you can you
 
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
can tilt it up and down electrically uh
 
00:58:10.609 --> 00:58:10.619 align:start position:0%
depending upon uh what attitude you want
 
00:58:12.290 --> 00:58:12.300 align:start position:0%
your boat to have as it goes to the
 
00:58:15.109 --> 00:58:15.119 align:start position:0%
water and also to account for shallow
 
00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:17.220 align:start position:0%
water you can lift the engine up out of
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
the water the jet pump is fixed to the
 
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
bottom of the personal watercraft
 
00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
but it is it is the throat the thrusts
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
are very similar
 
00:58:30.410 --> 00:58:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.109 --> 00:58:35.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much Captain
 
00:58:39.410 --> 00:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
for a second time thank you very much
 
00:58:43.789 --> 00:58:43.799 align:start position:0%
yeah all right you see uh no other
 
00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
questions on this bill
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
I will declare the work session no no
 
00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.829 align:start position:0%
I will declare the work session no no
no

00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:56.870 --> 00:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
representative Smith yeah I just wanted
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
to um clarify something
 
00:59:02.690 --> 00:59:02.700 align:start position:0%
um representative post asked about
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
um would any other areas be affected by
 
00:59:09.170 --> 00:59:09.180 align:start position:0%
possible future legislation and actually
 
00:59:12.770 --> 00:59:12.780 align:start position:0%
this bill does include uh areas of the
 
00:59:16.849 --> 00:59:16.859 align:start position:0%
Rye Marsh including Aquaman uh CV Creek
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
berries Brook Parsons Creek and those
 
00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
areas are very very shallow uh
 
00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:26.339 align:start position:0%
small tributaries and all come on Marsh
 
00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:27.780 align:start position:0%
I don't think I've ever seen enough
 
00:59:31.490 --> 00:59:31.500 align:start position:0%
water in it to be useful for any kind of
 
00:59:33.890 --> 00:59:33.900 align:start position:0%
motorized boat
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
um but I just wanted to bring that to
 
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:37.980 align:start position:0%
attention that where the bill does
 
00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
include other areas in Rye so it's
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
pretty much rye and Newcastle about each
 
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
other and so it includes other areas
 
00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
there doesn't include the navigable
 
00:59:52.010 --> 00:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:54.410 --> 00:59:54.420 align:start position:0%
is there any uh other representative
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
member of the committee who wishes to
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
make a comment statement uh based
 
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
basically part of this work session or
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh before I moved to Dollars before I
 
01:00:11.690 --> 01:00:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.289 --> 01:00:20.299 align:start position:0%
I think the basis
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
last year I voted for this bill
 
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
my concern
 
01:00:28.069 --> 01:00:28.079 align:start position:0%
is that one point of accessing a morning
 
01:00:30.049 --> 01:00:30.059 align:start position:0%
field if you are a homeowner in that
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
area and want to access a board field
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
with a personal autograph this will
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
prevents them representative gunski um
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
I'm having a really hard time hearing
 
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
you okay I will speak up louder how's
 
01:00:45.950 --> 01:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
that yeah that's better thank you I said
 
01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I have said that
 
01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
that I voted for this bill last year
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
but more information has come forward
 
01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
and my only concern is if I was a
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
resident in that area and I had a
 
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:01.500 align:start position:0%
morning and wanted to access that boring
 
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
with the personal watercraft I would be
 
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
unable to and it's apparent that
 
01:01:09.049 --> 01:01:09.059 align:start position:0%
uh if you have a large vessel on a
 
01:01:11.569 --> 01:01:11.579 align:start position:0%
mooring you need water to to keep that
 
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
vessel from
 
01:01:15.770 --> 01:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
and to access that under a knowing
 
01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:17.089 align:start position:0%
and to access that under a knowing
condition

01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
condition
 
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
I don't see
 
01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
of a turbidity would be that much of an
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
issue just accessing a morning feeling
 
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
this bill prohibits that that's the old
 
01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:27.119 align:start position:0%
that's the one hang up I have with this
 
01:01:27.119 --> 01:01:30.470 align:start position:0%
that's the one hang up I have with this
bill

01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
um but uh to my understanding it it only
 
01:01:39.470 --> 01:01:39.480 align:start position:0%
um prohibits jet propels
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
and not robots uh or is that correct I
 
01:01:46.809 --> 01:01:46.819 align:start position:0%
mean typically people access
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
water yes
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
yes he said jet propelled yeah and that
 
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
is a general
 
01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:57.970 align:start position:0%
is a general
Walker

01:01:57.970 --> 01:01:57.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.730 --> 01:02:01.740 align:start position:0%
yeah okay representative
 
01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.650 align:start position:0%
yeah okay representative
representative

01:02:03.650 --> 01:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I'm being a little
 
01:02:08.569 --> 01:02:08.579 align:start position:0%
redundant here but I would like to
 
01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
remind the committee that Mr cook was
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
unable to the answer the question of how
 
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:18.780 align:start position:0%
rare is the use of these vessels to get
 
01:02:22.190 --> 01:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
out to a moored boat in my experience it
 
01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
is much much more likely for someone to
 
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
just hop into a kayak or their row boat
 
01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:31.260 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a short distance from the
 
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
shore out to these moored boats and um
 
01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:37.619 align:start position:0%
as I say after 30 years of being on the
 
01:02:41.450 --> 01:02:41.460 align:start position:0%
water I have never seen anybody use one
 
01:02:44.510 --> 01:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
of these vessels to access
 
01:02:46.730 --> 01:02:46.740 align:start position:0%
um a moored boat it might be a little
 
01:02:49.609 --> 01:02:49.619 align:start position:0%
different here and but Mr cook seemed to
 
01:02:51.710 --> 01:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
be unable to say that this was anything
 
01:02:56.569 --> 01:02:56.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:59.510 --> 01:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly sir representative
 
01:03:02.329 --> 01:03:02.339 align:start position:0%
Kelly for a statement or question or
 
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
whatever yes yes statement um yeah my
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
concern if we put any type of of uh you
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
know uh if we we uh you know put an
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
exemption for something or do something
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
along those lines that it will add uh
 
01:03:18.289 --> 01:03:18.299 align:start position:0%
difficulty to enforcement
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
um it's very easy to put put signs up in
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
an area
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
um that that say no no personal
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
watercraft allowed within this Zone
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
um like there are for other boats in
 
01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
other areas
 
01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.410 align:start position:0%
other areas
um

01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:32.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
it's very easy to do that and then for
 
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
for Marine Patrol or residents to to
 
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
know that somebody is crossing a line
 
01:03:41.579 --> 01:03:42.890 align:start position:0%
know that somebody is crossing a line
uh

01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
literally so uh you know it seems like
 
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
the the danger to the area is very high
 
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
um and the right like the as we can see
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
from the map it's a very small area
 
01:03:56.510 --> 01:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
that's being Exempted so I think it'd be
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
much easier for us to just draw a line
 
01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:02.460 align:start position:0%
um and let people on the other side on
 
01:04:04.609 --> 01:04:04.619 align:start position:0%
one side use personal watercraft and on
 
01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:07.940 align:start position:0%
the other have it restricted
 
01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:09.530 align:start position:0%
the other have it restricted
yeah

01:04:09.530 --> 01:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative Frank
 
01:04:14.089 --> 01:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and get just to
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
follow on and
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
I agree with the bill
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
has written the One impact though
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
um as I'm looking at again the satellite
 
01:04:27.289 --> 01:04:27.299 align:start position:0%
map the number of houses and I wonder
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
how many of those houses have jet skis
 
01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
where the person bought a not
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
inexpensive house
 
01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:37.020 align:start position:0%
with the express purpose of having
 
01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
access to the water and now we pass this
 
01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:42.059 align:start position:0%
bill and that access to water is now
 
01:04:42.059 --> 01:04:43.730 align:start position:0%
bill and that access to water is now
denied

01:04:43.730 --> 01:04:43.740 align:start position:0%
denied
 
01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:46.559 align:start position:0%
because he's got his jet ski ramp out in
 
01:04:49.309 --> 01:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
the back that is no longer
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
he's no longer able to use because we
 
01:04:54.130 --> 01:04:54.140 align:start position:0%
passed his law and I
 
01:04:59.450 --> 01:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
as a landowner on water uh that would be
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
problematic to me
 
01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
um no one has testified to that but
 
01:05:07.010 --> 01:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
there's dozens of houses along there
 
01:05:13.309 --> 01:05:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
hello I love the question of uh again
 
01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.890 align:start position:0%
hello I love the question of uh again
captain

01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:18.900 align:start position:0%
captain
 
01:05:21.049 --> 01:05:21.059 align:start position:0%
uh will this
 
01:05:25.789 --> 01:05:25.799 align:start position:0%
will this bill if it passes deny people
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
who have
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
the uh those
 
01:05:33.770 --> 01:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
those uh boats the jet skis
 
01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
actually deny them access to the water
 
01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:40.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative yes as as
 
01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:45.299 align:start position:0%
written uh regardless as to whether or
 
01:05:47.450 --> 01:05:47.460 align:start position:0%
not a person owns Frontage along that
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
restricted area they would not be able
 
01:05:52.430 --> 01:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
to operate personal watercraft uh from
 
01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:54.059 align:start position:0%
their own property
 
01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
and if I can share Mr chairman just a
 
01:05:59.930 --> 01:05:59.940 align:start position:0%
for you I'm literally just looking at
 
01:05:59.940 --> 01:06:00.710 align:start position:0%
for you I'm literally just looking at
the

01:06:00.710 --> 01:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:02.760 align:start position:0%
at the uh
 
01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
this is a house that will be impacted by
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
the end
 
01:06:11.569 --> 01:06:11.579 align:start position:0%
and as you can see the the doc uh
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
extends out
 
01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
he's got
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
at least a large fishing boat two kayaks
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
looks to be what could be a personal
 
01:06:23.930 --> 01:06:23.940 align:start position:0%
watercraft a jet boat and I'm not I'm
 
01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:32.089 --> 01:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
so I mean that's an impact on
 
01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
people okay uh representative Smith did
 
01:06:39.289 --> 01:06:39.299 align:start position:0%
you have a comment yesterday
 
01:06:47.049 --> 01:06:47.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:52.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
actually Mr chair
 
01:06:58.190 --> 01:06:58.200 align:start position:0%
I was who's that
 
01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:00.380 align:start position:0%
who is uh
 
01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
um my satellite thing on my phone and it
 
01:07:08.930 --> 01:07:08.940 align:start position:0%
doesn't appear that the piscataqua river
 
01:07:11.210 --> 01:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
is within this
 
01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:14.569 align:start position:0%
is within this
area

01:07:14.569 --> 01:07:14.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:17.029 --> 01:07:17.039 align:start position:0%
so that's the area right there
 
01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:31.010 --> 01:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
represent post for a question sir uh
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:42.720 align:start position:0%
representative post
 
01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:44.650 align:start position:0%
representative post
foreign

01:07:44.650 --> 01:07:44.660 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:07:47.089 --> 01:07:47.099 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
01:07:47.099 --> 01:07:48.289 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
question

01:07:48.289 --> 01:07:48.299 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:52.559 align:start position:0%
um my concern on this is not only will
 
01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
be will we be restricting other people
 
01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:56.089 align:start position:0%
be will we be restricting other people
but

01:07:56.089 --> 01:07:56.099 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
um what I understood from Mr
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
um deers was that when the water was
 
01:08:06.650 --> 01:08:06.660 align:start position:0%
higher it was not as damaging instead it
 
01:08:08.349 --> 01:08:08.359 align:start position:0%
was just bad
 
01:08:10.970 --> 01:08:10.980 align:start position:0%
well he also
 
01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:12.130 align:start position:0%
well he also
um

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:12.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:13.530 --> 01:08:13.540 align:start position:0%
spoke about
 
01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:14.870 align:start position:0%
spoke about
[Music]

01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:08:17.209 --> 01:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
um the nutrients coming in and I would
 
01:08:20.169 --> 01:08:20.179 align:start position:0%
assume that would be from the homes
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
surrounding this area as well and I
 
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
I wonder if we're really trying to
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
protect this area if
 
01:08:34.249 --> 01:08:34.259 align:start position:0%
um there should be more
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
um uh concentration on everything that
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
is contributing to the marshes
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
um demise over there so
 
01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.430 align:start position:0%
um demise over there so
um

01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:48.349 --> 01:08:48.359 align:start position:0%
was there a marine biologist or anything
 
01:08:51.410 --> 01:08:51.420 align:start position:0%
that worked with the committee
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
um on this
 
01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.370 align:start position:0%
um on this
foreign

01:08:55.370 --> 01:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:08:58.510 --> 01:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.169 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
I think this is representative Smith I
 
01:09:05.209 --> 01:09:05.219 align:start position:0%
don't know if a marine biologist would
 
01:09:08.990 --> 01:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
be the authority on marshlands
 
01:09:11.570 --> 01:09:11.580 align:start position:0%
I think of them more in like underwater
 
01:09:15.289 --> 01:09:15.299 align:start position:0%
oceans and Bays whereas not in four to
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
eight inch deep Waters which is why we
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
we did talk a lot with uh Mr deers from
 
01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:24.900 align:start position:0%
Des because he does have a lot of work
 
01:09:27.410 --> 01:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
that he has done with the marshlands
 
01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay to quickly answer uh representative
 
01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
close question we did receive the letter
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
from uh Professor Burdick at UNH
 
01:09:45.349 --> 01:09:45.359 align:start position:0%
um talking who is a associate research
 
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
Professor for the Jackson estuarian
 
01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.669 align:start position:0%
Professor for the Jackson estuarian
Laboratory

01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
Laboratory
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
um who is in favor of the bill but my
 
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
main point of the statement was that
 
01:09:57.530 --> 01:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
we've now held two public sessions for
 
01:09:59.090 --> 01:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
this uh bill
 
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
um and the only resident of of Newmarket
 
01:10:03.890 --> 01:10:03.900 align:start position:0%
who's who's come to the session has been
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
a representative who has spoken in favor
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
01:10:09.169 --> 01:10:09.179 align:start position:0%
um we've given people every opportunity
 
01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
including two years of this bill to come
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
forward and speak about how it could
 
01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
affect them personally and we have not
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
heard any so yes there might be that one
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
picture end of in the video but but I
 
01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
was trying to go doctor doc to find one
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
as well I could not find one that was
 
01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:27.719 align:start position:0%
clearly a personal watercraft
 
01:10:33.890 --> 01:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:38.820 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
anyone else for comment
 
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
all right I closed the uh work session
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
and open the this bill to Executive
 
01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.570 align:start position:0%
and open the this bill to Executive
sessions

01:10:56.570 --> 01:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
sessions
 
01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:58.250 align:start position:0%
sessions
uh

01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:01.250 --> 01:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative Smith uh Mo I recognize
 
01:11:03.770 --> 01:11:03.780 align:start position:0%
you for a motion thank you Mr chair I
 
01:11:06.290 --> 01:11:06.300 align:start position:0%
make a motion of ought to pass on House
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
Bill 184 and I would like to speak to my
 
01:11:11.930 --> 01:11:11.940 align:start position:0%
motion when it's appropriate
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
uh let's do I hear a second
 
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
seconded seconded by
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly representative
 
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
Kelly uh representative Smith do you
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%

01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
and thank you
 
01:11:29.689 --> 01:11:29.699 align:start position:0%
um this bill has had a lot of work done
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
on it and because we kind of were asking
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
similar questions last year uh Captain
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
dunleavy's team out on the Seacoast took
 
01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:41.100 align:start position:0%
us out on a field trip so we could see
 
01:11:44.689 --> 01:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
the exact area we were talking about and
 
01:11:47.990 --> 01:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of that we all understood a
 
01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
lot better what we cannot really
 
01:11:52.130 --> 01:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
understand just looking at satellite
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
photos and Mr deers commented about how
 
01:11:59.330 --> 01:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
quickly the tide can go in and out and
 
01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:01.380 align:start position:0%
you can be in a foot of water and all of
 
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
a sudden there's no water which can be a
 
01:12:05.570 --> 01:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
huge problem and I had that experience
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
kayaking a few years ago in the Great
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
Bay where there was plenty of water and
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
I was paddling around and like within
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
minutes all of a sudden I was on a mud
 
01:12:17.390 --> 01:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
flat and I was stuck for an hour until
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
the tides started coming in again so I
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
think this bill is important it's
 
01:12:25.010 --> 01:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
important for the Ecology of the area
 
01:12:28.010 --> 01:12:28.020 align:start position:0%
and representative Murray in her
 
01:12:31.189 --> 01:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
testimony was quoting documents from the
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
um the personal watercraft industry
 
01:12:36.169 --> 01:12:36.179 align:start position:0%
about how they recommend that they stay
 
01:12:38.330 --> 01:12:38.340 align:start position:0%
out of shallow areas and I think that
 
01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
this bill is a step in the right
 
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.010 align:start position:0%
this bill is a step in the right
direction

01:12:42.010 --> 01:12:42.020 align:start position:0%
direction
 
01:12:45.610 --> 01:12:45.620 align:start position:0%
environmentally and for our Precious
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
marshlands on the Seacoast thank you
 
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:51.169 align:start position:0%
marshlands on the Seacoast thank you
uh

01:12:51.169 --> 01:12:51.179 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
Kelly what was that Kelly would you like
 
01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.689 align:start position:0%
 
wave

01:12:59.689 --> 01:12:59.699 align:start position:0%
wave
 
01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:06.290 --> 01:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
uh is there anyone else who'd like to
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.390 --> 01:13:17.400 align:start position:0%
I would ask those who have had who have
 
01:13:19.189 --> 01:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
expressed concerns
 
01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:23.460 align:start position:0%
this on issue of
 
01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:24.470 align:start position:0%
this on issue of
because

01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:13:28.330 --> 01:13:28.340 align:start position:0%
of its personal watercraft that might be
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
prevented from using
 
01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle alone personal watercraft
 
01:13:39.229 --> 01:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
we met their use during the rare times
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
that they need to take it out
 
01:13:43.689 --> 01:13:43.699 align:start position:0%
from their property
 
01:13:48.229 --> 01:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
is there a amendment that anyone feels
 
01:13:48.239 --> 01:13:50.149 align:start position:0%
is there a amendment that anyone feels
might

01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
might
 
01:14:01.330 --> 01:14:01.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:03.790 --> 01:14:03.800 align:start position:0%
to represent close to the question
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
representative post
 
01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
you have a question uh yes
 
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:12.300 align:start position:0%
um i i two things
 
01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:15.590 align:start position:0%
um i i two things
um

01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:18.649 --> 01:14:18.659 align:start position:0%
I I would make an amendment
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
um on that but my concern is on this
 
01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
bill that we're we're trying trying to
 
01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:27.229 align:start position:0%
bill that we're we're trying trying to
preserve

01:14:27.229 --> 01:14:27.239 align:start position:0%
preserve
 
01:14:30.169 --> 01:14:30.179 align:start position:0%
this Marsh area but we're only looking
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
at one side of it
 
01:14:37.070 --> 01:14:37.080 align:start position:0%
and I I just it targets one specific
 
01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:42.840 align:start position:0%
vote vote I mean excuse me vote and um
 
01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.270 align:start position:0%
vote vote I mean excuse me vote and um
you

01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:14:46.430 --> 01:14:46.440 align:start position:0%
um the representative just spoke about
 
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
how she got stuck on the marsh and I I
 
01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:52.440 align:start position:0%
believe people with personal watercraft
 
01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:55.860 align:start position:0%
when they see a low low area like that
 
01:14:58.490 --> 01:14:58.500 align:start position:0%
aren't going to go in there and ruin
 
01:15:00.530 --> 01:15:00.540 align:start position:0%
their boats
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
um so I'm concerned that we're not
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:14.590 --> 01:15:14.600 align:start position:0%
the representatives saying thank you
 
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure I'm successfully
 
01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
lowering my hand but now that I I just
 
01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
feel that we need to step back and and
 
01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
look at the big picture here we have a
 
01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
lot of information
 
01:15:32.450 --> 01:15:32.460 align:start position:0%
scientific information about the impact
 
01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
of these vessels on the marsh on the
 
01:15:40.490 --> 01:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
other side we have no evidence that
 
01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
there would be an adverse impact we
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
don't know if any of the people who live
 
01:15:47.810 --> 01:15:47.820 align:start position:0%
around the marsh actually have one that
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
they want to use we don't know if
 
01:15:52.550 --> 01:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's anybody who is using these boats
 
01:15:55.610 --> 01:15:55.620 align:start position:0%
to access their moored boats so we're
 
01:15:59.090 --> 01:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
taking a known uh harm that can happen
 
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
and has been observed and other marshes
 
01:16:05.950 --> 01:16:05.960 align:start position:0%
and we're weighing it against
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
speculation that somebody might the
 
01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
inconvenienced by passing this
 
01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
legislation to me that's a very clear uh
 
01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:19.750 align:start position:0%
path to a decision to pass this bill
 
01:16:19.750 --> 01:16:22.750 align:start position:0%
path to a decision to pass this bill
[Music]

01:16:22.750 --> 01:16:22.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:16:25.250 --> 01:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
yeah I um
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that the hard work and the
 
01:16:31.189 --> 01:16:31.199 align:start position:0%
thought that has gone into this
 
01:16:31.199 --> 01:16:33.110 align:start position:0%
thought that has gone into this
um

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:35.520 align:start position:0%
if I was a resident and I wasn't
 
01:16:37.490 --> 01:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
involved in politics I didn't know this
 
01:16:39.770 --> 01:16:39.780 align:start position:0%
was going on and I had a twenty thousand
 
01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
dollar vote
 
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:43.260 align:start position:0%
on a million dollar house
 
01:16:45.649 --> 01:16:45.659 align:start position:0%
and I had the legislature come up to me
 
01:16:46.910 --> 01:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
and say hey
 
01:16:49.070 --> 01:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
you got you can't use your boat in your
 
01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:50.090 align:start position:0%
you got you can't use your boat in your
house

01:16:50.090 --> 01:16:50.100 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:16:52.130 --> 01:16:52.140 align:start position:0%
that would be a problem I don't know
 
01:16:54.530 --> 01:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
that that exists represent US Bank I
 
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
agree I don't know whether that exists
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh potentially uh an endemic that would
 
01:17:03.709 --> 01:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
say a grandfather Applause
 
01:17:06.310 --> 01:17:06.320 align:start position:0%
they said those with boats in that area
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
as of the date that the bill passed
 
01:17:11.209 --> 01:17:11.219 align:start position:0%
I don't know whether that's reasonable
 
01:17:13.610 --> 01:17:13.620 align:start position:0%
or not but you asked for an alternative
 
01:17:13.620 --> 01:17:15.229 align:start position:0%
or not but you asked for an alternative
Amendment

01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and that would address
 
01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
potentially some of Representative
 
01:17:20.990 --> 01:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
dunsty's questions about those that
 
01:17:22.729 --> 01:17:22.739 align:start position:0%
access the vote which again we don't
 
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:24.900 align:start position:0%
know how many that is it could be one it
 
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
could be zero I don't know
 
01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
yeah representative Cohen
 
01:17:40.070 --> 01:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Colin for a statement
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much for recognizing
 
01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
it I just wanted to address
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
um Representatives post comment I
 
01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
thought she made an excellent point that
 
01:17:51.649 --> 01:17:51.659 align:start position:0%
it would be good to look at the entire
 
01:17:55.330 --> 01:17:55.340 align:start position:0%
problem here to protect the area
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
I would say that I would just suggest
 
01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:58.970 align:start position:0%
I would say that I would just suggest
that

01:17:58.970 --> 01:17:58.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:01.610 --> 01:18:01.620 align:start position:0%
if that's I agree with that look at the
 
01:18:04.010 --> 01:18:04.020 align:start position:0%
whole area but this is a stepping stone
 
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
if we agree that what this does makes a
 
01:18:09.709 --> 01:18:09.719 align:start position:0%
step towards what we want to do I would
 
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
just suggest we pass this bill and
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
consider in our next session next year
 
01:18:19.490 --> 01:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
The Next Step that gets the com if it's
 
01:18:21.169 --> 01:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
identity representative post can help us
 
01:18:23.689 --> 01:18:23.699 align:start position:0%
and if it was a complete picture is get
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
the complete picture and amend the bill
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
next year but let's not wait a year to
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:34.159 --> 01:18:36.050 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:18:36.050 --> 01:18:36.060 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:39.910 --> 01:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly for a statement
 
01:18:42.169 --> 01:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
back to the bill
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
yeah so I just uh to respond to
 
01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton's um proposal I
 
01:18:49.010 --> 01:18:49.020 align:start position:0%
just weary that if we add something
 
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
along those lines it'll be very
 
01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
difficult to enforce and if we if if
 
01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
other uh you know personal watercraft
 
01:18:57.890 --> 01:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
users see somebody using a watercraft
 
01:18:59.930 --> 01:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
inside that restricted area where the
 
01:19:02.689 --> 01:19:02.699 align:start position:0%
signage is up it'll be
 
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
much more difficult for them to
 
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
understand the distinction between the
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
marsh and the greater piscataqua River
 
01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:10.550 align:start position:0%
marsh and the greater piscataqua River
area

01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:19:19.370 --> 01:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
anyone else speak to well you have
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative Patsy sir
 
01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh is it that that's
 
01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.890 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh is it that that's
it

01:19:29.890 --> 01:19:29.900 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:19:33.950 --> 01:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for permitting me to speak
 
01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
um I've been listening to the
 
01:19:38.570 --> 01:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
conversation and it seems to me that if
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
you pass the bill and you have a couple
 
01:19:44.649 --> 01:19:44.659 align:start position:0%
of homeowners that are opposed to it
 
01:19:49.070 --> 01:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
that will uh clearly bring them out
 
01:19:52.370 --> 01:19:52.380 align:start position:0%
um in opposition and at that point you
 
01:19:55.010 --> 01:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
could consider an amendment it is my
 
01:19:58.070 --> 01:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
understanding that we have passed other
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
bills in the past
 
01:20:02.470 --> 01:20:02.480 align:start position:0%
um where we thought it was a good bill
 
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
uh it went into law and then we found
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
out that perhaps there were some things
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
we didn't think about and amendments
 
01:20:13.729 --> 01:20:13.739 align:start position:0%
were then brought forward in future
 
01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
sessions so since you haven't had
 
01:20:19.010 --> 01:20:19.020 align:start position:0%
anybody opposed to the bill if you pass
 
01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
the bill and there are people that are
 
01:20:25.310 --> 01:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
um violently opposed with I think
 
01:20:27.229 --> 01:20:27.239 align:start position:0%
um Representatives will be hearing from
 
01:20:30.350 --> 01:20:30.360 align:start position:0%
them at that point and and then they can
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
consider future legislation to change it
 
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
yeah representative post
 
01:20:40.430 --> 01:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
representative post for a statement
 
01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.130 align:start position:0%
representative post for a statement
um

01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:45.890 --> 01:20:45.900 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much I I I'm still
 
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
it's more of a question
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
um having trouble with this because if
 
01:20:52.510 --> 01:20:52.520 align:start position:0%
we are so concerned to protect this area
 
01:20:55.490 --> 01:20:55.500 align:start position:0%
why don't we just ban all votes because
 
01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:57.780 align:start position:0%
if they get in there during a time when
 
01:21:00.050 --> 01:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
the tide goes out and they end up stuck
 
01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
there they're going to be walking in
 
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:03.719 align:start position:0%
those marshes or trying to get someone
 
01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:05.940 align:start position:0%
to come get them out
 
01:21:07.970 --> 01:21:07.980 align:start position:0%
um and I just feel like this is
 
01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
targeting obviously it is targeting
 
01:21:14.209 --> 01:21:14.219 align:start position:0%
um and and I think if we really want to
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
protect it I think we have to put
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
um other boats in there I I think we
 
01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
representative Spang for actually well
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
what would be is it a question or is it
 
01:21:38.510 --> 01:21:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:45.890 --> 01:21:45.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative spank on mute please
 
01:21:53.270 --> 01:21:53.280 align:start position:0%
all right are we in the next session so
 
01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
we can make statements or are we asking
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
questions we are made we are an
 
01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
executive session we are to speak on the
 
01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
bill if you have a question that you
 
01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
would suppose in this way of a statement
 
01:22:07.729 --> 01:22:07.739 align:start position:0%
uh on the bill that fine we're not
 
01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:10.380 align:start position:0%
asking questions of anybody right yes we
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
are an executive assess each other dudes
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
me just fine
 
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
um this is our second hearing basically
 
01:22:20.890 --> 01:22:20.900 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
there have been plenty of opportunities
 
01:22:27.530 --> 01:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
for people to come out who are uh who
 
01:22:30.830 --> 01:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
would be adversely affected by this
 
01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
um and we have not heard opposition so I
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
think for us to be making up uh
 
01:22:39.410 --> 01:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
hypothetical opponents who are going to
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
be damaged by this is not
 
01:22:45.709 --> 01:22:45.719 align:start position:0%
um addressing the uh the problem uh
 
01:22:45.719 --> 01:22:47.510 align:start position:0%
um addressing the uh the problem uh
rationally

01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
rationally
 
01:22:50.630 --> 01:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
um I would like to ask the chair
 
01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:54.300 align:start position:0%
did we or did we not get a list of
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
people who were supporters of this bill
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
that included a lot of the people uh who
 
01:23:03.649 --> 01:23:03.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.659 --> 01:23:05.350 align:start position:0%
 
no

01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:23:10.130 --> 01:23:10.140 align:start position:0%
the list that on the remote testify uh
 
01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
ads list of three people that's that's
 
01:23:13.970 --> 01:23:13.980 align:start position:0%
for today
 
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
I know there were people who were on a
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
list uh when we first had this right I
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't have that in front of me at the
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
moments I can't read that out and I know
 
01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:28.760 align:start position:0%
that there were a lot of
 
01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
letters and things that you should you
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
and everyone else should have gotten yes
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
uh so to be so everybody will know that
 
01:23:39.470 --> 01:23:39.480 align:start position:0%
the number of people
 
01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:42.300 align:start position:0%
so I would proffer then that this
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
indicates that it was uh this is not a
 
01:23:47.810 --> 01:23:47.820 align:start position:0%
sneak attack that the people in the area
 
01:23:50.450 --> 01:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
were well aware that this bill was out
 
01:23:52.490 --> 01:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
and the fact that we've had no
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
opposition to it probably indicates that
 
01:23:59.209 --> 01:23:59.219 align:start position:0%
uh that we're on firm ground in terms of
 
01:24:01.790 --> 01:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
passing this bill
 
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
representative Smithson
 
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
representative Smith first uh on the
 
01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:09.169 align:start position:0%
representative Smith first uh on the
motion

01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
um clarify uh representative post is
 
01:24:17.770 --> 01:24:17.780 align:start position:0%
concerned that we're singling out the um
 
01:24:20.330 --> 01:24:20.340 align:start position:0%
the personal watercraft but the
 
01:24:23.930 --> 01:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
difference between a um a motorboat uh
 
01:24:26.090 --> 01:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
and a or you know a regular outboard
 
01:24:29.330 --> 01:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
motorboat and a personal watercraft are
 
01:24:32.209 --> 01:24:32.219 align:start position:0%
as Captain I just Captain Don Levy said
 
01:24:33.950 --> 01:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
that if you have an outboard you can
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
like pull the motor halfway out of the
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
water so it has a lot less draft and the
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
personal watercraft do not have that
 
01:24:43.490 --> 01:24:43.500 align:start position:0%
option they're all set they're at the
 
01:24:45.110 --> 01:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
set at the same setting all the time
 
01:24:49.910 --> 01:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:52.090 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:24:52.090 --> 01:24:52.100 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
anyone else which this big
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
there's a very cool thank you very
 
01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.270 align:start position:0%
there's a very cool thank you very
quickly

01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wanted to say I'm I'm in
 
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill uh as a boater as a
 
01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
kayaker and a sailboater and sometimes
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
using an outboard it seems clear to me
 
01:25:15.169 --> 01:25:15.179 align:start position:0%
from my experience maybe I'm out of
 
01:25:17.450 --> 01:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
touch but people typically don't access
 
01:25:20.270 --> 01:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
their boats with a jet ski
 
01:25:23.030 --> 01:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
maybe that that's probably quite rare I
 
01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:23.930 align:start position:0%
maybe that that's probably quite rare I
think

01:25:23.930 --> 01:25:23.940 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:25:27.709 --> 01:25:27.719 align:start position:0%
um row boats or a small outboard a boat
 
01:25:29.270 --> 01:25:29.280 align:start position:0%
with a small outboard is probably a lot
 
01:25:32.390 --> 01:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
more common and just as a as a kayaker
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
and a person that enjoys these sort of
 
01:25:36.530 --> 01:25:36.540 align:start position:0%
marshy areas
 
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
jet skis
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
seem quite out of place in them um so I
 
01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
I just don't feel like we're
 
01:25:45.709 --> 01:25:45.719 align:start position:0%
doing anybody any harm I don't think
 
01:25:48.130 --> 01:25:48.140 align:start position:0%
that jet skis belong in these little
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:59.689 --> 01:25:59.699 align:start position:0%
let's try some no further questions
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative Botley does her hand up
 
01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:10.650 align:start position:0%
yeah I see what was that
 
01:26:10.650 --> 01:26:10.850 align:start position:0%
yeah I see what was that
[Music]

01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:10.860 align:start position:0%

01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
I just went back and tried to find
 
01:26:31.310 --> 01:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
everything we got in support or if on HB
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
184 uh and I found four letters of
 
01:26:38.870 --> 01:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
support from various people in the area
 
01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:43.500 align:start position:0%
and nothing in uh against it
 
01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:49.550 align:start position:0%
and nothing in uh against it
foreign

01:26:49.550 --> 01:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
are we ready for
 
01:26:54.890 --> 01:26:54.900 align:start position:0%
ready for a vote
 
01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:59.990 align:start position:0%
ready for a vote
yes

01:26:59.990 --> 01:27:00.000 align:start position:0%

okay

01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%

to speak on his motion thank you Mr
chair

01:31:37.129 --> 01:31:37.139 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
uh have you been a member of the late
 
01:31:40.610 --> 01:31:40.620 align:start position:0%
Club Commission
 
01:31:43.250 --> 01:31:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh this is not a reputation that came
 
01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
out of the commission you heard uh a lot
 
01:31:49.310 --> 01:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
of testimony on this bill saying that
 
01:31:52.490 --> 01:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
this is uh this is not a ban on weight
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
folks and that is correct this is not a
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.669 --> 01:32:01.679 align:start position:0%
so uh proponents
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
of this particular bill
 
01:32:06.830 --> 01:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
have made statements that this is the
 
01:32:09.410 --> 01:32:09.420 align:start position:0%
first step of some to come so there is
 
01:32:12.050 --> 01:32:12.060 align:start position:0%
future legislation behind this bill to
 
01:32:14.570 --> 01:32:14.580 align:start position:0%
make restrictions
 
01:32:16.669 --> 01:32:16.679 align:start position:0%
I think during this time in the state of
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire where many families are
 
01:32:21.050 --> 01:32:21.060 align:start position:0%
locked in their homes and some of the
 
01:32:22.490 --> 01:32:22.500 align:start position:0%
only enjoyment they have are on our
 
01:32:24.410 --> 01:32:24.420 align:start position:0%
Lakes I think restrictions are the last
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
thing we want to do
 
01:32:28.729 --> 01:32:28.739 align:start position:0%
heads of that and obviously some other
 
01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
things I think that this is a bad Bill
 
01:32:34.010 --> 01:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative Mayfield to speak to
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:32:43.610 --> 01:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
um I agree with representative bunski
 
01:32:45.169 --> 01:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
and I would just like to point out that
 
01:32:46.370 --> 01:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
while the committee definitely
 
01:32:48.290 --> 01:32:48.300 align:start position:0%
understands that there is an issue with
 
01:32:50.930 --> 01:32:50.940 align:start position:0%
these type of boats that we do have laws
 
01:32:52.370 --> 01:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
in place that already and currently
 
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
focus on the behavior of the voters
 
01:32:57.470 --> 01:32:57.480 align:start position:0%
rather than the actual boat itself
 
01:32:59.689 --> 01:32:59.699 align:start position:0%
um I agree this is an itl and expedient
 
01:33:01.010 --> 01:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
to legislate
 
01:33:02.990 --> 01:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
um that we do not need to Define and
 
01:33:05.149 --> 01:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
ultimately regulate and potentially ban
 
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
this type of a boat that it's not good
 
01:33:08.810 --> 01:33:08.820 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire it's not good for our
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
citizens our Lakes are short little
 
01:33:14.209 --> 01:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
Waterfront are really important to our
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
state and we should support those
 
01:33:19.070 --> 01:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.450 --> 01:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who would like to
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you have representative Smith
 
01:33:30.050 --> 01:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
uh representative Smith to speak on the
 
01:33:32.510 --> 01:33:32.520 align:start position:0%
motion yeah thank you Mr chair
 
01:33:35.330 --> 01:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
um the Wake vote commission worked for
 
01:33:40.010 --> 01:33:40.020 align:start position:0%
over a year to try to learn more about
 
01:33:43.669 --> 01:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
them and uh and the effects that they
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
have on the environment on a budding
 
01:33:50.570 --> 01:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
landowners and on people swimming in the
 
01:33:54.470 --> 01:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
water and various other issues were and
 
01:33:57.290 --> 01:33:57.300 align:start position:0%
the safety issues also we already passed
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
the wake surfing Bill and that was the
 
01:34:01.250 --> 01:34:01.260 align:start position:0%
unanimous recommendation from the
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
commission when I introduced the idea of
 
01:34:07.310 --> 01:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
defining wake boats at the Wake Boat
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
Commission the reason my reasoning for
 
01:34:11.810 --> 01:34:11.820 align:start position:0%
thinking it would be a good idea to
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
Define them is because we had 20 over 20
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
people on the commission and the boats
 
01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
were referred to as wake boats ballast
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
boats tow boats
 
01:34:25.250 --> 01:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:34:27.830 --> 01:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
different people from different even in
 
01:34:29.990 --> 01:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
the same industry referred to them by
 
01:34:31.970 --> 01:34:31.980 align:start position:0%
two or three different names and I
 
01:34:33.290 --> 01:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
thought that
 
01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
um there I believe there is some
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
regulation needed and that if everyone
 
01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
knew what a wake boat actually was
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
and up until I served on the commission
 
01:34:47.090 --> 01:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
I was not even sure what a wake boat was
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
or what one looked like so I thought
 
01:34:52.490 --> 01:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
defining wake boats would be a good idea
 
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
um I am not the prime sponsor of the
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill I'm one of the co-sponsors but
 
01:35:00.470 --> 01:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
um I believe that defining the boats
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
does not necessarily mean regulating
 
01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
them although there are certain areas
 
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
like similar to the marshlands that we
 
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
just talked about in the last bill and
 
01:35:14.330 --> 01:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
shallow areas of lakes and shallow coves
 
01:35:17.470 --> 01:35:17.480 align:start position:0%
where some regulation may be needed
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
further than the 150 foot Zone that we
 
01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
now have as a buffer
 
01:35:24.890 --> 01:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:26.350 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:35:29.629 --> 01:35:29.639 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly for uh to speak on
 
01:35:31.129 --> 01:35:31.139 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
01:35:33.470 --> 01:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so to follow up on representative
 
01:35:36.410 --> 01:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
Smith's points I I agree I like the the
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
definition of wake boat does not mean a
 
01:35:40.250 --> 01:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
band I do not support a ban on Wake
 
01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:41.510 align:start position:0%
band I do not support a ban on Wake
boats

01:35:41.510 --> 01:35:41.520 align:start position:0%
boats
 
01:35:45.649 --> 01:35:45.659 align:start position:0%
um but as a a CDL operator a wake boat
 
01:35:49.250 --> 01:35:49.260 align:start position:0%
is every year uh the Wake boats will
 
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
continue to increase the amount of
 
01:35:52.610 --> 01:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
ballast that they produce as to as
 
01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:55.320 align:start position:0%
engineering and Technology go along it
 
01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
is important I think it's important that
 
01:35:58.250 --> 01:35:58.260 align:start position:0%
this committee look at them as we go
 
01:36:00.470 --> 01:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
along that route just as a CDL operator
 
01:36:02.390 --> 01:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
I have to go through additional testing
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
to operate a truck over the gross weight
 
01:36:08.090 --> 01:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
of 26 000 pounds I think that as these
 
01:36:09.890 --> 01:36:09.900 align:start position:0%
ballasts get larger and larger it is
 
01:36:13.910 --> 01:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
important that they need it may become
 
01:36:16.850 --> 01:36:16.860 align:start position:0%
um it may become necessary for this
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
committee to issue additional permitting
 
01:36:22.189 --> 01:36:22.199 align:start position:0%
for those who wish to operate them so
 
01:36:25.310 --> 01:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
for a driver increasing the age to 21 or
 
01:36:26.450 --> 01:36:26.460 align:start position:0%
something along those lines and that
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
would require a definition of the boat
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
itself again I don't support an outright
 
01:36:33.649 --> 01:36:33.659 align:start position:0%
ban obviously I think we've also said
 
01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
that at some point during this committee
 
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
but just as we have larger vehicles that
 
01:36:42.470 --> 01:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
require special licensing a a additional
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
ballast in the boat that could
 
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
potentially cause greater harm by
 
01:36:49.850 --> 01:36:49.860 align:start position:0%
mistaking mistakenly operating it in a
 
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
certain way may require
 
01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:54.229 align:start position:0%
certain way may require
additional

01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
additional
 
01:36:56.030 --> 01:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
you know licensing or additional
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
you know anyone else we should speak to
 
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
the building so there are no further
 
01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.550 align:start position:0%
the building so there are no further
hands-ups

01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
hands-ups
 
01:37:09.649 --> 01:37:09.659 align:start position:0%
representative Botley got her hand up as
 
01:37:11.649 --> 01:37:11.659 align:start position:0%
well who is
 
01:37:14.530 --> 01:37:14.540 align:start position:0%
the residence
 
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh yeah uh one of the things I would
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
like to point out is that uh
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
when I spoke on this bill not two years
 
01:37:27.649 --> 01:37:27.659 align:start position:0%
ago three years ago
 
01:37:27.659 --> 01:37:28.850 align:start position:0%
ago three years ago
um

01:37:28.850 --> 01:37:28.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:37.250 --> 01:37:37.260 align:start position:0%
the amount of ballast that's being put
 
01:37:40.490 --> 01:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
in the boats is just increasing and
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
increasing and increasing and I have an
 
01:37:47.689 --> 01:37:47.699 align:start position:0%
advertisement for one that well we heard
 
01:37:49.729 --> 01:37:49.739 align:start position:0%
about one
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
um where there was 2 800 pounds of
 
01:37:55.030 --> 01:37:55.040 align:start position:0%
ballast but I can find other
 
01:37:58.010 --> 01:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
advertisements of up to 5 000 and then
 
01:38:00.890 --> 01:38:00.900 align:start position:0%
even saying oh no we can give you six
 
01:38:03.169 --> 01:38:03.179 align:start position:0%
thousand pounds of ballast so I think
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
that is being promoted in the industry
 
01:38:10.070 --> 01:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
and every time you increase the amount
 
01:38:13.129 --> 01:38:13.139 align:start position:0%
of ballast you are basically increasing
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
the amount of weight and so uh
 
01:38:20.110 --> 01:38:20.120 align:start position:0%
you know I'm simply speaking to that uh
 
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly uh in support of we
 
01:38:25.970 --> 01:38:25.980 align:start position:0%
may have to think of things in the
 
01:38:30.950 --> 01:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
future that uh help out a bit
 
01:38:34.250 --> 01:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative is there any
 
01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
other representative for the first time
 
01:38:39.290 --> 01:38:39.300 align:start position:0%
representative okay representative
 
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
grassy for the first time yeah I'm I'm
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to be voting against this motion
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
because I feel it's important one of the
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
things that we listen to is we say well
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
people want to enjoy our Lakes
 
01:38:51.169 --> 01:38:51.179 align:start position:0%
and when you look at the environment the
 
01:38:53.090 --> 01:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
natural environment that we have here in
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire that's the
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
true New Hampshire advantage
 
01:38:57.530 --> 01:38:57.540 align:start position:0%
and we've looked at a number of
 
01:39:00.050 --> 01:39:00.060 align:start position:0%
instances and not just wake boats but
 
01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:02.100 align:start position:0%
other things such as ATVs and everything
 
01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:03.229 align:start position:0%
other things such as ATVs and everything
where

01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:39:05.410 --> 01:39:05.420 align:start position:0%
we've seen a significant amount of
 
01:39:07.610 --> 01:39:07.620 align:start position:0%
environmental damage
 
01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
and to make the parade off that it's
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay to damage the environment because
 
01:39:16.189 --> 01:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
seem to doesn't seem to fit I think we
 
01:39:20.930 --> 01:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
we can do both
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
and by defining weight boats we're able
 
01:39:25.970 --> 01:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
to provide sensible regulation
 
01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:28.739 align:start position:0%
that maybe a wake boat on certain lakes
 
01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
or ponds is not a place to be
 
01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to increase the distance
 
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
from the shore
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
because of the damage these boats are
 
01:39:37.560 --> 01:39:38.390 align:start position:0%
because of the damage these boats are
doing

01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
doing
 
01:39:41.450 --> 01:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
just say let them do their damage we
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
don't care
 
01:39:45.890 --> 01:39:45.900 align:start position:0%
um eventually the advantage that we have
 
01:39:47.090 --> 01:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire is going to go
 
01:39:49.790 --> 01:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
away because we'll have destroyed it
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
I think this is the wrong time to just
 
01:39:54.229 --> 01:39:54.239 align:start position:0%
say no to this maybe it's something we
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
want to retain
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
um or uh and take a longer look at it
 
01:40:02.270 --> 01:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
instead of just saying no so I'll be
 
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
voting against this motion and we'll
 
01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:06.719 align:start position:0%
hopefully uh we'll be able to retain
 
01:40:08.629 --> 01:40:08.639 align:start position:0%
this bill maybe work on a little bit
 
01:40:10.430 --> 01:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
more we need to do something
 
01:40:12.649 --> 01:40:12.659 align:start position:0%
we just can't say that because people
 
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
want to enjoy themselves
 
01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
the heck with the environment let's just
 
01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
let it be destroyed because Pat you know
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
people are having fun destroying the
 
01:40:21.239 --> 01:40:27.350 align:start position:0%
people are having fun destroying the
environment

01:40:27.350 --> 01:40:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:30.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.169 --> 01:40:33.179 align:start position:0%
representative post for the first time
 
01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you Mr chairman um I
 
01:40:39.590 --> 01:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
support the itl and this is why when you
 
01:40:42.830 --> 01:40:42.840 align:start position:0%
look up ballast anyone can add ballast
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
to a boat so how can you define that how
 
01:40:49.189 --> 01:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
will they know whether it's a a cooler
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
placed in a certain you know filled to
 
01:40:56.330 --> 01:40:56.340 align:start position:0%
the brim with heavy weight to make that
 
01:40:59.930 --> 01:40:59.940 align:start position:0%
effect and I think that puts a real onus
 
01:41:03.169 --> 01:41:03.179 align:start position:0%
on Fish and Game or whoever has to uh
 
01:41:06.530 --> 01:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
follow you know uh these votes to decide
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
and somebody might inadvertently have a
 
01:41:11.649 --> 01:41:11.659 align:start position:0%
cooler on one side that all of a sudden
 
01:41:14.870 --> 01:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
now they're being charged with something
 
01:41:18.169 --> 01:41:18.179 align:start position:0%
because or given the fine because
 
01:41:22.729 --> 01:41:22.739 align:start position:0%
um uh they have a a wake boat and so I
 
01:41:25.970 --> 01:41:25.980 align:start position:0%
feel like this definition
 
01:41:31.310 --> 01:41:31.320 align:start position:0%
um is is not well uh grounded and
 
01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:31.910 align:start position:0%
um is is not well uh grounded and
um

01:41:31.910 --> 01:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:35.149 --> 01:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
I I think it doesn't include just one
 
01:41:37.970 --> 01:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
class of boat like a jet ski
 
01:41:40.370 --> 01:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
um this includes all boats
 
01:41:43.609 --> 01:41:43.619 align:start position:0%
um because everybody can modify to be a
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:50.709 --> 01:41:50.719 align:start position:0%
representative Titan for the first time
 
01:41:53.330 --> 01:41:53.340 align:start position:0%
uh yes Mr chairman thank you just to
 
01:41:56.330 --> 01:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
follow on representative post I'm just
 
01:41:58.790 --> 01:41:58.800 align:start position:0%
reading the bill what it says it says
 
01:42:00.649 --> 01:42:00.659 align:start position:0%
any vote
 
01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
is equipped with ballast tanks bags
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
compartments Etc
 
01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:07.980 align:start position:0%
that are designed to alter or enhance
 
01:42:09.850 --> 01:42:09.860 align:start position:0%
the characteristics of the boat's wake
 
01:42:14.330 --> 01:42:14.340 align:start position:0%
so the way I read this my kayak
 
01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
with a cooler in the back could malt of
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
the way to my kayak and then fall under
 
01:42:21.590 --> 01:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
this definition
 
01:42:24.970 --> 01:42:24.980 align:start position:0%
and so I just think that
 
01:42:27.410 --> 01:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
it's not making a lot of sense to me the
 
01:42:28.910 --> 01:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
way I read it
 
01:42:30.830 --> 01:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
um if I don't know how I would apply
 
01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
uh no other person for the first time on
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
sir you have uh represented Kelly and
 
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
representative Harmon her first
 
01:42:52.729 --> 01:42:52.739 align:start position:0%
representative harp for the first time
 
01:42:55.609 --> 01:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
it's thank you Mr chairman uh I Echo
 
01:42:58.010 --> 01:42:58.020 align:start position:0%
some of the comments of my fellow
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
Representatives about the definition
 
01:43:03.709 --> 01:43:03.719 align:start position:0%
being expansive but I also want to say
 
01:43:06.410 --> 01:43:06.420 align:start position:0%
that I was persuaded by the hundreds of
 
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
emails I got from boaters that suggested
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
we ought to look into more education and
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see us
 
01:43:16.729 --> 01:43:16.739 align:start position:0%
figure out how can we do that for the
 
01:43:18.590 --> 01:43:18.600 align:start position:0%
people that do have what I would
 
01:43:21.649 --> 01:43:21.659 align:start position:0%
consider a wake boat rather than setting
 
01:43:24.890 --> 01:43:24.900 align:start position:0%
a definition so I will be supporting
 
01:43:28.250 --> 01:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
um IDL thank you representative Kelly
 
01:43:32.109 --> 01:43:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:34.189 --> 01:43:34.199 align:start position:0%
representative dunski put the second
 
01:43:35.930 --> 01:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
time followed by representative Kelly
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:43:42.109 --> 01:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
I I much like representative harv I just
 
01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:43.860 align:start position:0%
want to follow up on what he stated I
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
want the committee to uh to recall we
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
had over 1200 in opposition that signed
 
01:43:52.370 --> 01:43:52.380 align:start position:0%
in on the bill originally
 
01:43:55.790 --> 01:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
and about 130 135 that are supporting
 
01:43:57.890 --> 01:43:57.900 align:start position:0%
the bill so it was over 10 to one when
 
01:43:59.270 --> 01:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
we heard when we first heard this bill
 
01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:05.270 --> 01:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
there has been many discussion about
 
01:44:08.390 --> 01:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
this isn't yes this is a definition
 
01:44:10.729 --> 01:44:10.739 align:start position:0%
and I heard restrictions maybe some
 
01:44:12.890 --> 01:44:12.900 align:start position:0%
changes mic slight changes this is just
 
01:44:15.169 --> 01:44:15.179 align:start position:0%
as I said in the past this is the canvas
 
01:44:17.090 --> 01:44:17.100 align:start position:0%
knows Under the Tent
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
I don't think this is necessary as
 
01:44:21.109 --> 01:44:21.119 align:start position:0%
representative Harvard had mentioned
 
01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
about education there is an education
 
01:44:27.169 --> 01:44:27.179 align:start position:0%
program that has been that the industry
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
has been working on diligently called
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
wake responsibly the industry local
 
01:44:34.129 --> 01:44:34.139 align:start position:0%
marinas are on the Marine Patrol
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
to to
 
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
develop a campaign to educate voters
 
01:44:41.450 --> 01:44:41.460 align:start position:0%
I've talked about education I because I
 
01:44:43.370 --> 01:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
talked with with several individuals
 
01:44:45.950 --> 01:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
including people that are on this bill
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
they they laughed when I talked about
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
education like are you kidding me you
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
think education is going to work and I
 
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:53.820 align:start position:0%
think that's wrong education does work
 
01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
it's proven in many areas throughout the
 
01:44:58.129 --> 01:44:58.139 align:start position:0%
state where it has worked and I think we
 
01:44:59.870 --> 01:44:59.880 align:start position:0%
should be focusing more on the education
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.169 --> 01:45:06.179 align:start position:0%
do you have representative Kelly
 
01:45:08.030 --> 01:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
representative Spang and representative
 
01:45:10.390 --> 01:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
post all right representative
 
01:45:12.709 --> 01:45:12.719 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly followed by
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
representative Spang
 
01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:18.239 align:start position:0%
LED and by representative postal for the
 
01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
second time
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly to speak thank you
 
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
Mr chair my question I guess is I'm a
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
freshman rep so I'm still on clear what
 
01:45:28.010 --> 01:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
emotion of what voting for emotion of
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
itl mean that we are unable to examine a
 
01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
new definition
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
um in the next two years I guess my
 
01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
because my concern is like I believe
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
that this definition is wrong just like
 
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative Creighton said I think
 
01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:42.179 align:start position:0%
that it does needs a little bit it needs
 
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
to be flushed out more but I would like
 
01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:45.770 align:start position:0%
to be flushed out more but I would like
to

01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
do that and I just don't know if an itl
 
01:45:49.330 --> 01:45:49.340 align:start position:0%
motion would mean that we couldn't
 
01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:52.679 align:start position:0%
examine it further down the line what an
 
01:45:54.590 --> 01:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
itl motion basically does is an
 
01:45:57.410 --> 01:45:57.420 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and if that is
 
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
passed by the house then it uh it would
 
01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:02.689 align:start position:0%
passed by the house then it uh it would
ostensibly

01:46:02.689 --> 01:46:02.699 align:start position:0%
ostensibly
 
01:46:06.169 --> 01:46:06.179 align:start position:0%
be dead however uh something
 
01:46:09.709 --> 01:46:09.719 align:start position:0%
a bill similar to this that it is or but
 
01:46:12.950 --> 01:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
another bill can come forward in the
 
01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:15.179 align:start position:0%
second year if there is if there's
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh there could be a or could be a
 
01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
similar bill
 
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
passed that really a lot of that similar
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
build brought before this committee uh
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
and in fact
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
I've seen it I've seen it done a lot of
 
01:46:40.450 --> 01:46:40.460 align:start position:0%
it depends about on the speaker
 
01:46:44.209 --> 01:46:44.219 align:start position:0%
and maybe the chair of this committee
 
01:46:48.530 --> 01:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
beyond that uh advantage or question
 
01:46:51.229 --> 01:46:51.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so thank you Mr chair
 
01:46:51.239 --> 01:46:52.810 align:start position:0%
yeah so thank you Mr chair
um

01:46:52.810 --> 01:46:52.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
followed by representative post for a
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
second time
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:47:02.270 --> 01:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
um first uh in response to
 
01:47:05.590 --> 01:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative I can't quite hear you
 
01:47:09.290 --> 01:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
everybody here well
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:24.050 --> 01:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
um an alternative motion which would be
 
01:47:27.770 --> 01:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
to refer for interim study and then that
 
01:47:30.229 --> 01:47:30.239 align:start position:0%
would give us the opportunity to do what
 
01:47:34.330 --> 01:47:34.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:34.340 --> 01:47:35.930 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:47:35.930 --> 01:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
interim study is only allowed for its
 
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
second year I'm sorry I mean retain okay
 
01:47:44.209 --> 01:47:44.219 align:start position:0%
so if we turn down the
 
01:47:47.629 --> 01:47:47.639 align:start position:0%
itl we can make a lot of paying the bill
 
01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
and then we would be able to study uh
 
01:47:52.729 --> 01:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
some of the issues that representative
 
01:47:55.490 --> 01:47:55.500 align:start position:0%
Kelly is talking about
 
01:47:57.770 --> 01:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
I I'm not sure if it's appropriate to
 
01:48:04.310 --> 01:48:04.320 align:start position:0%
say this but I am really disturbed by
 
01:48:07.970 --> 01:48:07.980 align:start position:0%
the committee uh getting thousands of
 
01:48:09.910 --> 01:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
letters uh
 
01:48:13.810 --> 01:48:13.820 align:start position:0%
commenting on a bill with misinformation
 
01:48:17.149 --> 01:48:17.159 align:start position:0%
or with a misunderstanding of what the
 
01:48:19.370 --> 01:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
bill does we're going to be seeing
 
01:48:22.850 --> 01:48:22.860 align:start position:0%
another bill later where that is being a
 
01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:26.100 align:start position:0%
problem where we have interest groups
 
01:48:28.970 --> 01:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
who get people to write
 
01:48:30.890 --> 01:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
um in opposition to a bill with
 
01:48:33.169 --> 01:48:33.179 align:start position:0%
information that is not true
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
in this instance I think it's very
 
01:48:38.090 --> 01:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
obvious that um
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
that we are taking a bill and projecting
 
01:48:44.649 --> 01:48:44.659 align:start position:0%
what might happen in the future
 
01:48:47.229 --> 01:48:47.239 align:start position:0%
which is always
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
a poor way to do our legislation we can
 
01:48:55.370 --> 01:48:55.380 align:start position:0%
take this definition and clearly the
 
01:48:58.129 --> 01:48:58.139 align:start position:0%
definition could not apply to a kayak
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
because you wouldn't be putting a
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
coolant cooler in to increase the wake
 
01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
but if there is a problem with the the
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
wording of the definition then I think
 
01:49:13.810 --> 01:49:13.820 align:start position:0%
that Representatives Kelly's
 
01:49:16.729 --> 01:49:16.739 align:start position:0%
solution is where we should be going
 
01:49:17.990 --> 01:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:49:23.750 --> 01:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative post for the second
 
01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:25.250 align:start position:0%
uh representative post for the second
time

01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:49:27.830 --> 01:49:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you Mr chairman
 
01:49:30.590 --> 01:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
um I I just wanted to
 
01:49:34.669 --> 01:49:34.679 align:start position:0%
um Echo uh representative denske's um
 
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
petition that Education Works and I will
 
01:49:39.709 --> 01:49:39.719 align:start position:0%
say that because we all wear our seat
 
01:49:42.169 --> 01:49:42.179 align:start position:0%
belts we wear ski helmets we wear bike
 
01:49:44.830 --> 01:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
helmets I think most of these were never
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
mandated before we all started using
 
01:49:51.649 --> 01:49:51.659 align:start position:0%
them for our own safety and knowing that
 
01:49:54.229 --> 01:49:54.239 align:start position:0%
these were good things and I think when
 
01:49:56.109 --> 01:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
you educate
 
01:49:59.570 --> 01:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
the Boating industry on what happens
 
01:50:02.109 --> 01:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
with excessive ballast
 
01:50:04.910 --> 01:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
will work because people want to
 
01:50:08.990 --> 01:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
continue using our waterways and I think
 
01:50:11.629 --> 01:50:11.639 align:start position:0%
if they you know that's a good solution
 
01:50:24.010 --> 01:50:24.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:26.810 --> 01:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
all right representative Colin go right
 
01:50:29.030 --> 01:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
ahead yes quick question just for
 
01:50:31.010 --> 01:50:31.020 align:start position:0%
clarification from you could you please
 
01:50:33.350 --> 01:50:33.360 align:start position:0%
explain exactly what the procedure would
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
be if we wanted to offer a motion to
 
01:50:39.350 --> 01:50:39.360 align:start position:0%
retain this bill do we need to
 
01:50:39.360 --> 01:50:41.570 align:start position:0%
retain this bill do we need to
um

01:50:41.570 --> 01:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:46.490 --> 01:50:46.500 align:start position:0%
you have the the itl has to be defeated
 
01:50:49.669 --> 01:50:49.679 align:start position:0%
itl has to be defeated right yeah I've
 
01:50:52.129 --> 01:50:52.139 align:start position:0%
done it with the itl it would have to be
 
01:50:53.810 --> 01:50:53.820 align:start position:0%
defeated then you could bring someone
 
01:50:56.930 --> 01:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
could bring Floyd from motion to retain
 
01:50:58.970 --> 01:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for the
 
01:51:01.970 --> 01:51:01.980 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you uh I just want
 
01:51:04.370 --> 01:51:04.380 align:start position:0%
my I would like to speak uh on the bills
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
the chair's privilege
 
01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
uh I am going to support the motion
 
01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:11.330 align:start position:0%
uh I am going to support the motion
uh

01:51:11.330 --> 01:51:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:15.290 --> 01:51:15.300 align:start position:0%
for a basic reason the bill is far as is
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
fundamentally flawed and and is in a lot
 
01:51:22.250 --> 01:51:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:23.629 align:start position:0%
 
we're

01:51:23.629 --> 01:51:23.639 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:51:27.229 --> 01:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
the issues that we're facing on this is
 
01:51:29.810 --> 01:51:29.820 align:start position:0%
not so much a boat
 
01:51:32.570 --> 01:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
as it is the enforcement
 
01:51:35.090 --> 01:51:35.100 align:start position:0%
there is there are other issues there
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
are there are important issues
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
that we should take in the and
 
01:51:45.109 --> 01:51:45.119 align:start position:0%
I feel that and the chair will commit
 
01:51:49.129 --> 01:51:49.139 align:start position:0%
to work to put together an ad hoc
 
01:51:49.139 --> 01:51:50.510 align:start position:0%
to work to put together an ad hoc
committee

01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:51:53.810 --> 01:51:53.820 align:start position:0%
uh in this in this uh
 
01:51:57.530 --> 01:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
well in in this committee and ad hoc uh
 
01:52:01.310 --> 01:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
committee to be able to examine some of
 
01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:02.390 align:start position:0%
committee to be able to examine some of
the

01:52:02.390 --> 01:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:52:06.050 --> 01:52:06.060 align:start position:0%
issues that need correction I mean
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
especially in the area of enforcement
 
01:52:12.530 --> 01:52:12.540 align:start position:0%
uh and in the in the area of education
 
01:52:15.830 --> 01:52:15.840 align:start position:0%
but these things have to be have to be
 
01:52:19.129 --> 01:52:19.139 align:start position:0%
legislative scalpers not Hammers and
 
01:52:22.250 --> 01:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
this is a legislative Hammer so uh it
 
01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
right now this bill uh I've I've been
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
convinced that
 
01:52:34.129 --> 01:52:34.139 align:start position:0%
uh it it is put a cloud over these the
 
01:52:35.270 --> 01:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
use of
 
01:52:38.050 --> 01:52:38.060 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of boats
 
01:52:44.570 --> 01:52:44.580 align:start position:0%
for sales in in the state and I don't
 
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
think we want that
 
01:52:48.790 --> 01:52:48.800 align:start position:0%
I think what we want to do is to have
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
precise builds to
 
01:52:58.129 --> 01:52:58.139 align:start position:0%
to fix and correct precise issues so I
 
01:52:59.750 --> 01:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
will be supporting
 
01:53:01.810 --> 01:53:01.820 align:start position:0%
the itl
 
01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
but I also like I said as I say I will
 
01:53:06.770 --> 01:53:06.780 align:start position:0%
be committing to
 
01:53:10.250 --> 01:53:10.260 align:start position:0%
push forth amongst this committee uh
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%

01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:17.450 align:start position:0%

I'll tell you if you have a screen free
 
01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes just turning off your video
 
01:58:39.830 --> 01:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
will help because it sometimes maybe
 
01:58:42.229 --> 01:58:42.239 align:start position:0%
you're bandwidth and having video you're
 
01:58:44.209 --> 01:58:44.219 align:start position:0%
using a lot of bandwidth so just turn
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%

02:01:43.790 --> 02:01:43.800 align:start position:0%
my internet's acting a little funny
 
02:01:45.169 --> 02:01:45.179 align:start position:0%

okay go go right you're on
 
02:01:59.149 --> 02:01:59.159 align:start position:0%
I'm going to turn my video off because
 
02:02:01.490 --> 02:02:01.500 align:start position:0%
if that's okay because mine seems to be
 
02:02:03.530 --> 02:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
skipping all right why don't why don't
 
02:02:05.689 --> 02:02:05.699 align:start position:0%
you turn it off then that's fine
 
02:02:08.330 --> 02:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
all right let's try that okay well good
 
02:02:10.129 --> 02:02:10.139 align:start position:0%
morning members of the committee uh for
 
02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
the record my name is representative
 
02:02:13.550 --> 02:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
Howard Pearl from our Merrimack 26
 
02:02:16.129 --> 02:02:16.139 align:start position:0%
representing the talents of Loudon Law
 
02:02:18.890 --> 02:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
School in Canterbury Northfield and
 
02:02:21.950 --> 02:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
Franklin Ward 3. I am here today to
 
02:02:24.830 --> 02:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
introduce house bill 397.
 
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
and uh I sent you some notes with my
 
02:02:29.510 --> 02:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
talking points so I won't cover all of
 
02:02:31.729 --> 02:02:31.739 align:start position:0%
it because uh I know you're always short
 
02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
for time but I'll try and hit the points
 
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
that I've highlighted in my testimony I
 
02:02:38.750 --> 02:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
sent forward
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
this bill reinstates a fee exemption
 
02:02:42.290 --> 02:02:42.300 align:start position:0%
that was in place until just two years
 
02:02:45.290 --> 02:02:45.300 align:start position:0%
ago when it was allowed to Sunset it's a
 
02:02:47.570 --> 02:02:47.580 align:start position:0%
pretty simple one-line bill and I have
 
02:02:48.890 --> 02:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
an amendment that I'm going to introduce
 
02:02:51.890 --> 02:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
and and once I do it the amendment will
 
02:02:54.109 --> 02:02:54.119 align:start position:0%
stay permits for projects solely funded
 
02:02:56.149 --> 02:02:56.159 align:start position:0%
by Municipal County state or federal
 
02:02:57.830 --> 02:02:57.840 align:start position:0%
entities shall be exempt from the
 
02:03:01.430 --> 02:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
permitting fees of paragraph one
 
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
so what I was approached by some of the
 
02:03:06.830 --> 02:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities and uh talking about the
 
02:03:08.209 --> 02:03:08.219 align:start position:0%
high fees that they have which can run
 
02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
into the tens of thousands of dollars
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
for these permits and up until a couple
 
02:03:14.510 --> 02:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
of years ago they were exempt from them
 
02:03:17.470 --> 02:03:17.480 align:start position:0%
until the uh that exemption sunseted
 
02:03:20.450 --> 02:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
there was a uh this this bill or a
 
02:03:22.430 --> 02:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
similar bill that had some of this
 
02:03:24.050 --> 02:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
language and it was in the Senate last
 
02:03:26.689 --> 02:03:26.699 align:start position:0%
year uh Senate Bill 491
 
02:03:28.490 --> 02:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
and it had gone through the Senate
 
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
unanimously and became a uh became a
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
victim of the pandemic and so it did not
 
02:03:36.410 --> 02:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
end up coming through to the house
 
02:03:40.250 --> 02:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
I know Des has had some concerns with
 
02:03:43.010 --> 02:03:43.020 align:start position:0%
this bill but this uh this would be
 
02:03:45.050 --> 02:03:45.060 align:start position:0%
consistent with other areas that they
 
02:03:47.570 --> 02:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
have exemptions in the On Solid Waste
 
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:50.460 align:start position:0%
such as uh you know facility permits for
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions sludge uh quality
 
02:03:55.970 --> 02:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
certification fees and towns who haul
 
02:03:59.089 --> 02:03:59.099 align:start position:0%
their own sludge are exempt from fees
 
02:04:00.830 --> 02:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
I think most the most important point
 
02:04:02.810 --> 02:04:02.820 align:start position:0%
right now is the pandemic has certainly
 
02:04:04.970 --> 02:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
put a lot of municipalities and
 
02:04:07.370 --> 02:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
financial crunches and you know
 
02:04:09.350 --> 02:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
reinstating this exemption for them
 
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
would would be come at a really good
 
02:04:12.890 --> 02:04:12.900 align:start position:0%
time for any of them that have any of
 
02:04:16.910 --> 02:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:19.550 --> 02:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
um I want to say to note that the New
 
02:04:21.410 --> 02:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association and the
 
02:04:23.089 --> 02:04:23.099 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Water Works strongly
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
support this legislation and you'll be
 
02:04:27.169 --> 02:04:27.179 align:start position:0%
hearing from some of the other uh
 
02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities that will testify behind
 
02:04:32.089 --> 02:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
me and I think probably most of the
 
02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
technical questions they'll do very well
 
02:04:36.410 --> 02:04:36.420 align:start position:0%
answering more so than myself
 
02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'd like to talk about the
 
02:04:40.490 --> 02:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
amendment here just quickly at this
 
02:04:42.770 --> 02:04:42.780 align:start position:0%
point so if all of I emailed it to the
 
02:04:47.470 --> 02:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:50.689 --> 02:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
2021-0579h and all this amendment does
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
is simply removes the uh
 
02:04:56.510 --> 02:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
the exemption for uh
 
02:04:59.570 --> 02:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
the non-profits I understand there was
 
02:05:01.490 --> 02:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
some concern in that area with some of
 
02:05:02.810 --> 02:05:02.820 align:start position:0%
the committee members about how broad
 
02:05:05.149 --> 02:05:05.159 align:start position:0%
that language was and I agreed I think
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
the most important part at this point is
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
we get that exemption back from the
 
02:05:10.910 --> 02:05:10.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the in the state or
 
02:05:13.370 --> 02:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
federal entities so I would introduce
 
02:05:14.990 --> 02:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
this amendment and again it just simply
 
02:05:16.850 --> 02:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
removes the uh
 
02:05:19.010 --> 02:05:19.020 align:start position:0%
those non-profits from being in the
 
02:05:19.020 --> 02:05:21.890 align:start position:0%
those non-profits from being in the
exemption

02:05:21.890 --> 02:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:24.169 --> 02:05:24.179 align:start position:0%
I would uh I guess that's pretty much
 
02:05:25.970 --> 02:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
all that I really want to cover and and
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
I I appreciate the time of the committee
 
02:05:29.089 --> 02:05:29.099 align:start position:0%
and I'll certainly answer any questions
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
and again if you've got some real
 
02:05:32.810 --> 02:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
technical ones I I think I'll ask you to
 
02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
ask those of the folks that are going to
 
02:05:35.330 --> 02:05:35.340 align:start position:0%
testify behind me from the
 
02:05:35.340 --> 02:05:40.490 align:start position:0%
testify behind me from the
municipalities

02:05:40.490 --> 02:05:40.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:45.050 --> 02:05:45.060 align:start position:0%
any questions of Representative Pearl
 
02:05:47.290 --> 02:05:47.300 align:start position:0%
so we have representative
 
02:05:50.410 --> 02:05:50.420 align:start position:0%
representative colon for a question
 
02:05:52.669 --> 02:05:52.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
 
02:05:52.679 --> 02:05:54.050 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my
question

02:05:54.050 --> 02:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:05:56.810 --> 02:05:56.820 align:start position:0%
um is there a financial impact with this
 
02:05:58.850 --> 02:05:58.860 align:start position:0%
amendment I didn't see one I didn't see
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
them or the attachment
 
02:06:04.010 --> 02:06:04.020 align:start position:0%
uh there was not a fiscal note attached
 
02:06:06.890 --> 02:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
to it that's correct
 
02:06:10.850 --> 02:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
follow-up Mr chairperson or follow-up
 
02:06:13.850 --> 02:06:13.860 align:start position:0%
why wasn't there I'm not objecting to
 
02:06:15.410 --> 02:06:15.420 align:start position:0%
the bill I'm just concerned on the
 
02:06:20.570 --> 02:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
impact on the state uh of the bill
 
02:06:22.970 --> 02:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
I'll be honest with you I do I I don't
 
02:06:24.530 --> 02:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
know why the I guess no one asked for a
 
02:06:27.649 --> 02:06:27.659 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on it and I'm not a uh
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know what the Des would have to
 
02:06:31.850 --> 02:06:31.860 align:start position:0%
ask for that but uh usually when it goes
 
02:06:33.169 --> 02:06:33.179 align:start position:0%
through the process they'll put one on
 
02:06:34.970 --> 02:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
if they feel it's necessary so I guess
 
02:06:37.010 --> 02:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
they didn't didn't see the need for one
 
02:06:38.629 --> 02:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:06:40.970 --> 02:06:40.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're very welcome
 
02:06:43.129 --> 02:06:43.139 align:start position:0%

02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
Spang for our question thank you Mr
 
02:07:24.830 --> 02:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you just speak louder
 
02:07:26.810 --> 02:07:26.820 align:start position:0%
I really can't hear you you're gonna
 
02:07:28.850 --> 02:07:28.860 align:start position:0%
have to yell into your phone into your
 
02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:30.830 align:start position:0%
have to yell into your phone into your
uh

02:07:30.830 --> 02:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:32.990 --> 02:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
is this better
 
02:07:38.209 --> 02:07:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:41.950 --> 02:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
due to this computer to make it louder
 
02:07:44.450 --> 02:07:44.460 align:start position:0%
I can hear you
 
02:07:47.450 --> 02:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
okay that's what matters no no suddenly
 
02:07:48.770 --> 02:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
we heard you
 
02:07:55.550 --> 02:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:57.950 --> 02:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl maybe you can pass
 
02:08:01.250 --> 02:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
along what I'm saying to the chair
 
02:08:05.330 --> 02:08:05.340 align:start position:0%
um my question is when I looked up the
 
02:08:08.930 --> 02:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
RSA that this is being embedded in it
 
02:08:12.530 --> 02:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
seems to just relate to the permit by
 
02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:14.330 align:start position:0%
seems to just relate to the permit by
notification

02:08:14.330 --> 02:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
notification
 
02:08:14.340 --> 02:08:15.189 align:start position:0%
notification
um

02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:18.890 --> 02:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
projects right were you aware of that
 
02:08:21.290 --> 02:08:21.300 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't apply to any of the
 
02:08:25.689 --> 02:08:25.699 align:start position:0%
other Wetland uh permits
 
02:08:28.669 --> 02:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
yeah this is pretty narrow actually and
 
02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
um it's done so intentionally and it
 
02:08:32.330 --> 02:08:32.340 align:start position:0%
targets just the specific permits that
 
02:08:36.290 --> 02:08:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:39.410 --> 02:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
so following up Mr chairman for a
 
02:08:42.830 --> 02:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah so and and maybe Des can
 
02:08:46.010 --> 02:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
confirm this so these are the projects
 
02:08:49.609 --> 02:08:49.619 align:start position:0%
that are have very minimal impacts so
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
the ones I would think the ones that
 
02:08:54.950 --> 02:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
would be uh more expensive were the more
 
02:08:57.649 --> 02:08:57.659 align:start position:0%
expensive permit fees would not be
 
02:09:00.109 --> 02:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
included in this bill is that correct
 
02:09:02.209 --> 02:09:02.219 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl
 
02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
I think I'm actually going to defer you
 
02:09:06.050 --> 02:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
to Des to answer that question you're
 
02:09:08.209 --> 02:09:08.219 align:start position:0%
going to get into an area that's a
 
02:09:09.890 --> 02:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
little bit beyond my technical knowledge
 
02:09:11.810 --> 02:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
so rather than give you the wrong answer
 
02:09:13.790 --> 02:09:13.800 align:start position:0%
I think I'll ask you to ask them that
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative
 
02:09:19.089 --> 02:09:19.099 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
02:09:21.850 --> 02:09:21.860 align:start position:0%
uh representative post for our question
 
02:09:24.950 --> 02:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and I do
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
have my question written down now I I uh
 
02:09:30.589 --> 02:09:30.599 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl I wanted to know if
 
02:09:32.689 --> 02:09:32.699 align:start position:0%
you gave a Sunset date when that
 
02:09:35.209 --> 02:09:35.219 align:start position:0%
happened and is that possibly the reason
 
02:09:35.219 --> 02:09:36.530 align:start position:0%
happened and is that possibly the reason
why

02:09:36.530 --> 02:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:09:38.450 --> 02:09:38.460 align:start position:0%
um it didn't go for fiscal note that it
 
02:09:40.910 --> 02:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
was recent
 
02:09:42.770 --> 02:09:42.780 align:start position:0%
I honestly don't know why it didn't go
 
02:09:44.450 --> 02:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
for a fiscal note we did not put a
 
02:09:46.669 --> 02:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
Sunset date on this it did Sunset two
 
02:09:48.950 --> 02:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
years ago uh I guess that's something
 
02:09:50.930 --> 02:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
the committee could certainly consider
 
02:09:53.089 --> 02:09:53.099 align:start position:0%
if they wanted to add that to it but uh
 
02:09:54.709 --> 02:09:54.719 align:start position:0%
I don't I didn't feel it was necessary
 
02:09:58.910 --> 02:09:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:00.830 --> 02:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
this is the exact Language by the way
 
02:10:04.189 --> 02:10:04.199 align:start position:0%
that that was in the uh RSA prior to at
 
02:10:06.770 --> 02:10:06.780 align:start position:0%
sunsetting the original bill now that
 
02:10:09.890 --> 02:10:09.900 align:start position:0%
we've removed the um the exemption for
 
02:10:11.870 --> 02:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
the non-profits then it'll be slightly
 
02:10:13.970 --> 02:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
different but that'll the original 397
 
02:10:15.890 --> 02:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
that I put in was the original language
 
02:10:18.169 --> 02:10:18.179 align:start position:0%
that was in before
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
may I give a follow-up
 
02:10:24.169 --> 02:10:24.179 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up yes um do we know
 
02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:26.639 align:start position:0%
um what kind of what it cost us in the
 
02:10:26.639 --> 02:10:28.430 align:start position:0%
um what kind of what it cost us in the
past

02:10:28.430 --> 02:10:28.440 align:start position:0%
past
 
02:10:29.930 --> 02:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
02:10:32.149 --> 02:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
um accounting for them
 
02:10:33.709 --> 02:10:33.719 align:start position:0%
I think that would be a better question
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
for Des and I guess it would depend on
 
02:10:37.070 --> 02:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
what projects that were currently in the
 
02:10:37.080 --> 02:10:38.270 align:start position:0%
what projects that were currently in the
pike

02:10:38.270 --> 02:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
pike
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:40.970 --> 02:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you for the
 
02:10:44.709 --> 02:10:44.719 align:start position:0%
question any other questions uh
 
02:10:47.209 --> 02:10:47.219 align:start position:0%
there being no other further questions
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:10:52.790 --> 02:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate your time uh
 
02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:03.109 --> 02:11:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:07.129 --> 02:11:07.139 align:start position:0%
uh might as well go with the go with the
 
02:11:10.070 --> 02:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
but with the Mr Pelletier from
 
02:11:11.570 --> 02:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
02:11:13.970 --> 02:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services an
 
02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to the bill to testify
 
02:11:21.530 --> 02:11:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:23.209 --> 02:11:23.219 align:start position:0%
spell it too
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:30.950 --> 02:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.250 --> 02:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
can you hear me we can hear you oh
 
02:11:34.260 --> 02:11:35.330 align:start position:0%
can you hear me we can hear you oh
perfect

02:11:35.330 --> 02:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
02:11:37.609 --> 02:11:37.619 align:start position:0%
yeah I think we we oppose the bill
 
02:11:39.890 --> 02:11:39.900 align:start position:0%
because uh but this belt here first of
 
02:11:43.310 --> 02:11:43.320 align:start position:0%
all just to say your name your uh what
 
02:11:45.770 --> 02:11:45.780 align:start position:0%
would you represent what uh
 
02:11:47.930 --> 02:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
no okay
 
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
Etc I know I know but a lot of some
 
02:11:53.030 --> 02:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
folks here though okay uh Rainey
 
02:11:55.070 --> 02:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
pelotium the assistant director of The
 
02:11:58.189 --> 02:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
Water Division the Des uh and obviously
 
02:12:00.589 --> 02:12:00.599 align:start position:0%
Shoreland is one of the programs within
 
02:12:02.750 --> 02:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
the Water Division out of the seven
 
02:12:05.570 --> 02:12:05.580 align:start position:0%
major bureaus that we have so I'm here
 
02:12:09.290 --> 02:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
today we we spoke uh did not support
 
02:12:10.970 --> 02:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
this bill because of the financial
 
02:12:14.030 --> 02:12:14.040 align:start position:0%
implications I think philosophically the
 
02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:14.890 align:start position:0%
implications I think philosophically the
department

02:12:14.890 --> 02:12:14.900 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:12:17.930 --> 02:12:17.940 align:start position:0%
uh opposed this because we thought it
 
02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
was somewhat inequitable for the normal
 
02:12:23.330 --> 02:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
resident of the developer or other folks
 
02:12:26.810 --> 02:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
to be paying a fee and as you know Chief
 
02:12:29.570 --> 02:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
renzullo the shoreline program is
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
totally fee funded uh it's a fee for
 
02:12:36.290 --> 02:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
service program and we felt that it
 
02:12:39.709 --> 02:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
while uh public projects used to be
 
02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
Exempted and representative Pearl I do
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate your Amendment uh I think
 
02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:45.830 align:start position:0%
appreciate your Amendment uh I think
that

02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
brings us some concern less concern if
 
02:12:50.810 --> 02:12:50.820 align:start position:0%
you will
 
02:12:52.910 --> 02:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
um one of the thoughts we had now that
 
02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:55.069 align:start position:0%
um one of the thoughts we had now that
you've

02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
you've
 
02:12:58.250 --> 02:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
brought forth that amendment is maybe an
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
approach might be because of the fee
 
02:13:01.199 --> 02:13:02.290 align:start position:0%
approach might be because of the fee
structure

02:13:02.290 --> 02:13:02.300 align:start position:0%
structure
 
02:13:04.669 --> 02:13:04.679 align:start position:0%
is based on
 
02:13:07.010 --> 02:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
funding Staffing so we can meet our
 
02:13:09.709 --> 02:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
statutory turnaround times so that's why
 
02:13:12.109 --> 02:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
we have concern about when you get
 
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
exemptions I think I was asked one of
 
02:13:16.609 --> 02:13:16.619 align:start position:0%
the questions in 20
 
02:13:20.689 --> 02:13:20.699 align:start position:0%
last year we received fifty thousand
 
02:13:25.729 --> 02:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of fees in from state in
 
02:13:29.390 --> 02:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
local municipalities 22 000 of that fee
 
02:13:32.810 --> 02:13:32.820 align:start position:0%
was from dot for a Bridge Project so
 
02:13:36.010 --> 02:13:36.020 align:start position:0%
there is a fiscal impact albeit it's not
 
02:13:39.290 --> 02:13:39.300 align:start position:0%
thousands hundreds of thousands it was a
 
02:13:39.300 --> 02:13:41.450 align:start position:0%
thousands hundreds of thousands it was a
concern

02:13:41.450 --> 02:13:41.460 align:start position:0%
concern
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
um so that's really the long and the
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
shot of it is that's why we didn't
 
02:13:48.050 --> 02:13:48.060 align:start position:0%
support it because we are fee based and
 
02:13:50.930 --> 02:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
that's what supports our staffing which
 
02:13:53.270 --> 02:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
is critical to us because we we have
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
mandated turnaround times on
 
02:13:55.199 --> 02:14:00.229 align:start position:0%
mandated turnaround times on
applications

02:14:00.229 --> 02:14:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:02.149 --> 02:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
I certainly would be willing to take any
 
02:14:05.149 --> 02:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
questions or thoughts uh I do have one
 
02:14:06.910 --> 02:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
thought though before I
 
02:14:10.609 --> 02:14:10.619 align:start position:0%
go away is perhaps we can look at what
 
02:14:12.890 --> 02:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl is presenting and
 
02:14:15.050 --> 02:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
maybe put a cap on those applications
 
02:14:17.209 --> 02:14:17.219 align:start position:0%
they used to be a thirty seven hundred
 
02:14:19.729 --> 02:14:19.739 align:start position:0%
dollar and fifty thirty seven hundred
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
and fifty dollar cap on applications
 
02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:27.960 align:start position:0%
until 2018. uh that may be an approach
 
02:14:30.229 --> 02:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
that would uh take a little bit of the
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
bang out of the lack of Revenue uh just
 
02:14:35.390 --> 02:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
something to think about
 
02:14:39.350 --> 02:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:41.930 --> 02:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
Representatives bank first question
 
02:14:43.250 --> 02:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:46.729 --> 02:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and Mr Pelletier
 
02:14:49.490 --> 02:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
um you know I'm a I'm very sympathetic
 
02:14:51.470 --> 02:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
to des's
 
02:14:56.270 --> 02:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
um increasingly uh dire circumstances
 
02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh fiscally
 
02:14:58.560 --> 02:14:59.810 align:start position:0%
uh fiscally
um

02:14:59.810 --> 02:14:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:02.450 --> 02:15:02.460 align:start position:0%
so I hate to ask this question
 
02:15:05.870 --> 02:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
but is it a possibility that the fact
 
02:15:09.290 --> 02:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
that this applies only to pbn projects
 
02:15:12.890 --> 02:15:12.900 align:start position:0%
which are ones that I would think would
 
02:15:14.470 --> 02:15:14.480 align:start position:0%
require less
 
02:15:17.750 --> 02:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
involvement a lot fewer resources from
 
02:15:21.770 --> 02:15:21.780 align:start position:0%
the agency does that help to reduce the
 
02:15:21.780 --> 02:15:22.810 align:start position:0%
the agency does that help to reduce the
impact

02:15:22.810 --> 02:15:22.820 align:start position:0%
impact
 
02:15:28.370 --> 02:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
on your uh on on your budget
 
02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:29.870 align:start position:0%
on your uh on on your budget
uh

02:15:29.870 --> 02:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:33.109 --> 02:15:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative Spang I I don't
 
02:15:34.550 --> 02:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
understand the bill to just deal with
 
02:15:37.550 --> 02:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
pbns uh perhaps representative Pearl
 
02:15:40.729 --> 02:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
could uh uh speak to that
 
02:15:43.790 --> 02:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
if obviously pbns are 400 per
 
02:15:46.129 --> 02:15:46.139 align:start position:0%
application that is a significant
 
02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
difference than a 400 base fee and 20
 
02:15:52.910 --> 02:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
cents per square foot
 
02:15:55.250 --> 02:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
um but again I didn't understand this
 
02:16:00.109 --> 02:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:03.770 --> 02:16:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
a set and it's at 483 B 5 b
 
02:16:10.129 --> 02:16:10.139 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:16:13.609 --> 02:16:13.619 align:start position:0%
um the section that is entirely devoted
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
to pbns so I assumed that it was just
 
02:16:21.310 --> 02:16:21.320 align:start position:0%
relating to the 20 cents per square foot
 
02:16:23.270 --> 02:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:16:26.870 --> 02:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
um 200 or 400 dollar base
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh for the for the pbn projects now I
 
02:16:34.549 --> 02:16:34.559 align:start position:0%
don't think I think this bill is written
 
02:16:37.070 --> 02:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
applies to all Shoreland applications
 
02:16:40.610 --> 02:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
both pbn and standards
 
02:16:44.330 --> 02:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
the 20 cents per square foot is is not a
 
02:16:46.610 --> 02:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
pbn a pbn fee is a flat four hundred
 
02:16:49.790 --> 02:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
dollars I'm just looking at where it is
 
02:16:52.910 --> 02:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
in the rsas
 
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
um and it seems that the whole that
 
02:16:58.490 --> 02:16:58.500 align:start position:0%
whole paragraph Just relates to defining
 
02:17:01.549 --> 02:17:01.559 align:start position:0%
a pbn and talking about what is
 
02:17:04.429 --> 02:17:04.439 align:start position:0%
necessary in an application for a pbn
 
02:17:09.889 --> 02:17:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:14.209 --> 02:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
um representative Mr Pelletier
 
02:17:14.219 --> 02:17:15.589 align:start position:0%
um representative Mr Pelletier
um

02:17:15.589 --> 02:17:15.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:20.690 --> 02:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
if if the agency feels that a
 
02:17:23.389 --> 02:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
that a fiscal note is appropriate for
 
02:17:26.169 --> 02:17:26.179 align:start position:0%
this bill is the agency
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
uh unable to independently ask to
 
02:17:34.250 --> 02:17:34.260 align:start position:0%
prepare a fiscal note even if the OLS
 
02:17:35.450 --> 02:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
does not
 
02:17:46.070 --> 02:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
we lost him
 
02:17:55.690 --> 02:17:55.700 align:start position:0%
he's fled
 
02:18:07.730 --> 02:18:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:10.490 --> 02:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
this is Mr pelletier's common reaction
 
02:18:13.509 --> 02:18:13.519 align:start position:0%
to me when I ask a question
 
02:18:17.810 --> 02:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
okay he's a back Mr Solitaire it's
 
02:18:19.310 --> 02:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
everybody's common reaction to you
 
02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:20.830 align:start position:0%
everybody's common reaction to you
Judith

02:18:20.830 --> 02:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
Judith
 
02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:22.690 align:start position:0%
Judith
representative

02:18:22.690 --> 02:18:22.700 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:18:30.610 --> 02:18:30.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:33.650 --> 02:18:33.660 align:start position:0%
not me
 
02:18:36.589 --> 02:18:36.599 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Pelletier are you there
 
02:18:39.490 --> 02:18:39.500 align:start position:0%
I think he's having trouble
 
02:18:43.429 --> 02:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
uh can you hear me can you hear me now
 
02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
we can hear you now yeah I keep uh
 
02:18:51.230 --> 02:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
getting a thing that says rejoin keeps
 
02:18:53.810 --> 02:18:53.820 align:start position:0%
coming up in front of me so if I might
 
02:18:55.969 --> 02:18:55.979 align:start position:0%
chairman renzuelai there's two questions
 
02:18:58.490 --> 02:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
two parts to that question the first
 
02:19:03.469 --> 02:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
spot is on the uh Shoreland fee 483 b5b
 
02:19:06.530 --> 02:19:06.540 align:start position:0%
is all permits not just pbns just add
 
02:19:09.830 --> 02:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
Clarity to this so as far as we're
 
02:19:11.870 --> 02:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
concerned this bill applies to austral
 
02:19:13.629 --> 02:19:13.639 align:start position:0%
land applications
 
02:19:16.849 --> 02:19:16.859 align:start position:0%
secondly the fiscal note generally comes
 
02:19:19.429 --> 02:19:19.439 align:start position:0%
over to us from administrative Services
 
02:19:22.370 --> 02:19:22.380 align:start position:0%
when they look at a bill and determine
 
02:19:24.290 --> 02:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
that there is potential for fiscal
 
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
impact uh to state local or County uh we
 
02:19:31.009 --> 02:19:31.019 align:start position:0%
did not receive a fiscal note as you can
 
02:19:32.929 --> 02:19:32.939 align:start position:0%
tell by the dialogue that's taken place
 
02:19:36.530 --> 02:19:36.540 align:start position:0%
here this morning there is a fiscal uh
 
02:19:39.349 --> 02:19:39.359 align:start position:0%
path to this legislation albeit it's not
 
02:19:41.590 --> 02:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars
 
02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:42.290 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars
[Music]

02:19:42.290 --> 02:19:42.300 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:19:42.300 --> 02:19:43.009 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:19:43.009 --> 02:19:43.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:47.089 --> 02:19:47.099 align:start position:0%
but I I again I like representative
 
02:19:49.490 --> 02:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
Pearl's uh amendment I think that makes
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
sense it makes it more equitable
 
02:19:55.730 --> 02:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
um and I guess I could certainly live
 
02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
with the other part of the bill which
 
02:19:59.870 --> 02:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
talks about public benefit projects if
 
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
you will municipalities and so forth uh
 
02:20:04.730 --> 02:20:04.740 align:start position:0%
but I'd like the committee to entertain
 
02:20:07.730 --> 02:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
perhaps on those four
 
02:20:10.130 --> 02:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
applications that uh
 
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl has in the bill
 
02:20:15.050 --> 02:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
that maybe we put a statutory cap
 
02:20:18.310 --> 02:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
which used to be there prior to 2018
 
02:20:23.510 --> 02:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
of 3 750 it does take more of the sting
 
02:20:27.230 --> 02:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
out of the fee loss but I think that
 
02:20:29.690 --> 02:20:29.700 align:start position:0%
would be uh I feel pretty comfortable
 
02:20:31.610 --> 02:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
with that being a good compromise for
 
02:20:33.469 --> 02:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
the agency
 
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
right and a follow-up uh I don't know
 
02:20:39.170 --> 02:20:39.180 align:start position:0%
whether this is for Mr chairman or Mr
 
02:20:42.170 --> 02:20:42.180 align:start position:0%
pellets thank you
 
02:20:45.230 --> 02:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
um would this require that we retain the
 
02:20:49.190 --> 02:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
bill in order to work out that that
 
02:20:52.370 --> 02:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
compromise language uh
 
02:20:55.790 --> 02:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
if someone decides to bring an amendment
 
02:20:57.710 --> 02:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
to the amendment
 
02:21:01.429 --> 02:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh or somewhat in other words
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
take uh
 
02:21:07.090 --> 02:21:07.100 align:start position:0%
Amendment 2021
 
02:21:11.710 --> 02:21:11.720 align:start position:0%
0579h and adding a statutory cap to it
 
02:21:16.570 --> 02:21:16.580 align:start position:0%
uh voice what did you say 37 50.
 
02:21:23.330 --> 02:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
37.50 yep that used to be the cap uh and
 
02:21:26.710 --> 02:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
that could be taken up
 
02:21:29.830 --> 02:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
in the after uh in the afternoon
 
02:21:32.270 --> 02:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
executive session it would require
 
02:21:32.280 --> 02:21:35.030 align:start position:0%
executive session it would require
someone

02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:36.849 --> 02:21:36.859 align:start position:0%
to call
 
02:21:42.770 --> 02:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
OLX up the OLS to get that
 
02:21:48.170 --> 02:21:48.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:53.929 --> 02:21:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:56.270 --> 02:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you have representative Pearl
 
02:21:58.610 --> 02:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
you said Pearl has his hand up okay
 
02:22:01.130 --> 02:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl
 
02:22:03.710 --> 02:22:03.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair if that is the will
 
02:22:05.090 --> 02:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
of the committee I would be more than
 
02:22:07.490 --> 02:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
willing to take that to OLS and have it
 
02:22:12.410 --> 02:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
done for you uh why don't I just take a
 
02:22:15.230 --> 02:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
just a general consensus not a vote for
 
02:22:17.150 --> 02:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
the general consensus of the committee
 
02:22:19.790 --> 02:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
so you have two hands up
 
02:22:22.250 --> 02:22:22.260 align:start position:0%
um Smith and folks all right uh
 
02:22:24.889 --> 02:22:24.899 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
02:22:32.990 --> 02:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:35.570 --> 02:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
I was going to suggest that because so
 
02:22:37.550 --> 02:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
much new information has come into light
 
02:22:40.190 --> 02:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh such as what the bill actually
 
02:22:44.030 --> 02:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
applies to a possible cap taking out
 
02:22:46.490 --> 02:22:46.500 align:start position:0%
non-profits I'd be questioning why are
 
02:22:48.290 --> 02:22:48.300 align:start position:0%
why is the federal government in there
 
02:22:50.450 --> 02:22:50.460 align:start position:0%
getting a pass
 
02:22:53.150 --> 02:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
um that that I think that's a lot of of
 
02:22:56.690 --> 02:22:56.700 align:start position:0%
stuff to put into an amendment a fast
 
02:22:58.490 --> 02:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
turnaround Amendment and I would think
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
it'd be more beneficial to retain the
 
02:23:07.090 --> 02:23:07.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:10.670 --> 02:23:10.680 align:start position:0%
for a comment yes thank you um this is
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
actually a question
 
02:23:14.030 --> 02:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm a newbie and I do not know what

can you hear me yep yes yeah uh permit
 
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
by notification is a fee that it's a one

flat fee of 400 for projects that aren't
 
02:23:40.190 --> 02:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
major and impact and uh those uh
 
02:23:43.250 --> 02:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
somewhat common for projects that are
 
02:23:47.090 --> 02:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
under 1500 square feet of uh impact
 
02:23:53.450 --> 02:23:53.460 align:start position:0%

02:24:01.969 --> 02:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
you know every representative poster do
 
02:24:04.010 --> 02:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up yes I just wanted
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
to know if it proclaimed uh specifically
 
02:24:09.530 --> 02:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:09.540 --> 02:24:11.450 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:24:11.450 --> 02:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:24:15.170 --> 02:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
the Shoreland program involves any
 
02:24:17.330 --> 02:24:17.340 align:start position:0%
activity that's taking place from the
 
02:24:21.469 --> 02:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
mean high water mark back 250 feet from
 
02:24:22.790 --> 02:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
the shoreline
 
02:24:25.370 --> 02:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
that is what the show in or the water
 
02:24:29.630 --> 02:24:29.640 align:start position:0%
quality act uh has regulations on
 
02:24:32.450 --> 02:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate that
 
02:24:35.210 --> 02:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
is that hard to followed by anyone
 
02:24:36.889 --> 02:24:36.899 align:start position:0%
expand and code
 
02:24:40.429 --> 02:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
uh representative harp and thank you Mr
 
02:24:43.309 --> 02:24:43.319 align:start position:0%
chairman uh following up and
 
02:24:46.370 --> 02:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
on representative Smith even with the
 
02:24:49.790 --> 02:24:49.800 align:start position:0%
cap I would be concerned about how what
 
02:24:52.010 --> 02:24:52.020 align:start position:0%
is the fiscal impact even with that cap
 
02:24:55.309 --> 02:24:55.319 align:start position:0%
since it's a feed-based uh operation so
 
02:24:58.490 --> 02:24:58.500 align:start position:0%
I'd be asking for a fiscal note on it uh
 
02:25:00.530 --> 02:25:00.540 align:start position:0%
I think maybe retaining might be the
 
02:25:03.170 --> 02:25:03.180 align:start position:0%
best thing because I appreciate the uh
 
02:25:06.170 --> 02:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
potential exemption of cutting out the
 
02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
federal government being free from any
 
02:25:10.730 --> 02:25:10.740 align:start position:0%
promise thank you
 
02:25:14.630 --> 02:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
in Spanish uh representative Spang for a
 
02:25:16.910 --> 02:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
second or third time
 
02:25:19.730 --> 02:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
I believe it's the fifth that's what I
 
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:24.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:27.650 --> 02:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
go right ahead my question
 
02:25:30.530 --> 02:25:30.540 align:start position:0%
um is I I'm intrigued by the idea of not
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
letting the federal government off the
 
02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:34.130 align:start position:0%
letting the federal government off the
hook

02:25:34.130 --> 02:25:34.140 align:start position:0%
hook
 
02:25:37.010 --> 02:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
um and I'm uh wondering what the fiscal
 
02:25:40.309 --> 02:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
impact would be I think you've said that
 
02:25:43.190 --> 02:25:43.200 align:start position:0%
the the D.O.T but that state but what
 
02:25:46.550 --> 02:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
would be the the impact if we were to
 
02:25:51.170 --> 02:25:51.180 align:start position:0%
not exempt the federal projects and
 
02:25:53.690 --> 02:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
um and uh and then my question would be
 
02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
to the chair whether that whether the
 
02:25:59.150 --> 02:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
committee would agree to slipping that
 
02:26:02.450 --> 02:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
into our uh Amendment also to remove the
 
02:26:06.170 --> 02:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
exemption for the federal projects
 
02:26:08.870 --> 02:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe Mr Pelletier can help me with
 
02:26:08.880 --> 02:26:10.610 align:start position:0%
and maybe Mr Pelletier can help me with
that

02:26:10.610 --> 02:26:10.620 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:10.620 --> 02:26:12.530 align:start position:0%
that
uh

02:26:12.530 --> 02:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:26:14.389 --> 02:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
committee can do a lot
 
02:26:17.210 --> 02:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
uh at what point does it become
 
02:26:19.849 --> 02:26:19.859 align:start position:0%
cumbersome first of all if the committee
 
02:26:22.010 --> 02:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
is demanding a fiscal note that doesn't
 
02:26:23.510 --> 02:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
happen today
 
02:26:26.090 --> 02:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
that I the committee has to vote on that
 
02:26:29.330 --> 02:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
and he would have to go to have to be
 
02:26:34.250 --> 02:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
submitted to the uh the office to and in
 
02:26:38.750 --> 02:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
order to get a fiscal note uh and there
 
02:26:40.969 --> 02:26:40.979 align:start position:0%
are the other things we can all we can
 
02:26:43.190 --> 02:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
we can work on but if we continue to
 
02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:45.170 align:start position:0%
keep finding stuff
 
02:26:45.170 --> 02:26:46.370 align:start position:0%
keep finding stuff
[Music]

02:26:46.370 --> 02:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:26:50.090 --> 02:26:50.100 align:start position:0%
asking for Stuff eventually it becomes
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:57.650 --> 02:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
02:27:02.330 --> 02:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
right now we're positioned to amend to
 
02:27:05.990 --> 02:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
you could will amend to the uh the
 
02:27:10.070 --> 02:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
the amount of money the 3750 fairly
 
02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:13.270 align:start position:0%
the amount of money the 3750 fairly
readily

02:27:13.270 --> 02:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:15.889 --> 02:27:15.899 align:start position:0%
Federal entities and if you want to
 
02:27:18.290 --> 02:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
discuss uh
 
02:27:20.090 --> 02:27:20.100 align:start position:0%
other issues
 
02:27:22.370 --> 02:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
then it becomes more cumbersome
 
02:27:25.450 --> 02:27:25.460 align:start position:0%
so just be aware
 
02:27:28.370 --> 02:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
we want to do something with this bill
 
02:27:28.380 --> 02:27:29.630 align:start position:0%
we want to do something with this bill
today

02:27:29.630 --> 02:27:29.640 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:27:32.889 --> 02:27:32.899 align:start position:0%
Mr Pelletier and representative
 
02:27:32.899 --> 02:27:34.870 align:start position:0%
Mr Pelletier and representative
uh

02:27:34.870 --> 02:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:27:38.389 --> 02:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Pearl representative Pearl first
 
02:27:40.190 --> 02:27:40.200 align:start position:0%
is your bill
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
yes hey thank you Mr chair I'm just
 
02:27:44.990 --> 02:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure if I'm clear I I
 
02:27:46.490 --> 02:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
would have no issue amending the bill
 
02:27:49.969 --> 02:27:49.979 align:start position:0%
with the 3750 cap and removing the feds
 
02:27:52.309 --> 02:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
I really think I I don't disagree with
 
02:27:53.990 --> 02:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
the uh the sentiment that's been raised
 
02:27:56.030 --> 02:27:56.040 align:start position:0%
I think he Municipal County and state is
 
02:27:57.590 --> 02:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
the most important parts of this bill
 
02:27:59.809 --> 02:27:59.819 align:start position:0%
and so I I would be more than willing to
 
02:28:02.270 --> 02:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
do that I I will throw in um I had a
 
02:28:03.650 --> 02:28:03.660 align:start position:0%
bill in my committee where I was in a
 
02:28:05.809 --> 02:28:05.819 align:start position:0%
similar situation to yourself that I
 
02:28:08.990 --> 02:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
reached out to uh Mr alakonis to request
 
02:28:11.570 --> 02:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
a fiscal note I was informed that I was
 
02:28:13.429 --> 02:28:13.439 align:start position:0%
not able to get one until it had passed
 
02:28:15.410 --> 02:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
the house to get a revised fiscal note
 
02:28:17.809 --> 02:28:17.819 align:start position:0%
so I will just throw that information in
 
02:28:19.370 --> 02:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
there all right if that helps the
 
02:28:19.380 --> 02:28:23.530 align:start position:0%
there all right if that helps the
committee

02:28:23.530 --> 02:28:23.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question is do you want me
 
02:28:27.469 --> 02:28:27.479 align:start position:0%
to go forward with an amendment with the
 
02:28:29.750 --> 02:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
3750 cap in removing the federal part
 
02:28:31.550 --> 02:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
well we'll we'll see where we're going
 
02:28:34.190 --> 02:28:34.200 align:start position:0%
from here uh Mr pellets okay
 
02:28:36.110 --> 02:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I just I
 
02:28:38.110 --> 02:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yeah
 
02:28:41.330 --> 02:28:41.340 align:start position:0%
I just like to know what I I think uh
 
02:28:44.270 --> 02:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's refreshing to see
 
02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:46.260 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl be willing to make
 
02:28:49.370 --> 02:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
those changes I also will say that at
 
02:28:51.889 --> 02:28:51.899 align:start position:0%
this point I believe it's important if
 
02:28:54.349 --> 02:28:54.359 align:start position:0%
this bill does pass uh we do have
 
02:28:56.570 --> 02:28:56.580 align:start position:0%
Municipal projects coming up on the deck
 
02:28:59.150 --> 02:28:59.160 align:start position:0%
we also have dot projects coming up on
 
02:29:00.650 --> 02:29:00.660 align:start position:0%
the deck
 
02:29:02.929 --> 02:29:02.939 align:start position:0%
um I think with the cap that makes it
 
02:29:06.230 --> 02:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
more palatable for us I would Advocate
 
02:29:08.889 --> 02:29:08.899 align:start position:0%
that the committee entertain
 
02:29:11.570 --> 02:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl's willingness to
 
02:29:15.230 --> 02:29:15.240 align:start position:0%
put in those amendments but um candidly
 
02:29:17.809 --> 02:29:17.819 align:start position:0%
I don't think fiscal notes necessary now
 
02:29:20.570 --> 02:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
that we've gone through this dialogue
 
02:29:23.030 --> 02:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
and talked about applications fees as I
 
02:29:27.050 --> 02:29:27.060 align:start position:0%
said last year 20 and 20 there was fifty
 
02:29:29.750 --> 02:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars worth of Revenue
 
02:29:32.990 --> 02:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
um again 22 000 of that was with DOT
 
02:29:35.809 --> 02:29:35.819 align:start position:0%
projects uh but I think the department
 
02:29:37.910 --> 02:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
would feel comfortable with the an
 
02:29:40.490 --> 02:29:40.500 align:start position:0%
amendment as proposed by representative
 
02:29:43.910 --> 02:29:43.920 align:start position:0%
Pearl and I do uh thank him for his
 
02:29:45.469 --> 02:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
willingness to move forward in that
 
02:29:48.710 --> 02:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
approach so I would Advocate that if the
 
02:29:51.050 --> 02:29:51.060 align:start position:0%
committee can find uh confident in this
 
02:29:53.809 --> 02:29:53.819 align:start position:0%
that uh I think it would be prudent if
 
02:29:56.389 --> 02:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
the bill would have moved forward
 
02:29:58.809 --> 02:29:58.819 align:start position:0%
but I asked for a sense of the committee
 
02:30:02.150 --> 02:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
this will not be a vote but it just so I
 
02:30:04.969 --> 02:30:04.979 align:start position:0%
need a kind of a general consensus
 
02:30:08.929 --> 02:30:08.939 align:start position:0%
that we asked
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl to come back to
 
02:30:16.969 --> 02:30:16.979 align:start position:0%
improve his
 
02:30:19.969 --> 02:30:19.979 align:start position:0%
amendment of
 
02:30:19.979 --> 02:30:21.110 align:start position:0%
amendment of
uh

02:30:21.110 --> 02:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:30:24.910 --> 02:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
you know 15 579 h
 
02:30:30.910 --> 02:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:33.910 --> 02:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
and add
 
02:30:38.809 --> 02:30:38.819 align:start position:0%
and remove the federal projects
 
02:30:43.730 --> 02:30:43.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:43.740 --> 02:30:45.290 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:30:45.290 --> 02:30:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:30:48.650 --> 02:30:48.660 align:start position:0%
I think I'm getting a sense grassy's up
 
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh not only is not cool is that hard was
 
02:30:51.960 --> 02:30:52.809 align:start position:0%
uh not only is not cool is that hard was
that

02:30:52.809 --> 02:30:52.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:31:03.070 --> 02:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:05.290 --> 02:31:05.300 align:start position:0%
you have
 
02:31:07.969 --> 02:31:07.979 align:start position:0%
an issue that
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
oh my issue is I would like to wait and
 
02:31:14.510 --> 02:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
get a financial impact statement if
 
02:31:17.690 --> 02:31:17.700 align:start position:0%
possible I'm not objecting to miss
 
02:31:19.550 --> 02:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative moffatt's suggestions I
 
02:31:22.010 --> 02:31:22.020 align:start position:0%
just would be more comfortable waiting
 
02:31:24.050 --> 02:31:24.060 align:start position:0%
and getting the financial impact with
 
02:31:25.730 --> 02:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
the changes so he doesn't have to go
 
02:31:28.010 --> 02:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
crazy doing it today
 
02:31:32.650 --> 02:31:32.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:35.570 --> 02:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
well here's what will have to happen if
 
02:31:36.950 --> 02:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
we do that
 
02:31:41.690 --> 02:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
we will have to have another meeting
 
02:31:44.630 --> 02:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
later on and this would be the only bill
 
02:31:47.809 --> 02:31:47.819 align:start position:0%
so everybody will have to show up
 
02:31:51.170 --> 02:31:51.180 align:start position:0%
uh a week from today
 
02:31:53.330 --> 02:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
because that's and it may not even be
 
02:31:55.969 --> 02:31:55.979 align:start position:0%
available then so
 
02:31:55.979 --> 02:31:58.250 align:start position:0%
available then so
uh

02:31:58.250 --> 02:31:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:02.270 --> 02:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
is the only other choice would be that
 
02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
we would post that we would retain the
 
02:32:08.150 --> 02:32:08.160 align:start position:0%
bill and it would not would not become
 
02:32:11.870 --> 02:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
law until after the first of the uh
 
02:32:14.030 --> 02:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
after the first of the year
 
02:32:14.040 --> 02:32:16.170 align:start position:0%
after the first of the year
uh

02:32:16.170 --> 02:32:16.180 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:16.180 --> 02:32:17.469 align:start position:0%
uh
[Music]

02:32:17.469 --> 02:32:17.479 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:32:19.670 --> 02:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative grassy followed by
 
02:32:22.550 --> 02:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative harp yes Mr chairman I
 
02:32:24.590 --> 02:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
think that if we do pass this uh
 
02:32:26.270 --> 02:32:26.280 align:start position:0%
certainly with the concern that we want
 
02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
to see a fiscal analysis done fiscal
 
02:32:30.530 --> 02:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
impact of this build that let's go to
 
02:32:32.570 --> 02:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
the Senate and they can get that
 
02:32:34.130 --> 02:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
information and deal with it there as
 
02:32:36.650 --> 02:32:36.660 align:start position:0%
far as the budget's concerned that is
 
02:32:38.990 --> 02:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
that is very true thank you very much
 
02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:40.389 align:start position:0%
that is very true thank you very much
representative

02:32:40.389 --> 02:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:32:45.889 --> 02:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:48.710 --> 02:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman perhaps uh
 
02:32:51.050 --> 02:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
having uh the representative go for the
 
02:32:54.290 --> 02:32:54.300 align:start position:0%
amendment maybe during the break
 
02:32:58.130 --> 02:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
um Mr Pelletier can go find out how many
 
02:33:00.950 --> 02:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh because he might have a record of how
 
02:33:03.889 --> 02:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
much money went over that cap on even
 
02:33:07.490 --> 02:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
last year's uh applications uh who
 
02:33:09.110 --> 02:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
should be maybe he might be able to just
 
02:33:11.090 --> 02:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
tell us that and come back this
 
02:33:21.010 --> 02:33:21.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:23.389 --> 02:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
actually almost like representative
 
02:33:25.490 --> 02:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
Valentina been here longer than most of
 
02:33:27.950 --> 02:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
us uh
 
02:33:30.230 --> 02:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
the uh did you hear a representative
 
02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
Harps uh
 
02:33:35.389 --> 02:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
uh I I did I did hear that like I said
 
02:33:37.490 --> 02:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
last year the fees were fifty thousand
 
02:33:40.250 --> 02:33:40.260 align:start position:0%
dollars I mean we can do the the simple
 
02:33:44.210 --> 02:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
math uh to figure that out the dot one
 
02:33:47.090 --> 02:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
was the Big E which was 22 000 that
 
02:33:51.290 --> 02:33:51.300 align:start position:0%
would be gone from 22 to 37.50 if this
 
02:33:55.010 --> 02:33:55.020 align:start position:0%
were implemented uh I also want to
 
02:33:57.050 --> 02:33:57.060 align:start position:0%
caution that I think when you look at
 
02:34:00.110 --> 02:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
the exemptions they're based on funding
 
02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
source and I do have concern and I can
 
02:34:06.290 --> 02:34:06.300 align:start position:0%
check further into this but I do have
 
02:34:09.410 --> 02:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
concern that if we strike the federal
 
02:34:12.410 --> 02:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
projects out of Representative Pearl's
 
02:34:12.420 --> 02:34:13.969 align:start position:0%
projects out of Representative Pearl's
Amendment

02:34:13.969 --> 02:34:13.979 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
02:34:17.690 --> 02:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
that that may uh impact dot because many
 
02:34:20.630 --> 02:34:20.640 align:start position:0%
of their projects are federally funded
 
02:34:23.270 --> 02:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
so I would have a that would concern me
 
02:34:25.670 --> 02:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
right off the bat
 
02:34:27.650 --> 02:34:27.660 align:start position:0%
um I don't think it's going to be a big
 
02:34:31.429 --> 02:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact if we leave the federal
 
02:34:34.790 --> 02:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
pod in that Amendment but I caution the
 
02:34:37.790 --> 02:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
committee that this exemption is based
 
02:34:41.570 --> 02:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
on funding in a lodge or the Lion's
 
02:34:43.250 --> 02:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
Share projects and Dot are federally
 
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
funded so that would be a concern for me
 
02:34:51.610 --> 02:34:51.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:54.770 --> 02:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
yeah having been a city councilman at a
 
02:34:57.110 --> 02:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
local level I know that you don't ever
 
02:34:58.370 --> 02:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
really have the federal government
 
02:35:00.410 --> 02:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
coming in and doing projects unless it's
 
02:35:02.630 --> 02:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
an Army Core thing for uh you know
 
02:35:04.610 --> 02:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
flooding purposes or emergency purposes
 
02:35:07.370 --> 02:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
but he's right all of most of our
 
02:35:09.050 --> 02:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
projects are federally funded when we do
 
02:35:11.030 --> 02:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of these big projects so that it
 
02:35:13.550 --> 02:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
may be that it's an unintended
 
02:35:16.550 --> 02:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
consequence but the local community pays
 
02:35:18.950 --> 02:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
a portion of those funds and if we have
 
02:35:20.450 --> 02:35:20.460 align:start position:0%
to pay those fees it's going to have a
 
02:35:22.370 --> 02:35:22.380 align:start position:0%
major impact on the local community so
 
02:35:25.010 --> 02:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
it's probably not something it certainly
 
02:35:26.330 --> 02:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
wasn't something we were considering but
 
02:35:27.830 --> 02:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
I would agree I don't think we should
 
02:35:30.110 --> 02:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
exempt the federal projects
 
02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:32.450 align:start position:0%
exempt the federal projects
so

02:35:32.450 --> 02:35:32.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:35.349 --> 02:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
you have a question from the two panels
 
02:35:39.490 --> 02:35:39.500 align:start position:0%
okay who we have
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%

come forward
 
02:35:57.120 --> 02:36:05.469 align:start position:0%
come forward
standby

02:36:05.469 --> 02:36:05.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:08.570 --> 02:36:08.580 align:start position:0%
why don't you your floor is yours good
 
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
morning thank you uh for the record
 
02:36:12.410 --> 02:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
Kevin Nyan I manage the environmental
 
02:36:14.809 --> 02:36:14.819 align:start position:0%
office here at the D.O.T
 
02:36:17.090 --> 02:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
um if if it's okay with the chair uh
 
02:36:19.670 --> 02:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
turning on my video would take uh moving
 
02:36:21.830 --> 02:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
around some computers nope that's fine
 
02:36:23.889 --> 02:36:23.899 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you
 
02:36:26.690 --> 02:36:26.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I I um I just want
 
02:36:28.870 --> 02:36:28.880 align:start position:0%
to Echo or actually
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh the comments offered by Mr
 
02:36:35.330 --> 02:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
Pelletier from Des that um certainly
 
02:36:38.210 --> 02:36:38.220 align:start position:0%
exempting Federal projects would have an
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
effect on the department
 
02:36:42.770 --> 02:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
um or or not exempting the federal
 
02:36:42.780 --> 02:36:44.210 align:start position:0%
um or or not exempting the federal
projects

02:36:44.210 --> 02:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
projects
 
02:36:46.670 --> 02:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
um into Mr pelletier's point a project
 
02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
that he was referring to which was the
 
02:36:52.070 --> 02:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollar plus project
 
02:36:55.309 --> 02:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
um was in fact a federal aid project so
 
02:36:58.910 --> 02:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh so I guess I I guess I that would be
 
02:37:01.730 --> 02:37:01.740 align:start position:0%
my my comments is to express you know
 
02:37:04.429 --> 02:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
appreciation for that sentiment
 
02:37:07.969 --> 02:37:07.979 align:start position:0%
um and be prior to
 
02:37:10.130 --> 02:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
um the sun setting of the statute it is
 
02:37:12.530 --> 02:37:12.540 align:start position:0%
true that we did not pay uh permitting
 
02:37:14.929 --> 02:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
fees for Shoreline permits
 
02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
um and uh any amendment that would cap
 
02:37:21.530 --> 02:37:21.540 align:start position:0%
that at the 37.50 would would be
 
02:37:24.590 --> 02:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
appreciated so uh that's all I just
 
02:37:26.090 --> 02:37:26.100 align:start position:0%
wanted to say thank you and I'm happy to
 
02:37:31.630 --> 02:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:34.790 --> 02:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
yeah just just if I could speak quickly
 
02:37:37.370 --> 02:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
I should have said this earlier uh to my
 
02:37:39.469 --> 02:37:39.479 align:start position:0%
knowledge and as you know representative
 
02:37:42.290 --> 02:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
this is year 49 for me the yes so I go
 
02:37:45.110 --> 02:37:45.120 align:start position:0%
back a long way but to my knowledge
 
02:37:48.849 --> 02:37:48.859 align:start position:0%
there's been only one actual Federal
 
02:37:51.469 --> 02:37:51.479 align:start position:0%
application since the Inception of the
 
02:37:53.990 --> 02:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
Shoreland program all of the other
 
02:37:57.130 --> 02:37:57.140 align:start position:0%
source fundings were mostly with DOT so
 
02:37:59.990 --> 02:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
I want to reiterate I I think it would
 
02:38:01.969 --> 02:38:01.979 align:start position:0%
be prudent to leave that in
 
02:38:05.090 --> 02:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl's Amendment
 
02:38:08.570 --> 02:38:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:11.570 --> 02:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
so so really uh what we are talking
 
02:38:14.750 --> 02:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
about for an amendment to the amendment
 
02:38:20.450 --> 02:38:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:22.490 --> 02:38:22.500 align:start position:0%
anybody agree to that
 
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:33.770 --> 02:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
everybody uh so we could send
 
02:38:33.780 --> 02:38:34.929 align:start position:0%
everybody uh so we could send
Representatives

02:38:34.929 --> 02:38:34.939 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
02:38:38.090 --> 02:38:38.100 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative Smith and pearl

02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr yeah thank you Mr
 
02:38:48.110 --> 02:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
chair um all of a sudden I feel like
 
02:38:52.610 --> 02:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
I've lost my my my knowledge here
 
02:38:55.750 --> 02:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
if we are exempting
 
02:38:59.330 --> 02:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
projects funded by Municipal County
 
02:39:03.349 --> 02:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
they're exempt from the fees so what's
 
02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:13.370 --> 02:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
and that's probably a question for Mr
 
02:39:13.380 --> 02:39:15.290 align:start position:0%
and that's probably a question for Mr
Pelletier

02:39:15.290 --> 02:39:15.300 align:start position:0%
Pelletier
 
02:39:17.929 --> 02:39:17.939 align:start position:0%
if they're not paying a fee why is there
 
02:39:20.389 --> 02:39:20.399 align:start position:0%
a cap honestly unless it's two different
 
02:39:22.429 --> 02:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
things completely
 
02:39:22.439 --> 02:39:24.469 align:start position:0%
things completely
yeah

02:39:24.469 --> 02:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:26.510 --> 02:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
Mr proletari can you help us with that
 
02:39:28.730 --> 02:39:28.740 align:start position:0%
what are whereabouts does the statutory
 
02:39:32.450 --> 02:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
cap go just caps on top of every
 
02:39:37.370 --> 02:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:41.690 --> 02:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
yeah here I am uh they're exempt from
 
02:39:44.090 --> 02:39:44.100 align:start position:0%
the fee and I guess we'd have to think
 
02:39:46.370 --> 02:39:46.380 align:start position:0%
about wordsmithing that but the intent
 
02:39:48.469 --> 02:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
was that they would still apply for an
 
02:39:52.429 --> 02:39:52.439 align:start position:0%
application but the fee would be capped
 
02:39:55.250 --> 02:39:55.260 align:start position:0%
at 3 750 dollars
 
02:39:58.550 --> 02:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm sure I trust representative Pearl
 
02:40:01.130 --> 02:40:01.140 align:start position:0%
talking with OLS can figure out the
 
02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate language that uh perhaps
 
02:40:06.830 --> 02:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
exemption isn't the word that should be
 
02:40:10.010 --> 02:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
in the sentence but the intent here I
 
02:40:13.490 --> 02:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
think that I'm advocating for is that
 
02:40:16.610 --> 02:40:16.620 align:start position:0%
they would submit an application but the
 
02:40:26.570 --> 02:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:29.330 --> 02:40:29.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair all right actually
 
02:40:31.370 --> 02:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
that was pretty much the question I was
 
02:40:34.550 --> 02:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
going to ask is so the cap is actually
 
02:40:37.790 --> 02:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
capping them not to exceed 37.50 I just
 
02:40:39.530 --> 02:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I understood and we
 
02:40:44.690 --> 02:40:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.849 --> 02:40:46.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:46.859 --> 02:40:47.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:40:47.990 --> 02:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:49.969 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

02:40:49.969 --> 02:40:49.979 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:40:53.690 --> 02:40:53.700 align:start position:0%
your question answered
 
02:40:55.969 --> 02:40:55.979 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I froze for just a second my
 
02:40:57.290 --> 02:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
apologies I turned my video back I've
 
02:40:59.690 --> 02:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
tried again all right you're uh you're
 
02:41:02.630 --> 02:41:02.640 align:start position:0%
you're you understand what's being asked
 
02:41:06.230 --> 02:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
so we want to cap we want to uh cap that
 
02:41:07.570 --> 02:41:07.580 align:start position:0%
so that
 
02:41:09.950 --> 02:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
statutorily they can their fees will not
 
02:41:12.590 --> 02:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
exceed 37.50 and we're leaving the
 
02:41:13.969 --> 02:41:13.979 align:start position:0%
federals in the exemption is that
 
02:41:15.770 --> 02:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
correct yes
 
02:41:17.809 --> 02:41:17.819 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:41:20.330 --> 02:41:20.340 align:start position:0%
I will take that to OLS and get it done
 
02:41:23.650 --> 02:41:23.660 align:start position:0%
wait a minute don't leave yet all right
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
all right representative Smith this is
 
02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
yeah this is a follow-up to that so if
 
02:41:32.330 --> 02:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
we are capping the fee that could be
 
02:41:32.340 --> 02:41:33.530 align:start position:0%
we are capping the fee that could be
paid

02:41:33.530 --> 02:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
paid
 
02:41:37.090 --> 02:41:37.100 align:start position:0%
then it's not an exemption
 
02:41:40.670 --> 02:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
you know it would be permits uh shell
 
02:41:44.030 --> 02:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
costs of permits shall be
 
02:41:47.809 --> 02:41:47.819 align:start position:0%
um capped at 37.50 not exempt from
 
02:41:49.610 --> 02:41:49.620 align:start position:0%
permitting fees because they wouldn't be
 
02:41:51.469 --> 02:41:51.479 align:start position:0%
exempt they would just get much reduced
 
02:41:51.479 --> 02:41:53.210 align:start position:0%
exempt they would just get much reduced
rates

02:41:53.210 --> 02:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
rates
 
02:41:56.150 --> 02:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
is that correct that I think that's what
 
02:42:01.610 --> 02:42:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:04.010 --> 02:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
is that question for me I'm sorry I
 
02:42:05.750 --> 02:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't clear it's probably this is
 
02:42:08.389 --> 02:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl yeah it's a
 
02:42:10.130 --> 02:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
question for anybody well it's actually
 
02:42:13.370 --> 02:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
a question probably forever too
 
02:42:17.630 --> 02:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
here I am again okay the uh the question
 
02:42:20.750 --> 02:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
is is it is not is it it is not an
 
02:42:23.870 --> 02:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
exemption it's a capping of the of the
 
02:42:26.770 --> 02:42:26.780 align:start position:0%
feed they pay up that they pay
 
02:42:31.190 --> 02:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
37.50 uh but no more than them yes I
 
02:42:32.690 --> 02:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
think representative Pearl hit the nail
 
02:42:34.910 --> 02:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
right on the head the word exemption has
 
02:42:38.750 --> 02:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
to go away but the the wordsmithing of
 
02:42:41.389 --> 02:42:41.399 align:start position:0%
the applications for those four entities
 
02:42:45.530 --> 02:42:45.540 align:start position:0%
would be capped at 37.50 I think
 
02:42:48.230 --> 02:42:48.240 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and I'm sure Judith
 
02:42:51.730 --> 02:42:51.740 align:start position:0%
was going to say the same thing so
 
02:42:56.450 --> 02:42:56.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:56.460 --> 02:43:04.309 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:43:04.309 --> 02:43:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:06.950 --> 02:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
yes I I think if you just say this still
 
02:43:12.290 --> 02:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
caps the fees at 37 uh 50 for municipal
 
02:43:14.150 --> 02:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
County state and federal projects from
 
02:43:19.210 --> 02:43:19.220 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:22.849 --> 02:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative Spain thank
 
02:43:22.859 --> 02:43:24.230 align:start position:0%
all right uh representative Spain thank
you

02:43:24.230 --> 02:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
one day on the head so I've got to get
 
02:43:27.889 --> 02:43:27.899 align:start position:0%
you and
 
02:43:30.590 --> 02:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
what is going to be happening with our
 
02:43:33.290 --> 02:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
desire to take out the non-profit
 
02:43:33.300 --> 02:43:35.330 align:start position:0%
desire to take out the non-profit
organizations

02:43:35.330 --> 02:43:35.340 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
02:43:37.790 --> 02:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
is that going to also be taken out of
 
02:43:40.910 --> 02:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
this appears
 
02:43:43.910 --> 02:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment replaces the non-profit
 
02:43:46.370 --> 02:43:46.380 align:start position:0%
organizations okay so that will remain
 
02:43:47.929 --> 02:43:47.939 align:start position:0%
that we're taking that out and then
 
02:43:49.910 --> 02:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
we're adding the cap and then Bob's your
 
02:43:49.920 --> 02:43:58.849 align:start position:0%
we're adding the cap and then Bob's your
uncle

02:43:58.849 --> 02:43:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:00.650 --> 02:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
so there are no further questions no
 
02:44:03.230 --> 02:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
further questions are we are we ready
 
02:44:06.770 --> 02:44:06.780 align:start position:0%
then for to send uh representative Pearl
 
02:44:09.770 --> 02:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
out to make the required changes and the
 
02:44:11.929 --> 02:44:11.939 align:start position:0%
representative Burrell no exchanges
 
02:44:14.389 --> 02:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to make
 
02:44:19.309 --> 02:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I believe I do okay
 
02:44:21.650 --> 02:44:21.660 align:start position:0%
as we're glad one of us is if you have
 
02:44:24.349 --> 02:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
thumbs up from grashing and published in
 
02:44:27.530 --> 02:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
Oregon all right just just one one quick
 
02:44:30.290 --> 02:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
thing yes just for clarification costs
 
02:44:34.010 --> 02:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
of permit these shall be capped at 37.50
 
02:44:37.490 --> 02:44:37.500 align:start position:0%
per permit or per applicant
 
02:44:42.650 --> 02:44:42.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:44.870 --> 02:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
correct Mr Pelletier it's poor permit
 
02:44:47.090 --> 02:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
correct prayer application the
 
02:44:56.690 --> 02:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:01.870 --> 02:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:04.670 --> 02:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:45:07.910 --> 02:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl your uh
 
02:45:11.150 --> 02:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
I think you can uh be off and make your
 
02:45:14.150 --> 02:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
phone call and see what Jerry you can do
 
02:45:17.450 --> 02:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
hopefully something gets back to us by
 
02:45:20.570 --> 02:45:20.580 align:start position:0%
uh at least like two o'clock at least
 
02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%
all right thank you that was going to be
 
02:45:23.750 --> 02:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
my next question what your timing was so
 
02:45:26.210 --> 02:45:26.220 align:start position:0%
I will reach out to OLS and see if I can
 
02:45:30.830 --> 02:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yeah we're gonna continue
 
02:45:37.010 --> 02:45:37.020 align:start position:0%
our uh exacting uh after uh two o'clock
 
02:45:39.170 --> 02:45:39.180 align:start position:0%
okay I'll make sure to try and make sure
 
02:45:40.750 --> 02:45:40.760 align:start position:0%
they have that thank you
 
02:45:43.490 --> 02:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
two o'clock would be the
 
02:45:45.710 --> 02:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
drop dead we should be still in an
 
02:45:45.720 --> 02:45:47.090 align:start position:0%
drop dead we should be still in an
executive

02:45:47.090 --> 02:45:47.100 align:start position:0%
executive
 
02:45:48.590 --> 02:45:48.600 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:45:50.870 --> 02:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's
 
02:45:53.929 --> 02:45:53.939 align:start position:0%
uh it gets time that we
 
02:45:58.250 --> 02:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
uh I'm gonna end this uh executive
 
02:46:01.570 --> 02:46:01.580 align:start position:0%
session we'll pick the we'll pick it up
 
02:46:07.570 --> 02:46:07.580 align:start position:0%
executive session uh uh after we
 
02:46:10.370 --> 02:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh we're gonna have at one o'clock we're
 
02:46:13.490 --> 02:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
hearing 4 46 and 2 o'clock we're into
 
02:46:15.410 --> 02:46:15.420 align:start position:0%
executive session and this will be the
 
02:46:18.710 --> 02:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
first part of uh it'll be picked up
 
02:46:21.590 --> 02:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
after two o'clock so
 
02:46:26.270 --> 02:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
in the meeting I'll adjourn and
 
02:46:29.870 --> 02:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes do we have other people
 
02:46:32.270 --> 02:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
wishing to speak on this bill
 
02:46:36.110 --> 02:46:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:41.929 align:start position:0%
 
actually

02:46:41.929 --> 02:46:41.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:45.290 --> 02:46:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh the only youngest person to wish to
 
02:46:49.910 --> 02:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
speak was uh uh darling forced Jason
 
02:46:51.469 --> 02:46:51.479 align:start position:0%
Randall with his hands up in the
 
02:46:55.730 --> 02:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:58.070 --> 02:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
oh first I'll recognize darling force
 
02:47:06.830 --> 02:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:12.230 --> 02:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:14.150 --> 02:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
and now I want to see if she disagrees
 
02:47:20.389 --> 02:47:20.399 align:start position:0%

and then the floor will be yours and
 
02:48:26.510 --> 02:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
make it
 
02:48:31.750 --> 02:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
well good morning can you hear me uh yep
 
02:48:34.429 --> 02:48:34.439 align:start position:0%
and committee members my name is Jason
 
02:48:37.070 --> 02:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
Randall I am the superintendent at
 
02:48:38.750 --> 02:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
Plymouth Village Water and Sewer
 
02:48:41.090 --> 02:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
District in Plymouth New Hampshire I'm
 
02:48:44.809 --> 02:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
speaking today in favor of the bill uh
 
02:48:46.849 --> 02:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
397 on the shoreline protection
 
02:48:49.429 --> 02:48:49.439 align:start position:0%
exemption for municipalities Village
 
02:48:51.830 --> 02:48:51.840 align:start position:0%
districts and precincts
 
02:48:54.950 --> 02:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit of background
 
02:48:54.960 --> 02:48:55.610 align:start position:0%
a little bit of background
um

02:48:55.610 --> 02:48:55.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:58.370 --> 02:48:58.380 align:start position:0%
the district started planning and
 
02:49:01.070 --> 02:49:01.080 align:start position:0%
financing a sewer Force main replacement
 
02:49:05.389 --> 02:49:05.399 align:start position:0%
project in 2017 and 2018
 
02:49:07.090 --> 02:49:07.100 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
02:49:11.809 --> 02:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
RSA 483 B5 B
 
02:49:15.050 --> 02:49:15.060 align:start position:0%
3 Exempted public utility lines from the
 
02:49:17.090 --> 02:49:17.100 align:start position:0%
shoreline permitting fees
 
02:49:19.250 --> 02:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
until at Sunset it like it was
 
02:49:21.889 --> 02:49:21.899 align:start position:0%
recognized earlier
 
02:49:24.770 --> 02:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
um this reversal created a surprise
 
02:49:27.889 --> 02:49:27.899 align:start position:0%
impact fee on this project for the
 
02:49:30.950 --> 02:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
District of approximately 30 to 35
 
02:49:32.750 --> 02:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars
 
02:49:36.290 --> 02:49:36.300 align:start position:0%
uh that that this this was
 
02:49:38.990 --> 02:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
um in 2020 so I know that's one of the
 
02:49:42.290 --> 02:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
projects that wasn't brought up earlier
 
02:49:46.190 --> 02:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
um because we have reached out to Des to
 
02:49:47.809 --> 02:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
request a waiver
 
02:49:50.090 --> 02:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
the waiver
 
02:49:53.990 --> 02:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
um for that project was denied twice by
 
02:49:54.000 --> 02:49:55.610 align:start position:0%
um for that project was denied twice by
Des

02:49:55.610 --> 02:49:55.620 align:start position:0%
Des
 
02:49:55.620 --> 02:49:56.150 align:start position:0%
Des
um

02:49:56.150 --> 02:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:59.030 --> 02:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
and we asked for
 
02:50:00.889 --> 02:50:00.899 align:start position:0%
um the second time I believe we asked
 
02:50:03.590 --> 02:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
for the project to be considered a
 
02:50:06.530 --> 02:50:06.540 align:start position:0%
permit by notification project which
 
02:50:10.070 --> 02:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
would have included a 400 fee and that
 
02:50:11.990 --> 02:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
was also denied
 
02:50:14.510 --> 02:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh we did
 
02:50:17.630 --> 02:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
um uh have reach out to Executive
 
02:50:20.809 --> 02:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
counselor cryons and he interceded on
 
02:50:23.450 --> 02:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
the district's behalf uh to help get a
 
02:50:25.929 --> 02:50:25.939 align:start position:0%
waiver for the project uh so ultimately
 
02:50:30.830 --> 02:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh Des had approved a waiver uh for the
 
02:50:35.809 --> 02:50:35.819 align:start position:0%
the permit so that 35 000 fee went to a
 
02:50:39.170 --> 02:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
400 fee for the district
 
02:50:41.630 --> 02:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
um the project
 
02:50:41.640 --> 02:50:42.230 align:start position:0%
um the project
um

02:50:42.230 --> 02:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:50:46.070 --> 02:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
the Des considered the project a new
 
02:50:49.550 --> 02:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
utility due to a change in the alignment
 
02:50:53.389 --> 02:50:53.399 align:start position:0%
of the existing Force main and temporary
 
02:50:56.090 --> 02:50:56.100 align:start position:0%
disturbances abutting
 
02:50:57.770 --> 02:50:57.780 align:start position:0%
um the baker River
 
02:50:59.690 --> 02:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
the district believed that the
 
02:51:01.910 --> 02:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
construction work was an important
 
02:51:04.910 --> 02:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
Improvement to an existing utility and
 
02:51:07.790 --> 02:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
the alignment needs needed to change to
 
02:51:09.650 --> 02:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
allow for maintenance of the Force main
 
02:51:11.750 --> 02:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
following Construction
 
02:51:15.050 --> 02:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
uh so I think this is kind of the uh
 
02:51:16.670 --> 02:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
difference that I don't believe was
 
02:51:17.929 --> 02:51:17.939 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
02:51:20.929 --> 02:51:20.939 align:start position:0%
um in regard to a new project versus an
 
02:51:25.490 --> 02:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
existing utility uh that would would
 
02:51:28.969 --> 02:51:28.979 align:start position:0%
allow a municipality to apply for a
 
02:51:31.910 --> 02:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
permit by notification and essentially
 
02:51:34.790 --> 02:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
be exempt of the impact fees that would
 
02:51:38.630 --> 02:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
come with a new project
 
02:51:42.530 --> 02:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
um uh new project permit
 
02:51:42.540 --> 02:51:43.790 align:start position:0%
um uh new project permit
so

02:51:43.790 --> 02:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:51:46.910 --> 02:51:46.920 align:start position:0%
the uh you know moving forward if the
 
02:51:49.570 --> 02:51:49.580 align:start position:0%
amendment is not passed for an exemption
 
02:51:52.550 --> 02:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
the district will also face significant
 
02:51:54.830 --> 02:51:54.840 align:start position:0%
Shoreland permit fees in the next few
 
02:51:59.150 --> 02:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
years ranging between 15 and 25 thousand
 
02:52:01.730 --> 02:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
dollars for several Water and Sewer
 
02:52:03.650 --> 02:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
infrastructure projects
 
02:52:06.230 --> 02:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
that are federally funded through the
 
02:52:09.050 --> 02:52:09.060 align:start position:0%
USDA Rural Development the state
 
02:52:12.590 --> 02:52:12.600 align:start position:0%
drinking water and clean water srf funds
 
02:52:14.809 --> 02:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
as well as the drinking water and
 
02:52:18.050 --> 02:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
groundwater trust fund so these fees
 
02:52:20.690 --> 02:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
will essentially be paid back to the
 
02:52:24.710 --> 02:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
state using funds from the state and and
 
02:52:26.570 --> 02:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
02:52:29.710 --> 02:52:29.720 align:start position:0%
small utility operations like ours
 
02:52:32.210 --> 02:52:32.220 align:start position:0%
struggle with maintaining affordability
 
02:52:34.849 --> 02:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
in the face of increasing requirements
 
02:52:37.429 --> 02:52:37.439 align:start position:0%
and the huge cost of maintaining and
 
02:52:39.769 --> 02:52:39.779 align:start position:0%
upgrading aging infrastructure
 
02:52:43.550 --> 02:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
the state imposed fees only add to the
 
02:52:45.290 --> 02:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
seemingly insurmountable Financial
 
02:52:47.690 --> 02:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
challenges of providing the potable
 
02:52:50.269 --> 02:52:50.279 align:start position:0%
water and treatment of Wastewater that
 
02:52:52.250 --> 02:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
is essential to public health and safety
 
02:52:54.349 --> 02:52:54.359 align:start position:0%
in every New Hampshire community
 
02:52:55.790 --> 02:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
 
02:52:58.910 --> 02:52:58.920 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair
 
03:58:16.610 --> 03:58:16.620 align:start position:0%
last session uh this committee struggled
 
03:58:18.170 --> 03:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
with the impacts of off Highway
 
03:58:20.330 --> 03:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
recreational vehicles
 
03:58:23.269 --> 03:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
on residents living where these vehicles
 
03:58:24.710 --> 03:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
are used
 
03:58:27.590 --> 03:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
it is understood that these vehicles are
 
03:58:30.590 --> 03:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
part of an economic Revival in some
 
03:58:32.090 --> 03:58:32.100 align:start position:0%
parts of the state
 
03:58:34.610 --> 03:58:34.620 align:start position:0%
they are here to stay
 
03:58:37.550 --> 03:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
where is the line between their youth
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
and their impact on those Limited in the
 
03:58:40.080 --> 03:58:41.510 align:start position:0%
and their impact on those Limited in the
area

03:58:41.510 --> 03:58:41.520 align:start position:0%
area
 
03:58:43.550 --> 03:58:43.560 align:start position:0%
in the course of the commute of the
 
03:58:46.189 --> 03:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
committee's investigations we saw some
 
03:58:48.710 --> 03:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
things that concerned us
 
03:58:50.510 --> 03:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
one thing that concerned this
 
03:58:54.010 --> 03:58:54.020 align:start position:0%
representative was that the use of large
 
03:58:56.990 --> 03:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
off-road recreational vehicles where he
 
03:59:00.170 --> 03:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
reobserved on a class six Road
 
03:59:02.630 --> 03:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
with an elite with the ellipse tacit
 
03:59:05.090 --> 03:59:05.100 align:start position:0%
approval of local authorities
 
03:59:08.210 --> 03:59:08.220 align:start position:0%
since the people in a class six road now
 
03:59:12.290 --> 03:59:12.300 align:start position:0%
have to pay for the road upkeep
 
03:59:15.170 --> 03:59:15.180 align:start position:0%
should there be some protection
 
03:59:17.750 --> 03:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
or restitution for damage to the role of
 
03:59:19.969 --> 03:59:19.979 align:start position:0%
these vehicles that's a good question
 
03:59:22.490 --> 03:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
but there's no good answer
 
03:59:25.010 --> 03:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
as the transportation committee was
 
03:59:28.790 --> 03:59:28.800 align:start position:0%
forming a commission to study the road
 
03:59:31.510 --> 03:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
usage of non-traditional motor vehicles
 
03:59:34.849 --> 03:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
and that roads including class six roads
 
03:59:37.130 --> 03:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
came under their jurisdiction
 
03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
to a resource recreational development
 
03:59:43.250 --> 03:59:43.260 align:start position:0%
reps were added to the commission
 
03:59:45.110 --> 03:59:45.120 align:start position:0%
along with the charge that the
 
03:59:48.170 --> 03:59:48.180 align:start position:0%
commission shall study the on-road usage
 
03:59:51.830 --> 03:59:51.840 align:start position:0%
of non-traditional Motor Vehicles
 
03:59:54.650 --> 03:59:54.660 align:start position:0%
such that all terrain vehicles and such
 
03:59:57.349 --> 03:59:57.359 align:start position:0%
as alterated vehicles and golf carts
 
03:59:59.450 --> 03:59:59.460 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the commission has only
 
04:00:02.330 --> 04:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
met twice and appears to have fallen
 
04:00:04.849 --> 04:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
victim to the coven
 
04:00:06.889 --> 04:00:06.899 align:start position:0%
while I still have hopes for the
 
04:00:10.130 --> 04:00:10.140 align:start position:0%
commission I wanted to hedge my bet this
 
04:00:13.010 --> 04:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
bill proposes a bipartisan legislative
 
04:00:13.020 --> 04:00:14.450 align:start position:0%
bill proposes a bipartisan legislative
committee

04:00:14.450 --> 04:00:14.460 align:start position:0%
committee
 
04:00:16.370 --> 04:00:16.380 align:start position:0%
propose of members from the three
 
04:00:18.889 --> 04:00:18.899 align:start position:0%
committees that should have a say on
 
04:00:21.590 --> 04:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:24.670 --> 04:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
Transportation knows roads
 
04:00:27.410 --> 04:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
Municipal accounting no zoning and land
 
04:00:32.929 --> 04:00:32.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:36.290 --> 04:00:36.300 align:start position:0%
we might then be able to view all
 
04:00:39.950 --> 04:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
aspects allowing recreational use
 
04:00:44.510 --> 04:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
of view all the aspects of the allowing
 
04:00:49.010 --> 04:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
of recreational uses on public roads
 
04:00:51.410 --> 04:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
the present Commission
 
04:00:53.389 --> 04:00:53.399 align:start position:0%
is still in place
 
04:00:56.210 --> 04:00:56.220 align:start position:0%
and I hope we'll be up to running up and
 
04:00:57.650 --> 04:00:57.660 align:start position:0%
running soon
 
04:01:01.250 --> 04:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
as such I would ask that the committee
 
04:01:04.010 --> 04:01:04.020 align:start position:0%
to please hold this bill in advance by
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
retaining it
 
04:01:07.610 --> 04:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
should the present commission falter or
 
04:01:11.150 --> 04:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
40 or fall short
 
04:01:13.969 --> 04:01:13.979 align:start position:0%
we will have a leader a vehicle to
 
04:01:17.750 --> 04:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
further address this issues and
 
04:01:22.910 --> 04:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:24.650 --> 04:01:24.660 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from the
 
04:01:33.530 --> 04:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:36.050 --> 04:01:36.060 align:start position:0%
I see no questions okay seeing none
 
04:01:39.170 --> 04:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
we'll move to the next speaker
 
04:01:39.180 --> 04:01:45.550 align:start position:0%
we'll move to the next speaker
achievements

04:01:45.550 --> 04:01:45.560 align:start position:0%

and I'm I'm pleased to
 
04:02:29.809 --> 04:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
want to testify in support of this I do
 
04:02:32.689 --> 04:02:32.699 align:start position:0%
understand the circumstances around the
 
04:02:35.570 --> 04:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
sponsor's request to retain it but I
 
04:02:38.630 --> 04:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
just wanted to take this opportunity
 
04:02:42.290 --> 04:02:42.300 align:start position:0%
um to raise two two points
 
04:02:46.910 --> 04:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
um on the whole concept of ohrv use on
 
04:02:50.570 --> 04:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
on public roads class five and class six
 
04:02:53.870 --> 04:02:53.880 align:start position:0%
um I hear regularly from my members kind
 
04:02:55.790 --> 04:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
of two overlying concerns and I just
 
04:02:58.550 --> 04:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to get this in the record and as
 
04:03:00.950 --> 04:03:00.960 align:start position:0%
this uh should this committee move
 
04:03:00.960 --> 04:03:02.689 align:start position:0%
this uh should this committee move
forward

04:03:02.689 --> 04:03:02.699 align:start position:0%
forward
 
04:03:04.550 --> 04:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
um hope these would be considerations
 
04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%
that they would would look at one is you
 
04:03:10.250 --> 04:03:10.260 align:start position:0%
know the use of these roads for by by
 
04:03:12.670 --> 04:03:12.680 align:start position:0%
the landowners of the properties
 
04:03:16.070 --> 04:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
adjacent to those roads you know they
 
04:03:19.370 --> 04:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
are use of them for actually work
 
04:03:22.490 --> 04:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
um and landowners using ohrvs to travel
 
04:03:24.410 --> 04:03:24.420 align:start position:0%
on these roads
 
04:03:27.950 --> 04:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
um our hope would be that you know that
 
04:03:29.630 --> 04:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
there would not be anything that would
 
04:03:31.550 --> 04:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
you know come out of this process that
 
04:03:34.070 --> 04:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
would restrict or curtail that type of
 
04:03:34.080 --> 04:03:35.410 align:start position:0%
would restrict or curtail that type of
activity

04:03:35.410 --> 04:03:35.420 align:start position:0%
activity
 
04:03:39.050 --> 04:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
ohrvs are incredibly useful tools
 
04:03:41.570 --> 04:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
for Forest management they enable
 
04:03:44.809 --> 04:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
landowners to in land managers to access
 
04:03:47.689 --> 04:03:47.699 align:start position:0%
back parts of their property with with
 
04:03:49.610 --> 04:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
the necessary tools and instruments they
 
04:03:49.620 --> 04:03:50.330 align:start position:0%
the necessary tools and instruments they
need

04:03:50.330 --> 04:03:50.340 align:start position:0%
need
 
04:03:53.450 --> 04:03:53.460 align:start position:0%
and uh we would hate to see that you
 
04:03:55.309 --> 04:03:55.319 align:start position:0%
know curtailed
 
04:03:59.150 --> 04:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
um the second is on the other hand
 
04:04:01.849 --> 04:04:01.859 align:start position:0%
um ohrv use you know a lot I've been
 
04:04:04.010 --> 04:04:04.020 align:start position:0%
following this subject in in your
 
04:04:06.110 --> 04:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
committee for the last several years you
 
04:04:07.670 --> 04:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
hear a lot about the impacts on
 
04:04:10.429 --> 04:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
neighbors noise dust Etc
 
04:04:13.130 --> 04:04:13.140 align:start position:0%
but the other impact is in the sponsor
 
04:04:15.710 --> 04:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
had mentioned it damaged to the roads um
 
04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
as landowners will will go into uh we'll
 
04:04:22.370 --> 04:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
have to use a class six road to access a
 
04:04:24.610 --> 04:04:24.620 align:start position:0%
property to go in and harvest timber
 
04:04:28.910 --> 04:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
because the town is not obligated to in
 
04:04:31.849 --> 04:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
you know invest in it the landowners
 
04:04:33.769 --> 04:04:33.779 align:start position:0%
that are conducting the timber sale are
 
04:04:35.870 --> 04:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
investing it and it gets it can become
 
04:04:37.910 --> 04:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
very frustrating
 
04:04:40.189 --> 04:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
um to see that investment literally
 
04:04:42.610 --> 04:04:42.620 align:start position:0%
washed away due to rutting and
 
04:04:46.429 --> 04:04:46.439 align:start position:0%
inappropriate inappropriate use so I
 
04:04:48.650 --> 04:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
just wanted to raise these two points I
 
04:04:51.349 --> 04:04:51.359 align:start position:0%
look forward to the commission
 
04:04:54.349 --> 04:04:54.359 align:start position:0%
um that that that is currently on hold
 
04:04:56.809 --> 04:04:56.819 align:start position:0%
looking forward to getting that seeing
 
04:04:59.689 --> 04:04:59.699 align:start position:0%
that up and operational but I appreciate
 
04:05:01.729 --> 04:05:01.739 align:start position:0%

concepts out there and look forward to

04:06:51.610 --> 04:06:51.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:57.050 --> 04:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
HB 1182 the study commission uh Nova has
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
a seat on that commission and as a
 
04:07:02.809 --> 04:07:02.819 align:start position:0%
sponsor stated uh was off to a slow
 
04:07:04.969 --> 04:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
start because of covid
 
04:07:07.429 --> 04:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
um but I have uh faked that once that
 
04:07:08.750 --> 04:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
gets moving
 
04:07:10.370 --> 04:07:10.380 align:start position:0%
um information about this will start
 
04:07:13.550 --> 04:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
flowing and uh some some good ideas will
 
04:07:15.769 --> 04:07:15.779 align:start position:0%
come out of that
 
04:07:18.130 --> 04:07:18.140 align:start position:0%
um in 2019
 
04:07:22.790 --> 04:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
this legislature passed a bill uh to
 
04:07:25.550 --> 04:07:25.560 align:start position:0%
require two-week notice by verified mail
 
04:07:29.689 --> 04:07:29.699 align:start position:0%
to all a Butters uh for these class five
 
04:07:33.290 --> 04:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
and class six roads uh and and have a
 
04:07:35.150 --> 04:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
04:07:38.269 --> 04:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
um since that legislature there there
 
04:07:41.030 --> 04:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
have been towns like Stewartstown North
 
04:07:45.229 --> 04:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
Stratford Warner Hinsdale and Monroe New
 
04:07:48.530 --> 04:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who have all closed down some
 
04:07:51.889 --> 04:07:51.899 align:start position:0%
or all of their roads to ohrvs
 
04:07:54.950 --> 04:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
um for you know mainly the reasons of of
 
04:07:57.530 --> 04:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
neighbors complaining
 
04:08:01.070 --> 04:08:01.080 align:start position:0%
um in Gorham uh the state has worked
 
04:08:03.650 --> 04:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
diligently to put in a new parking area
 
04:08:06.710 --> 04:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh up on route 16.
 
04:08:09.469 --> 04:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
and now Gorham has has requested to
 
04:08:12.349 --> 04:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
close the Route 2 parking area which was
 
04:08:14.870 --> 04:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
a major point in contention a few years
 
04:08:16.849 --> 04:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
ago and actually spurred some
 
04:08:16.859 --> 04:08:18.469 align:start position:0%
ago and actually spurred some
legislation

04:08:18.469 --> 04:08:18.479 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:08:20.689 --> 04:08:20.699 align:start position:0%
um which which failed
 
04:08:23.150 --> 04:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
um and and it seems like that parking
 
04:08:26.570 --> 04:08:26.580 align:start position:0%
area may go back to the hikers who want
 
04:08:29.269 --> 04:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
to access the presidential Trail and
 
04:08:31.849 --> 04:08:31.859 align:start position:0%
other hiking trails around with the new
 
04:08:35.389 --> 04:08:35.399 align:start position:0%
parking area up on route 16.
 
04:08:38.750 --> 04:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
some of the clubs have already put in
 
04:08:42.110 --> 04:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
new trails in the woods and and rerouted
 
04:08:45.530 --> 04:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
uh their Trails off from class five and
 
04:08:50.570 --> 04:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:53.929 --> 04:08:53.939 align:start position:0%
as far as maintaining the class six and
 
04:08:57.410 --> 04:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
class 5 roads under the grant and aid
 
04:08:59.450 --> 04:08:59.460 align:start position:0%
program that is offered through Bureau
 
04:09:03.290 --> 04:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
of trails a local municipality can apply
 
04:09:05.410 --> 04:09:05.420 align:start position:0%
for these Grant need
 
04:09:08.570 --> 04:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
requests they can spend money on their
 
04:09:10.630 --> 04:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
class five roads that they've opened up
 
04:09:13.610 --> 04:09:13.620 align:start position:0%
and there's towns like Pittsburgh who
 
04:09:16.670 --> 04:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
the the club has put calcium chloride on
 
04:09:18.410 --> 04:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
some of the dirt roads to keep down the
 
04:09:18.420 --> 04:09:19.570 align:start position:0%
some of the dirt roads to keep down the
dust

04:09:19.570 --> 04:09:19.580 align:start position:0%
dust
 
04:09:23.389 --> 04:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
but municipalities often don't know this
 
04:09:27.410 --> 04:09:27.420 align:start position:0%
is a source of income that they could
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
use to offset the cost of taking care of
 
04:09:32.030 --> 04:09:32.040 align:start position:0%
these roads if they open them to ohrvs
 
04:09:35.150 --> 04:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
as far as the class six roads they can't
 
04:09:40.070 --> 04:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
put money towards and so if a club
 
04:09:42.710 --> 04:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
gets permission to use that class six
 
04:09:46.849 --> 04:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
Road as a trail now the club is eligible
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
for grant and aid through the same Grant
 
04:09:51.290 --> 04:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
made program
 
04:09:55.610 --> 04:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
to work on those roads the local club
 
04:09:57.950 --> 04:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
I'm involved with just put over ten
 
04:10:00.830 --> 04:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars worth of work in a
 
04:10:03.889 --> 04:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
short section of class six roads between
 
04:10:06.290 --> 04:10:06.300 align:start position:0%
Cornish and Newport
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
um which has has not seen any work over
 
04:10:12.110 --> 04:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
the years and really needed some some
 
04:10:14.090 --> 04:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
basic attention
 
04:10:16.630 --> 04:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
um this was all spurred through a
 
04:10:20.150 --> 04:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
Cooperative program with the City of
 
04:10:23.210 --> 04:10:23.220 align:start position:0%
Claremont to protect the Watershed which
 
04:10:25.189 --> 04:10:25.199 align:start position:0%
we do have a couple of trails going
 
04:10:25.199 --> 04:10:26.929 align:start position:0%
we do have a couple of trails going
through

04:10:26.929 --> 04:10:26.939 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:10:31.550 --> 04:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
um as far as Nova on the New Hampshire
 
04:10:34.010 --> 04:10:34.020 align:start position:0%
off highway vehicle association has an
 
04:10:37.309 --> 04:10:37.319 align:start position:0%
association they have created a trail
 
04:10:41.030 --> 04:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
Patrol program to encourage clubs uh
 
04:10:42.590 --> 04:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
which there are some clubs that already
 
04:10:44.330 --> 04:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
had Trail Patrols
 
04:10:47.150 --> 04:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
but we're encouraging Trail Patrols in
 
04:10:50.150 --> 04:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
all clubs to get to these hot spots and
 
04:10:53.450 --> 04:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
try to educate the Riders on on what it
 
04:10:56.210 --> 04:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
takes to maintain these Trails on the
 
04:10:59.030 --> 04:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
roads and on private property
 
04:10:59.040 --> 04:10:59.710 align:start position:0%
roads and on private property
um

04:10:59.710 --> 04:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:04.010 --> 04:11:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's it's no secret that the economic
 
04:11:06.950 --> 04:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
factor is there but really the impact to
 
04:11:09.950 --> 04:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
everyone is really what is of most
 
04:11:12.110 --> 04:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
concern and
 
04:11:14.929 --> 04:11:14.939 align:start position:0%
um Nova has worked on an education
 
04:11:17.030 --> 04:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
program also
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
for those Trail Patrol people to hand
 
04:11:23.150 --> 04:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
out rack cards and encourage them to
 
04:11:24.530 --> 04:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
join clubs
 
04:11:26.450 --> 04:11:26.460 align:start position:0%
currently we only have about a 40
 
04:11:26.460 --> 04:11:27.769 align:start position:0%
currently we only have about a 40
percent

04:11:27.769 --> 04:11:27.779 align:start position:0%
percent
 
04:11:30.710 --> 04:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
um uh percentage who join clubs versus
 
04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
don't join clubs most people who join
 
04:11:35.809 --> 04:11:35.819 align:start position:0%
the clubs are respectful of the trails
 
04:11:37.550 --> 04:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
they understand what the clubs go
 
04:11:39.650 --> 04:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
through to put the trails out there
 
04:11:42.110 --> 04:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
the the people who don't join the clubs
 
04:11:44.689 --> 04:11:44.699 align:start position:0%
and just pay the extra thirty dollars
 
04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's so many new riders that they
 
04:11:49.670 --> 04:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
just don't understand in the in the last
 
04:11:52.550 --> 04:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
four or five years of growth you know
 
04:11:55.910 --> 04:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
have shown that so all this
 
04:11:57.769 --> 04:11:57.779 align:start position:0%
um legislation over the last few years
 
04:12:00.290 --> 04:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
has really spurred
 
04:12:02.809 --> 04:12:02.819 align:start position:0%
um a lot of positivity coming out of
 
04:12:02.819 --> 04:12:03.830 align:start position:0%
um a lot of positivity coming out of
this

04:12:03.830 --> 04:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:12:07.610 --> 04:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
in working with uh the the neighbors and
 
04:12:11.450 --> 04:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
the butters that are uh unhappy
 
04:12:15.429 --> 04:12:15.439 align:start position:0%
um grant and aid increased uh in 2018
 
04:12:19.130 --> 04:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
due to the club membership program and
 
04:12:22.309 --> 04:12:22.319 align:start position:0%
it used to be only about 330 thousand
 
04:12:24.290 --> 04:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
dollars went to the clubs to maintain
 
04:12:26.929 --> 04:12:26.939 align:start position:0%
trails and last year they were awarded
 
04:12:29.809 --> 04:12:29.819 align:start position:0%
close to 700 000 which
 
04:12:32.389 --> 04:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
created almost a million dollars worth
 
04:12:33.950 --> 04:12:33.960 align:start position:0%
of Trail work last year
 
04:12:36.170 --> 04:12:36.180 align:start position:0%
last year so um the notion of thinking
 
04:12:38.150 --> 04:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
that these class six roads are getting
 
04:12:41.450 --> 04:12:41.460 align:start position:0%
no attention uh can't be the furthest
 
04:12:43.969 --> 04:12:43.979 align:start position:0%
from the truth and the the work is
 
04:12:46.670 --> 04:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
actually being done as this money keeps
 
04:12:48.769 --> 04:12:48.779 align:start position:0%
coming in and as our registration
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
numbers grow that Grant need
 
04:12:54.290 --> 04:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
a pool grows and more money goes to the
 
04:12:57.170 --> 04:12:57.180 align:start position:0%
trails supporting this
 
04:13:00.290 --> 04:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
um sport that so many people enjoy
 
04:13:04.309 --> 04:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
and that concludes the testimony
 
04:13:07.729 --> 04:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
um you know this this should illustrate
 
04:13:10.250 --> 04:13:10.260 align:start position:0%
that the current system is working and
 
04:13:12.349 --> 04:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
most municipalities are addressing the
 
04:13:14.330 --> 04:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
complaints and concerns of their
 
04:13:14.340 --> 04:13:17.689 align:start position:0%
complaints and concerns of their
residents

04:13:17.689 --> 04:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:20.030 --> 04:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr Wilkie are there any
 
04:13:21.290 --> 04:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
questions from the members of the
 
04:13:28.250 --> 04:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:32.290 --> 04:13:32.300 align:start position:0%
that's an answer uh representative Smith
 
04:13:34.370 --> 04:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
representative Smith for a question
 
04:13:34.380 --> 04:13:36.469 align:start position:0%
representative Smith for a question
please

04:13:36.469 --> 04:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
please
 
04:13:38.389 --> 04:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:13:41.330 --> 04:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
can't hear you yeah thank you Mr chair
 
04:13:44.090 --> 04:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
and um thank you Mr Wilkie for taking my
 
04:13:44.100 --> 04:13:45.349 align:start position:0%
and um thank you Mr Wilkie for taking my
question

04:13:45.349 --> 04:13:45.359 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:13:48.889 --> 04:13:48.899 align:start position:0%
um you talk about the grant program and
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
which I have heard of before
 
04:13:52.319 --> 04:13:53.650 align:start position:0%
which I have heard of before
foreign

04:13:53.650 --> 04:13:53.660 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
04:13:57.590 --> 04:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
visiting a few sites last year
 
04:13:57.600 --> 04:13:58.910 align:start position:0%
visiting a few sites last year
um

04:13:58.910 --> 04:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:01.729 --> 04:14:01.739 align:start position:0%
it did not seem that the people who
 
04:14:04.250 --> 04:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
lived on the classics roads or owned the
 
04:14:05.990 --> 04:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
property under the classics Road were
 
04:14:09.170 --> 04:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
aware of this how does one apply for one
 
04:14:12.349 --> 04:14:12.359 align:start position:0%
of these grants and what is the process
 
04:14:15.050 --> 04:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
so the municipality themselves would
 
04:14:17.510 --> 04:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
need to apply for that they would want
 
04:14:20.929 --> 04:14:20.939 align:start position:0%
to contact uh the bureau trails in
 
04:14:20.939 --> 04:14:22.490 align:start position:0%
to contact uh the bureau trails in
Concord

04:16:43.610 --> 04:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
I worked with uh
 
04:16:45.229 --> 04:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
the committee a couple of years ago
 
04:16:47.809 --> 04:16:47.819 align:start position:0%
relative to toxic chemicals on the rail
 
04:16:47.819 --> 04:16:50.330 align:start position:0%
relative to toxic chemicals on the rail
trails

04:16:50.330 --> 04:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:52.070 --> 04:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
anyway uh
 
04:16:54.110 --> 04:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
what I have to say today is that the
 
04:16:56.330 --> 04:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
committee is our only voice
 
04:16:59.090 --> 04:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
uh against in against our protection
 
04:17:01.490 --> 04:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
against the ohrv lobby which is very
 
04:17:01.500 --> 04:17:02.630 align:start position:0%
against the ohrv lobby which is very
powerful

04:17:02.630 --> 04:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
powerful
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
and the only way we can get any redress
 
04:17:06.590 --> 04:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
on this and and protect our
 
04:17:08.269 --> 04:17:08.279 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and the Fifth
 
04:17:11.450 --> 04:17:11.460 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh and and to avoid inverse
 
04:17:11.460 --> 04:17:12.769 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh and and to avoid inverse
condemnation

04:17:12.769 --> 04:17:12.779 align:start position:0%
condemnation
 
04:17:14.450 --> 04:17:14.460 align:start position:0%
is to have a committee that's going to
 
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
come up with some regulations that's
 
04:17:20.090 --> 04:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
rsas that's going to protect us from uh
 
04:17:21.490 --> 04:17:21.500 align:start position:0%
the increasing
 
04:17:23.750 --> 04:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
encroachment on our property on our
 
04:17:23.760 --> 04:17:24.650 align:start position:0%
encroachment on our property on our
roads

04:17:24.650 --> 04:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
roads
 
04:17:27.650 --> 04:17:27.660 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:17:31.070 --> 04:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:34.910 --> 04:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
protect us from the stress related to
 
04:17:36.889 --> 04:17:36.899 align:start position:0%
noise fumes and dust
 
04:17:40.389 --> 04:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:43.729 --> 04:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
they're specifically designed aohr Visa
 
04:17:46.610 --> 04:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
specifically designed for trails and
 
04:17:49.729 --> 04:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
really not designed for on roads class 5
 
04:17:52.309 --> 04:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
or class six because it results in
 
04:17:55.969 --> 04:17:55.979 align:start position:0%
erosion and other issues
 
04:17:55.979 --> 04:17:59.269 align:start position:0%
erosion and other issues
um

04:17:59.269 --> 04:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:03.349 --> 04:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
the loss of peace and quiet due to ohrv
 
04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
noise is well documented and the the
 
04:18:08.450 --> 04:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
noise results in stress and the fumes
 
04:18:14.750 --> 04:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:17.689 --> 04:18:17.699 align:start position:0%
as the previous speaker mentioned the uh
 
04:18:17.699 --> 04:18:20.210 align:start position:0%
as the previous speaker mentioned the uh
the uh

04:18:20.210 --> 04:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:18:22.670 --> 04:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
increase in registrations is is growing
 
04:18:25.130 --> 04:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
every year and so the desire for
 
04:18:27.950 --> 04:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
operating in other areas by The
 
04:18:30.469 --> 04:18:30.479 align:start position:0%
Operators grows every year because they
 
04:18:32.510 --> 04:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
there's just so many trails for them to
 
04:18:34.910 --> 04:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
ride on the state has spent thousands
 
04:18:36.889 --> 04:18:36.899 align:start position:0%
and thousands of dollars for Mo for the
 
04:18:39.410 --> 04:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
Jericho State Park area where they can
 
04:18:41.269 --> 04:18:41.279 align:start position:0%
ride and that connects with numerous
 
04:18:42.769 --> 04:18:42.779 align:start position:0%
other Trails throughout the Northeast
 
04:18:45.650 --> 04:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
Northern political state
 
04:18:48.290 --> 04:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
the southern part of the state is a much
 
04:18:50.630 --> 04:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
more densely populated even though I
 
04:18:53.990 --> 04:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
live on a a class six or class five road
 
04:18:57.050 --> 04:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
with only four immediate neighbors
 
04:19:00.050 --> 04:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
um we all relish our peace and quiet and
 
04:19:03.050 --> 04:19:03.060 align:start position:0%
we cannot put a price on that
 
04:19:05.450 --> 04:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
um three years ago a local Club attended
 
04:19:07.610 --> 04:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
attempted to get permission to operate
 
04:19:10.849 --> 04:19:10.859 align:start position:0%
ATVs in Hillsboro we formed a local
 
04:19:13.370 --> 04:19:13.380 align:start position:0%
committee we hired an attorney and we
 
04:19:14.630 --> 04:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
prepared to
 
04:19:17.090 --> 04:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
um proceed if the Selectmen had desired
 
04:19:17.100 --> 04:19:18.530 align:start position:0%
um proceed if the Selectmen had desired
had

04:19:18.530 --> 04:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:19:19.610 --> 04:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
um determined that they were going to
 
04:19:22.070 --> 04:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
allow that club to operate we presented
 
04:19:24.530 --> 04:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
arguments and the Selectmen decided not
 
04:19:26.870 --> 04:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
to allow the club to operate because of
 
04:19:28.849 --> 04:19:28.859 align:start position:0%
all the opposition we've had numerous
 
04:19:31.729 --> 04:19:31.739 align:start position:0%
hearings in Hillsboro and and are not
 
04:19:33.950 --> 04:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
hearings but but meetings with the
 
04:19:36.769 --> 04:19:36.779 align:start position:0%
Selectmen over ATV issues in town and
 
04:19:39.889 --> 04:19:39.899 align:start position:0%
it's I'd say it's 99 negative because of
 
04:19:43.010 --> 04:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
the residents being upset by operators
 
04:19:46.010 --> 04:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
racing up and down roads and the noise
 
04:19:48.769 --> 04:19:48.779 align:start position:0%
in general is is really distasteful
 
04:19:52.610 --> 04:19:52.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:54.769 --> 04:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how many people are aware
 
04:19:56.809 --> 04:19:56.819 align:start position:0%
of the uh the incident that happened in
 
04:19:58.790 --> 04:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
in Gorham a few years ago when they
 
04:20:01.189 --> 04:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
retired or orthopedic surgeon from South
 
04:20:03.650 --> 04:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
Dakota built his uh dream retirement
 
04:20:05.570 --> 04:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
home and then a couple of years later
 
04:20:08.870 --> 04:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
they opened up an adjacent Trail and a
 
04:20:11.510 --> 04:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
parking area near his house and he
 
04:20:13.370 --> 04:20:13.380 align:start position:0%
opposed it and they found out and they
 
04:20:14.990 --> 04:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
proceeded to harass him to the point
 
04:20:18.110 --> 04:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
where a year later he took his own life
 
04:20:21.429 --> 04:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
and as a result of the ohrv operation
 
04:20:24.229 --> 04:20:24.239 align:start position:0%
immediately around its property and
 
04:20:26.150 --> 04:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
harassment by operators
 
04:20:28.370 --> 04:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
so um that's the kind of stress that
 
04:20:30.830 --> 04:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
they can induce and um we're I'm really
 
04:20:32.150 --> 04:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
in support of this bill that the
 
04:20:33.710 --> 04:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
committee will come up with some kind of
 
04:20:33.720 --> 04:20:35.450 align:start position:0%
committee will come up with some kind of
rational

04:20:35.450 --> 04:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
rational
 
04:20:39.290 --> 04:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
um regulations and rsas to prevent
 
04:20:39.300 --> 04:20:40.010 align:start position:0%
um regulations and rsas to prevent
um

04:20:40.010 --> 04:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:43.729 --> 04:20:43.739 align:start position:0%
the encroachment on our rights of and uh
 
04:20:47.689 --> 04:20:47.699 align:start position:0%
the um the lobbying efforts of the ohrv
 
04:20:49.809 --> 04:20:49.819 align:start position:0%
is is you know we need we need support
 
04:20:53.389 --> 04:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
by our representatives to to um protect
 
04:20:55.130 --> 04:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
us from that Lobby which is very
 
04:20:56.929 --> 04:20:56.939 align:start position:0%
powerful and and
 
04:20:56.939 --> 04:20:57.650 align:start position:0%
powerful and and
um

04:20:57.650 --> 04:20:57.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:00.229 --> 04:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
successful so a lot of the as I
 
04:21:01.969 --> 04:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
understand it a lot of the bills are
 
04:21:03.950 --> 04:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
regulations that were proposed years ago
 
04:21:06.469 --> 04:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
have were repeatedly watered down over
 
04:21:08.570 --> 04:21:08.580 align:start position:0%
the last 10 years or so to the point
 
04:21:11.510 --> 04:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
where they were no longer affect it
 
04:21:13.729 --> 04:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
um and most of the and as the um
 
04:21:16.370 --> 04:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
previous is Mr Wilkie stated there's a
 
04:21:17.990 --> 04:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
lot of unhappy residents out there and
 
04:21:20.630 --> 04:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
resulted in regulations so
 
04:21:22.610 --> 04:21:22.620 align:start position:0%
um and because people have basically Fed
 
04:21:24.410 --> 04:21:24.420 align:start position:0%
Up and the towns are closing Trails
 
04:21:26.030 --> 04:21:26.040 align:start position:0%
because of numerous complaints because
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
people just can't they don't want to
 
04:21:30.530 --> 04:21:30.540 align:start position:0%
deal with the noise and fumes and dust
 
04:21:33.349 --> 04:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
so basically I see them as they're kind
 
04:21:36.349 --> 04:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
of like smokers they um they really
 
04:21:38.330 --> 04:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
enjoy what they're doing with very
 
04:21:40.610 --> 04:21:40.620 align:start position:0%
little regard for the secondary effects
 
04:21:40.620 --> 04:21:41.870 align:start position:0%
little regard for the secondary effects
of

04:21:41.870 --> 04:21:41.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:21:44.090 --> 04:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
um you know which was Once Upon a Time
 
04:21:45.950 --> 04:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
second-hand smoke but now it's it's
 
04:21:47.929 --> 04:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with people that are are
 
04:21:50.510 --> 04:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
generating fumes dust and noise and they
 
04:21:52.010 --> 04:21:52.020 align:start position:0%
really don't have any regard for the
 
04:21:54.469 --> 04:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
people that that uh live on the roads
 
04:21:55.729 --> 04:21:55.739 align:start position:0%
where they go by
 
04:21:58.370 --> 04:21:58.380 align:start position:0%
and so hopefully the committee will be
 
04:22:00.050 --> 04:22:00.060 align:start position:0%
formed and and it will come up with
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
something constructive to protect
 
04:22:04.250 --> 04:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
residents and and to support our rights
 
04:22:06.110 --> 04:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
under the Constitution
 
04:22:10.429 --> 04:22:10.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:12.110 --> 04:22:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Collins I
 
04:22:13.969 --> 04:22:13.979 align:start position:0%
appreciate it sir uh are there any
 
04:22:13.979 --> 04:22:15.530 align:start position:0%
appreciate it sir uh are there any
questions

04:22:15.530 --> 04:22:15.540 align:start position:0%
questions
 
04:22:19.370 --> 04:22:19.380 align:start position:0%
from the committee for for Mr Collins
 
04:22:19.380 --> 04:22:22.189 align:start position:0%
from the committee for for Mr Collins
representative

04:22:22.189 --> 04:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:22:24.830 --> 04:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr Collins I appreciate you coming
 
04:22:27.050 --> 04:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
on today and I remember
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh talking to you about this in detail
 
04:22:32.030 --> 04:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
last summer it might be helpful if you
 
04:22:34.550 --> 04:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
could describe your front yard and the
 
04:22:36.110 --> 04:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
amount of traffic that goes in front of
 
04:22:38.330 --> 04:22:38.340 align:start position:0%
your front yard on a on a daily basis
 
04:22:41.990 --> 04:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:44.150 --> 04:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
um on the weekends it's it the uh normal
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
Vehicles regular vehicle traffic
 
04:22:48.370 --> 04:22:48.380 align:start position:0%
increases dramatically on the weekends
 
04:22:50.689 --> 04:22:50.699 align:start position:0%
uh fortunately
 
04:22:53.330 --> 04:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
um we through reports to the police
 
04:22:55.309 --> 04:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
complaints or the police they have been
 
04:22:58.210 --> 04:22:58.220 align:start position:0%
uh very helpful in keeping the ATVs down
 
04:23:01.189 --> 04:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
but uh four years ago the Selectmen
 
04:23:03.290 --> 04:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
decided without con without talking to
 
04:23:05.389 --> 04:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
anyone else Consulting anyone that they
 
04:23:08.090 --> 04:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
would allow 08 the utvs to operate in
 
04:23:10.849 --> 04:23:10.859 align:start position:0%
all the town roads class five roads in
 
04:23:12.769 --> 04:23:12.779 align:start position:0%
any any road under 30 miles an hour
 
04:23:15.710 --> 04:23:15.720 align:start position:0%
posted for under 30. so
 
04:23:18.110 --> 04:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
um the traffic has been
 
04:23:18.120 --> 04:23:20.210 align:start position:0%
um the traffic has been
intermittent

04:23:20.210 --> 04:23:20.220 align:start position:0%
intermittent
 
04:23:23.870 --> 04:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
um but uh it can be it can be annoying
 
04:23:26.269 --> 04:23:26.279 align:start position:0%
when when a seven or eight Vehicles go
 
04:23:27.769 --> 04:23:27.779 align:start position:0%
by all at once
 
04:23:29.630 --> 04:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
I would say on the weekends we might
 
04:23:32.689 --> 04:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
have 10 or 15 a day go by this is this
 
04:23:36.530 --> 04:23:36.540 align:start position:0%
is ohrvs in my neighborhood
 
04:23:40.070 --> 04:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
but um on a regular basis it is at one
 
04:23:42.410 --> 04:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
once once it's the Summer's over it it
 
04:23:44.150 --> 04:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
Windows off to almost down to almost
 
04:23:44.160 --> 04:23:45.110 align:start position:0%
Windows off to almost down to almost
nothing

04:23:45.110 --> 04:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
04:23:48.349 --> 04:23:48.359 align:start position:0%
but um right now we've kept them at Bay
 
04:23:51.710 --> 04:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
because of the of um uh our activities
 
04:23:56.750 --> 04:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
as a committee but um we want to keep it
 
04:23:58.250 --> 04:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
that way we want to keep it from from
 
04:24:00.590 --> 04:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
spreading we want them to be
 
04:24:00.600 --> 04:24:01.429 align:start position:0%
spreading we want them to be
um

04:24:01.429 --> 04:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:03.290 --> 04:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
kept on Trails where they where they're
 
04:24:05.090 --> 04:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
designed to be right now the Selectmen
 
04:24:07.370 --> 04:24:07.380 align:start position:0%
are working on a bill around a bill but
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
a uh a rule for town a town an ordinance
 
04:24:13.929 --> 04:24:13.939 align:start position:0%
to uh limit ohrvs and their activities
 
04:24:16.550 --> 04:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not privy to exactly where it is
 
04:24:18.349 --> 04:24:18.359 align:start position:0%
at this point but they're waiting to to
 
04:24:21.830 --> 04:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
have a hearing in June when uh rep
 
04:24:23.929 --> 04:24:23.939 align:start position:0%
um residents that no longer that are not
 
04:24:25.969 --> 04:24:25.979 align:start position:0%
here in the winter time will return
 
04:24:27.650 --> 04:24:27.660 align:start position:0%
because there's summer homes and so that
 
04:24:28.969 --> 04:24:28.979 align:start position:0%
they'll have input
 
04:24:31.969 --> 04:24:31.979 align:start position:0%
so it's become an issue and and um
 
04:24:33.769 --> 04:24:33.779 align:start position:0%
the the Selectmen are trying to address
 
04:24:33.779 --> 04:24:35.450 align:start position:0%
the the Selectmen are trying to address
it

04:24:35.450 --> 04:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:24:38.630 --> 04:24:38.640 align:start position:0%
so as far as many as car vehicles going
 
04:24:40.309 --> 04:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
by my house
 
04:24:42.050 --> 04:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
um in the summer there's probably a
 
04:24:46.610 --> 04:24:46.620 align:start position:0%
couple dozen a day and um but but the
 
04:24:52.849 --> 04:24:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:54.290 --> 04:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
is there any other
 
04:24:59.889 --> 04:24:59.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:08.030 --> 04:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:08.040 --> 04:25:10.550 align:start position:0%
 
yep

04:25:10.550 --> 04:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:25:13.550 --> 04:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
Joe recognizes Caleb Dobbins
 
04:25:20.450 --> 04:25:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:22.429 --> 04:25:22.439 align:start position:0%
you can just identify yourself who you
 
04:25:23.929 --> 04:25:23.939 align:start position:0%
represent and how much time you'll
 
04:25:26.330 --> 04:25:26.340 align:start position:0%
you'll need yeah thank you Mr chairman
 
04:25:28.070 --> 04:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is Caleb
 
04:25:29.929 --> 04:25:29.939 align:start position:0%
Dobbins I'm a resident of the town of
 
04:25:33.110 --> 04:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
hanaker I'm speaking as a landowner
 
04:25:35.330 --> 04:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
um uh in the town of Henniker and a
 
04:25:37.790 --> 04:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
private citizen of New Hampshire
 
04:25:39.349 --> 04:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
um hopefully I can wrap this up within
 
04:25:42.889 --> 04:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
five minutes uh I'd just like to comment
 
04:25:44.689 --> 04:25:44.699 align:start position:0%
um I understand you folks are discussing
 
04:25:46.910 --> 04:25:46.920 align:start position:0%
class five and class six roads I'm going
 
04:25:49.670 --> 04:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
to probably limit all of my testimony
 
04:25:52.670 --> 04:25:52.680 align:start position:0%
specifically to class six roadways they
 
04:25:54.050 --> 04:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
are very different than a class five
 
04:25:57.349 --> 04:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
roadway I will note a few things
 
04:25:59.809 --> 04:25:59.819 align:start position:0%
um the gentleman from Nova noted that
 
04:26:01.910 --> 04:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
legislation has changed many things in
 
04:26:04.070 --> 04:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
the ohrv industry
 
04:26:05.870 --> 04:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
um all the more reason for you folks to
 
04:26:07.849 --> 04:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
have a committee and continue to look at
 
04:26:10.550 --> 04:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
this subject there is effects that are
 
04:26:12.170 --> 04:26:12.180 align:start position:0%
being happening and the only reason
 
04:26:14.510 --> 04:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
these changes are happening is because
 
04:26:16.849 --> 04:26:16.859 align:start position:0%
the legislature is in fact actually
 
04:26:18.830 --> 04:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
looking at these things so I applaud the
 
04:26:21.290 --> 04:26:21.300 align:start position:0%
legislature for willing to take these
 
04:26:22.870 --> 04:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
issues on
 
04:26:25.729 --> 04:26:25.739 align:start position:0%
so just quickly on class six roads class
 
04:26:27.469 --> 04:26:27.479 align:start position:0%
six roads were originally designed
 
04:26:30.410 --> 04:26:30.420 align:start position:0%
simply to give folks who previously had
 
04:26:33.290 --> 04:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
access to properties in 1925 the state
 
04:26:36.649 --> 04:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
decided what roads needed to stay truly
 
04:26:38.870 --> 04:26:38.880 align:start position:0%
public roads and which ones needed to be
 
04:26:41.269 --> 04:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
remain open such that people who lived
 
04:26:43.370 --> 04:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
on that property could access the
 
04:26:47.570 --> 04:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
property so that was 1925. it talks
 
04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
about being adverse the public use must
 
04:26:51.410 --> 04:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
have been adverse which means that the
 
04:26:51.420 --> 04:26:52.309 align:start position:0%
have been adverse which means that the
public

04:26:52.309 --> 04:26:52.319 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:26:54.649 --> 04:26:54.659 align:start position:0%
has to have either claimed or believed
 
04:26:56.990 --> 04:26:57.000 align:start position:0%
they had a right to access that property
 
04:27:00.410 --> 04:27:00.420 align:start position:0%
okay oh hrvs were not created and were
 
04:27:02.649 --> 04:27:02.659 align:start position:0%
not in existence in New Hampshire until
 
04:27:06.830 --> 04:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
1968. so clearly ohrv users do not have
 
04:27:09.590 --> 04:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
an adverse right to access the
 
04:27:13.010 --> 04:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
properties that they do not own
 
04:27:16.550 --> 04:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
um so the fact that towns have to give
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
special permission to use these roadways
 
04:27:22.010 --> 04:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
for ohrvs and it's really class five or
 
04:27:25.969 --> 04:27:25.979 align:start position:0%
six clearly the use of ohrvs is an
 
04:27:28.550 --> 04:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
unanticipated use of these roadways due
 
04:27:31.910 --> 04:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
to the need for a special permission
 
04:27:33.290 --> 04:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
um I will speak quickly on the
 
04:27:35.269 --> 04:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
maintenance and the liability relative
 
04:27:38.809 --> 04:27:38.819 align:start position:0%
to class six roadways so right now
 
04:27:41.929 --> 04:27:41.939 align:start position:0%
legislation allows a town to open up a
 
04:27:44.929 --> 04:27:44.939 align:start position:0%
Class 6 roadway for ohrv use but as
 
04:27:46.849 --> 04:27:46.859 align:start position:0%
other folks have stated the butters are
 
04:27:49.550 --> 04:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
the ones that must maintain that
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
um it had been it had been noted that
 
04:27:53.290 --> 04:27:53.300 align:start position:0%
there was a grant and aid program
 
04:27:56.269 --> 04:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
that towns can access and somehow that
 
04:27:59.269 --> 04:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
money goes to the clubs I'm not a lawyer
 
04:28:01.370 --> 04:28:01.380 align:start position:0%
but I would argue that would make the
 
04:28:04.370 --> 04:28:04.380 align:start position:0%
club as an agent of the town because the
 
04:28:06.530 --> 04:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
town is the one who's granting the
 
04:28:09.050 --> 04:28:09.060 align:start position:0%
permission for the club to maintain that
 
04:28:11.630 --> 04:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
roadway not the landowner the landowner
 
04:28:13.610 --> 04:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
has no say
 
04:28:15.710 --> 04:28:15.720 align:start position:0%
in whether or not a Classics roadway
 
04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
that runs through their property and
 
04:28:20.269 --> 04:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
they own that property they have no say
 
04:28:23.090 --> 04:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
they cannot say yes or no they are only
 
04:28:23.100 --> 04:28:24.950 align:start position:0%
they cannot say yes or no they are only
notified

04:28:24.950 --> 04:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
notified
 
04:28:27.889 --> 04:28:27.899 align:start position:0%
um so I would argue that any funds any
 
04:28:29.809 --> 04:28:29.819 align:start position:0%
public funds and that is what Grant Aid
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
is it is state and federal funds that
 
04:28:35.630 --> 04:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
are expended on a class six roadway
 
04:28:38.210 --> 04:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
could very well and should revert that
 
04:28:41.510 --> 04:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
road to a class 5 roadway because public
 
04:28:43.550 --> 04:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
funds have been spent on that roadway
 
04:28:45.349 --> 04:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
which will then change the
 
04:28:48.290 --> 04:28:48.300 align:start position:0%
classification from a class six to a
 
04:28:49.729 --> 04:28:49.739 align:start position:0%
class five
 
04:28:51.830 --> 04:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
private landowners are taxed on this
 
04:28:51.840 --> 04:28:53.149 align:start position:0%
private landowners are taxed on this
property

04:28:53.149 --> 04:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:28:55.910 --> 04:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
okay they can't even do things on this
 
04:28:55.920 --> 04:28:57.050 align:start position:0%
okay they can't even do things on this
property

04:28:57.050 --> 04:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:28:58.849 --> 04:28:58.859 align:start position:0%
that they would be able to do if it was
 
04:29:02.630 --> 04:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
a class 5 roadway many many
 
04:29:04.429 --> 04:29:04.439 align:start position:0%
um mortgage companies won't even give
 
04:29:06.590 --> 04:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
you a mortgage if you want to build a a
 
04:29:08.870 --> 04:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
a house on a class six roadway because
 
04:29:11.090 --> 04:29:11.100 align:start position:0%
it's not a class five roadway it's a
 
04:29:13.429 --> 04:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
class six roadway it doesn't have the
 
04:29:15.469 --> 04:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
same maintenance that that is required
 
04:29:17.630 --> 04:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
of a class five because the town
 
04:29:20.570 --> 04:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
holds absolutely no liability or
 
04:29:23.389 --> 04:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
responsibility to maintain that in any
 
04:29:25.910 --> 04:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
way shape or form and in effect they do
 
04:29:30.370 --> 04:29:30.380 align:start position:0%
maintain it it becomes a class 5 roadway
 
04:29:33.769 --> 04:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
ohrb statutes require a landowner's
 
04:29:36.649 --> 04:29:36.659 align:start position:0%
permission to use property in this case
 
04:29:40.250 --> 04:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
the property is the is the class six
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
landowners property the town that only
 
04:29:45.590 --> 04:29:45.600 align:start position:0%
has a only has a basically an easement
 
04:29:49.910 --> 04:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
through there that was granted in 1925.
 
04:29:52.849 --> 04:29:52.859 align:start position:0%
um so in in fact ohrv folks should
 
04:29:54.590 --> 04:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
probably have to get permission from
 
04:29:56.630 --> 04:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
that landowner
 
04:29:58.670 --> 04:29:58.680 align:start position:0%
um I applaud again the commission the uh
 
04:30:01.610 --> 04:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
this committee for um looking to form a
 
04:30:03.889 --> 04:30:03.899 align:start position:0%
study committee on this
 
04:30:06.050 --> 04:30:06.060 align:start position:0%
um I would suggest possibly a commission
 
04:30:07.849 --> 04:30:07.859 align:start position:0%
but I understand that gets unwieldy so I
 
04:30:07.859 --> 04:30:09.050 align:start position:0%
but I understand that gets unwieldy so I
won't

04:30:09.050 --> 04:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
won't
 
04:30:10.490 --> 04:30:10.500 align:start position:0%
um and I'll just simply say that that
 
04:30:12.469 --> 04:30:12.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing the landowners on
 
04:30:14.330 --> 04:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
Classics roadways the possibility to
 
04:30:15.889 --> 04:30:15.899 align:start position:0%
Take Back Control of their property
 
04:30:18.349 --> 04:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
rights and if the towns feel strongly
 
04:30:20.330 --> 04:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
enough that ohrvs need to be on that
 
04:30:22.189 --> 04:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
roadway then they should seriously
 
04:30:24.170 --> 04:30:24.180 align:start position:0%
consider making it a class five roadway
 
04:30:26.090 --> 04:30:26.100 align:start position:0%
take over the maintenance responsibility
 
04:30:28.670 --> 04:30:28.680 align:start position:0%
and allow those landowners to be able to
 
04:30:30.769 --> 04:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
develop that property
 
04:30:34.010 --> 04:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
that they cannot do now on a class six
 
04:30:34.020 --> 04:30:34.969 align:start position:0%
that they cannot do now on a class six
roadway

04:30:34.969 --> 04:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
roadway
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:30:39.290 --> 04:30:39.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Gardens
 
04:30:41.030 --> 04:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
is there any questions from the
 
04:30:50.530 --> 04:30:50.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:52.969 --> 04:30:52.979 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Smith for a
 
04:30:52.979 --> 04:30:55.790 align:start position:0%
recognize representative Smith for a
question

04:30:55.790 --> 04:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:58.910 --> 04:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
look we can't hear you
 
04:31:01.550 --> 04:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
04:31:04.189 --> 04:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
Dobbins you don't by chance have your
 
04:31:06.050 --> 04:31:06.060 align:start position:0%
testimony written down to you because I
 
04:31:07.729 --> 04:31:07.739 align:start position:0%
was madly writing everything you said
 
04:31:10.010 --> 04:31:10.020 align:start position:0%
and I missed most of it
 
04:31:12.410 --> 04:31:12.420 align:start position:0%
I I could certainly uh forward the notes
 
04:31:14.149 --> 04:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
that I have that I was right that I was
 
04:31:15.889 --> 04:31:15.899 align:start position:0%
speaking over um and I will forward it
 
04:31:18.950 --> 04:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
to the committee as it explains in the
 
04:31:18.960 --> 04:31:20.870 align:start position:0%
to the committee as it explains in the
legislature

04:31:20.870 --> 04:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
04:31:22.429 --> 04:31:22.439 align:start position:0%
um guides that are online
 
04:31:29.630 --> 04:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:31.130 --> 04:31:31.140 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
04:31:35.450 --> 04:31:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:37.189 --> 04:31:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you register Dobbins I was very
 
04:31:48.900 --> 04:31:48.910 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:48.910 --> 04:31:52.189 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:31:52.189 --> 04:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:54.250 --> 04:31:54.260 align:start position:0%
he's coming
 
04:31:57.469 --> 04:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
recognizes Monique petrovsky to speak on
 
04:31:58.309 --> 04:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:32:01.130 --> 04:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
you can just State your your name uh we
 
04:32:03.710 --> 04:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
represent and how much time you need
 
04:32:09.290 --> 04:32:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:09.300 --> 04:32:17.090 align:start position:0%
 
hello

04:32:17.090 --> 04:32:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:20.030 --> 04:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
hi this is Monique petrovsky I'm not
 
04:32:21.649 --> 04:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
sure if I heard my name called or not
 
04:32:21.659 --> 04:32:24.170 align:start position:0%
sure if I heard my name called or not
yep

04:32:24.170 --> 04:32:24.180 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:32:27.229 --> 04:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sorry about that
 
04:32:29.090 --> 04:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the opportunity to
 
04:32:33.229 --> 04:32:33.239 align:start position:0%
speak in support of House Bill 446 and
 
04:32:36.830 --> 04:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
um I did send in my uh notes to the
 
04:32:39.229 --> 04:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
email that I was given
 
04:32:41.389 --> 04:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
um so I'm Monique petrovsky and I'm from
 
04:32:43.250 --> 04:32:43.260 align:start position:0%
Stewartstown New Hampshire
 
04:32:45.469 --> 04:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
and I returned to this area after
 
04:32:47.330 --> 04:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
retiring from the U.S Public Health
 
04:32:50.210 --> 04:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
Service as a captain after 29 years of
 
04:32:52.610 --> 04:32:52.620 align:start position:0%
service and I include this information
 
04:32:54.830 --> 04:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
because I worked for the Centers for
 
04:32:56.269 --> 04:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
Disease Control in the National
 
04:32:58.010 --> 04:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
Institute of Health
 
04:33:01.070 --> 04:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
in my career and so I believe this
 
04:33:03.469 --> 04:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
pertinent to my testimony on concern for
 
04:33:07.070 --> 04:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
the unhealthy effects of Malawi ohrvs on
 
04:33:10.369 --> 04:33:10.379 align:start position:0%
class five and six roads
 
04:33:13.269 --> 04:33:13.279 align:start position:0%
um as as Mr Collins
 
04:33:16.490 --> 04:33:16.500 align:start position:0%
mentioned the quality of life is uh
 
04:33:18.709 --> 04:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
greatly adversely affected the noise
 
04:33:23.890 --> 04:33:23.900 align:start position:0%
decibels created by ohrbs exceed The Who
 
04:33:27.230 --> 04:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
standard quality of life in fact they
 
04:33:32.029 --> 04:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
exceed the decibels found in snowmobiles
 
04:33:34.189 --> 04:33:34.199 align:start position:0%
the year-round permanent homeowners
 
04:33:36.830 --> 04:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
quality of life has been greatly
 
04:33:40.490 --> 04:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
diminished throughout the ride the Wilds
 
04:33:40.500 --> 04:33:41.209 align:start position:0%
diminished throughout the ride the Wilds
um

04:33:41.209 --> 04:33:41.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:33:41.219 --> 04:33:42.529 align:start position:0%
um
Trail

04:33:42.529 --> 04:33:42.539 align:start position:0%
Trail
 
04:33:45.230 --> 04:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
the other concern is the dust or a
 
04:33:47.349 --> 04:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
particulate matter which is called
 
04:33:51.410 --> 04:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
pm10id PM 2.5 which alludes to the size
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
of the Dust but that the dust created by
 
04:33:56.631 --> 04:33:56.641 align:start position:0%
these roads has known negative health
 
04:33:59.330 --> 04:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
effects the state of Alaska Department
 
04:34:02.449 --> 04:34:02.459 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Conservation has done
 
04:34:07.551 --> 04:34:07.561 align:start position:0%
extensive studies on that and although
 
04:34:07.561 --> 04:34:08.349 align:start position:0%
extensive studies on that and although
um

04:34:08.349 --> 04:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:10.609 --> 04:34:10.619 align:start position:0%
extensive studies haven't been done in
 
04:34:12.289 --> 04:34:12.299 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I would say that that's
 
04:34:14.750 --> 04:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
like saying we should do studies to see
 
04:34:17.090 --> 04:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
if smoking adversely affects us in New
 
04:34:19.131 --> 04:34:19.141 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we know that it is about
 
04:34:23.330 --> 04:34:23.340 align:start position:0%
having PM particles 10 and 2.5 are bad
 
04:34:25.730 --> 04:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
they penetrate deep into the respiratory
 
04:34:29.269 --> 04:34:29.279 align:start position:0%
tract nuisance staffs also degrades the
 
04:34:31.369 --> 04:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
quality of life because it settles and
 
04:34:34.189 --> 04:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
evades all living spaces including
 
04:34:36.949 --> 04:34:36.959 align:start position:0%
window cells inside the homes
 
04:34:39.890 --> 04:34:39.900 align:start position:0%
that's how that's how invasive the dust
 
04:34:43.250 --> 04:34:43.260 align:start position:0%
is and of course porches and barbecues
 
04:34:45.529 --> 04:34:45.539 align:start position:0%
are out of the question
 
04:34:47.390 --> 04:34:47.400 align:start position:0%
I'm also concerned about the
 
04:34:49.609 --> 04:34:49.619 align:start position:0%
environmental effects of our roads I
 
04:34:50.990 --> 04:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
grew up in Northern New Hampshire
 
04:34:53.209 --> 04:34:53.219 align:start position:0%
Northern Vermont
 
04:34:55.970 --> 04:34:55.980 align:start position:0%
um so I've known the roads for over 60
 
04:34:55.980 --> 04:34:57.051 align:start position:0%
um so I've known the roads for over 60
years

04:34:57.051 --> 04:34:57.061 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:34:59.929 --> 04:34:59.939 align:start position:0%
and oh HIV is due to the Nabi tires are
 
04:35:02.230 --> 04:35:02.240 align:start position:0%
eroding the roads down to the ledge
 
04:35:06.170 --> 04:35:06.180 align:start position:0%
contributing to erosion extreme widening
 
04:35:09.230 --> 04:35:09.240 align:start position:0%
of the roads and when it rains it
 
04:35:12.310 --> 04:35:12.320 align:start position:0%
creates huge puddles that the Ohr
 
04:35:16.429 --> 04:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
recenter and enjoy where they use the
 
04:35:19.310 --> 04:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to mud in the puddles on the
 
04:35:22.369 --> 04:35:22.379 align:start position:0%
roads which means they they'll go
 
04:35:24.289 --> 04:35:24.299 align:start position:0%
through as fast as they can so they get
 
04:35:26.750 --> 04:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
splashed with the with the mud
 
04:35:29.269 --> 04:35:29.279 align:start position:0%
which further exacerbates the erosion
 
04:35:29.279 --> 04:35:31.609 align:start position:0%
which further exacerbates the erosion
problem

04:35:31.609 --> 04:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.429 --> 04:35:34.439 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that from the studies
 
04:35:36.490 --> 04:35:36.500 align:start position:0%
from other states have been done
 
04:35:39.470 --> 04:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
in response to the dust and the noise
 
04:35:41.410 --> 04:35:41.420 align:start position:0%
and the erosion
 
04:35:45.709 --> 04:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
is rerouting traffic away from homes off
 
04:35:49.510 --> 04:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
these roads and truly not
 
04:35:52.131 --> 04:35:52.141 align:start position:0%
not allowing them on roads where people
 
04:35:54.131 --> 04:35:54.141 align:start position:0%
live on
 
04:35:56.810 --> 04:35:56.820 align:start position:0%
the other the third concern that I'd
 
04:36:00.051 --> 04:36:00.061 align:start position:0%
like to just talk about briefly is due
 
04:36:03.349 --> 04:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
to the erosion roads that were once seen
 
04:36:05.689 --> 04:36:05.699 align:start position:0%
that can considered calendar photo
 
04:36:09.529 --> 04:36:09.539 align:start position:0%
worthy have been as I mentioned reduced
 
04:36:10.789 --> 04:36:10.799 align:start position:0%
to ledge
 
04:36:14.570 --> 04:36:14.580 align:start position:0%
but they've now become impassable by car
 
04:36:17.990 --> 04:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm official fisherman and I
 
04:36:19.970 --> 04:36:19.980 align:start position:0%
used to fish all of these streams I
 
04:36:22.551 --> 04:36:22.561 align:start position:0%
can't even reach them by car anymore and
 
04:36:24.709 --> 04:36:24.719 align:start position:0%
even if I could reach them by car the
 
04:36:26.929 --> 04:36:26.939 align:start position:0%
dust and the noise from the yellow hivs
 
04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
would make it such an unpleasant
 
04:36:31.670 --> 04:36:31.680 align:start position:0%
experience that I wouldn't want to but
 
04:36:33.769 --> 04:36:33.779 align:start position:0%
I'm also concerned about the erosion and
 
04:36:33.779 --> 04:36:35.330 align:start position:0%
I'm also concerned about the erosion and
sometimes

04:36:35.330 --> 04:36:35.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
um in judicious use of salt on the roads
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
near the Brooks that that they're using
 
04:36:44.029 --> 04:36:44.039 align:start position:0%
um I I did submit pictures at earlier
 
04:36:46.429 --> 04:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
hearings of how they're salting the
 
04:36:48.709 --> 04:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
roads and they it looked like snowfall
 
04:36:52.250 --> 04:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
and snowballs and they were mere feet
 
04:36:54.170 --> 04:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
from Brooks
 
04:36:57.289 --> 04:36:57.299 align:start position:0%
the third thing that I'm concerned about
 
04:37:00.890 --> 04:37:00.900 align:start position:0%
um and I I applaud the committee's
 
04:37:04.990 --> 04:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
um they I applied The Honorable chairman
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
renzulu to to and look into this more
 
04:37:11.209 --> 04:37:11.219 align:start position:0%
clearly is
 
04:37:13.609 --> 04:37:13.619 align:start position:0%
um even the coloss trail
 
04:37:15.529 --> 04:37:15.539 align:start position:0%
um which is now a hiking trail which is
 
04:37:18.949 --> 04:37:18.959 align:start position:0%
162 miles that goes through co-auth has
 
04:37:22.131 --> 04:37:22.141 align:start position:0%
had problems on social media hikers talk
 
04:37:22.141 --> 04:37:23.390 align:start position:0%
had problems on social media hikers talk
about

04:37:23.390 --> 04:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:37:25.910 --> 04:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
um the unpleasantness of how hiking this
 
04:37:28.490 --> 04:37:28.500 align:start position:0%
Trail a very historic trail that
 
04:37:31.310 --> 04:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
actually began in 1803 following the
 
04:37:34.010 --> 04:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
Abenaki Trails
 
04:37:36.109 --> 04:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
um and that they're in the process of
 
04:37:39.529 --> 04:37:39.539 align:start position:0%
rerouting off of the class five and six
 
04:37:41.510 --> 04:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
roads because of
 
04:37:41.520 --> 04:37:42.830 align:start position:0%
roads because of
um

04:37:42.830 --> 04:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:37:47.869 --> 04:37:47.879 align:start position:0%
how well when they have been harassed as
 
04:37:47.879 --> 04:37:49.490 align:start position:0%
how well when they have been harassed as
well

04:37:49.490 --> 04:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:37:52.670 --> 04:37:52.680 align:start position:0%
um so I I feel What's Happening by have
 
04:37:55.670 --> 04:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
allowing ohrvs on class five and six
 
04:37:58.730 --> 04:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
roads is not only the quality of life
 
04:38:01.789 --> 04:38:01.799 align:start position:0%
the environmental effects the health
 
04:38:01.799 --> 04:38:04.609 align:start position:0%
the environmental effects the health
effects

04:38:04.609 --> 04:38:04.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:07.789 --> 04:38:07.799 align:start position:0%
um but I think with self-selecting uh
 
04:38:09.949 --> 04:38:09.959 align:start position:0%
for a sport that's driving other people
 
04:38:13.490 --> 04:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
away which I find very concerning and I
 
04:38:15.949 --> 04:38:15.959 align:start position:0%
did look at some of the statistics
 
04:38:20.209 --> 04:38:20.219 align:start position:0%
and for 2019 there was 159
 
04:38:23.209 --> 04:38:23.219 align:start position:0%
000 hunting registrations
 
04:38:27.230 --> 04:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:29.929 --> 04:38:29.939 align:start position:0%
for fishing there was 159 000
 
04:38:32.390 --> 04:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
registrations for hunting there was over
 
04:38:36.769 --> 04:38:36.779 align:start position:0%
57 000 and registrations for ohrvs with
 
04:38:39.830 --> 04:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
31 000. so to me it hits me as a
 
04:38:39.840 --> 04:38:41.689 align:start position:0%
31 000. so to me it hits me as a
disproportionate

04:38:41.689 --> 04:38:41.699 align:start position:0%
disproportionate
 
04:38:45.051 --> 04:38:45.061 align:start position:0%
um of people being
 
04:38:48.051 --> 04:38:48.061 align:start position:0%
um inconvenienced for a sport that
 
04:38:50.029 --> 04:38:50.039 align:start position:0%
actually we have much smaller numbers
 
04:38:50.039 --> 04:38:51.230 align:start position:0%
actually we have much smaller numbers
for

04:38:51.230 --> 04:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:38:52.789 --> 04:38:52.799 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the opportunity to
 
04:38:54.890 --> 04:38:54.900 align:start position:0%
speak out and support up what I consider
 
04:38:57.429 --> 04:38:57.439 align:start position:0%

discussion or any questions or comments
 
04:46:45.050 --> 04:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:47.570 --> 04:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
04:46:49.490 --> 04:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair
 
04:46:51.410 --> 04:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
um are we making a motion first are we
 
04:46:56.150 --> 04:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:59.390 --> 04:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
we can make a motion
 
04:47:01.250 --> 04:47:01.260 align:start position:0%
yeah we can make a motion if somebody
 
04:47:11.448 --> 04:47:11.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:13.250 --> 04:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
04:47:15.650 --> 04:47:15.660 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:47:18.470 --> 04:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
yes I'll make a motion that we retain
 
04:47:23.448 --> 04:47:23.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:26.930 --> 04:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
and representative motion
 
04:47:30.948 --> 04:47:30.958 align:start position:0%
well I listened to the prime sponsor and
 
04:47:33.050 --> 04:47:33.060 align:start position:0%
I think there's a lot of issues that do
 
04:47:37.190 --> 04:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
need to be done uh to review uh these
 
04:47:39.470 --> 04:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
class five class six and the effects on
 
04:47:41.270 --> 04:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
the road so I'm in favor of the
 
04:47:43.730 --> 04:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
committee but I understand why the
 
04:47:45.948 --> 04:47:45.958 align:start position:0%
request to retain was made so I'll
 
04:47:47.868 --> 04:47:47.878 align:start position:0%
support that request
 
04:47:50.570 --> 04:47:50.580 align:start position:0%
okay do we have a second on the position
 
04:47:52.190 --> 04:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
04:47:52.200 --> 04:47:54.070 align:start position:0%
to retain
second

04:47:54.070 --> 04:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:47:57.050 --> 04:47:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative Todd seconds get my
 
04:47:57.060 --> 04:47:59.990 align:start position:0%
representative Todd seconds get my
second

04:47:59.990 --> 04:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:00.000 --> 04:48:09.948 align:start position:0%
 
thanks

04:48:09.948 --> 04:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:13.368 --> 04:48:13.378 align:start position:0%
God Mr chairperson am I allowed to ask
 
04:48:18.650 --> 04:48:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:22.128 --> 04:48:22.138 align:start position:0%
yeah yes yes representative Cohen answer
 
04:48:24.410 --> 04:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
your question uh representative or chair
 
04:48:27.050 --> 04:48:27.060 align:start position:0%
however I address chairperson or a zoo
 
04:48:28.850 --> 04:48:28.860 align:start position:0%
because he's not mature at this moment
 
04:48:32.868 --> 04:48:32.878 align:start position:0%
so representative renzullo based on what
 
04:48:34.070 --> 04:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
we've heard
 
04:48:36.050 --> 04:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
uh for Testimony
 
04:48:39.890 --> 04:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
would you recommend retain or ought to
 
04:48:43.930 --> 04:48:43.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:48.410 --> 04:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
uh either one would do uh the reason I
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
said retain is because it's under our
 
04:48:51.480 --> 04:48:52.970 align:start position:0%
said retain is because it's under our
control

04:48:52.970 --> 04:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
control
 
04:48:55.310 --> 04:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
04:48:57.530 --> 04:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
if you pass it
 
04:49:02.090 --> 04:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:05.690 --> 04:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yes so just follow on
 
04:49:07.750 --> 04:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
04:49:10.610 --> 04:49:10.620 align:start position:0%
thank you I can support
 
04:49:10.620 --> 04:49:11.868 align:start position:0%
thank you I can support
um the

04:49:11.868 --> 04:49:11.878 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:49:13.788 --> 04:49:13.798 align:start position:0%
um representative Hearts motion at this
 
04:49:16.010 --> 04:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
point no problem with it
 
04:49:16.020 --> 04:49:17.650 align:start position:0%
point no problem with it
Smith

04:49:17.650 --> 04:49:17.660 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
04:49:19.550 --> 04:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
04:49:22.010 --> 04:49:22.020 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair
 
04:49:25.368 --> 04:49:25.378 align:start position:0%
um in listening to the testimony
 
04:49:27.890 --> 04:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
it reminded me again of just how
 
04:49:29.930 --> 04:49:29.940 align:start position:0%
important initiative this is to a lot of
 
04:49:32.448 --> 04:49:32.458 align:start position:0%
different people and how it's a
 
04:49:36.590 --> 04:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
long-standing uh issue and I'm I will
 
04:49:39.650 --> 04:49:39.660 align:start position:0%
support retain and I really hope that we
 
04:49:43.250 --> 04:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
as a committee can take the time to do
 
04:49:45.410 --> 04:49:45.420 align:start position:0%
the study ourselves I think we'd do a
 
04:49:47.330 --> 04:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
better job than any appointed committee
 
04:49:49.070 --> 04:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm really concerned that that
 
04:49:52.610 --> 04:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
commission that is in shape in in that
 
04:49:55.788 --> 04:49:55.798 align:start position:0%
has already been formed uh spearheaded
 
04:49:58.368 --> 04:49:58.378 align:start position:0%
by the transportation committee
 
04:50:00.530 --> 04:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
because they have not even started to
 
04:50:02.628 --> 04:50:02.638 align:start position:0%
meet and their deadline is November and
 
04:50:04.788 --> 04:50:04.798 align:start position:0%
this is one of many many issues that
 
04:50:07.250 --> 04:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
they could choose to deal with I think
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
that we will do a better job of it even
 
04:50:13.970 --> 04:50:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:17.650 --> 04:50:17.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:20.750 --> 04:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
so I I feel strongly also representative
 
04:50:22.490 --> 04:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
Smith those are very good point and I
 
04:50:25.730 --> 04:50:25.740 align:start position:0%
think yes the committee this has been a
 
04:50:27.530 --> 04:50:27.540 align:start position:0%
hot issue for us for the last several
 
04:50:29.810 --> 04:50:29.820 align:start position:0%
years and I think that I think that
 
04:50:32.690 --> 04:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
suggestion is is well taken I think the
 
04:50:35.030 --> 04:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
committee itself
 
04:50:36.890 --> 04:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
obviously several individuals on the
 
04:50:38.330 --> 04:50:38.340 align:start position:0%
committee are very familiar with the
 
04:50:39.770 --> 04:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
subject matter and I think we think it's
 
04:50:41.390 --> 04:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
a good job of that at least you know
 
04:50:42.650 --> 04:50:42.660 align:start position:0%
getting the ball rolling on this
 
04:50:47.930 --> 04:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:52.310 --> 04:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:54.470 --> 04:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
I guess I do have one and you
 
04:50:56.448 --> 04:50:56.458 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I agree with your
 
04:50:58.930 --> 04:50:58.940 align:start position:0%
your assessment so I just
 
04:51:01.730 --> 04:51:01.740 align:start position:0%
procedurally the motion on the table is
 
04:51:03.350 --> 04:51:03.360 align:start position:0%
to retain
 
04:51:07.250 --> 04:51:07.260 align:start position:0%
if retain it then nothing happens
 
04:51:07.260 --> 04:51:08.810 align:start position:0%
if retain it then nothing happens
every

04:51:08.810 --> 04:51:08.820 align:start position:0%
every
 
04:51:11.270 --> 04:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
passion then it goes through and then
 
04:51:14.150 --> 04:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
the committee is initiated
 
04:51:17.930 --> 04:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
is that am I missing something
 
04:51:20.868 --> 04:51:20.878 align:start position:0%
you can work on the bill
 
04:51:23.390 --> 04:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
retained by definition you work on the
 
04:51:27.410 --> 04:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:30.590 --> 04:51:30.600 align:start position:0%
does the bill establishes a committee so
 
04:51:32.510 --> 04:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
the committee isn't reformed until the
 
04:51:35.470 --> 04:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:39.050 --> 04:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
I will I'll refer to the crime so much
 
04:51:41.650 --> 04:51:41.660 align:start position:0%
uh the committee
 
04:51:43.750 --> 04:51:43.760 align:start position:0%
uh with
 
04:51:47.868 --> 04:51:47.878 align:start position:0%
this committee as it can work on
 
04:51:52.910 --> 04:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
whatever it wants using the bills bill
 
04:51:52.920 --> 04:51:54.410 align:start position:0%
whatever it wants using the bills bill
the

04:51:54.410 --> 04:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:51:58.390 --> 04:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
getting the involvement of the
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
transportation or
 
04:52:04.970 --> 04:52:04.980 align:start position:0%
information or the municipal County
 
04:52:07.430 --> 04:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
would require the passing
 
04:52:09.770 --> 04:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
but it would also require if we passed
 
04:52:13.850 --> 04:52:13.860 align:start position:0%
through the Senate and also the assigned
 
04:52:16.610 --> 04:52:16.620 align:start position:0%
by the building so it wouldn't be
 
04:52:23.030 --> 04:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:24.770 --> 04:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
so yes
 
04:52:26.690 --> 04:52:26.700 align:start position:0%
so there are ideas those are the two
 
04:52:30.288 --> 04:52:30.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:33.050 --> 04:52:33.060 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted to understand
 
04:52:34.970 --> 04:52:34.980 align:start position:0%
the ramifications of what the book was
 
04:52:34.980 --> 04:52:35.890 align:start position:0%
the ramifications of what the book was
right

04:52:35.890 --> 04:52:35.900 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:52:39.410 --> 04:52:39.420 align:start position:0%
it keeps the bill in front of us
 
04:52:43.970 --> 04:52:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:47.570 --> 04:52:47.580 align:start position:0%
you passed it it would it would be
 
04:52:47.580 --> 04:52:50.948 align:start position:0%
you passed it it would it would be
uh

04:52:50.948 --> 04:52:50.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:54.850 --> 04:52:54.860 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:57.350 --> 04:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
you're right absolutely true and you
 
04:53:01.150 --> 04:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:04.430 --> 04:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:06.890 --> 04:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
um I'm thinking that the reason for
 
04:53:10.368 --> 04:53:10.378 align:start position:0%
retaining is to then uh decide at the
 
04:53:12.890 --> 04:53:12.900 align:start position:0%
end of the the period like in November
 
04:53:21.650 --> 04:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:24.590 --> 04:53:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative Spang we've lost your
 
04:53:29.448 --> 04:53:29.458 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:29.458 --> 04:53:30.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:53:30.790 --> 04:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:53:30.800 --> 04:53:33.590 align:start position:0%
okay
[Music]

04:53:33.590 --> 04:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:53:37.670 --> 04:53:37.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:42.650 --> 04:53:42.660 align:start position:0%
okay oh already how are we doing now we
 
04:53:45.530 --> 04:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
have you now okay thanks
 
04:53:48.530 --> 04:53:48.540 align:start position:0%
so the recommendation uh at the end of
 
04:53:49.910 --> 04:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:53:52.670 --> 04:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
the period in November after we finished
 
04:53:54.708 --> 04:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
with this bill will be to either
 
04:53:58.368 --> 04:53:58.378 align:start position:0%
recommend it for further legislation or
 
04:54:02.150 --> 04:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
not is that correct
 
04:54:04.750 --> 04:54:04.760 align:start position:0%
no no
 
04:54:08.090 --> 04:54:08.100 align:start position:0%
so what would be the end game here when
 
04:54:12.708 --> 04:54:12.718 align:start position:0%
we finish with uh looking at this bill
 
04:54:15.650 --> 04:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
it would be a representative Spang for
 
04:54:18.230 --> 04:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
an ought to pass or an Ito
 
04:54:21.110 --> 04:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
at the end of the routine period
 
04:54:24.590 --> 04:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
if we decide and
 
04:54:28.010 --> 04:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
so if we do an ought to pass then it
 
04:54:32.150 --> 04:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
goes through the whole uh cycle again in
 
04:54:34.250 --> 04:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
order to set up this committee is that
 
04:54:34.260 --> 04:54:35.930 align:start position:0%
order to set up this committee is that
correct

04:54:35.930 --> 04:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:54:37.670 --> 04:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct
 
04:54:40.070 --> 04:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so in the meantime what will we be
 
04:54:42.230 --> 04:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
doing and what will be the outcome of
 
04:54:46.910 --> 04:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:48.890 --> 04:54:48.900 align:start position:0%
well it could be a number of things
 
04:54:50.510 --> 04:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
obviously it could be moving this bill
 
04:54:52.070 --> 04:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
to a not to pass
 
04:54:55.128 --> 04:54:55.138 align:start position:0%
uh in our work as a committee it could
 
04:54:57.170 --> 04:54:57.180 align:start position:0%
produce you know obviously we could we
 
04:54:59.150 --> 04:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
could file new legislation based on
 
04:54:59.160 --> 04:55:02.090 align:start position:0%
could file new legislation based on
findings

04:55:02.090 --> 04:55:02.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:04.670 --> 04:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
which we could do anyway which we could
 
04:55:07.390 --> 04:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
do anyways that is correct right okay
 
04:55:11.030 --> 04:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
you can also take the bill and gun it
 
04:55:14.750 --> 04:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
and put something else in its place
 
04:55:14.760 --> 04:55:16.010 align:start position:0%
and put something else in its place
true

04:55:16.010 --> 04:55:16.020 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
and you have posts and representative
 
04:55:19.200 --> 04:55:21.128 align:start position:0%
and you have posts and representative
Smith

04:55:21.128 --> 04:55:21.138 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
04:55:24.970 --> 04:55:24.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:28.730 --> 04:55:28.740 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for recognizing me
 
04:55:32.030 --> 04:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm in support of retaining it I'm
 
04:55:34.368 --> 04:55:34.378 align:start position:0%
working on it as a committee
 
04:55:35.810 --> 04:55:35.820 align:start position:0%
um I see
 
04:55:40.730 --> 04:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
um a lot of um families in our area in
 
04:55:42.650 --> 04:55:42.660 align:start position:0%
our towns surrounding towns that have
 
04:55:45.110 --> 04:55:45.120 align:start position:0%
these vehicles and
 
04:55:47.690 --> 04:55:47.700 align:start position:0%
um I I just want to make sure we do a
 
04:55:50.030 --> 04:55:50.040 align:start position:0%
good job in researching before we start
 
04:55:57.368 --> 04:55:57.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:59.570 --> 04:55:59.580 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
04:56:03.770 --> 04:56:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh thank you I was just going to uh say
 
04:56:06.230 --> 04:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
what representative renzullo just said
 
04:56:09.050 --> 04:56:09.060 align:start position:0%
is which we can work on it we can amend
 
04:56:11.750 --> 04:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
it and then it goes to the floor in
 
04:56:16.010 --> 04:56:16.020 align:start position:0%
January with our recommendation
 
04:56:19.010 --> 04:56:19.020 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
04:56:20.750 --> 04:56:20.760 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else
 
04:56:23.830 --> 04:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
I'd like to uh comment representative
 
04:56:26.150 --> 04:56:26.160 align:start position:0%
representative Cohen
 
04:56:28.730 --> 04:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
Mr chairperson I'm sorry I just need a
 
04:56:30.288 --> 04:56:30.298 align:start position:0%
little clarification let me ask my
 
04:56:32.570 --> 04:56:32.580 align:start position:0%
question of you and then see if you can
 
04:56:35.990 --> 04:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
answer it for me if we retain if we vote
 
04:56:37.850 --> 04:56:37.860 align:start position:0%
to retain this bill
 
04:56:41.448 --> 04:56:41.458 align:start position:0%
and we do successfully retain the bill
 
04:56:44.330 --> 04:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
when we work on it again let's just say
 
04:56:47.208 --> 04:56:47.218 align:start position:0%
in November if the other committee has
 
04:56:50.868 --> 04:56:50.878 align:start position:0%
done nothing is a Class 5 and class six
 
04:56:54.948 --> 04:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
bills can we after we finish while we're
 
04:56:56.750 --> 04:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
working on this bill
 
04:56:59.810 --> 04:56:59.820 align:start position:0%
add an amendment that may affect the use
 
04:57:03.288 --> 04:57:03.298 align:start position:0%
of world class five or six bills and
 
04:57:05.208 --> 04:57:05.218 align:start position:0%
then vote on that as a committee for
 
04:57:08.570 --> 04:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
this amended to this bill
 
04:57:11.690 --> 04:57:11.700 align:start position:0%
yes we can Representatives we can amend
 
04:57:14.030 --> 04:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
this bill with whatever language we feel
 
04:57:20.110 --> 04:57:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:24.830 --> 04:57:24.840 align:start position:0%
extreme case if we decide that um ohvr
 
04:57:27.170 --> 04:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
should be banned from class five and
 
04:57:28.670 --> 04:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
class six because the work we did
 
04:57:31.070 --> 04:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
looking at when we're team we could put
 
04:57:33.230 --> 04:57:33.240 align:start position:0%
an amendment on this bill saying
 
04:57:35.690 --> 04:57:35.700 align:start position:0%
something to that effect
 
04:57:37.788 --> 04:57:37.798 align:start position:0%
that is correct representative okay I

them we actually can bring up uh
 
05:01:15.788 --> 05:01:15.798 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly I believe yeah okay
 
05:01:20.628 --> 05:01:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Kelly are you there yep I
 
05:01:24.240 --> 05:01:25.788 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Kelly are you there yep I
am

05:01:25.788 --> 05:01:25.798 align:start position:0%
am
 
05:01:29.270 --> 05:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
um so uh I was trying to find the the
 
05:01:31.250 --> 05:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
people kept mentioning a sunset the sun
 
05:01:33.410 --> 05:01:33.420 align:start position:0%
setting of the old provision I I
 
05:01:34.490 --> 05:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
couldn't find where it was ever
 
05:01:36.590 --> 05:01:36.600 align:start position:0%
sunsetted in fact OLS is currently
 
05:01:38.628 --> 05:01:38.638 align:start position:0%
looking into they can't they haven't
 
05:01:41.208 --> 05:01:41.218 align:start position:0%
been able to find what chaptered law
 
05:01:44.270 --> 05:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
repealed the section that's in question
 
05:01:46.430 --> 05:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
um but I did find a version the last
 
05:01:48.350 --> 05:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
version of it that appeared in law from
 
05:01:51.410 --> 05:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
2017 and so all I did was send that to
 
05:01:53.750 --> 05:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative Pearl the the like the
 
05:01:56.270 --> 05:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
the last version of section three or
 
05:01:59.090 --> 05:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
section three of the RSA that that
 
05:01:59.100 --> 05:02:00.410 align:start position:0%
section three of the RSA that that
actually

05:02:00.410 --> 05:02:00.420 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:02:02.208 --> 05:02:02.218 align:start position:0%
um had the language
 
05:02:03.830 --> 05:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
um I think that's his language I think
 
05:02:05.868 --> 05:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
mine's probably down below I can pull it
 
05:02:05.878 --> 05:02:06.830 align:start position:0%
mine's probably down below I can pull it
up

05:02:06.830 --> 05:02:06.840 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:02:09.230 --> 05:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
hold on a second I've got the other one
 
05:02:10.490 --> 05:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
stand by
 
05:02:17.030 --> 05:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
so this was at 609 is it 609 or 607 609
 
05:02:22.190 --> 05:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:25.010 --> 05:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
that it should have
 
05:02:30.050 --> 05:02:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:34.610 --> 05:02:34.620 align:start position:0%
yes 607 I think 607 was the one that I
 
05:02:36.230 --> 05:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
sent that was the original that was the
 
05:02:38.330 --> 05:02:38.340 align:start position:0%
language that had been removed had been
 
05:02:40.788 --> 05:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
repealed in a previous bill
 
05:02:43.208 --> 05:02:43.218 align:start position:0%
and it and it reads
 
05:02:45.230 --> 05:02:45.240 align:start position:0%
applicants for the construction of
 
05:02:47.390 --> 05:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
public roads public utility lines and
 
05:02:49.368 --> 05:02:49.378 align:start position:0%
Associated structures facilities public
 
05:02:51.470 --> 05:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
water access facilities and projects
 
05:02:54.350 --> 05:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
solely funded by Municipal County state
 
05:02:56.868 --> 05:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
or federal entities shall incur and
 
05:02:59.030 --> 05:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
before the old the the way it was all
 
05:03:00.830 --> 05:03:00.840 align:start position:0%
used to be written it said
 
05:03:05.750 --> 05:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh shall be exempt from these permits so
 
05:03:09.770 --> 05:03:09.780 align:start position:0%
all I did was just add the 3750 cap that
 
05:03:13.550 --> 05:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
Des was saying so that's the
 
05:03:13.560 --> 05:03:14.150 align:start position:0%
Des was saying so that's the
um

05:03:14.150 --> 05:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:03:16.788 --> 05:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
that's what it said and so shall be no
 
05:03:21.830 --> 05:03:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:23.628 --> 05:03:23.638 align:start position:0%
is this one
 
05:03:25.190 --> 05:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly that you were
 
05:03:26.570 --> 05:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
looking for
 
05:03:29.030 --> 05:03:29.040 align:start position:0%
yeah what number is that could you go to
 
05:03:33.590 --> 05:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:33.600 --> 05:03:35.470 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:03:35.470 --> 05:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:03:41.150 --> 05:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
4607 until seven each this is 609 each
 
05:03:46.490 --> 05:03:46.500 align:start position:0%
you want 607 each yeah okay standby
 
05:03:56.930 --> 05:03:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:01.670 --> 05:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:10.610 --> 05:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:12.850 --> 05:04:12.860 align:start position:0%
oh yeah that uh
 
05:04:15.770 --> 05:04:15.780 align:start position:0%
yes correct yep under where it says
 
05:04:17.930 --> 05:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
where the x is or where the 10 section
 
05:04:17.940 --> 05:04:18.770 align:start position:0%
where the x is or where the 10 section
10

05:04:18.770 --> 05:04:18.780 align:start position:0%
10
 
05:04:20.570 --> 05:04:20.580 align:start position:0%
application for construction of public
 
05:04:22.730 --> 05:04:22.740 align:start position:0%
roads public utility lines and
 
05:04:24.830 --> 05:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
Associated structures facilities public
 
05:04:26.570 --> 05:04:26.580 align:start position:0%
water access facilities and projects
 
05:04:28.430 --> 05:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
solely funded by Municipal County state
 
05:04:30.230 --> 05:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
or federal entities shall incur The Firm
 
05:04:33.470 --> 05:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
anything no greater than 37.50 so the
 
05:04:36.110 --> 05:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
the issue that that someone had brought
 
05:04:39.530 --> 05:04:39.540 align:start position:0%
up was that the Municipal Water
 
05:04:41.930 --> 05:04:41.940 align:start position:0%
districts may be classified as
 
05:04:43.970 --> 05:04:43.980 align:start position:0%
non-profits which is why representative
 
05:04:45.230 --> 05:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
from may have included that language
 
05:04:48.170 --> 05:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
originally so there was some fear that
 
05:04:51.890 --> 05:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
that by that you know not not putting
 
05:04:54.230 --> 05:04:54.240 align:start position:0%
the language specifically about water
 
05:04:57.288 --> 05:04:57.298 align:start position:0%
access facilities that Des would not be
 
05:04:59.090 --> 05:04:59.100 align:start position:0%
able to
 
05:05:02.510 --> 05:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh Grant those that the permits and
 
05:05:04.010 --> 05:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
though that seemed to be who was mainly
 
05:05:06.530 --> 05:05:06.540 align:start position:0%
reaching out to us so I just I just took
 
05:05:09.890 --> 05:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
the old language from 2017 and posted it
 
05:05:09.900 --> 05:05:10.730 align:start position:0%
the old language from 2017 and posted it
in

05:05:10.730 --> 05:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:05:13.250 --> 05:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
with it that this was the last version I
 
05:05:15.350 --> 05:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
believe representative Pearl was using a
 
05:05:17.330 --> 05:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
prior version of the
 
05:05:20.330 --> 05:05:20.340 align:start position:0%
of the text so that's why it's there's a
 
05:05:22.430 --> 05:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
slight difference and he what I did I
 
05:05:23.570 --> 05:05:23.580 align:start position:0%
didn't know who to reach out to about
 
05:05:26.530 --> 05:05:26.540 align:start position:0%
that so I sent that to him he sent both
 
05:05:29.208 --> 05:05:29.218 align:start position:0%
sets to the
 
05:05:31.128 --> 05:05:31.138 align:start position:0%
um to OLS to have them draft the
 
05:05:34.570 --> 05:05:34.580 align:start position:0%
Amendments and he said that we could we
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
whatever we decided was the better
 
05:05:39.170 --> 05:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
version of the language to go with that
 
05:05:41.330 --> 05:05:41.340 align:start position:0%
and and I believe that's why he sent us
 
05:05:41.340 --> 05:05:44.510 align:start position:0%
and and I believe that's why he sent us
both

05:05:44.510 --> 05:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:54.890 --> 05:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:58.368 --> 05:05:58.378 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the
 
05:05:58.378 --> 05:05:59.690 align:start position:0%
any discussion on the
well

05:05:59.690 --> 05:05:59.700 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:06:02.090 --> 05:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
she got both of them
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
so any discussion on which one we prefer
 
05:06:10.070 --> 05:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative by representative Smith
 
05:06:12.948 --> 05:06:12.958 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I thought it might
 
05:06:15.708 --> 05:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
be good to ask Des if this language
 
05:06:18.170 --> 05:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
looks good to them
 
05:06:20.330 --> 05:06:20.340 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm not sure because this is the
 
05:06:21.890 --> 05:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
first time we're seeing this language
 
05:06:23.948 --> 05:06:23.958 align:start position:0%
but I mean I like the way that it it
 
05:06:27.230 --> 05:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
includes more specifics but I just want
 
05:06:31.368 --> 05:06:31.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:33.530 --> 05:06:33.540 align:start position:0%
I think Des would be the people to ask
 
05:06:37.670 --> 05:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
are there anyone from Des still here
 
05:06:42.430 --> 05:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
I did see uh Mr Pelletier here
 
05:06:55.368 --> 05:06:55.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:58.910 --> 05:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes we can no thanks
 
05:07:01.430 --> 05:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for the invite uh the only
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
problem I have with the the Second
 
05:07:07.550 --> 05:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment we're looking at 607 h
 
05:07:10.990 --> 05:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
is uh public utility lines
 
05:07:14.570 --> 05:07:14.580 align:start position:0%
uh that in my mind should be taken out
 
05:07:16.368 --> 05:07:16.378 align:start position:0%
that would mean that the Northern Pass
 
05:07:19.430 --> 05:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
project which was as you know hundreds
 
05:07:20.990 --> 05:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
of miles
 
05:07:21.000 --> 05:07:22.310 align:start position:0%
of miles
uh

05:07:22.310 --> 05:07:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:07:24.110 --> 05:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
would be exempt
 
05:07:27.890 --> 05:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
so I think the First Amendment
 
05:07:27.900 --> 05:07:28.550 align:start position:0%
so I think the First Amendment
um

05:07:28.550 --> 05:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:31.610 --> 05:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
that were shown is uh would be the
 
05:07:34.208 --> 05:07:34.218 align:start position:0%
correct one I think
 
05:07:37.250 --> 05:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
well I take out public utility lines and
 
05:07:40.010 --> 05:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
Associated structures
 
05:07:45.490 --> 05:07:45.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:48.530 --> 05:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
there I've got it up now this is the uh
 
05:07:48.540 --> 05:07:52.490 align:start position:0%
there I've got it up now this is the uh
609

05:07:52.490 --> 05:07:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:59.890 --> 05:07:59.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:59.900 --> 05:08:01.430 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

05:08:01.430 --> 05:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:08:04.310 --> 05:08:04.320 align:start position:0%
if I might jam and uh what do utilities
 
05:08:07.610 --> 05:08:07.620 align:start position:0%
aren't considered non-profits uh they
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
charge for uh for an activity
 
05:08:14.208 --> 05:08:14.218 align:start position:0%
and they're regulated by puc if they're
 
05:08:14.218 --> 05:08:29.270 align:start position:0%
and they're regulated by puc if they're
non-governmental

05:08:29.270 --> 05:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:33.050 --> 05:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
representative Penske for a question
 
05:08:35.510 --> 05:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
here I just wanted to follow up
 
05:08:39.770 --> 05:08:39.780 align:start position:0%
Amendment 607 was in statute
 
05:08:42.288 --> 05:08:42.298 align:start position:0%
did you so you had issues when it was in
 
05:08:46.310 --> 05:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
statute prior years yes we did yeah yes
 
05:08:48.288 --> 05:08:48.298 align:start position:0%
we did with the public utilities section
 
05:08:50.110 --> 05:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
05:08:53.230 --> 05:08:53.240 align:start position:0%
if these two follow-up links
 
05:08:55.910 --> 05:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
and how how did you address that fee
 
05:08:58.788 --> 05:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
shortfall prior to the sun setting is it
 
05:09:01.368 --> 05:09:01.378 align:start position:0%
just something you just
 
05:09:05.990 --> 05:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
yeah it went in and it got sunset at 19.
 
05:09:08.750 --> 05:09:08.760 align:start position:0%
so that was we had worked last session
 
05:09:11.270 --> 05:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
but because of the pandemic uh stuff
 
05:09:14.810 --> 05:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
never went to any kind of fruition so
 
05:09:18.110 --> 05:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
um it just ended up being uh
 
05:09:27.350 --> 05:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:28.730 --> 05:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
yeah it says it's a follow-up question
 
05:09:31.368 --> 05:09:31.378 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and how long was this
 
05:09:35.030 --> 05:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
legislation that we see in 607 how long
 
05:09:39.170 --> 05:09:39.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:44.750 --> 05:09:44.760 align:start position:0%
oh that was it started in 2007 I believe
 
05:09:47.990 --> 05:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
and it was uh sunsettered
 
05:09:52.128 --> 05:09:52.138 align:start position:0%
uh and it was sunset in 2019 both there
 
05:09:56.090 --> 05:09:56.100 align:start position:0%
were two parts to the Shoreland act one
 
05:09:59.628 --> 05:09:59.638 align:start position:0%
was the fee uh sun setting which was
 
05:10:02.448 --> 05:10:02.458 align:start position:0%
addressed in 19. and they never
 
05:10:07.010 --> 05:10:07.020 align:start position:0%
addressed the second part of the statute
 
05:10:11.270 --> 05:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
which was in fact this exemption part
 
05:10:13.150 --> 05:10:13.160 align:start position:0%

I got a call at lunch and I know there
 
05:11:13.670 --> 05:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
are a couple people from the Plymouth
 
05:11:16.250 --> 05:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
Village Water and Sewer District here
 
05:11:16.260 --> 05:11:18.590 align:start position:0%
Village Water and Sewer District here
and

05:11:18.590 --> 05:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:11:21.590 --> 05:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
most of their work is paid for most of
 
05:11:23.150 --> 05:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
their projects are paid for with a
 
05:11:26.208 --> 05:11:26.218 align:start position:0%
combination of Grants and rate payer
 
05:11:30.410 --> 05:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
rate rate the rates paid by rate payers
 
05:11:40.250 --> 05:11:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:42.530 --> 05:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
that's a question I get a question
 
05:11:48.050 --> 05:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
probably of of Mr Pelletier not
 
05:11:50.270 --> 05:11:50.280 align:start position:0%
yeah it would be our intent that they
 
05:11:53.330 --> 05:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for the cap okay thank
 
05:11:56.330 --> 05:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
you and if because if I might uh Mr
 
05:11:59.650 --> 05:11:59.660 align:start position:0%
chair it's a solely funded by Municipal
 
05:12:02.690 --> 05:12:02.700 align:start position:0%
County state or federal so if they've
 
05:12:06.110 --> 05:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
got a mix of Federal loans grants and
 
05:12:09.050 --> 05:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
Municipal input than they would be
 
05:12:15.230 --> 05:12:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:17.330 --> 05:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
point that um
 
05:12:19.670 --> 05:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
don't do Village Water and Sewer for
 
05:12:22.250 --> 05:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
instance is its own municipality
 
05:12:24.708 --> 05:12:24.718 align:start position:0%
water districts are their own they are
 
05:12:26.690 --> 05:12:26.700 align:start position:0%
actually municipality
 
05:12:29.930 --> 05:12:29.940 align:start position:0%
yeah well anything below the question
 
05:12:32.030 --> 05:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
really is um
 
05:12:35.150 --> 05:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh other real things like school
 
05:12:38.030 --> 05:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
districts water districts they would
 
05:12:40.850 --> 05:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
also be under this
 
05:12:42.770 --> 05:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
as what we could treat it as
 
05:12:42.780 --> 05:12:49.368 align:start position:0%
as what we could treat it as
municipalities

05:12:49.368 --> 05:12:49.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:52.010 --> 05:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
the physical there
 
05:12:54.590 --> 05:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
oh I wasn't I didn't understand that was
 
05:12:58.670 --> 05:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
uh aimed at me oh okay yeah yeah no that
 
05:13:00.830 --> 05:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
would be but if you're concerned about
 
05:13:02.868 --> 05:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
Clarity you could always add Village
 
05:13:05.090 --> 05:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
districts they're the only real other
 
05:13:07.750 --> 05:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
utility entities that we deal with but
 
05:13:11.390 --> 05:13:11.400 align:start position:0%
they're considered Municipal uh they
 
05:13:13.070 --> 05:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
just come under the category of Village
 
05:13:15.288 --> 05:13:15.298 align:start position:0%
District in some cases
 
05:13:15.298 --> 05:13:16.490 align:start position:0%
District in some cases
yeah

05:13:16.490 --> 05:13:16.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:13:18.890 --> 05:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
they represent I think all of them would
 
05:13:22.310 --> 05:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
be yeah Kelly uh representative Kelly
 
05:13:25.850 --> 05:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
for a question or for a comment I I
 
05:13:27.770 --> 05:13:27.780 align:start position:0%
agree I think that uh Mr Pelletier is
 
05:13:29.510 --> 05:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
correct I think that's this if they if
 
05:13:31.788 --> 05:13:31.798 align:start position:0%
they if his I think we should go forward
 
05:13:33.650 --> 05:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
with with the First Amendment if that's
 
05:13:35.090 --> 05:13:35.100 align:start position:0%

05:13:35.100 --> 05:13:37.430 align:start position:0%
the case
okay

05:13:37.430 --> 05:13:37.440 align:start position:0%

the

05:22:48.708 --> 05:22:48.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:22:53.570 --> 05:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
is he uh set in the bill he's proposed
 
05:22:55.930 --> 05:22:55.940 align:start position:0%
was a little bit different when it
 
05:22:59.690 --> 05:22:59.700 align:start position:0%
improved on this on his bill
 
05:22:59.700 --> 05:23:01.910 align:start position:0%
improved on this on his bill
well

05:23:01.910 --> 05:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:23:01.920 --> 05:23:04.070 align:start position:0%
well
I'm

05:23:04.070 --> 05:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
05:23:06.948 --> 05:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
I was I
 
05:23:10.190 --> 05:23:10.200 align:start position:0%
was presented with a very
 
05:23:12.590 --> 05:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
a good good idea by
 
05:23:14.570 --> 05:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
05:23:17.330 --> 05:23:17.340 align:start position:0%
who said you know we passed this bill
 
05:23:20.288 --> 05:23:20.298 align:start position:0%
last time why not pass the same bill
 
05:23:24.410 --> 05:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
this time which is a very good idea and
 
05:23:28.368 --> 05:23:28.378 align:start position:0%
my ideas I I believe it to be because it
 
05:23:30.708 --> 05:23:30.718 align:start position:0%
was a bill that
 
05:23:33.830 --> 05:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
when everyone originally presented but
 
05:23:36.830 --> 05:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
it would originally passed last time
 
05:23:39.708 --> 05:23:39.718 align:start position:0%
didn't have any of the issues
 
05:23:41.750 --> 05:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
that the bill
 
05:23:46.490 --> 05:23:46.500 align:start position:0%
uh as presented that we've presented
 
05:23:52.190 --> 05:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
before us uh has to has uh has today so
 
05:23:54.350 --> 05:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment
 
05:23:58.310 --> 05:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
basically recreates the bill that this
 
05:24:00.650 --> 05:24:00.660 align:start position:0%
committee passed
 
05:24:00.660 --> 05:24:02.330 align:start position:0%
committee passed
and

05:24:02.330 --> 05:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:05.208 --> 05:24:05.218 align:start position:0%
I've my feeling
 
05:24:05.218 --> 05:24:07.010 align:start position:0%
I've my feeling
that

05:24:07.010 --> 05:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:24:09.590 --> 05:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
someone should never
 
05:24:11.570 --> 05:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
you know never tried never lift the
 
05:24:13.970 --> 05:24:13.980 align:start position:0%
gifts worse than the mouth the one you
 
05:24:17.810 --> 05:24:17.820 align:start position:0%
know take what you've got and go so my
 
05:24:21.230 --> 05:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
feeling is that this puts is the better
 
05:24:21.240 --> 05:24:22.628 align:start position:0%
feeling is that this puts is the better
build

05:24:22.628 --> 05:24:22.638 align:start position:0%
build
 
05:24:26.330 --> 05:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
and it is it doesn't have to have any of
 
05:24:28.730 --> 05:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
the issues that the
 
05:24:33.650 --> 05:24:33.660 align:start position:0%
the new the the bill that was presented
 
05:24:36.830 --> 05:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
presents to us so
 
05:24:40.010 --> 05:24:40.020 align:start position:0%
we'll see this is uh
 
05:24:40.020 --> 05:24:42.250 align:start position:0%
we'll see this is uh

05:25:04.448 --> 05:25:04.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:06.770 --> 05:25:06.780 align:start position:0%
representative post has a question uh
 
05:25:10.310 --> 05:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:13.010 --> 05:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman does
 
05:25:15.470 --> 05:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
that remove the um Crystal note I mean
 
05:25:17.628 --> 05:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
is that going to alleviate the fiscal
 
05:25:20.628 --> 05:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
note on that the fiscal note would not
 
05:25:24.170 --> 05:25:24.180 align:start position:0%
apply to this to this bill okay thank
 
05:25:24.180 --> 05:25:26.510 align:start position:0%
apply to this to this bill okay thank
you

05:25:26.510 --> 05:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:31.788 --> 05:25:31.798 align:start position:0%
because uh if I if uh testimony
 
05:25:35.690 --> 05:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
testimony shows that uh the testimony
 
05:25:38.510 --> 05:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
that there was
 
05:25:43.430 --> 05:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
the the bill uh because the bill of the
 
05:25:45.610 --> 05:25:45.620 align:start position:0%
amendment does not
 
05:25:49.330 --> 05:25:49.340 align:start position:0%
specify specifically
 
05:25:52.990 --> 05:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
what the de how the Des
 
05:25:56.750 --> 05:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
would uh implement this bill
 
05:26:00.128 --> 05:26:00.138 align:start position:0%
and the hip and there is documentation
 
05:26:04.190 --> 05:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
that the Des had no problem with the
 
05:26:07.250 --> 05:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
bill the original with the bill as
 
05:26:10.128 --> 05:26:10.138 align:start position:0%
amended because it would be actually be
 
05:26:12.190 --> 05:26:12.200 align:start position:0%
a bill that was
 
05:26:17.628 --> 05:26:17.638 align:start position:0%
passed last year with dps's acquiescence
 
05:26:20.990 --> 05:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
that that should be should be the that
 
05:26:24.230 --> 05:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
should take care of the fiscal itself
 
05:26:26.448 --> 05:26:26.458 align:start position:0%
fiscal note would not apply
 
05:26:26.458 --> 05:26:28.730 align:start position:0%
fiscal note would not apply
uh

05:26:28.730 --> 05:26:28.740 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:26:31.250 --> 05:26:31.260 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
05:26:35.030 --> 05:26:35.040 align:start position:0%

house and is actually uh been in front
 
05:40:43.850 --> 05:40:43.860 align:start position:0%
of the whole body
 
05:40:46.850 --> 05:40:46.860 align:start position:0%
the language is very similar this this
 
05:40:48.770 --> 05:40:48.780 align:start position:0%
actually has been this particular
 
05:40:51.050 --> 05:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
subject matter was vetoed by our
 
05:40:54.650 --> 05:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
governor and I think this just seems in
 
05:40:56.150 --> 05:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
my eyes just another swing at the back
 
05:40:58.250 --> 05:40:58.260 align:start position:0%
and I just think that there's a lot of
 
05:40:58.260 --> 05:41:00.470 align:start position:0%
and I just think that there's a lot of
times

05:41:00.470 --> 05:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%

there
 
05:41:43.670 --> 05:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
can I hear a other Mr chairman he wanted
 
05:41:51.288 --> 05:41:51.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:54.948 --> 05:41:54.958 align:start position:0%
representative Schmitz to speak
 
05:41:54.958 --> 05:42:00.230 align:start position:0%
representative Schmitz to speak
uh

05:42:00.230 --> 05:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:03.350 --> 05:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:07.788 --> 05:42:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:10.610 --> 05:42:10.620 align:start position:0%
representative Smith there I go I'm here
 
05:42:15.770 --> 05:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
I am thank you Mr chair and I rise in
 
05:42:19.430 --> 05:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
opposition to the itl motion and there
 
05:42:21.470 --> 05:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
is a reason yes this bill has been on
 
05:42:24.170 --> 05:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
before us a few times but the reason is
 
05:42:27.830 --> 05:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
is because the value of wetlands
 
05:42:31.868 --> 05:42:31.878 align:start position:0%
is important for filtration of toxins
 
05:42:35.390 --> 05:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
for keeping silt out of our lakes and
 
05:42:39.470 --> 05:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
rivers and for numerous other uh reasons
 
05:42:42.530 --> 05:42:42.540 align:start position:0%
habitat for wildlife and I just don't
 
05:42:45.170 --> 05:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
want to see this bill go down without a
 
05:42:48.350 --> 05:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
fight and I will leave the rest to the
 
05:42:49.970 --> 05:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor and to representative
 
05:42:52.030 --> 05:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
Spang thank you
 
05:42:54.170 --> 05:42:54.180 align:start position:0%
representative Spain representative
 
05:42:57.410 --> 05:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
Spang thank you
 
05:43:03.350 --> 05:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:07.430 --> 05:43:07.440 align:start position:0%
here is whether or not uh we are going
 
05:43:11.110 --> 05:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
to uh take a realistic
 
05:43:14.330 --> 05:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
ecologically sound view of what a
 
05:43:17.930 --> 05:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
wetland is I think that the way the
 
05:43:20.390 --> 05:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
Wetland regulations are now it assumes
 
05:43:23.448 --> 05:43:23.458 align:start position:0%
that a wetland is like a donut hole
 
05:43:28.368 --> 05:43:28.378 align:start position:0%
where it is just round with no creaks
 
05:43:32.270 --> 05:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
coming into it with no little Coast we
 
05:43:34.310 --> 05:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
all know that there is no water body
 
05:43:36.590 --> 05:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
except our swimming pool that looks like
 
05:43:36.600 --> 05:43:37.690 align:start position:0%
except our swimming pool that looks like
that

05:43:37.690 --> 05:43:37.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:43:39.530 --> 05:43:39.540 align:start position:0%
and those
 
05:43:42.410 --> 05:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to use the word fingers
 
05:43:44.448 --> 05:43:44.458 align:start position:0%
and toes I think that that is
 
05:43:44.458 --> 05:43:45.948 align:start position:0%
and toes I think that that is
distracting

05:43:45.948 --> 05:43:45.958 align:start position:0%
distracting
 
05:43:48.708 --> 05:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
but these little coves and these little
 
05:43:52.070 --> 05:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
indentations along the the shoreline of
 
05:43:54.590 --> 05:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
a of a wetland are
 
05:43:56.990 --> 05:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
I think obviously
 
05:44:01.070 --> 05:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
a viable part of the Wetland and the way
 
05:44:04.610 --> 05:44:04.620 align:start position:0%
the Wetland functions uh anything that
 
05:44:07.788 --> 05:44:07.798 align:start position:0%
is living in that Wetland probably is
 
05:44:11.650 --> 05:44:11.660 align:start position:0%
nesting whether it's a a bird or a fish
 
05:44:15.948 --> 05:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
in those little shallows uh in the the
 
05:44:15.958 --> 05:44:18.170 align:start position:0%
in those little shallows uh in the the
additions

05:44:18.170 --> 05:44:18.180 align:start position:0%
additions
 
05:44:20.750 --> 05:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
to these to this wetland
 
05:44:25.490 --> 05:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
the only way that one could possibly say
 
05:44:27.948 --> 05:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
that this is not ecologically and
 
05:44:29.930 --> 05:44:29.940 align:start position:0%
hydrologically connected to the whole
 
05:44:33.410 --> 05:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
Wetland is if one were
 
05:44:35.868 --> 05:44:35.878 align:start position:0%
worried about extending the amount of
 
05:44:37.430 --> 05:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
the Wetland
 
05:44:41.048 --> 05:44:41.058 align:start position:0%
um and I hadn't yet to see a reasonable
 
05:44:44.570 --> 05:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
argument for that it certainly was not a
 
05:44:47.208 --> 05:44:47.218 align:start position:0%
reasonable argument that was presented
 
05:44:52.368 --> 05:44:52.378 align:start position:0%
to us with that absurd map that clearly
 
05:44:56.810 --> 05:44:56.820 align:start position:0%
did not recognize what was before us
 
05:44:59.628 --> 05:44:59.638 align:start position:0%
um I think that we ought to give the
 
05:45:03.110 --> 05:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
governor a chance to redeem himself in
 
05:45:06.770 --> 05:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
this this issue and to do what is
 
05:45:10.910 --> 05:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
scientifically ecologically rational in
 
05:45:14.990 --> 05:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
this instance uh this
 
05:45:17.810 --> 05:45:17.820 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and
 
05:45:20.330 --> 05:45:20.340 align:start position:0%
representative brasenson
 
05:45:21.850 --> 05:45:21.860 align:start position:0%
yes thank you
 
05:45:24.590 --> 05:45:24.600 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman thank you
 
05:45:24.600 --> 05:45:25.310 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman thank you
um

05:45:25.310 --> 05:45:25.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:45:28.070 --> 05:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
it's I read the governor's view this
 
05:45:29.628 --> 05:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
bill is passed by this committee twice
 
05:45:31.548 --> 05:45:31.558 align:start position:0%
before and it had bipartisan support
 
05:45:34.070 --> 05:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
both times it passed it passed the house
 
05:45:36.830 --> 05:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
twice it ended up well this last time it
 
05:45:39.048 --> 05:45:39.058 align:start position:0%
ended up on the floor or in the Senate
 
05:45:41.090 --> 05:45:41.100 align:start position:0%
basically on the floor because of covet
 
05:45:43.670 --> 05:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
but I read the governor's veto message
 
05:45:45.890 --> 05:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
of this the first time around and most
 
05:45:48.948 --> 05:45:48.958 align:start position:0%
of the opposition to this bill in fact
 
05:45:50.930 --> 05:45:50.940 align:start position:0%
um they're opposed to the current law
 
05:45:53.270 --> 05:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's not anything in this bill but
 
05:45:56.270 --> 05:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
changes the current law that they're not
 
05:45:58.070 --> 05:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
that they're opposed to things that are
 
05:45:59.930 --> 05:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
in the current rsas
 
05:46:02.208 --> 05:46:02.218 align:start position:0%
if somebody wants to change what they're
 
05:46:03.410 --> 05:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
opposed to they need to submit another
 
05:46:03.420 --> 05:46:04.910 align:start position:0%
opposed to they need to submit another
bill

05:46:04.910 --> 05:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:46:07.910 --> 05:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it allows a few
 
05:46:10.070 --> 05:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
small communities in the state
 
05:46:12.410 --> 05:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
to map out their Prime Wetlands
 
05:46:14.750 --> 05:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
accurately and adopt Prime Wetlands
 
05:46:16.850 --> 05:46:16.860 align:start position:0%
regulations every
 
05:46:19.010 --> 05:46:19.020 align:start position:0%
community that currently has Prime
 
05:46:21.048 --> 05:46:21.058 align:start position:0%
weapons designated
 
05:46:23.448 --> 05:46:23.458 align:start position:0%
fits the criteria that's built nothing
 
05:46:23.458 --> 05:46:25.070 align:start position:0%
fits the criteria that's built nothing
more

05:46:25.070 --> 05:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:46:27.110 --> 05:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
but this bill does do though is
 
05:46:28.810 --> 05:46:28.820 align:start position:0%
something that I think is very important
 
05:46:31.788 --> 05:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
which the governor and others have just
 
05:46:34.010 --> 05:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
ignored entirely is it gives an
 
05:46:36.288 --> 05:46:36.298 align:start position:0%
exemption to D.O.T I mean that's going
 
05:46:38.090 --> 05:46:38.100 align:start position:0%
to be advantage to State and communities
 
05:46:40.250 --> 05:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
if DOD can go into work particularly
 
05:46:42.470 --> 05:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
when you're looking at crisis situations
 
05:46:44.270 --> 05:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
when we've had significant flooding in
 
05:46:46.190 --> 05:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
the state UK needs to get in there and
 
05:46:48.128 --> 05:46:48.138 align:start position:0%
they need to work quickly under current
 
05:46:50.990 --> 05:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
under the current law they're held up
 
05:46:52.670 --> 05:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
they've got to go through this process
 
05:46:54.890 --> 05:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
they can't move as quickly as they could
 
05:46:57.110 --> 05:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
this bill frees them from that
 
05:46:59.270 --> 05:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
restriction and allows them to move
 
05:47:02.030 --> 05:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
forward all it does is it allows a few
 
05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
communities to accurately map their
 
05:47:03.840 --> 05:47:04.910 align:start position:0%
communities to accurately map their
weapons

05:47:04.910 --> 05:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
weapons
 
05:47:07.670 --> 05:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
it actually has a provision here with
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
government was concerned about because
 
05:47:12.048 --> 05:47:12.058 align:start position:0%
more representation to local landowners
 
05:47:14.750 --> 05:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
and it gives an exemption for DOT which
 
05:47:16.250 --> 05:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
we do not currently have in the
 
05:47:18.650 --> 05:47:18.660 align:start position:0%
ordinance in the rsas
 
05:47:20.390 --> 05:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
everybody who's spoken including the
 
05:47:22.850 --> 05:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
governor's veto has only been what's in
 
05:47:25.310 --> 05:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
the current laws has nothing to do with
 
05:47:27.948 --> 05:47:27.958 align:start position:0%
this bill and it's baffles me why he he
 
05:47:29.750 --> 05:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
basically says that he's opposed to this
 
05:47:31.430 --> 05:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
bill because of what's in current law
 
05:47:33.530 --> 05:47:33.540 align:start position:0%
because this doesn't do anything in fact
 
05:47:39.650 --> 05:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:43.930 --> 05:47:43.940 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on this bill
 
05:47:43.940 --> 05:47:45.548 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak on this bill
representative

05:47:45.548 --> 05:47:45.558 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:47:48.288 --> 05:47:48.298 align:start position:0%
representative Mayville to speak on the
 
05:47:51.770 --> 05:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
speak on the bill to begin the motion
 
05:47:54.110 --> 05:47:54.120 align:start position:0%
um representative Grassi I so appreciate
 
05:47:57.170 --> 05:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
your passion in this topic and I agree
 
05:47:59.810 --> 05:47:59.820 align:start position:0%
that there are really specific
 
05:48:01.788 --> 05:48:01.798 align:start position:0%
designations for each prime wetlands and
 
05:48:03.830 --> 05:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
that we must protect our New Hampshire
 
05:48:07.128 --> 05:48:07.138 align:start position:0%
resources my chief concern with the
 
05:48:10.250 --> 05:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
wording on this bill purely relates to
 
05:48:13.070 --> 05:48:13.080 align:start position:0%
the appearance of considering the
 
05:48:15.350 --> 05:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
potential effect on landowners instead
 
05:48:16.730 --> 05:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
of protecting them
 
05:48:18.948 --> 05:48:18.958 align:start position:0%
um I am not for this type of you know
 
05:48:24.110 --> 05:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
potential land grabs I see the change in
 
05:48:25.970 --> 05:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
your in the um you know the width of
 
05:48:29.270 --> 05:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
these narrow areas from 50 to 100 and
 
05:48:31.190 --> 05:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
that's what we heard over and over from
 
05:48:32.628 --> 05:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
folks that were coming out and talking
 
05:48:33.948 --> 05:48:33.958 align:start position:0%
about it was that they were really
 
05:48:35.868 --> 05:48:35.878 align:start position:0%
concerned about what was going to happen
 
05:48:39.350 --> 05:48:39.360 align:start position:0%
to the landowners and I think that as
 
05:48:40.670 --> 05:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
um you know our constituents and as
 
05:48:42.530 --> 05:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
legislators we have to think about the
 
05:48:44.270 --> 05:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
people here as well as protect our
 
05:48:46.670 --> 05:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
resources I'm with you with the resource
 
05:48:49.430 --> 05:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
protection but I I I don't agree that we
 
05:48:50.628 --> 05:48:50.638 align:start position:0%
can go in there and grab people's land
 
05:48:52.430 --> 05:48:52.440 align:start position:0%
away from them
 
05:48:55.670 --> 05:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:59.530 --> 05:48:59.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:02.930 --> 05:49:02.940 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry uh yes I I certainly
 
05:49:05.628 --> 05:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
understand the concern that they have
 
05:49:07.670 --> 05:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
and the thing is is that a lot of people
 
05:49:09.288 --> 05:49:09.298 align:start position:0%
are concerned about that because on a
 
05:49:11.270 --> 05:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
previous law a previous law which was
 
05:49:13.430 --> 05:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
repealed it was actually a hundred foot
 
05:49:15.410 --> 05:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
buffer and when people are talking about
 
05:49:17.270 --> 05:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
taking the land they were talking about
 
05:49:19.430 --> 05:49:19.440 align:start position:0%
that 100 foot muscle 100 foot buffer
 
05:49:21.650 --> 05:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist and we're not putting that
 
05:49:23.930 --> 05:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
in this bill so that's not something you
 
05:49:26.150 --> 05:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
really need to be concerned about all
 
05:49:27.948 --> 05:49:27.958 align:start position:0%
this does it's not taking anybody's
 
05:49:30.230 --> 05:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
buildable land away from them all it
 
05:49:31.610 --> 05:49:31.620 align:start position:0%
does is it means that the work they can
 
05:49:33.708 --> 05:49:33.718 align:start position:0%
do within the web
 
05:49:35.448 --> 05:49:35.458 align:start position:0%
you know what is considered Wetlands
 
05:49:38.208 --> 05:49:38.218 align:start position:0%
what's within the world if they wanted
 
05:49:40.610 --> 05:49:40.620 align:start position:0%
to under the way it is right now if they
 
05:49:42.288 --> 05:49:42.298 align:start position:0%
wanted to fill in some Wetlands they
 
05:49:45.230 --> 05:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
sort of put up they could because if
 
05:49:46.910 --> 05:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
because they're not considered Prime
 
05:49:46.920 --> 05:49:48.110 align:start position:0%
because they're not considered Prime
weapons

05:49:48.110 --> 05:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
weapons
 
05:49:50.090 --> 05:49:50.100 align:start position:0%
and they could still do it even if they
 
05:49:51.470 --> 05:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
were considered primewells they just
 
05:49:52.970 --> 05:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
have to go through a few more things to
 
05:49:55.548 --> 05:49:55.558 align:start position:0%
make sure that they're not impacting the
 
05:49:58.548 --> 05:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
habitat and the flood storage I mean
 
05:50:00.110 --> 05:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
there are the 12 criteria that you've
 
05:50:01.430 --> 05:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
got to take a look at as long as they're
 
05:50:02.930 --> 05:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
not going to destroy
 
05:50:05.030 --> 05:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
and and Wetland has to meet for it as
 
05:50:05.990 --> 05:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
long as they're not going to destroy
 
05:50:08.570 --> 05:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
those those Prime criteria
 
05:50:11.150 --> 05:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
they can still develop even within the
 
05:50:13.490 --> 05:50:13.500 align:start position:0%
Wetland but this doesn't take anybody's
 
05:50:15.230 --> 05:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
land buildable land away from them it
 
05:50:17.690 --> 05:50:17.700 align:start position:0%
takes that land which is which shouldn't
 
05:50:19.970 --> 05:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
be protected which is for flood storage
 
05:50:22.610 --> 05:50:22.620 align:start position:0%
and for water quality and for habitat
 
05:50:24.708 --> 05:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
and sort of takes that out it's the
 
05:50:26.030 --> 05:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
Wetland area they're all that we're
 
05:50:27.850 --> 05:50:27.860 align:start position:0%
taking out we're not touching
 
05:50:30.530 --> 05:50:30.540 align:start position:0%
developable land there are no more
 
05:50:32.570 --> 05:50:32.580 align:start position:0%
buffers and this was something that in
 
05:50:34.490 --> 05:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
past debates that we've had in input
 
05:50:36.890 --> 05:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
that came from from the number of people
 
05:50:38.868 --> 05:50:38.878 align:start position:0%
they said well you you meaning I can't
 
05:50:42.110 --> 05:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
build on all this dry up on crutching
 
05:50:44.690 --> 05:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
the dry up whatsoever it's just the
 
05:50:46.628 --> 05:50:46.638 align:start position:0%
women that we're dealing with
 
05:50:49.010 --> 05:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
this is my turn
 
05:50:51.708 --> 05:50:51.718 align:start position:0%
uh I like the chair would like to
 
05:50:54.890 --> 05:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
redress a few things that are being said
 
05:51:00.048 --> 05:51:00.058 align:start position:0%
the old grandfathered Wetlands had 100
 
05:51:04.430 --> 05:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
foot setbacks yes now when that when the
 
05:51:07.070 --> 05:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
change occurred
 
05:51:10.788 --> 05:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
it reverted to the set it the allowed
 
05:51:15.530 --> 05:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
the setbacks to be set by the localities
 
05:51:18.170 --> 05:51:18.180 align:start position:0%
I guarantee
 
05:51:23.330 --> 05:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
that if a locality has is is going to be
 
05:51:26.868 --> 05:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
making a prime wetland it the setback
 
05:51:29.150 --> 05:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
will be
 
05:51:32.330 --> 05:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
well at least a hundred feet if not more
 
05:51:35.270 --> 05:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
what I mean
 
05:51:37.970 --> 05:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
to say that there is no will be no
 
05:51:43.010 --> 05:51:43.020 align:start position:0%
setback is in is is is like plainly
 
05:51:43.020 --> 05:51:44.208 align:start position:0%
setback is in is is is like plainly
wrong

05:51:44.208 --> 05:51:44.218 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
05:51:48.350 --> 05:51:48.360 align:start position:0%
also we're talking about prime Wetlands
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
here not talking about about Wetlands
 
05:51:55.190 --> 05:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
the wetlands that we are talking about
 
05:51:58.010 --> 05:51:58.020 align:start position:0%
will still remain Wetlands they just
 
05:52:01.310 --> 05:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
will not become part of the Prime weapon
 
05:52:04.250 --> 05:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
and the issue around Prime Wetlands is
 
05:52:08.650 --> 05:52:08.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:11.448 --> 05:52:11.458 align:start position:0%
enforcement around Prime Wetlands that
 
05:52:14.030 --> 05:52:14.040 align:start position:0%
is different from Prime Wells I'll read
 
05:52:16.788 --> 05:52:16.798 align:start position:0%
you something from that Jason stock
 
05:52:20.208 --> 05:52:20.218 align:start position:0%
wrote from the six of them his sixth
 
05:52:22.490 --> 05:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
legislative policy update to his
 
05:52:24.948 --> 05:52:24.958 align:start position:0%
organization in New Hampshire Timber
 
05:52:28.070 --> 05:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
Owners Association where he says
 
05:52:30.830 --> 05:52:30.840 align:start position:0%
portions of a wetland less than 50 feet
 
05:52:33.490 --> 05:52:33.500 align:start position:0%
wide could be eligible for designation
 
05:52:36.410 --> 05:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
I.E inlets and Outlets or depressions
 
05:52:39.948 --> 05:52:39.958 align:start position:0%
adjacent to a bog or swamp once
 
05:52:42.590 --> 05:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
designated the regulatory permitting
 
05:52:45.948 --> 05:52:45.958 align:start position:0%
requirements for any activity including
 
05:52:48.470 --> 05:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
Forest management becomes a lot more
 
05:52:52.190 --> 05:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
complex and costly I.E but a butter
 
05:52:54.890 --> 05:52:54.900 align:start position:0%
notification Conservation Commission
 
05:52:58.128 --> 05:52:58.138 align:start position:0%
review Wetlands assessments Etc
 
05:53:01.010 --> 05:53:01.020 align:start position:0%
because this law remains a problem for
 
05:53:03.048 --> 05:53:03.058 align:start position:0%
landowners seeking to conduct Forest
 
05:53:05.690 --> 05:53:05.700 align:start position:0%
manager projects on properties with
 
05:53:09.730 --> 05:53:09.740 align:start position:0%
prime Wetlands the nhtoa opposes it
 
05:53:12.410 --> 05:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
currently there are two 32 New Hampshire
 
05:53:16.250 --> 05:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
towns of prime Latins neetlands in in
 
05:53:18.890 --> 05:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
and in some communities if the wet if
 
05:53:21.048 --> 05:53:21.058 align:start position:0%
the inlets and Outlets were to become
 
05:53:24.230 --> 05:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
designated large Parcels of land would
 
05:53:27.048 --> 05:53:27.058 align:start position:0%
be landlocked behind the regulation that
 
05:53:28.850 --> 05:53:28.860 align:start position:0%
is Jason's stock
 
05:53:28.860 --> 05:53:31.010 align:start position:0%
is Jason's stock
uh

05:53:31.010 --> 05:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:53:33.970 --> 05:53:33.980 align:start position:0%
uh as far as the
 
05:53:39.670 --> 05:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
the bill itself it talks about uh being
 
05:53:43.850 --> 05:53:43.860 align:start position:0%
a making a wetland less making a portion
 
05:53:47.150 --> 05:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
wet of a wet a prime Wetland that is
 
05:53:50.530 --> 05:53:50.540 align:start position:0%
less than 50 feet at its narrowest point
 
05:53:56.030 --> 05:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
how far the less than 50 feet 20 feet 10
 
05:53:58.368 --> 05:53:58.378 align:start position:0%
feet 5 feet
 
05:54:00.288 --> 05:54:00.298 align:start position:0%
is that still going to be a prime
 
05:54:02.990 --> 05:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
Wetland and how long is this Prime
 
05:54:06.910 --> 05:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
Wetland does it does it does it connect
 
05:54:10.850 --> 05:54:10.860 align:start position:0%
a one acre Prime Wetland with another
 
05:54:14.690 --> 05:54:14.700 align:start position:0%
acre Prime Wetland uh 100 uh
 
05:54:17.750 --> 05:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
100 yards away that's those are the
 
05:54:20.690 --> 05:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
questions everything is subjective
 
05:54:23.868 --> 05:54:23.878 align:start position:0%
whereas the the rules on Prime Wetlands
 
05:54:28.970 --> 05:54:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:32.230 --> 05:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:35.510 --> 05:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
I've said my piece there's actually no
 
05:54:38.590 --> 05:54:38.600 align:start position:0%
further uh representative Spain
 
05:54:41.690 --> 05:54:41.700 align:start position:0%
representative Spang four uh for comment
 
05:54:44.690 --> 05:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
or question thank you
 
05:54:47.270 --> 05:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
um I would like to point out that uh
 
05:54:51.350 --> 05:54:51.360 align:start position:0%
there are considerable uh restrictions
 
05:54:54.590 --> 05:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
on the landowner's use of their land
 
05:54:59.750 --> 05:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
even if it is just a regular wetland
 
05:55:02.330 --> 05:55:02.340 align:start position:0%
I would also that so they're not by
 
05:55:04.250 --> 05:55:04.260 align:start position:0%
making it Prime you're not really
 
05:55:07.250 --> 05:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
intruding that much on the use of their
 
05:55:10.430 --> 05:55:10.440 align:start position:0%
land and I think uh representative
 
05:55:13.850 --> 05:55:13.860 align:start position:0%
grassy has pointed out so you have to do
 
05:55:14.890 --> 05:55:14.900 align:start position:0%
in a better
 
05:55:18.708 --> 05:55:18.718 align:start position:0%
notification but it's not in a you're
 
05:55:21.650 --> 05:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
not taking away developable land because
 
05:55:23.690 --> 05:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
it's a it's Wetland like any other
 
05:55:23.700 --> 05:55:25.010 align:start position:0%
it's a it's Wetland like any other
wetland

05:55:25.010 --> 05:55:25.020 align:start position:0%
wetland
 
05:55:28.368 --> 05:55:28.378 align:start position:0%
in terms of the um
 
05:55:32.868 --> 05:55:32.878 align:start position:0%
the setbacks this was a major move that
 
05:55:35.990 --> 05:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
was made to take away the statutory
 
05:55:40.610 --> 05:55:40.620 align:start position:0%
setbacks uh and it was left open up to
 
05:55:43.190 --> 05:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
the municipality because it was decided
 
05:55:44.868 --> 05:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
that the state shouldn't decide this
 
05:55:46.990 --> 05:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
that it should be up to local control
 
05:55:50.150 --> 05:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
where local people including the
 
05:55:53.090 --> 05:55:53.100 align:start position:0%
landowners can uh say whether or not
 
05:55:56.750 --> 05:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
they wish to do this now I've written
 
05:55:59.208 --> 05:55:59.218 align:start position:0%
any number of wetland ordinances for
 
05:56:02.690 --> 05:56:02.700 align:start position:0%
communities and I'll tell you that
 
05:56:05.750 --> 05:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
um the the setbacks that they write for
 
05:56:09.590 --> 05:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
Wetlands is all over the place some of
 
05:56:12.170 --> 05:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
them are 25 feet some of them are 10
 
05:56:14.990 --> 05:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
feet some of them are a rare one might
 
05:56:18.410 --> 05:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
be 200 feet I've done a survey
 
05:56:20.690 --> 05:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
um so it's entirely it's all over the
 
05:56:23.090 --> 05:56:23.100 align:start position:0%
place in terms of what the municipality
 
05:56:25.490 --> 05:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
decides they want for a a wetland
 
05:56:28.430 --> 05:56:28.440 align:start position:0%
setback from a regular setback
 
05:56:32.448 --> 05:56:32.458 align:start position:0%
or for say a shoreline setback so though
 
05:56:35.330 --> 05:56:35.340 align:start position:0%
this does not really change anything
 
05:56:38.690 --> 05:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
regarding the setbacks
 
05:56:41.270 --> 05:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
um also and I think this is the most
 
05:56:43.730 --> 05:56:43.740 align:start position:0%
important point
 
05:56:47.150 --> 05:56:47.160 align:start position:0%
these these as they would additions
 
05:56:49.430 --> 05:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
fingers and toes as that they've become
 
05:56:49.440 --> 05:56:50.390 align:start position:0%
fingers and toes as that they've become
known

05:56:50.390 --> 05:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
known
 
05:56:54.948 --> 05:56:54.958 align:start position:0%
still have to have to satisfy the four
 
05:56:59.090 --> 05:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
criteria for a regular Wetland you can't
 
05:57:02.750 --> 05:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
just have a ditch and call it part of a
 
05:57:06.170 --> 05:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
prime Wetland it still has to meet the
 
05:57:09.770 --> 05:57:09.780 align:start position:0%
four criteria and in particular wildlife
 
05:57:13.250 --> 05:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
habitat Etc so it can't just be anything
 
05:57:17.208 --> 05:57:17.218 align:start position:0%
it has to be something that is in itself
 
05:57:20.270 --> 05:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
a prime wetland
 
05:57:23.570 --> 05:57:23.580 align:start position:0%
um and that is I think I'm hoping that
 
05:57:27.530 --> 05:57:27.540 align:start position:0%
this is enough for people to consider uh
 
05:57:30.948 --> 05:57:30.958 align:start position:0%
when they're talking about going back to
 
05:57:32.510 --> 05:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
the original
 
05:57:36.350 --> 05:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
Prime Wetland statute as it had been for
 
05:57:38.930 --> 05:57:38.940 align:start position:0%
years and years until this this very
 
05:57:41.990 --> 05:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
last change that made it
 
05:57:44.810 --> 05:57:44.820 align:start position:0%
um I think uh something that is
 
05:57:44.820 --> 05:57:46.850 align:start position:0%
um I think uh something that is
ecologically

05:57:46.850 --> 05:57:46.860 align:start position:0%
ecologically
 
05:57:51.590 --> 05:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:51.600 --> 05:57:57.048 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:57:57.048 --> 05:57:57.058 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:58.850 --> 05:57:58.860 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:58:02.570 --> 05:58:02.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:05.470 --> 05:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
let's talk a little bit about the four
 
05:58:08.628 --> 05:58:08.638 align:start position:0%
functions of wetlands and this one has
 
05:58:13.070 --> 05:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:16.430 --> 05:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
the 12 primary functions are
 
05:58:20.030 --> 05:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
one of which one is wetland dependent
 
05:58:24.650 --> 05:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:28.128 --> 05:58:28.138 align:start position:0%
do mosquitoes count
 
05:58:31.730 --> 05:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
educational potential
 
05:58:35.030 --> 05:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
what kind of educational potential is
 
05:58:38.390 --> 05:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
in that is what a wetland function I
 
05:58:41.090 --> 05:58:41.100 align:start position:0%
mean I had an education in a wetland
 
05:58:43.430 --> 05:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
once I've got I actually got lost in the
 
05:58:46.190 --> 05:58:46.200 align:start position:0%
swap when I out Hunted
 
05:58:48.530 --> 05:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
it it taught me a lesson I guess there
 
05:58:50.270 --> 05:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
is another educational potential
 
05:58:50.280 --> 05:58:55.610 align:start position:0%
is another educational potential
noteworthiness

05:58:55.610 --> 05:58:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:58.430 --> 05:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
Shoreline anchoring nutrient sediment
 
05:59:02.030 --> 05:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
trapping all of these things are Wetland
 
05:59:02.040 --> 05:59:04.070 align:start position:0%
trapping all of these things are Wetland
functions

05:59:04.070 --> 05:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
functions
 
05:59:08.590 --> 05:59:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:11.628 --> 05:59:11.638 align:start position:0%
uh simply subjective
 
05:59:13.850 --> 05:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
I think most
 
05:59:17.090 --> 05:59:17.100 align:start position:0%
people's backyards could meet these
 
05:59:19.788 --> 05:59:19.798 align:start position:0%
Wetlands functions at least four of them
 
05:59:21.590 --> 05:59:21.600 align:start position:0%
so it
 
05:59:23.810 --> 05:59:23.820 align:start position:0%
this this are
 
05:59:27.230 --> 05:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
these Wetlands functions
 
05:59:30.288 --> 05:59:30.298 align:start position:0%
they're very subjective
 
05:59:30.298 --> 05:59:32.510 align:start position:0%
they're very subjective
so

05:59:32.510 --> 05:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:59:35.030 --> 05:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
I think we have
 
05:59:38.628 --> 05:59:38.638 align:start position:0%
to make do we have we have and
 
05:59:41.448 --> 05:59:41.458 align:start position:0%
Primal in the prime Wetlands wardenants
 
05:59:43.548 --> 05:59:43.558 align:start position:0%
as it exists now
 
05:59:46.670 --> 05:59:46.680 align:start position:0%
things that are not subjective
 
05:59:48.890 --> 05:59:48.900 align:start position:0%
so let's simply
 
05:59:51.230 --> 05:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
stick to what we have
 
05:59:55.250 --> 05:59:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:58.190 --> 05:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions any other comments
 
05:59:58.200 --> 05:59:59.570 align:start position:0%
any other questions any other comments
right

05:59:59.570 --> 05:59:59.580 align:start position:0%

06:00:01.930 --> 06:00:01.940 align:start position:0%
no questions no questions
 
06:00:04.970 --> 06:00:04.980 align:start position:0%
saying no questions no and no comments
 
06:00:08.868 --> 06:00:08.878 align:start position:0%
we're on the emotion of
 
06:00:08.878 --> 06:00:12.410 align:start position:0%
we're on the emotion of
itl

06:00:12.410 --> 06:00:12.420 align:start position:0%

chance to go through it yeah not a
 
06:03:11.390 --> 06:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:13.548 --> 06:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
all right
 
06:03:15.530 --> 06:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
moving right along
 
06:03:15.540 --> 06:03:18.350 align:start position:0%
moving right along
uh

06:03:18.350 --> 06:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:03:22.670 --> 06:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
house assistant 426. how's Phil
 
06:03:28.610 --> 06:03:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:28.620 --> 06:03:31.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

06:03:31.310 --> 06:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:37.510 --> 06:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:42.010 --> 06:03:42.020 align:start position:0%
United representative foreign
 
06:03:46.010 --> 06:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
I'd like to recommend uh that we retain
 
06:03:49.250 --> 06:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
HB 426
 
06:03:52.430 --> 06:03:52.440 align:start position:0%
didn't want to hear a second second
 
06:03:52.440 --> 06:03:53.990 align:start position:0%
didn't want to hear a second second
by

06:03:53.990 --> 06:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
by
 
06:03:54.000 --> 06:03:57.548 align:start position:0%
by
Dodge

06:03:57.548 --> 06:03:57.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:59.810 --> 06:03:59.820 align:start position:0%
uh would you like to speak to yourself
 
06:04:03.048 --> 06:04:03.058 align:start position:0%
Yes actually it would uh
 
06:04:06.128 --> 06:04:06.138 align:start position:0%
we heard a lot of testimony on this and
 
06:04:09.288 --> 06:04:09.298 align:start position:0%
adding this fourth section
 
06:04:11.690 --> 06:04:11.700 align:start position:0%
I didn't feel based on what we had heard
 
06:04:13.330 --> 06:04:13.340 align:start position:0%
from the testimonies
 
06:04:15.650 --> 06:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
and there were some
 
06:04:18.110 --> 06:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
I thought some complications as it was
 
06:04:20.930 --> 06:04:20.940 align:start position:0%
written with a licensed septic designer
 
06:04:24.410 --> 06:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
or you know versus a nicer licensed
 
06:04:26.930 --> 06:04:26.940 align:start position:0%
septic evaluator so there was some
 
06:04:28.628 --> 06:04:28.638 align:start position:0%
confusion in that part of the language
 
06:04:32.510 --> 06:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh the change the 254 reference versus
 
06:04:35.628 --> 06:04:35.638 align:start position:0%
the 200 is also a consideration that I'd
 
06:04:38.510 --> 06:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
like to look into further because how is
 
06:04:40.850 --> 06:04:40.860 align:start position:0%
that going to impact
 
06:04:43.128 --> 06:04:43.138 align:start position:0%
individuals and the other one that
 
06:04:43.138 --> 06:04:44.330 align:start position:0%
individuals and the other one that
really

06:04:44.330 --> 06:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
really
 
06:04:46.670 --> 06:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
concerned me is when we heard from the
 
06:04:48.590 --> 06:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
from the Realtors
 
06:04:51.470 --> 06:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
one individual in particular had said in
 
06:04:54.170 --> 06:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
his 50 years he has never sold the home
 
06:04:56.810 --> 06:04:56.820 align:start position:0%
without a without a septic inspection
 
06:05:00.110 --> 06:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
and the general consensus was upwards of
 
06:05:04.368 --> 06:05:04.378 align:start position:0%
98 plus called houses sold
 
06:05:07.070 --> 06:05:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh we're sold with septic inspections
 
06:05:09.430 --> 06:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
part of the purchase and sales agreement
 
06:05:12.890 --> 06:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
so I I question exactly
 
06:05:14.628 --> 06:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
how many homes
 
06:05:18.288 --> 06:05:18.298 align:start position:0%
on Lake on shorefront are actually being
 
06:05:21.530 --> 06:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
sold without a without a thorough septic
 
06:05:23.270 --> 06:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
inspection and I don't have that
 
06:05:25.070 --> 06:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
particular information I would love to
 
06:05:26.810 --> 06:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
know that and that may take some time
 
06:05:28.128 --> 06:05:28.138 align:start position:0%
from the Realtors to see how much
 
06:05:29.990 --> 06:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
property was actually moved in a period
 
06:05:32.270 --> 06:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
of time and and exactly what we're
 
06:05:33.830 --> 06:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
talking about because
 
06:05:35.990 --> 06:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm seeing
 
06:05:38.448 --> 06:05:38.458 align:start position:0%
with this bill is not a lot of substance
 
06:05:40.430 --> 06:05:40.440 align:start position:0%
and change so I'd like to investigate it
 
06:05:41.690 --> 06:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
further and that's why I would like to
 
06:05:51.890 --> 06:05:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:54.510 --> 06:05:54.520 align:start position:0%
was I recognized
 
06:05:54.520 --> 06:05:56.110 align:start position:0%
was I recognized
[Music]

06:05:56.110 --> 06:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:06:00.708 --> 06:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
oh yeah oh God uh representative Dodge
 
06:06:03.530 --> 06:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your second
 
06:06:05.868 --> 06:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
um I really don't have much to say that
 
06:06:08.930 --> 06:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
uh uh representative gunski has not um
 
06:06:11.510 --> 06:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
he really covered a lot of uh a lot of
 
06:06:14.990 --> 06:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
land there okay all right I'll then I'll
 
06:06:17.390 --> 06:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
recognize representative spank
 
06:06:21.110 --> 06:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much and um
 
06:06:24.110 --> 06:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
I think that representative gunski has
 
06:06:26.628 --> 06:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
done the right thing here
 
06:06:30.410 --> 06:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
um there there was there were some
 
06:06:32.990 --> 06:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
complications that were introduced by
 
06:06:37.070 --> 06:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
Des at the hearing that kind of came out
 
06:06:40.250 --> 06:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
of the blue uh because they had not been
 
06:06:43.368 --> 06:06:43.378 align:start position:0%
brought up uh when it was the bill was
 
06:06:46.610 --> 06:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
farther down in the ranks with the staff
 
06:06:48.770 --> 06:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
um and I think that the questions that
 
06:06:53.990 --> 06:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
Des raised are are worth investigating I
 
06:06:57.948 --> 06:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
do think that uh this bill uh came out
 
06:07:02.030 --> 06:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
of a two-year commission to study the
 
06:07:04.930 --> 06:07:04.940 align:start position:0%
problems of water pollution by
 
06:07:08.510 --> 06:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
underperforming septic systems it was a
 
06:07:12.830 --> 06:07:12.840 align:start position:0%
a widely representative uh group with a
 
06:07:15.770 --> 06:07:15.780 align:start position:0%
lot of experts in it including people
 
06:07:17.570 --> 06:07:17.580 align:start position:0%
who are Wetland
 
06:07:20.090 --> 06:07:20.100 align:start position:0%
um evaluators I'm sorry septic
 
06:07:24.948 --> 06:07:24.958 align:start position:0%
evaluators and septic uh system uh and
 
06:07:24.958 --> 06:07:25.990 align:start position:0%
evaluators and septic uh system uh and
designers

06:07:25.990 --> 06:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
designers
 
06:07:29.270 --> 06:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
and they actually requested one of the
 
06:07:31.430 --> 06:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
changes that Des wanted
 
06:07:31.440 --> 06:07:32.750 align:start position:0%
changes that Des wanted
now

06:07:32.750 --> 06:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
now
 
06:07:36.470 --> 06:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
the letter that was sent out by the
 
06:07:36.480 --> 06:07:37.730 align:start position:0%
the letter that was sent out by the
Realtors

06:07:37.730 --> 06:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
Realtors
 
06:07:41.030 --> 06:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm getting many many many copies of
 
06:07:43.548 --> 06:07:43.558 align:start position:0%
the exact same thing
 
06:07:43.558 --> 06:07:44.470 align:start position:0%
the exact same thing
um

06:07:44.470 --> 06:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:07:49.310 --> 06:07:49.320 align:start position:0%
was kind of misleading in a way and
 
06:07:52.190 --> 06:07:52.200 align:start position:0%
um they were the commission as a whole
 
06:07:55.788 --> 06:07:55.798 align:start position:0%
voted to unanimously to support the
 
06:07:58.070 --> 06:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
findings of the commission except for
 
06:08:01.670 --> 06:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
the Realtors and the commission argued
 
06:08:05.510 --> 06:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
with the realtors that their uh their
 
06:08:09.670 --> 06:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
problems were not actually uh in fact
 
06:08:13.070 --> 06:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
based on what's happening in uh on the
 
06:08:13.080 --> 06:08:14.090 align:start position:0%
based on what's happening in uh on the
ground

06:08:14.090 --> 06:08:14.100 align:start position:0%
ground
 
06:08:17.090 --> 06:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
when they say that the houses are all
 
06:08:20.930 --> 06:08:20.940 align:start position:0%
the properties are already inspected
 
06:08:25.070 --> 06:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
that is not the septic system what we're
 
06:08:27.410 --> 06:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
talking about here is having the septic
 
06:08:31.010 --> 06:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
system its stealth looked at to see if
 
06:08:33.470 --> 06:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
it is underperforming what they're
 
06:08:36.048 --> 06:08:36.058 align:start position:0%
talking about is the required site
 
06:08:38.628 --> 06:08:38.638 align:start position:0%
assessment which just says whether
 
06:08:42.048 --> 06:08:42.058 align:start position:0%
there's enough land there to support a
 
06:08:44.868 --> 06:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
septic system and whether the soils are
 
06:08:48.048 --> 06:08:48.058 align:start position:0%
correct for it but it even the people on
 
06:08:52.190 --> 06:08:52.200 align:start position:0%
the commission who were uh site septic
 
06:08:55.190 --> 06:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
evaluators complained that there were
 
06:08:58.850 --> 06:08:58.860 align:start position:0%
septic systems being sold to people who
 
06:09:01.490 --> 06:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
did not know that the septic systems
 
06:09:04.430 --> 06:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
were underperforming
 
06:09:07.670 --> 06:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
so this is the way that
 
06:09:10.548 --> 06:09:10.558 align:start position:0%
um Des was talking about changing the
 
06:09:13.128 --> 06:09:13.138 align:start position:0%
bill uh it would have just sent this
 
06:09:16.010 --> 06:09:16.020 align:start position:0%
report to the home Bill the the
 
06:09:19.730 --> 06:09:19.740 align:start position:0%
potential home buyer which I think is
 
06:09:22.490 --> 06:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
pro any information a home buyer can get
 
06:09:26.570 --> 06:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
is probably uh for the better and they
 
06:09:29.208 --> 06:09:29.218 align:start position:0%
should certainly be willing to pay the
 
06:09:32.330 --> 06:09:32.340 align:start position:0%
um the marginal increase in cost to find
 
06:09:32.340 --> 06:09:34.070 align:start position:0%
um the marginal increase in cost to find
out

06:09:34.070 --> 06:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:09:36.650 --> 06:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
um but I think that it's also very
 
06:09:40.128 --> 06:09:40.138 align:start position:0%
important that the report be sent to Des
 
06:09:43.128 --> 06:09:43.138 align:start position:0%
and to the local code enforcement
 
06:09:47.390 --> 06:09:47.400 align:start position:0%
officer so that if there is say somebody
 
06:09:49.610 --> 06:09:49.620 align:start position:0%
had a summer Cottage that now they're
 
06:09:51.470 --> 06:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
living in full time with their whole
 
06:09:55.490 --> 06:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
family and the amount of uh dishwashing
 
06:09:56.990 --> 06:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
and laundry et cetera et cetera et
 
06:10:00.230 --> 06:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
cetera is now much more than it used to
 
06:10:02.208 --> 06:10:02.218 align:start position:0%
be the code enforcement officer could
 
06:10:04.490 --> 06:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on it
 
06:10:04.500 --> 06:10:05.330 align:start position:0%
keep an eye on it
um

06:10:05.330 --> 06:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:10:08.030 --> 06:10:08.040 align:start position:0%
the the issue that we're talking about
 
06:10:10.910 --> 06:10:10.920 align:start position:0%
here is that our surface waters are
 
06:10:14.628 --> 06:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
being polluted by underperforming septic
 
06:10:18.590 --> 06:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
systems and this has been proven by the
 
06:10:18.600 --> 06:10:19.750 align:start position:0%
systems and this has been proven by the
uh

06:10:19.750 --> 06:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:10:22.128 --> 06:10:22.138 align:start position:0%
volunteer groups who have worked with
 
06:10:24.230 --> 06:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
landowners to try to do something about
 
06:10:26.030 --> 06:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
it and they've cleaned up their legs
 
06:10:29.990 --> 06:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
they've gotten rid of the cyanobacteria
 
06:10:32.990 --> 06:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
this is what the bill was attempting to

this is what the bill was attempting to

06:10:34.368 --> 06:10:34.378 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:10:37.810 --> 06:10:37.820 align:start position:0%
the fact that the Des
 
06:10:43.250 --> 06:10:43.260 align:start position:0%
Amendment creates real questions I think
 
06:10:45.890 --> 06:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
is good because it's good for us to be
 
06:10:48.708 --> 06:10:48.718 align:start position:0%
looking at this to resolve those and
 
06:10:50.570 --> 06:10:50.580 align:start position:0%
also the commission was frustrated
 
06:10:53.510 --> 06:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
because they were because of covet and
 
06:10:55.970 --> 06:10:55.980 align:start position:0%
the interruption in our work we weren't
 
06:10:57.650 --> 06:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
able to get around to actually

that the commission had come up with

06:11:27.048 --> 06:11:27.058 align:start position:0%

06:15:26.160 --> 06:15:27.948 align:start position:0%
I heard this bill was need to complete
rewrite

06:15:27.948 --> 06:15:27.958 align:start position:0%
rewrite
 
06:15:30.110 --> 06:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
um there are so many unanswered
 
06:15:34.250 --> 06:15:34.260 align:start position:0%
questions about uh how big a problem it
 
06:15:36.830 --> 06:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
is whether it's bad or good for the
 
06:15:40.310 --> 06:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
environment to take the cables up uh how
 
06:15:42.530 --> 06:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
deep are they in what does abandoned
 
06:15:45.170 --> 06:15:45.180 align:start position:0%
mean it just seems like there's a lot of
 
06:15:46.970 --> 06:15:46.980 align:start position:0%
work that needs to be done on the issue
 
06:15:49.310 --> 06:15:49.320 align:start position:0%
if the indeed it is an important issue
 
06:15:50.330 --> 06:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
for the
 
06:15:53.510 --> 06:15:53.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature to deal with but it's
 
06:15:58.430 --> 06:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
not our job to totally uh rewrite bills
 
06:16:01.850 --> 06:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
completely and I think this one should
 
06:16:03.948 --> 06:16:03.958 align:start position:0%
be brought back by somebody next year
 
06:16:07.788 --> 06:16:07.798 align:start position:0%
with more complete information and so
 
06:16:12.230 --> 06:16:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's why I make a motion to itl it
 
06:16:14.208 --> 06:16:14.218 align:start position:0%

have to agree 100 with representative
 
06:16:33.830 --> 06:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
Smith when I first looked at the title
 
06:16:35.750 --> 06:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
of this bill I thought wow underwater
 
06:16:37.430 --> 06:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
bandic cables I mean I can't imagine
 
06:16:39.048 --> 06:16:39.058 align:start position:0%
those things just
 
06:16:41.030 --> 06:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
it you know Gathering up underneath the
 
06:16:42.590 --> 06:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
water and what's it doing to the water
 
06:16:44.628 --> 06:16:44.638 align:start position:0%
quality but once we started to dig into
 
06:16:47.390 --> 06:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
the build and there's fine schedules and
 
06:16:49.788 --> 06:16:49.798 align:start position:0%
who's responsible I mean can we can we
 
06:16:51.470 --> 06:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
ask a police officer in a community to
 
06:16:53.270 --> 06:16:53.280 align:start position:0%
identify the cable that kind of stuff it
 
06:16:54.530 --> 06:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
just didn't make sense at all there's
 
06:16:56.390 --> 06:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
just a lot of a ton of work that needs
 
06:16:58.330 --> 06:16:58.340 align:start position:0%
to be done to the building I agree 100
 
06:17:01.670 --> 06:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh the only the only real path to this
 
06:17:04.548 --> 06:17:04.558 align:start position:0%
bill is itm
 
06:17:07.310 --> 06:17:07.320 align:start position:0%

um on 426 I didn't have a 10 cent
 
06:19:50.750 --> 06:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:03.470 --> 06:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:03.480 --> 06:20:06.770 align:start position:0%
 
recognizes

06:20:06.770 --> 06:20:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:06.780 --> 06:20:08.590 align:start position:0%
 
uh

06:20:08.590 --> 06:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:20:12.650 --> 06:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
representatives of Smith
 
06:20:15.530 --> 06:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
I will defer to representative Kelly on
 
06:20:15.540 --> 06:20:16.430 align:start position:0%
I will defer to representative Kelly on
this

06:20:16.430 --> 06:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:20:23.690 --> 06:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:26.288 --> 06:20:26.298 align:start position:0%
this is 447 correct
 
06:20:31.690 --> 06:20:31.700 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:35.628 --> 06:20:35.638 align:start position:0%
I motion uh we we vote inexpedient to
 
06:20:35.638 --> 06:20:36.708 align:start position:0%
I motion uh we we vote inexpedient to
legislate

06:20:36.708 --> 06:20:36.718 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
06:20:40.010 --> 06:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
motion is an expedient to legislate
 
06:20:44.990 --> 06:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:48.230 --> 06:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
I'll second it rep Smith
 
06:20:52.850 --> 06:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:54.948 --> 06:20:54.958 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly we wish to speak to
 
06:20:57.190 --> 06:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
your motion
 
06:21:00.708 --> 06:21:00.718 align:start position:0%
I think that the idea of protecting you
 
06:21:03.350 --> 06:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
know scuba divers is a good one I'm not
 
06:21:05.270 --> 06:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
a scuba diver myself but I think that
 
06:21:07.548 --> 06:21:07.558 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea but I think that the
 
06:21:09.590 --> 06:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
those devices and what they can
 
06:21:11.810 --> 06:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
currently do or what they do
 
06:21:13.970 --> 06:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
um just doesn't fit with the with
 
06:21:16.548 --> 06:21:16.558 align:start position:0%
mandating them to be used in Aid
 
06:21:21.910 --> 06:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:23.930 --> 06:21:23.940 align:start position:0%
representative Smith do you wish to
 
06:21:27.048 --> 06:21:27.058 align:start position:0%
speak to your second
 
06:21:30.410 --> 06:21:30.420 align:start position:0%
although yes I would thank you Mr chair
 
06:21:34.548 --> 06:21:34.558 align:start position:0%
um although I feel really badly for
 
06:21:37.670 --> 06:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
anyone who is injured or disappears on a
 
06:21:39.890 --> 06:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
scuba diving trip
 
06:21:43.070 --> 06:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
um I believe the technology uh which
 
06:21:45.708 --> 06:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
would be needed to prevent something
 
06:21:47.810 --> 06:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
like this from happening would be
 
06:21:51.530 --> 06:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
exorbitant for a dive shop to keep the
 
06:21:54.288 --> 06:21:54.298 align:start position:0%
units on hand because if you really
 
06:21:56.030 --> 06:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
wanted one that was going to get you at
 
06:21:58.208 --> 06:21:58.218 align:start position:0%
depth and at the surface
 
06:22:00.948 --> 06:22:00.958 align:start position:0%
and let people know where you were
 
06:22:03.350 --> 06:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
you're talking about in the thousands
 
06:22:05.510 --> 06:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
because the inexpensive ones either only
 
06:22:07.490 --> 06:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
work on the top or only work once or
 
06:22:09.948 --> 06:22:09.958 align:start position:0%
twice and I just think it's not
 
06:22:09.958 --> 06:22:11.868 align:start position:0%
twice and I just think it's not
practical

06:22:11.868 --> 06:22:11.878 align:start position:0%
practical
 
06:22:14.570 --> 06:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
um and the
 
06:22:16.850 --> 06:22:16.860 align:start position:0%
when someone is on the surface they can
 
06:22:19.070 --> 06:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
easily purchase or get a free safety
 
06:22:21.110 --> 06:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
sausage which puts up about eight feet
 
06:22:23.750 --> 06:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the air so someone can find you if
 
06:22:25.910 --> 06:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
you're out on the water and also I think
 
06:22:28.730 --> 06:22:28.740 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire's very uh small
 
06:22:32.170 --> 06:22:32.180 align:start position:0%
amount of miles of Coastline
 
06:22:36.170 --> 06:22:36.180 align:start position:0%
this is more a problem that happens when
 
06:22:39.410 --> 06:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
large dive boats with 20 30 40 divers go
 
06:22:42.230 --> 06:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
out and they easily lose somebody on the
 
06:22:45.948 --> 06:22:45.958 align:start position:0%
way so um I think that although the
 
06:22:49.128 --> 06:22:49.138 align:start position:0%
intention is a good one I think this is
 
06:22:53.330 --> 06:22:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:57.770 --> 06:22:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:00.650 --> 06:23:00.660 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you have uh representative harp
 
06:23:03.770 --> 06:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
representative Iris recognized thank you
 
06:23:06.230 --> 06:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I appreciate the comments of
 
06:23:07.970 --> 06:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
the maker of the motion and the second
 
06:23:11.270 --> 06:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh just for the record as you may recall
 
06:23:14.690 --> 06:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
this is a constituents bill so uh I will
 
06:23:17.208 --> 06:23:17.218 align:start position:0%
be voting against it to support my
 
06:23:19.670 --> 06:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
constituent thank you perfectly
 
06:23:19.680 --> 06:23:21.048 align:start position:0%
constituent thank you perfectly
understandable

06:23:21.048 --> 06:23:21.058 align:start position:0%
understandable
 
06:23:25.430 --> 06:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh anyone else to speak under the motion
 
06:23:27.948 --> 06:23:27.958 align:start position:0%
sir representative Mabel representative
 
06:23:31.190 --> 06:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
Mayville to speak on the motion
 
06:23:32.570 --> 06:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
um just quickly I
 
06:23:34.368 --> 06:23:34.378 align:start position:0%
you know totally understand the reason
 
06:23:36.350 --> 06:23:36.360 align:start position:0%
behind the bill and you know support
 
06:23:40.010 --> 06:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
those reasons about safety but I am um I
 
06:23:41.930 --> 06:23:41.940 align:start position:0%
am going to vote for the itl simply
 
06:23:43.788 --> 06:23:43.798 align:start position:0%
because I don't believe that we should
 
06:23:47.208 --> 06:23:47.218 align:start position:0%
be mandating business practices such as
 
06:23:49.128 --> 06:23:49.138 align:start position:0%
mandating equipment at a sporting goods
 
06:23:52.190 --> 06:23:52.200 align:start position:0%
store would provide to their customers
 
06:23:53.868 --> 06:23:53.878 align:start position:0%
and so for me it's really just totally
 
06:23:58.490 --> 06:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:01.070 --> 06:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else to speak on the bill sure
 
06:24:02.410 --> 06:24:02.420 align:start position:0%
you have representative post
 
06:24:04.690 --> 06:24:04.700 align:start position:0%
representative post to speak on the bill
 
06:24:07.490 --> 06:24:07.500 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman
 
06:24:12.948 --> 06:24:12.958 align:start position:0%
um my um recommendation of itl is due to
 
06:24:15.830 --> 06:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
the liability that these businesses
 
06:24:17.990 --> 06:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
would face if they weren't able to
 
06:24:20.150 --> 06:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
provide or if something went wrong so
 
06:24:24.770 --> 06:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
again like Mary representative Mayville
 
06:24:24.780 --> 06:24:25.788 align:start position:0%
again like Mary representative Mayville
um

06:24:25.788 --> 06:24:25.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:24:29.090 --> 06:24:29.100 align:start position:0%
I I think it was not a good bill for for
 
06:24:32.810 --> 06:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:35.570 --> 06:24:35.580 align:start position:0%

obviously
 
06:27:57.650 --> 06:27:57.660 align:start position:0%
I think you heard from Fish and Game and
 
06:28:00.410 --> 06:28:00.420 align:start position:0%
your testimonies very convincing
 
06:28:03.470 --> 06:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
obviously they opposed this bill uh if
 
06:28:05.330 --> 06:28:05.340 align:start position:0%
it's any body of water under 10 acres or
 
06:28:08.570 --> 06:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
more quarters and those Waters by the
 
06:28:10.430 --> 06:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
state of State for the public who would
 
06:28:13.670 --> 06:28:13.680 align:start position:0%
have jurisdiction over these uh you know
 
06:28:15.470 --> 06:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
who would have the resources and the
 
06:28:18.170 --> 06:28:18.180 align:start position:0%
seasonal resources to enforce or reform
 
06:28:20.510 --> 06:28:20.520 align:start position:0%

this uh
 
06:28:26.030 --> 06:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
as much as I understand uh why this
 
06:28:28.610 --> 06:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
legislation was put forward I think he's
 
06:28:30.170 --> 06:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
thinking it doesn't fit when the state
 
06:28:31.788 --> 06:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so I'd recommend an
 
06:28:31.798 --> 06:28:36.350 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire so I'd recommend an
idea

06:28:36.350 --> 06:28:36.360 align:start position:0%

uh would you like to speak to your not
 
06:33:09.360 --> 06:33:12.548 align:start position:0%
uh would you like to speak to your not
sure

06:33:12.548 --> 06:33:12.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:15.590 --> 06:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
you're running out of gas too yeah Steve
 
06:33:19.730 --> 06:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
okay uh as much as I
 
06:33:23.330 --> 06:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
am dissatisfied with the way this
 
06:33:27.470 --> 06:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
this band went into place as a uh you
 
06:33:31.628 --> 06:33:31.638 align:start position:0%
know a line item and the last items
 
06:33:34.990 --> 06:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
budgeted in hb2
 
06:33:38.930 --> 06:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
I think the committee should spend a
 
06:33:40.490 --> 06:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
little bit more time familiarizing
 
06:33:42.770 --> 06:33:42.780 align:start position:0%
themselves with the actual Marsh uh
 
06:33:44.448 --> 06:33:44.458 align:start position:0%
what's going on where the residents are
 
06:33:45.650 --> 06:33:45.660 align:start position:0%
located I think there's still a little
 
06:33:47.810 --> 06:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
bit of work we can do on this bill make
 
06:33:49.788 --> 06:33:49.798 align:start position:0%
sure that we do all the residents
 
06:33:52.548 --> 06:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
justice so I think at this time it would
 
06:33:55.670 --> 06:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
be in our best interest to maintain this
 
06:33:57.830 --> 06:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:33:59.930 --> 06:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative Smith would be like to
 
06:34:02.448 --> 06:34:02.458 align:start position:0%
speak with your second sure thank you Mr
 
06:34:02.458 --> 06:34:03.830 align:start position:0%
speak with your second sure thank you Mr
chair

06:34:03.830 --> 06:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
chair
 
06:34:05.990 --> 06:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
one of the issues one of the biggest
 
06:34:09.350 --> 06:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
issues we deal with in this committee is
 
06:34:12.410 --> 06:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
balancing the rights of user groups on
 
06:34:15.530 --> 06:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
public land and public Waters and this
 
06:34:18.170 --> 06:34:18.180 align:start position:0%
is another example of that balancing the
 
06:34:20.330 --> 06:34:20.340 align:start position:0%
needs of those who want peace and quiet
 
06:34:22.430 --> 06:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
at their homes with the needs of those
 
06:34:24.890 --> 06:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
who want to recreate on the public Pro
 
06:34:28.070 --> 06:34:28.080 align:start position:0%
public Waters even if they're ice so I
 
06:34:29.690 --> 06:34:29.700 align:start position:0%
think that you know in the previous bill
 
06:34:33.650 --> 06:34:33.660 align:start position:0%
that we just itl'd was a blanket uh
 
06:34:37.490 --> 06:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
change and this gives us this retaining
 
06:34:40.610 --> 06:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
this bill gives us more time to research
 
06:34:43.850 --> 06:34:43.860 align:start position:0%
and study and do a better job with the
 
06:34:47.090 --> 06:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
situation of motorcycle riding on uh
 
06:34:50.270 --> 06:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
Quake Road Marsh so I support the uh
 
06:34:50.280 --> 06:34:55.190 align:start position:0%
Quake Road Marsh so I support the uh
retaining

06:34:55.190 --> 06:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:57.470 --> 06:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
is there any other
 
06:34:57.480 --> 06:34:58.970 align:start position:0%
is there any other
comments

06:34:58.970 --> 06:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
comments
 
06:35:04.030 --> 06:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
on House Bill to representative
 
06:35:07.788 --> 06:35:07.798 align:start position:0%
571 representative Cohen on the bill
 
06:35:11.570 --> 06:35:11.580 align:start position:0%
I I too support uh the motion to retain
 
06:35:14.930 --> 06:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
this bill the reason is uh last year I
 
06:35:16.250 --> 06:35:16.260 align:start position:0%
had privilege of serving on this
 
06:35:18.890 --> 06:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
committee and just due to covert
 
06:35:21.650 --> 06:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
restrictions this time we didn't get a
 
06:35:24.770 --> 06:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
lengthy um amount of testimony from some
 
06:35:27.288 --> 06:35:27.298 align:start position:0%
on both sides of the issue and nobody
 
06:35:29.150 --> 06:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
from any of the local governments that
 
06:35:30.830 --> 06:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
have bordered the issue like Concord
 
06:35:33.948 --> 06:35:33.958 align:start position:0%
came into con uh testified so I just
 
06:35:36.948 --> 06:35:36.958 align:start position:0%
want to make sure the um full existing
 
06:35:39.770 --> 06:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
board appears in depth some of the
 
06:35:41.750 --> 06:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
things that we've got to hear this time
 
06:35:44.090 --> 06:35:44.100 align:start position:0%
and I think we retain it will give us a
 
06:35:46.970 --> 06:35:46.980 align:start position:0%
little more time to just really explore
 
06:35:50.750 --> 06:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:53.390 --> 06:35:53.400 align:start position:0%

yes Mr chairman thank you
 
06:36:06.650 --> 06:36:06.660 align:start position:0%
um I think there's some there's other
 
06:36:08.448 --> 06:36:08.458 align:start position:0%
things that are just as important I mean
 
06:36:10.070 --> 06:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
we can listen to both sides and people
 
06:36:11.628 --> 06:36:11.638 align:start position:0%
who want to recreate the area and the
 
06:36:13.850 --> 06:36:13.860 align:start position:0%
people who want to stop the recreation
 
06:36:15.470 --> 06:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes we don't get a lot of
 
06:36:17.448 --> 06:36:17.458 align:start position:0%
testimony from the experts this is a
 
06:36:20.208 --> 06:36:20.218 align:start position:0%
wildlife refuge that's out there and I
 
06:36:21.530 --> 06:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
think we need to get some scientific
 
06:36:25.490 --> 06:36:25.500 align:start position:0%
information on what the impact
 
06:36:27.948 --> 06:36:27.958 align:start position:0%
could that's that's occurring on the
 
06:36:29.990 --> 06:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
wildlife that's in that area and and how
 
06:36:32.208 --> 06:36:32.218 align:start position:0%
we basically voiding the fact that it's
 
06:36:34.610 --> 06:36:34.620 align:start position:0%
a protected area allowing these juices
 
06:36:36.350 --> 06:36:36.360 align:start position:0%
out there we haven't had that kind of
 
06:36:38.448 --> 06:36:38.458 align:start position:0%
data presented to the committee I think
 
06:36:40.070 --> 06:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
we do need that kind of better better
 
06:36:42.230 --> 06:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
and that's stuff that by retaining it
 
06:36:43.850 --> 06:36:43.860 align:start position:0%
you can reach out and get that
 
06:36:43.860 --> 06:36:46.788 align:start position:0%
you can reach out and get that
information

06:36:46.788 --> 06:36:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:48.650 --> 06:36:48.660 align:start position:0%

form of motion
 
06:50:19.128 --> 06:50:19.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Mr chair I make a
 
06:50:23.810 --> 06:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:26.750 --> 06:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
to raise second to the motion
 
06:50:29.890 --> 06:50:29.900 align:start position:0%
I'll second representative harm
 
06:50:34.730 --> 06:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:50:34.740 --> 06:50:36.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

06:50:36.310 --> 06:50:36.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:50:38.390 --> 06:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
do you like to speak to your mother yeah
 
06:50:40.610 --> 06:50:40.620 align:start position:0%
I can speak to it just a little bit uh
 
06:50:43.610 --> 06:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
this is a very challenging bill for us
 
06:50:47.150 --> 06:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
and uh I know it's very
 
06:50:49.850 --> 06:50:49.860 align:start position:0%
polarizing people are you've got this
 
06:50:52.010 --> 06:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
camp in that camp and there's still
 
06:50:54.948 --> 06:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
information coming in uh actually just
 
06:50:57.468 --> 06:50:57.478 align:start position:0%
as of recently I think a day or so ago
 
06:51:00.230 --> 06:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
one of our fine Representatives sent us
 
06:51:02.930 --> 06:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
over some additional information and I
 
06:51:04.190 --> 06:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
haven't even actually gone through that
 
06:51:05.930 --> 06:51:05.940 align:start position:0%
information yet uh
 
06:51:08.990 --> 06:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh I just think this deserves uh due
 
06:51:11.270 --> 06:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
diligence to just go and listen to
 
06:51:14.930 --> 06:51:14.940 align:start position:0%
everybody that wants to to bring their
 
06:51:14.940 --> 06:51:16.270 align:start position:0%
everybody that wants to to bring their
uh

06:51:16.270 --> 06:51:16.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:51:18.770 --> 06:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
they're positioned forward
 
06:51:20.510 --> 06:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
and with the setting that we've had this
 
06:51:22.490 --> 06:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
year it's been a challenge with that and
 
06:51:24.770 --> 06:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
like I said I know there's a lot of
 
06:51:26.330 --> 06:51:26.340 align:start position:0%
people that have spoken on this but it's
 
06:51:28.010 --> 06:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
been challenging to get to everything so
 
06:51:29.628 --> 06:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
I just feel that it would be in our best
 
06:51:32.448 --> 06:51:32.458 align:start position:0%
interest to uh we changed this bill and
 
06:51:36.410 --> 06:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
take a really heavy swing at it
 
06:51:38.390 --> 06:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
representative Hobb do you wish to speak
 
06:51:40.490 --> 06:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
to your motion
 
06:51:43.128 --> 06:51:43.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman just briefly I
 
06:51:45.110 --> 06:51:45.120 align:start position:0%
agree with the representative gunski
 
06:51:49.010 --> 06:51:49.020 align:start position:0%
this seems to be a very polarized uh
 
06:51:51.650 --> 06:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
topic and a bill
 
06:51:56.530 --> 06:51:56.540 align:start position:0%
um from experts dentists to all and
 
06:51:59.868 --> 06:51:59.878 align:start position:0%
reports and the public and the Public's
 
06:52:06.590 --> 06:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:09.590 --> 06:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
right representative representative
 
06:52:12.048 --> 06:52:12.058 align:start position:0%
Spang knew is to speak to your promotion
 
06:52:15.350 --> 06:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
but we you wish to speak
 
06:52:19.070 --> 06:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
yes and anyway yeah the
 
06:52:23.990 --> 06:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:24.000 --> 06:52:25.788 align:start position:0%
 
involves

06:52:25.788 --> 06:52:25.798 align:start position:0%
involves
 
06:52:28.910 --> 06:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
this bill does not belong before our
 
06:52:31.490 --> 06:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
committee this is not a water quality
 
06:52:34.490 --> 06:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
issue this is not a resource issue this
 
06:52:37.968 --> 06:52:37.978 align:start position:0%
is a Health and Human Services issue and
 
06:52:42.110 --> 06:52:42.120 align:start position:0%
I would like to see uh it go over to the
 
06:52:45.708 --> 06:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
committee that is best equipped to deal
 
06:52:49.010 --> 06:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
with health and human uh human health
 
06:52:49.020 --> 06:52:50.270 align:start position:0%

issues

06:52:50.270 --> 06:52:50.280 align:start position:0%

06:52:53.510 --> 06:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you
 
06:52:55.128 --> 06:52:55.138 align:start position:0%
sir you have
 
06:52:57.590 --> 06:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
representative Moran uh representative
 
06:53:01.250 --> 06:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
Moran uh to speak to in the uh speak on
 
06:53:02.510 --> 06:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
06:53:05.090 --> 06:53:05.100 align:start position:0%
yes I would concur with my colleague
 
06:53:07.490 --> 06:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
um which colleagues uh Spain
 
06:53:10.910 --> 06:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
representative Spang uh this I
 
06:53:12.830 --> 06:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
personally believe that this bill should
 
06:53:14.810 --> 06:53:14.820 align:start position:0%
be an expedient to legislate I think
 
06:53:16.610 --> 06:53:16.620 align:start position:0%
this bill should die
 
06:53:19.788 --> 06:53:19.798 align:start position:0%
um we have um terrible Medicaid benefits
 
06:53:22.128 --> 06:53:22.138 align:start position:0%
in the state for dental insurance and
 
06:53:23.750 --> 06:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
passing a bill like this no matter what
 
06:53:26.208 --> 06:53:26.218 align:start position:0%
committee it comes out of will downshift
 
06:53:29.030 --> 06:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
cost to Independent Dental owners
 
06:53:30.530 --> 06:53:30.540 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
06:53:32.868 --> 06:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
I'm hopeful that over in the Senate that
 
06:53:34.070 --> 06:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
they're working on increasing the dental
 
06:53:36.948 --> 06:53:36.958 align:start position:0%
benefits but one thing that I hope this
 
06:53:40.070 --> 06:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill has done in this committee if we do
 
06:53:42.350 --> 06:53:42.360 align:start position:0%
get the expansion of Medicaid dental
 
06:53:44.030 --> 06:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
services from the Senate when it comes
 
06:53:46.250 --> 06:53:46.260 align:start position:0%
to the house that we can understand the
 
06:53:48.708 --> 06:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
DraStic need
 
06:53:51.048 --> 06:53:51.058 align:start position:0%
for adequate dental services in our
 
06:53:53.990 --> 06:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
state uh the fluoride is certainly a
 
06:53:55.490 --> 06:53:55.500 align:start position:0%
public health measure we're in the
 
06:53:57.288 --> 06:53:57.298 align:start position:0%
middle of a public health pandemic I
 
06:54:00.770 --> 06:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
can't see us taking a shot at Public
 
06:54:02.690 --> 06:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
Health initiatives especially when we
 
06:54:04.070 --> 06:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
have such poor
 
06:54:06.230 --> 06:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
um Quality
 
06:54:09.468 --> 06:54:09.478 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services for protecting the the
 
06:54:11.690 --> 06:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
health of our teeth which is directly
 
06:54:13.850 --> 06:54:13.860 align:start position:0%
affected in preventing heart disease and
 
06:54:16.850 --> 06:54:16.860 align:start position:0%
other major health issues uh you know
 
06:54:18.410 --> 06:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
certainly certainly
 
06:54:21.890 --> 06:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
be a rising cost for for Health Care uh
 
06:54:24.350 --> 06:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
in the state if we did allow this bill
 
06:54:26.930 --> 06:54:26.940 align:start position:0%
to go forward and if it did pass
 
06:54:28.628 --> 06:54:28.638 align:start position:0%
realize that
 
06:54:32.810 --> 06:54:32.820 align:start position:0%
just second uh this uh this previous
 
06:54:35.930 --> 06:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
speaker the this bill is to be retained
 
06:54:38.208 --> 06:54:38.218 align:start position:0%
at least that's the motion it is not the
 
06:54:38.218 --> 06:54:39.350 align:start position:0%
at least that's the motion it is not the
itl

06:54:39.350 --> 06:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
itl
 
06:54:41.208 --> 06:54:41.218 align:start position:0%
oh yes I know I was just sharing my
 
06:54:42.830 --> 06:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
opinion that I think it should be all
 
06:54:42.840 --> 06:54:43.868 align:start position:0%
opinion that I think it should be all
right

06:54:43.868 --> 06:54:43.878 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:54:47.510 --> 06:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative brassy
 
06:54:50.270 --> 06:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chairman thank you a lot of you
 
06:54:52.310 --> 06:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
members have received information that
 
06:54:53.750 --> 06:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
I've sent to you a lot of information
 
06:54:55.190 --> 06:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
sheets from even from different
 
06:54:57.590 --> 06:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
countries uh at the shoe I feel very
 
06:54:59.030 --> 06:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
strongly about and I would like to see
 
06:55:00.948 --> 06:55:00.958 align:start position:0%
at itl but I will support the retaining
 
06:55:02.810 --> 06:55:02.820 align:start position:0%
issue because I think it's important I
 
06:55:04.490 --> 06:55:04.500 align:start position:0%
also do agree with representative Spang
 
06:55:05.750 --> 06:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
I don't know why we have this in our
 
06:55:07.128 --> 06:55:07.138 align:start position:0%
committee it should go to health and
 
06:55:08.208 --> 06:55:08.218 align:start position:0%
services it shouldn't be in our
 
06:55:09.770 --> 06:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
committee at all
 
06:55:11.090 --> 06:55:11.100 align:start position:0%
um I guess this is the third time it
 
06:55:12.948 --> 06:55:12.958 align:start position:0%
come here and it's unfortunate that it
 
06:55:14.270 --> 06:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
does come to our community because it's
 
06:55:16.910 --> 06:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
not a place where uh on an issue that we
 
06:55:18.890 --> 06:55:18.900 align:start position:0%
really should be dealing with I would
 
06:55:20.930 --> 06:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
hope that the chairman would uh would
 
06:55:22.670 --> 06:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
certainly advise leadership that you
 
06:55:24.288 --> 06:55:24.298 align:start position:0%
know really needs to be a different
 
06:55:26.150 --> 06:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
committee other than ours but in the
 
06:55:28.310 --> 06:55:28.320 align:start position:0%
meantime we'll retain it we'll uh we'll
 
06:55:30.430 --> 06:55:30.440 align:start position:0%
find more information to you about this
 
06:55:32.990 --> 06:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
and uh hopefully by the time we get to
 
06:55:34.610 --> 06:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
the end of it eventually it will be
 
06:55:34.620 --> 06:55:35.990 align:start position:0%
the end of it eventually it will be
defeated

06:55:35.990 --> 06:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
defeated
 
06:55:38.868 --> 06:55:38.878 align:start position:0%
um in in the final final vote that we
 
06:55:44.510 --> 06:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:55:46.190 --> 06:55:46.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't want to be the guy who know
 
06:55:47.810 --> 06:55:47.820 align:start position:0%
who's uh so thank you Mr chairman I
 
06:55:48.890 --> 06:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
don't want to be the guy who's known for
 
06:55:50.750 --> 06:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
keeping us past our scheduled time so I
 
06:55:52.548 --> 06:55:52.558 align:start position:0%
don't want to go into my all my remarks
 
06:55:54.770 --> 06:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
I do have a I've been doing quite a bit
 
06:55:56.810 --> 06:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
of of leg work on this
 
06:55:58.610 --> 06:55:58.620 align:start position:0%
um to figure out how it affects our
 
06:56:00.110 --> 06:56:00.120 align:start position:0%
state um I think we heard a lot about
 
06:56:02.390 --> 06:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
the national conversation
 
06:56:04.968 --> 06:56:04.978 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of Statistics uh about
 
06:56:07.368 --> 06:56:07.378 align:start position:0%
our state specifically that I think need
 
06:56:08.868 --> 06:56:08.878 align:start position:0%
to be shared at some point so I'll
 
06:56:10.610 --> 06:56:10.620 align:start position:0%
support the motion to retain but I agree
 
06:56:12.048 --> 06:56:12.058 align:start position:0%
with representative Moran that I would
 
06:56:15.048 --> 06:56:15.058 align:start position:0%
much rather see this itl and move on but
 
06:56:17.330 --> 06:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
I'll save those remarks for
 
06:56:21.048 --> 06:56:21.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:23.690 --> 06:56:23.700 align:start position:0%
representative Cohen for walking really
 
06:56:23.700 --> 06:56:24.530 align:start position:0%
representative Cohen for walking really
quick

06:56:24.530 --> 06:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
quick
 
06:56:26.868 --> 06:56:26.878 align:start position:0%
um I will support the retain I think
 
06:56:28.968 --> 06:56:28.978 align:start position:0%
this is a drinking water issue that
 
06:56:31.490 --> 06:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
needs to be explored in our committee uh
 
06:56:34.910 --> 06:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:37.250 --> 06:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
but I will support the motion to retain
 
06:56:39.110 --> 06:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
and have that discussion in the summer
 
06:56:41.750 --> 06:56:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:56:43.990 --> 06:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else uh
 
06:56:48.590 --> 06:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh as chair I move uh I'll tell you my
 
06:56:50.390 --> 06:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
feelings on this reason I'm supporting
 
06:56:54.770 --> 06:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
one reason I'm supporting retention uh I
 
06:56:58.128 --> 06:56:58.138 align:start position:0%
do support the bill and then uh and the
 
06:57:01.430 --> 06:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
bill that I see in front of me is I
 
06:57:04.250 --> 06:57:04.260 align:start position:0%
don't believe is ready for prime time uh
 
06:57:08.330 --> 06:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
if you look at the bill uh it has one
 
06:57:10.910 --> 06:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
more uh one sentence concerning uh
 
06:57:14.628 --> 06:57:14.638 align:start position:0%
fluoride and water and it has a whole
 
06:57:16.490 --> 06:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
page concerning
 
06:57:21.410 --> 06:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
fluoride in school district water it the
 
06:57:23.750 --> 06:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
just by the way this bill is put
 
06:57:25.910 --> 06:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
together it focuses on the wrong thing
 
06:57:30.110 --> 06:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
that should be fixed uh also my concern
 
06:57:35.110 --> 06:57:35.120 align:start position:0%
is that we are in the first year here
 
06:57:40.070 --> 06:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh you we concentrate heavily on budgets
 
06:57:44.390 --> 06:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
and other issues and this is a very
 
06:57:49.010 --> 06:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
uh it's a very very let's say polarizing
 
06:57:51.708 --> 06:57:51.718 align:start position:0%
bill it's it goes it cuts across uh
 
06:57:55.070 --> 06:57:55.080 align:start position:0%
party lines there are some people who
 
06:57:56.990 --> 06:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
are foreign some people are against on
 
06:57:59.810 --> 06:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
both sides so this will be a hard-fought
 
06:58:03.830 --> 06:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
bill uh I don't want to see it tabled
 
06:58:06.110 --> 06:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
which will probably very well could
 
06:58:09.410 --> 06:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
happen in the first year and then we
 
06:58:11.150 --> 06:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
would be if it were tabled in the first
 
06:58:13.010 --> 06:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
year we would have it back the second
 
06:58:16.368 --> 06:58:16.378 align:start position:0%
year and ironically with this uh I'm
 
06:58:19.430 --> 06:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
going to have this bill get get a one
 
06:58:22.010 --> 06:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
shot and that would should be in the
 
06:58:25.730 --> 06:58:25.740 align:start position:0%
this in the SEC in the second year so
 
06:58:28.310 --> 06:58:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's where I that's where I stand on
 
06:58:30.770 --> 06:58:30.780 align:start position:0%
the bill uh I don't know if anybody else
 
06:58:34.788 --> 06:58:34.798 align:start position:0%
has any any questions or comments no
 
06:58:38.510 --> 06:58:38.520 align:start position:0%
other answer no no one else up on the
 
06:58:42.170 --> 06:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
bill to on a motion to retain
 
06:58:45.530 --> 06:58:45.540 align:start position:0%
I'll spill 611.
