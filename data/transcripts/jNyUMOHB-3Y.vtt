00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 align:start position:0%
I just like open up with the really the
 
00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:33.439 align:start position:0%
the first question
 
00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
and we really appreciate your cander and
 
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
your your uh answering tough questions
 
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of months as we go
 
00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 align:start position:0%
through this and again our our
 
00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
perspective is one recognizing that we
 
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 align:start position:0%
we need to have landfills but two that
 
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
those landfills need to be um safe for
 
00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 align:start position:0%
the environment and safe for the public
 
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:56.200 align:start position:0%
and and you guys I know are caught right
 
00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 align:start position:0%
in the middle of trying to make rules
 
00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 align:start position:0%
that balance those two things
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
um what we've heard and and you know
 
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 align:start position:0%
we're talking about this morning is um
 
00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of discussion about
 
00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 align:start position:0%
numbers and and flow and 10 to minus 3
 
00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 align:start position:0%
versus 10 to Minus 5 and all that my my
 
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
biggest question guys
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
is as you sit there and you rewrite the
 
00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 align:start position:0%
rules our desire all along up front is
 
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that when that next land
 
00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 align:start position:0%
landfill comes whenever it
 
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
comes that when it goes in it is safer
 
00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 align:start position:0%
for the environment and safer for the
 
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
public than what currently
 
00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:43.759 align:start position:0%
exists and that's the question and so
 
00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
how are these rules that you're creating
 
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
today making it safer
 
00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 align:start position:0%
over great well thank you uh Mr chair
 
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee for the
 
00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
record my name is Mike willat I serve as
 
00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
director of the waste management
 
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 align:start position:0%
division for New Hampshire Dees and I'm
 
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
joined this morning by leam McKenna who
 
00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 align:start position:0%
serves as administrator of our Solid
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
Waste Management Bureau um we're happy
 
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
to be before you this morning to present
 
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
this letter in response to your question
 
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 align:start position:0%
um about how um our proposed Solid Waste
 
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 align:start position:0%
rules will um provide uh additional
 
00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
protections um and and improve uh
 
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
protection protectiveness of human
 
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 align:start position:0%
health and safety as well as protection
 
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
of the environment um your letter in
 
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
your question had asked you maybe you
 
00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 align:start position:0%
know five or seven uh examples and as we
 
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
look through the rules and analyze that
 
00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 align:start position:0%
we realized that that that there are a
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
lot more than that and rather than just
 
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
highlight them we we thought we'd uh
 
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
we'd actually outline in the letter all
 
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
the ones that we that really came to
 
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
mind as being adding significant
 
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
protections um there are probably more
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
but but these I think are ones that
 
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
stood out to us um what I'd like to do
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
this morning is really just highlight uh
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
about seven of them that I think you
 
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
know maybe could could come to the top
 
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the list um I also before we finish I
 
00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
would like to turn it over to um uh Leah
 
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
to to give you some idea where we're at
 
00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
with the ru making because that Ru
 
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
making notice will be filed shortly and
 
00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
I want to just talk to you about we'd
 
00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
like to just talk to you about the
 
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
logistics of that so um I I think it's
 
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
important before I discuss these
 
00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
individual um improvements to understand
 
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
as we've discussed previously that
 
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:33.400 align:start position:0%
um all of our rules really work together
 
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
a rule set works together to provide
 
00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
protections and you can't just look at
 
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
one rule and say well that either does
 
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
or doesn't provide a protection you have
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
to look at it in the context of how it
 
00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:46.120 align:start position:0%
works with other other rules in the uh
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
in the set and of course our rules as
 
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
you know you you folks probably
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
understand these rules better than a lot
 
00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
of people do um they they're expansive
 
00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
and they cover a lot of ground so it's
 
00:06:57.309 --> 00:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
important to look at them as a holistic
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
set rather than one individual provision
 
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.629 align:start position:0%
set rather than one individual provision
ision

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:01.639 align:start position:0%
ision
 
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
so to highlight a few of those
 
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:06.560 align:start position:0%
provisions and and in your letter I
 
00:07:09.670 --> 00:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
think you'll note that the the the um
 
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
citations are they're not prioritized by
 
00:07:14.629 --> 00:07:14.639 align:start position:0%
by level of protection they're actually
 
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
prior they're actually ordered in terms
 
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
of um in the nomenclature of the rules
 
00:07:20.869 --> 00:07:20.879 align:start position:0%
where they occur in the rules so that
 
00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
way if you were looking at a set of
 
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:23.960 align:start position:0%
rules and you wanted to go through the
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
letter you wouldn't have to keep
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
flipping Pages back and forth you could
 
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
keep going forward and you could read
 
00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
you know look at those individual rules
 
00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 align:start position:0%
so the first one that I'd like to
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
highlight is uh en envs sw80 and and for
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
purposes of of discussion here I'm going
 
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
to all of these rules have the the
 
00:07:46.029 --> 00:07:46.039 align:start position:0%
prefix en vsw I'm going to avoid that so
 
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
you don't hear me you know giving you an
 
00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
alphabet soup this morning so I'm just
 
00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:51.919 align:start position:0%
going to talk about the the the
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
numerical citation of the rule so um to
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
start off nvsw
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
842b 80403 B
 
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:00.670 align:start position:0%
842b 80403 B
and

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
80405 B are proposed for revision to add
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
consideration of storm water lee8 and
 
00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:08.919 align:start position:0%
landfill gas infrastructure location
 
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
during landfill sighting uh the current
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
rules only require the landfill
 
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
footprint be considered in these site
 
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
specific sighting requirements the
 
00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:19.800 align:start position:0%
proposed change will improve protection
 
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:21.800 align:start position:0%
of groundwater surface waters and other
 
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.629 align:start position:0%
of groundwater surface waters and other
potential

00:08:23.629 --> 00:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
receptors uh the second one that I'd
 
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
like to highlight is 80403 C
 
00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
and that is uh proposed for addition to
 
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
require that a landfill and Associated
 
00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
storm water lee8 and landfill gas
 
00:08:40.509 --> 00:08:40.519 align:start position:0%
infrastructure be cited such that a
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
discharge spill leachate release or
 
00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.160 align:start position:0%
other failure of the waste containment
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
system or Associated infrastructure will
 
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
be detected and assessed and Remediation
 
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
initiated prior to contamination
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
reaching any perennial water body um
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
while a parallel requirement exists in
 
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
the groundwater protection requirements
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
in the rules um no such provision
 
00:09:02.269 --> 00:09:02.279 align:start position:0%
currently exists to protect surface
 
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
waters so this proposed change will um
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
clearly improve protection of surface
 
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:09.760 align:start position:0%
waters when compared to the previous
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
rule um The Third One 80403 D is
 
00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040 align:start position:0%
proposed for revision to increase the
 
00:09:18.269 --> 00:09:18.279 align:start position:0%
distance between a landfill footprint
 
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
and a perennial surface water body from
 
00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
200 to 500 ft with the exception of
 
00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
first and second order perennial streams
 
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
for which distances proposed to remain
 
00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
at 200 ft now current the landfill
 
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
footprint is required to be 200 ft from
 
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
all perennial surface water bodies under
 
00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
the existing rules the proposed change
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
increases the distance between the
 
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
landfill footprint and surface waters
 
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959 align:start position:0%
thus increasing the time a Pere has to
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
address and remediate potential Rees
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
releases from the landfill and we note
 
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:51.480 align:start position:0%
that um the site specific sighting
 
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
requirements and the minimum setback
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
distance requirements work in tandem to
 
00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
enhance protection of groundwater
 
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
surface waters and other potential
 
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519 align:start position:0%
receptors so that it's important to
 
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
understand there are other Provisions
 
00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:05.839 align:start position:0%
that that also influence the
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that um the fourth one
 
00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
EnV SW
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
859b and G are proposed for revision to
 
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
increase the designed capacity of storm
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
Water Management Systems from that
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
required for a 25e 24-hour storm event
 
00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:25.880 align:start position:0%
to that required for a 50-year storm
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
event excuse me current rules require
 
00:10:31.509 --> 00:10:31.519 align:start position:0%
storm water systems be designed to
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
accommodate just the 25-year storm event
 
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:36.240 align:start position:0%
this proposed change will better address
 
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
the increases and frequency and duration
 
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:41.720 align:start position:0%
of storm events due to climate change
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
and provide uh protections with respect
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
to uh both generation of lee8 and
 
00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
management of storm water on the on the
 
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.069 align:start position:0%
management of storm water on the on the
landfill

00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:56.629 --> 00:10:56.639 align:start position:0%
site uh that is the citation for that is
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
8059 B and G that's going to be number
 
00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:03.160 align:start position:0%
12 in the letter sure oh sorry about
 
00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
that yeah so we went 1 3 4 12 so
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
far and then if you can maybe find that
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
one 80512 a 15 so number 13 in the
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
letter um s nvsw
 
00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
852a is proposed for
 
00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
revision to require a composite liner
 
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
the current rule only requires a geome
 
00:11:31.269 --> 00:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
membrane liner and this is for MSW
 
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
landfills that already require a double
 
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
liner in the current rules they
 
00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:37.959 align:start position:0%
essentially require that both of those
 
00:11:40.509 --> 00:11:40.519 align:start position:0%
be or that at least one is a geomembrane
 
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
liner the new revision will require that
 
00:11:46.269 --> 00:11:46.279 align:start position:0%
one of those liners be a composite liner
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
which to understand the definition of
 
00:11:50.389 --> 00:11:50.399 align:start position:0%
that would either be a GC what's known
 
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.680 align:start position:0%
as a GCL liner so a geosynthetic
 
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
composite liner which is actually a
 
00:11:57.389 --> 00:11:57.399 align:start position:0%
geomembrane liner a plastic liner that
 
00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:01.279 align:start position:0%
is bonded to um a a clay material that
 
00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh helps to provide additional
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
protection from leakage even in the
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
event of a small puncture um and then um
 
00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
or a composite liner can be a
 
00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
geomembrane plastic liner coupled with a
 
00:12:16.509 --> 00:12:16.519 align:start position:0%
layer of of engineered soil so this will
 
00:12:18.629 --> 00:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
provide uh improve the effectiveness and
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
the protectiveness of liner systems um
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
and again assist in self-healing any
 
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:25.839 align:start position:0%
pinhole leaks that could
 
00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
occur the sixth one um 806 8
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
G3 which is number 16 in the letter uh
 
00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:35.680 align:start position:0%
is proposed to be added to require
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
landfill permites to perform an annual
 
00:12:40.829 --> 00:12:40.839 align:start position:0%
Odor Control evaluation report current
 
00:12:42.590 --> 00:12:42.600 align:start position:0%
rules don't require comprehensive
 
00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
evaluations of odor issues and this
 
00:12:47.150 --> 00:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
proposed change will assist in reducing
 
00:12:49.670 --> 00:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
nuisance odor conditions and you know
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things in here
 
00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
that are related to what are termed
 
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
nuisance things like litter and odor and
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
noise but we understand that that those
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
are quality of life issues that can have
 
00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
an indirect effect on on on health so we
 
00:13:06.230 --> 00:13:06.240 align:start position:0%
think they're meaningful and important
 
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
changes um and then the uh the last one
 
00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to highlight is EnV SW 8068 D6
 
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
which is number 17 and that uh is
 
00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
proposed to add requirements for um per
 
00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:22.680 align:start position:0%
P per and poly floral alcohol what I
 
00:13:25.870 --> 00:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
think everybody now knows as pasas um
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
testing of leech Aid and um current
 
00:13:30.750 --> 00:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
rules don't specifically require lee8 to
 
00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
be tested for pasas although we have
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
asked in in our in our in our our
 
00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
landfill operators have done initial at
 
00:13:40.430 --> 00:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
least one round of initial testing of
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
their lee8 for pasas but this proposed
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
change will ensure that Peres are
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
collecting data on the concentrations of
 
00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
pasas in lee8 and preparing for future
 
00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
regulations that will likely limit or
 
00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
change the way that pasas in the way
 
00:13:58.629 --> 00:13:58.639 align:start position:0%
that lee8 containing pasas can be
 
00:14:01.829 --> 00:14:01.839 align:start position:0%
treated are disposed of in the future so
 
00:14:03.749 --> 00:14:03.759 align:start position:0%
that's just highlighting a few of the of
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
the 19 that are outlined in the letter
 
00:14:08.990 --> 00:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
um and with that I I just want to uh
 
00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
turn it over to Leah for just a moment
 
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
to talk about the status of this
 
00:14:15.550 --> 00:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
proposed rul making sure good morning
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
for the record Leah McKenna
 
00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
administrator of the solid waste
 
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.870 align:start position:0%
administrator of the solid waste
management

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
management
 
00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
Bureau so where we are at is a rul
 
00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:25.480 align:start position:0%
making notice was filed to the office of
 
00:14:27.829 --> 00:14:27.839 align:start position:0%
legislative Services last Thursday which
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
means fingers crossed it will be
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
published in the rul making register
 
00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:33.759 align:start position:0%
this Thursday and in that uh will be
 
00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
links to the initial proposal so the the
 
00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:37.440 align:start position:0%
um the version of the rules that you've
 
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
all seen as well as the date and time
 
00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
and location for the public hearing
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
which if all things are AO that would be
 
00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
scheduled for the 20th of May at the DMV
 
00:14:52.910 --> 00:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
Auditorium I believe it will start at 1M
 
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
but the hearing notice will will uh will
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
yeah just for the record do you plan on
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
that being a hybrid format or is it
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
iners only format great question sorry
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
about that yes it's it'll be hybrid uh
 
00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
so I believe the DMV Auditorium holds
 
00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:16.240 align:start position:0%
100 and we anticipate there'll be uh
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
plenty of folks that will attend um
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
hybrid and there will be there should be
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
enough time to have everyone um deliver
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
their um their comments and then we'll
 
00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
we will explain in great detail I think
 
00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
repetitively um how uh to ensure that
 
00:15:33.069 --> 00:15:33.079 align:start position:0%
folks submit um comments to us in
 
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:35.319 align:start position:0%
writing and we will note what the length
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
of the public comment period will be the
 
00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:39.880 align:start position:0%
formal public comment period um and then
 
00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
we go we go through um make adjustments
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
to the rules as we see fit based on the
 
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
feedback that we receive uh and then we
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
would file the initial proposal uh at
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
some point um soon after that and then
 
00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
and then the jail car jail car process
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
starts and and like the director
 
00:15:59.069 --> 00:15:59.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned a couple of um meetings ago we
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
will because of the schedule we will not
 
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
meet the July 1st uh expiration date but
 
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
that's totally okay um because we've
 
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
already filed the rul making notice we
 
00:16:09.269 --> 00:16:09.279 align:start position:0%
get we get an extension that's going to
 
00:16:10.710 --> 00:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
go far beyond what we will need in order
 
00:16:13.749 --> 00:16:13.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:16.120 align:start position:0%
reopt and and if I could before we go to
 
00:16:18.949 --> 00:16:18.959 align:start position:0%
questions just I want to I want to thank
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
you I want to reiterate that um uh the
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee's input in this has been
 
00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
very important to this process we've
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
been engaged in really I think a I guess
 
00:16:29.949 --> 00:16:29.959 align:start position:0%
you could call a pre preformal
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
rulemaking uh process that really I
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
think is um I'm not sure it's been
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
duplicated in for any other the
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
rulemakings that we've done in the
 
00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
division um the subcommittee's input has
 
00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
been very important to us it's it has
 
00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:44.360 align:start position:0%
informed this this rule set that we've
 
00:16:46.509 --> 00:16:46.519 align:start position:0%
just described to you and uh we look
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
forward to moving forward in the
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process and to hearing from
 
00:16:52.269 --> 00:16:52.279 align:start position:0%
uh either the subcommittee as a unit or
 
00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
or the individual members um in the in
 
00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:56.720 align:start position:0%
the in the public comment and uh and
 
00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720 align:start position:0%
hearing period that we will have
 
00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that I just one second um
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
on the last two that you talked about
 
00:17:10.350 --> 00:17:10.360 align:start position:0%
Parra 16 and 17 both of those required
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh testing on an annual basis one for PS
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
and one for odor so in the rules how
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
does that work if so example you know if
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
there's an odor that is bad I mean who
 
00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
determines that and then what's the
 
00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
remediation process is that in the rules
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
or or is that how's that determined sure
 
00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:35.320 align:start position:0%
so so actually that the the rule that I
 
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
highlighted is is basically saying that
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a um an annual odor
 
00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation and what that really amounts
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
to it's not testing at the site what
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
that really is is looking at the way
 
00:17:50.110 --> 00:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
that we learn about odor and the way we
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
deal with odor at landfills is people
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
report it they experience odor problems
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
they and and what we have done for years
 
00:17:59.470 --> 00:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
is um in the first instance we we want
 
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
the problem to be resolved in some cases
 
00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:04.400 align:start position:0%
you know certainly landfills gas is is
 
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:06.520 align:start position:0%
odorous there's no question about it and
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
it's really about management of that gas
 
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:10.480 align:start position:0%
and those emissions that that is whether
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
or not you're successful in controlling
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
odors in a way that your neighbors to
 
00:18:17.029 --> 00:18:17.039 align:start position:0%
the facility don't have a bad experience
 
00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
and um in some cases when there's odor
 
00:18:22.110 --> 00:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
it could be they you know to be candid
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
you know wastewater treatment sludge is
 
00:18:27.549 --> 00:18:27.559 align:start position:0%
often disposed of at landfills and that
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
can generate odor complaints if it's not
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
done really well and and effectively um
 
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
it can create off-site odor complaints
 
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
so um what we encourage people to do as
 
00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:39.159 align:start position:0%
soon as they experiencing oders to call
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
the landfill directly and let them know
 
00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
that because landfill doesn't always
 
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
know the landfill operators don't always
 
00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
know that that's happening and that
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
sometimes in real time they can take
 
00:18:51.549 --> 00:18:51.559 align:start position:0%
make changes that will improve that um
 
00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of changes have been
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
made to the procedures for off the time
 
00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
and the manner and and the type of uh
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
sludge that they or the way that the
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
sludge is treated um we a while back
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
required that that um um landfill or
 
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
that wastewater treatment sledges be uh
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
pre-treated for odor prior to arriving
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
at the landfill let us the lime
 
00:19:15.789 --> 00:19:15.799 align:start position:0%
stabilization process that helps control
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
odors so there's that um but also we we
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
we get complaints and we encourage
 
00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
people to let us know when they're
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
experiencing odor complaints so those
 
00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
get compiled over time and um but what
 
00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
this rule change will mean is that
 
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:30.480 align:start position:0%
there's a standing requirement to do an
 
00:19:32.909 --> 00:19:32.919 align:start position:0%
evaluation of how things have gone over
 
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
the last year with respect to odors and
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
and as part of that there are Provisions
 
00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:38.840 align:start position:0%
in the rule that set out exactly what
 
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
that evaluation should entail and and a
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
requirement that if there are problems
 
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
that are not being addressed well that
 
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
there be a plan to address odors um
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
we've had uh over at a number of our
 
00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
facilities over the years we've had some
 
00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
sort of persistent odor problems that
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
have required us to kind of even from an
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement standpoint require someone
 
00:20:03.909 --> 00:20:03.919 align:start position:0%
to a landfill operator to um you know
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
bring in a consultant to really work on
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
why their odor problems are happening um
 
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
in some cases it's uh you know a
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
maintenance problem or or a breakdown
 
00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
problem with landfill gas management and
 
00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
if people are paying close attention to
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
that um they can ensure that they
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
identify it and then make whatever
 
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
repairs are necessary to control those
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
odors so there's a lot that goes into it
 
00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:29.559 align:start position:0%
okay uh all right I got to follow up but
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
let me get to representative
 
00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
Jana thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
00:20:35.909 --> 00:20:35.919 align:start position:0%
both for being here and for for taking
 
00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
my question so I appreciate the the
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
statement the comments you made a minute
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
ago about working with the subcommittee
 
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
during this process uh but what I'm
 
00:20:47.909 --> 00:20:47.919 align:start position:0%
hoping for is that you could kind of put
 
00:20:50.430 --> 00:20:50.440 align:start position:0%
some tangible meat on those bones
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
because I'm having a hard time seeing
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
that frankly I can point to several
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
cases where industry feedback has been
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
directly Incorporated ated into the
 
00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
changes I can point to those I can see
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
those I have a really hard time seeing
 
00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:06.799 align:start position:0%
at this point how feedback provided by
 
00:21:09.270 --> 00:21:09.280 align:start position:0%
this subcommittee the subcommittee has
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
been Incorporated so if you could help
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
me by pointing to some specifics where
 
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
you have
 
00:21:19.269 --> 00:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
heard uh feedback from the subcommittee
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
that has shaped the drafting of the the
 
00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.440 align:start position:0%
rules so I I think I got this question
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
last time and I in the way I responded
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
and I'll respond again is that I I I I
 
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
don't know that I can necessarily right
 
00:21:32.990 --> 00:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
now point to a specific thing that was
 
00:21:35.029 --> 00:21:35.039 align:start position:0%
changed because of something on this
 
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
that this committee said um as we always
 
00:21:40.909 --> 00:21:40.919 align:start position:0%
do when we're rul making we're taking
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
input from a variety a diverse group of
 
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
stakeholders people who have a different
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
sort of dog in the fight with regard to
 
00:21:52.029 --> 00:21:52.039 align:start position:0%
our rules and um as we hear input from
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
those various parties it's incumbent on
 
00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
us to decide what makes sense to us
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
what's real what who's got a point or
 
00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
who is just you know maybe raising
 
00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
something that that we we can't address
 
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
or that that it's we're not able to to
 
00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:08.440 align:start position:0%
deal with and so we make a lot of
 
00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
individual decisions about where a rule
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
is going to be what it specifically is
 
00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:14.840 align:start position:0%
going to say what what standards it's
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
going to set and we're influenced by
 
00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
everything that we hear from all of
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
those diverse stakeholders and so that's
 
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
really what I was referring to when I
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
said this subcommittee has um influenced
 
00:22:29.669 --> 00:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
these rules and improved them because
 
00:22:31.789 --> 00:22:31.799 align:start position:0%
we're hearing from a group of very
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
interested and educated stakeholders who
 
00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:37.120 align:start position:0%
have really put this committee must be
 
00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
commended for the effort and the time it
 
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:42.039 align:start position:0%
has put into reviewing these rules and
 
00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:43.960 align:start position:0%
understanding them and asking questions
 
00:22:46.669 --> 00:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
about them and as we uh you know we we
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
heard you're right we heard input from
 
00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
the industry and we did make some
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
changes based on that that input um but
 
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
in many cases and in most cases we
 
00:22:58.669 --> 00:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
didn't make the exact change that they
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
would like we we we did something
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
different we may have you know uh eased
 
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
a particular standard because it we we
 
00:23:07.950 --> 00:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
learned after career review that it
 
00:23:09.789 --> 00:23:09.799 align:start position:0%
probably couldn't be complied with or it
 
00:23:12.269 --> 00:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
would create unintended consequences but
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
in most cases um because we're hearing
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
from a diverse group of stakeholders um
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
we land somewhere in the middle if you
 
00:23:23.269 --> 00:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
will and um I think that's really what I
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
was referring to when and you have to
 
00:23:29.149 --> 00:23:29.159 align:start position:0%
look at that in a very holistic sense
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
ask follow one second let me go here and
 
00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:33.960 align:start position:0%
then go
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair for taking my
 
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for taking my
 
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:40.000 align:start position:0%
question as well um so I have a couple
 
00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
of things that I'm still chewing on
 
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
thinking about perhaps uh maybe offering
 
00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:46.000 align:start position:0%
some additional comments at a later time
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
so if it's okay may I ask some of these
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
clarifying questions or of course okay
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
um so under 8069 which is what noted
 
00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
here as well under other operating
 
00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.750 align:start position:0%
here as well under other operating
standards

00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
standards
 
00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
um there had been some strikethroughs
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
enumerating corrective action plans for
 
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:07.400 align:start position:0%
reports um that were in I think
 
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
FNG uh of the draft that was on eight
 
00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh 03824 that we
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
received and so my question to you all
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
was just sort of it looks like now um it
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's requiring the permit uh shall post
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
on the facility website a contact us
 
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
form but it
 
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
looks like in the previous iterations
 
00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
there had been actually sort of a notice
 
00:24:37.230 --> 00:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
to the public of types of complaints
 
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
that were lodged or am I misinterpreting
 
00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
that I'm I'm sorry could you I'm not
 
00:24:44.549 --> 00:24:44.559 align:start position:0%
sure I understand your question I
 
00:24:46.350 --> 00:24:46.360 align:start position:0%
apologize so the question I'm asking is
 
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
so that that the strikethroughs that I
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
see seem to be taking out what I'm maybe
 
00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
I'm misinterpreting it to be is that uh
 
00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480 align:start position:0%
responses to courses of action through
 
00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
through other types of complaints it
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
says the invest uh this is regarding um
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
identifying potential causes of
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
appropriate response and actions which
 
00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:11.440 align:start position:0%
shall be reported to the department in
 
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480 align:start position:0%
writing in the form of a proposed action
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
plan and that has been stricken through
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
as well as subsection G saying the
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
permit permit shall Implement approved
 
00:25:22.870 --> 00:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
response action plans and I was
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
interpreting because there is a a new
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
addition in there with a website contact
 
00:25:29.750 --> 00:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
us kind
 
00:25:33.789 --> 00:25:33.799 align:start position:0%
I'm confused is that simply a receptacle
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
to receive complaints and then they then
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
forward them on to you or what the CH
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
what is the change there I'm looking to
 
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
see if we just moved that section to the
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
reporting section so just a give me a
 
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
give me a moment okay sorry about that
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm I'm going to guess that's what
 
00:25:52.830 --> 00:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
it is because if anything we were trying
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we improved upon and
 
00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
and had a clearer and and more effective
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
means of dealing with with complaints so
 
00:26:04.549 --> 00:26:04.559 align:start position:0%
um that is one of the frustrating things
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
about the rules you see a strike through
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
and you think wow why is that being
 
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:09.320 align:start position:0%
removed and then in many cases it's
 
00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.960 align:start position:0%
simply being relocated with do you want
 
00:26:14.029 --> 00:26:14.039 align:start position:0%
to do you want to try to find that and
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
then did you have one other one I did
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
have uh one other one okay um and with
 
00:26:22.070 --> 00:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
regard to section
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
80404 and that was um setbacks I think a
 
00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
th000 foot setbacks for high congregate
 
00:26:33.389 --> 00:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
settings that were named um such as
 
00:26:33.399 --> 00:26:43.510 align:start position:0%
settings that were named um such as
schools

00:26:43.510 --> 00:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
Etc is that 80404 D yes that's number
 
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
response yes and so my question was is
 
00:26:59.950 --> 00:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
the list that is um noted in your rules
 
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
draft exhaustive and meant to be
 
00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:04.600 align:start position:0%
prescriptive because there's other high
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
congregate settings that I could think
 
00:27:08.789 --> 00:27:08.799 align:start position:0%
of like nursing homes or jails or things
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:19.029 --> 00:27:19.039 align:start position:0%
listed actually in 80404 C um
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
Residential Care Facilities nursing
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
homes and prisons are addressed okay
 
00:27:26.950 --> 00:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
sorry apologize thank you and
 
00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:29.480 align:start position:0%
representative hton
 
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:32.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much and good morning
 
00:27:34.909 --> 00:27:34.919 align:start position:0%
morning I'm interested in the topic of
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
sludge it's absolutely new to did you
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
wake up at 4:00 in the morning think
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
about sludge no actually I read an
 
00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:43.240 align:start position:0%
article in one of the environmental mags
 
00:27:45.509 --> 00:27:45.519 align:start position:0%
that I get and they were talking about
 
00:27:48.389 --> 00:27:48.399 align:start position:0%
sludge being used as fertilizer yes
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
ma'am do we still do that there there is
 
00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:55.240 align:start position:0%
a program for um land application of
 
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
what are termed biosolids but it's a
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
certain Cate of wastewater treatment
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
sludges um and that has been implemented
 
00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for for several decades
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
um and um it's being certainly subjected
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
to additional scrutiny right now and has
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
been for the last several years because
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
of p and if you follow the news uh in
 
00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
our neighboring state of Maine they've
 
00:28:22.269 --> 00:28:22.279 align:start position:0%
had tremendous problems with it um and
 
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:25.240 align:start position:0%
and the reason that it's not to say that
 
00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:27.320 align:start position:0%
we don't see p in New Hampshire sludge
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
and that it hasn't created ated problems
 
00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
here um but we've experienced not the
 
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:35.440 align:start position:0%
same level of impact that Maine has and
 
00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:37.559 align:start position:0%
the source the the primary source of
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
pasas in sludge is actually um in uh or
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
high high concentrations of P fassen
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
sludge is not necessarily from Municipal
 
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:51.240 align:start position:0%
Wastewater sludge but from um paper mill
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
sludge and or Municipal Wastewater
 
00:28:56.509 --> 00:28:56.519 align:start position:0%
plants that receive wastewaters from
 
00:28:58.789 --> 00:28:58.799 align:start position:0%
paper mills and of course Main has a a
 
00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
long history of of of paper making and a
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
lot of towns um and cities in Maine have
 
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
have or have had you know significant
 
00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
paper mills in their in their location
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
and um because past was used in the
 
00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
paper making process um in particular
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
there was a mill in Maine that that used
 
00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:20.360 align:start position:0%
um P to make Chinet you you're probably
 
00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:21.640 align:start position:0%
familiar with that and it's a reason
 
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
that it works so good at the picnic and
 
00:29:27.509 --> 00:29:27.519 align:start position:0%
um that those sledges were very high and
 
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there are a number of
 
00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:32.600 align:start position:0%
farms in Maine that received significant
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
amounts of land application of those
 
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:38.080 align:start position:0%
sledges um which resulted in very high
 
00:29:41.509 --> 00:29:41.519 align:start position:0%
past concentration some cases you know
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
destroying a dairy herd um or creating
 
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
you know basically a you know
 
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
bankrupting a farmer because their their
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
fields are no longer and as far as
 
00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:53.559 align:start position:0%
you're aware may I ume we don't do that
 
00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
well we there is some history of short
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
paper fiber sludge used that's what they
 
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
they call it SPF short paper fiber it's
 
00:30:02.509 --> 00:30:02.519 align:start position:0%
it's basically paper mill sludge in New
 
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um it was actually pretty
 
00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
popular to use it um for interestingly
 
00:30:12.269 --> 00:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
enough for closure of online landfills
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
so the the the benefits of using any of
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
these sludges is that they provide
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
organic material and nutrients for
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
develop of a vegetate development of a
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
vegetative cover over landfill so you
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
may know we have you know almost 300
 
00:30:26.789 --> 00:30:26.799 align:start position:0%
online landfills in the state that were
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
operated by mostly by
 
00:30:31.549 --> 00:30:31.559 align:start position:0%
municipalities they had a long Legacy of
 
00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
contamination of groundwater um and
 
00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
drinking water and they they just didn't
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
you know we know we know that an unline
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
landfill was not a good way to manage
 
00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:43.240 align:start position:0%
waste so back in the 80s we started
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
closing those facilities directing the
 
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities to close them we even had
 
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
a grant program to help offset the cost
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
of doing that and it was determined that
 
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.320 align:start position:0%
the most effective way to do that
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
closure was to provide a low
 
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
permeability cap a cap that would when
 
00:31:00.070 --> 00:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily a plastic cap in some cases
 
00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
but a low permeability soil that would
 
00:31:04.310 --> 00:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
limit the amount of infiltration of
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
water to the uh to the landfill and um
 
00:31:09.629 --> 00:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
when you do that you want to get it
 
00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
vegetated and as it turned out use of
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
short paper fiber sludge was a common
 
00:31:17.509 --> 00:31:17.519 align:start position:0%
way to provide uh adequate uh organic
 
00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
material and and nutrients to get a
 
00:31:22.909 --> 00:31:22.919 align:start position:0%
vegetative cover going on there so we do
 
00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
have some landfills that and it's hard
 
00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:26.840 align:start position:0%
to discern because we know that the
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
waste at those landfills received even
 
00:31:31.789 --> 00:31:31.799 align:start position:0%
just from Municipal Solid Waste contain
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
pasas um but but we do see that the the
 
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
facilities that were closed with this
 
00:31:38.909 --> 00:31:38.919 align:start position:0%
short paper fiber sludge tend to have
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
higher levels of past contamination in
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
the groundwater than the facilities that
 
00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
were not so we have had a problem with
 
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
it we we and and I know Anthony drwan
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
who I think has spoken maybe to this
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
group before or to to the full committee
 
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
um has is our um land application um
 
00:31:58.029 --> 00:31:58.039 align:start position:0%
coordinator at Dees really knowledgeable
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
about this has done a tremendous amount
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
of work and that program continues to
 
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
morph and change the the the goal is to
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
make sure that any Wastewater sludges
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
that are land applied don't have high
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
concentrations of P we did a lot of work
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
over the last couple years to develop
 
00:32:16.190 --> 00:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
soil standards and and the work of for
 
00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
for past cleanup and as part of that we
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
also looked at what you know might be a
 
00:32:24.190 --> 00:32:24.200 align:start position:0%
safe level of past to have in sludges
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
where they could still be land applied
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
but would not impose would not threaten
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
groundwater quality and so that work is
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
still ongoing to set those standards
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
thank you I think I just wanted to put a
 
00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
pin in that topic sure and so just a a
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
follow a followup if you can just hold
 
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
on one second so does the rules that
 
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
you're going through now that we're
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
discussing apply to the sludge
 
00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:53.720 align:start position:0%
issue it they apply to the Sledge issue
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
only to the extent that many wastewater
 
00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
treatment sledges are disposed of in
 
00:32:59.710 --> 00:32:59.720 align:start position:0%
landfill s the the the regulatory status
 
00:33:02.509 --> 00:33:02.519 align:start position:0%
of of of wastewater treatment sludges is
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
a little unique they are um regulated
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
actually separately from solid wastes
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
they are not a solid waste unless they
 
00:33:12.350 --> 00:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
are disposed of in a permited solid
 
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:14.880 align:start position:0%
waste facility so when sludge comes
 
00:33:17.549 --> 00:33:17.559 align:start position:0%
through the gate at a landfill it
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
becomes a solid waste and it's being and
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's its disposal is regulated like any
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
other Solid Waste at that facility but
 
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
um it's it's regula under separate law
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
when it's not disposed of a solid waste
 
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
facility under our Water Division okay
 
00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:35.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative potenzo just a
 
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:36.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up question about that so is are
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
you telling me that all sludge is tested
 
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
before it is applied like for a farm
 
00:33:44.389 --> 00:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
before it's applied for if it's put on
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
top of a landfill I just want to be
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
clear all the sludge is tested for the
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
past concentrations in it before it is
 
00:33:54.750 --> 00:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
going out to these farms and or anybody
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
that's using it in an agricultural sense
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
cuz that's the problem earily that's
 
00:34:01.389 --> 00:34:01.399 align:start position:0%
going on in Maine is they were not okay
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
so there are reg rigorous testing
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
requirements for sludge I I can't I'm
 
00:34:07.149 --> 00:34:07.159 align:start position:0%
not an expert on specifically what the
 
00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
frequency is but certainly that's
 
00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
something that our our folks in the land
 
00:34:14.270 --> 00:34:14.280 align:start position:0%
application program could could or the
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
biosolids program could could answer
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
that more specifically but yes there are
 
00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
I know there are rigorous testing
 
00:34:22.470 --> 00:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
requirements and Dees does some of its
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
own testing to assist those uh
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
facilities with developing standards and
 
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
or developing
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh options for for managing their
 
00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
sludge and Miss McKennon did you sure
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
you found thank you for waking up
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
thinking about sludge it gave me the
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
opportunity to find to find the rule
 
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839 align:start position:0%
that the uh so it it's it indeed still
 
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
exists okay it was just moved to
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
8068 starting at letter
 
00:34:49.069 --> 00:34:49.079 align:start position:0%
L so I just moved one section above okay
 
00:34:50.990 --> 00:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you cool thank you and and
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
representative Jam you had a followup
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair uh and if so my
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
question this is something we have
 
00:35:00.990 --> 00:35:01.000 align:start position:0%
spoken about specifically before and it
 
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:03.720 align:start position:0%
was the language um I was searching for
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
the most recent version of the rules so
 
00:35:07.630 --> 00:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
maybe my citation isn't going to be
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
right in the in
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
previous iteration it was at 80402 C and
 
00:35:16.630 --> 00:35:16.640 align:start position:0%
it has to do with the average uh
 
00:35:19.390 --> 00:35:19.400 align:start position:0%
hydraulic conductivity uh and the one of
 
00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
the questions one of the discussions we
 
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
had is the difference between average
 
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:24.829 align:start position:0%
had is the difference between average
and

00:35:24.829 --> 00:35:24.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
representative uh and in a conversation
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
we had I said
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
um average is not necessarily
 
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:34.520 align:start position:0%
representative right and so raised the
 
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
possibility that you could drill uh you
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
Wells or test Wells right you could test
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
within a very confined area to
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
manipulate an average to produce a
 
00:35:48.069 --> 00:35:48.079 align:start position:0%
predetermined result and and you're
 
00:35:50.870 --> 00:35:50.880 align:start position:0%
you're had said something to the effect
 
00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
of if you got an application and you saw
 
00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:56.599 align:start position:0%
that something like that was happening
 
00:35:58.910 --> 00:35:58.920 align:start position:0%
that an applicant was trying to
 
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
manipulate the process that way right if
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
you had 10 drills in a very uh small uh
 
00:36:05.670 --> 00:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
area that that's something that you
 
00:36:07.589 --> 00:36:07.599 align:start position:0%
would flag and so the question I asked
 
00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
you at that time and and I'll ask it
 
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
again is can you point to a specific
 
00:36:14.109 --> 00:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
place in
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
rules uh that gives you the the power to
 
00:36:21.589 --> 00:36:21.599 align:start position:0%
do that right so if if you're going to
 
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
say to if you're going to try to call
 
00:36:26.670 --> 00:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
somebody out and say no this is not an
 
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
acceptable s Le right where in rules
 
00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
does it
 
00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
specify how such a determination is to
 
00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.870 align:start position:0%
specify how such a determination is to
be

00:36:36.870 --> 00:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
made I'm not sure that the rules are
 
00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:43.480 align:start position:0%
that um detailed or spec or explicit
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
about that I can tell you that when we
 
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:48.040 align:start position:0%
you know there is a requirement to do a
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
hydro geological study which includes
 
00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation of soil conditions um when
 
00:36:56.069 --> 00:36:56.079 align:start position:0%
when citing a new landfill or when uh
 
00:36:58.069 --> 00:36:58.079 align:start position:0%
proposing to expand an existing ing
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
landfill and that study is subject
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
subjected to review by our licensed
 
00:37:05.589 --> 00:37:05.599 align:start position:0%
hydrogeologists and engineers at the
 
00:37:09.109 --> 00:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
agency and um if we feel that I think
 
00:37:11.390 --> 00:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
maybe to answer your question it may be
 
00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
that um it's it's a little oblique but I
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
think it gets us there um and this has
 
00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
happened with other things where we just
 
00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:20.200 align:start position:0%
feel we don't have enough information to
 
00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
make a determination that something
 
00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
meets a rule or is compliant and that is
 
00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
a basis for denial if we believe that we
 
00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:29.240 align:start position:0%
don't have enough information to
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
determine that a rule has been complied
 
00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:33.480 align:start position:0%
with or that a standard has been met we
 
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
can deny the permit application that now
 
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
that may be a little nuclear in terms of
 
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
you know approaching it but but at the
 
00:37:42.349 --> 00:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
end of the day what happens in PR
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
practice is that our licensed
 
00:37:46.950 --> 00:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
professionals review these materials and
 
00:37:50.069 --> 00:37:50.079 align:start position:0%
if they don't feel that the the in in
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
the in the case that you gave that the
 
00:37:55.069 --> 00:37:55.079 align:start position:0%
uh that the samples that have been taken
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
are representative of the of the
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
of the formation or that they are in
 
00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
some way manipulated to try to force a
 
00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:06.920 align:start position:0%
particular result they can call that out
 
00:38:08.710 --> 00:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
and say they want more borings or they
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
want a broader you know uh array across
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
the site um so I don't I don't think I
 
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
can point to a place where it says
 
00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:20.720 align:start position:0%
specifically that they have to be you
 
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
know spaced a certain distance or or um
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
cover an area in a particular way but
 
00:38:29.309 --> 00:38:29.319 align:start position:0%
what really end up happening because
 
00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:31.240 align:start position:0%
every site is different and every
 
00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:33.800 align:start position:0%
circumstance is different is that our
 
00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:35.480 align:start position:0%
professionals who are responsible for
 
00:38:38.109 --> 00:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
reviewing will make a a professional
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
judgment call on whether those that
 
00:38:43.710 --> 00:38:43.720 align:start position:0%
information and the location the samples
 
00:38:44.910 --> 00:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
and the nature and the number of the
 
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
samples are adequate to answer the
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
question and if they're not we'll ask
 
00:38:51.990 --> 00:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
for more and you know we it's um very
 
00:38:56.670 --> 00:38:56.680 align:start position:0%
uncommon for a application for um a new
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
landfill site or a um what's more common
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
for us is an expansion of existing
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
landfill for that application to be
 
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
deemed complete on first try it almost
 
00:39:08.270 --> 00:39:08.280 align:start position:0%
never happens there's always additional
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
almost always additional information
 
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for can can I ask a
 
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
follow up on that yeah yeah please thank
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
you very and and thank you and I
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that uh and it makes sense
 
00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
based on the the feedback you're getting
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
from the experts where I'm a little
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
confused still though is that given the
 
00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
response that that you just gave
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
the term representative actually seems
 
00:39:35.710 --> 00:39:35.720 align:start position:0%
more uh descriptive of what you just uh
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
referred to whereas average implies that
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
there is a numerical standard uh a
 
00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:44.400 align:start position:0%
specific numerical standard and that a
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
judgment would be based not
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
on professional judgment about whether
 
00:39:52.069 --> 00:39:52.079 align:start position:0%
or not it is representative it's based
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
upon a number and you either pass or you
 
00:39:56.670 --> 00:39:56.680 align:start position:0%
don't pass based upon a number so again
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
I come back to uh a claim that I've made
 
00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:01.319 align:start position:0%
previously that
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh is what we should be
 
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
aiming for here and as you said I think
 
00:40:08.829 --> 00:40:08.839 align:start position:0%
it reflects more accurately the process
 
00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:12.079 align:start position:0%
you just described than an average thank
 
00:40:13.430 --> 00:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
you we'll we'll certainly note that and
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
I would encourage you or any others to
 
00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
provide that in comment during the
 
00:40:19.829 --> 00:40:19.839 align:start position:0%
public comment period certainly it's
 
00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
something we can look at thank you thank
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
um okay so first I'd like to go to the
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
number 17 here um on the list in regards
 
00:40:40.309 --> 00:40:40.319 align:start position:0%
with adding a requirement for testing of
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
lee8 so um so I would assume that would
 
00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:49.480 align:start position:0%
be all of the leech that is either um if
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
it's being treated on a site in addition
 
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
to all the lri that's being trucked to
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
be treated elsewhere that's correct
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
every single every single truckload
 
00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:59.430 align:start position:0%
every single every single truckload
every

00:40:59.430 --> 00:40:59.440 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
single no I don't think it means that it
 
00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
it means that we're going to want to
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
have representative sampling of lee8 so
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
that we can monitor lee8 quality it
 
00:41:10.349 --> 00:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that every truck load is
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
going to get tested I just want to be
 
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:13.880 align:start position:0%
clear about that there're several
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
truckloads per day that leave these
 
00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
facilities and I don't think that's what
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
this rule was trying to accomplish so
 
00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
give me a scenario of what it is trying
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
to accomplish then like I want to kind
 
00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:28.480 align:start position:0%
of understand um if you're telling me
 
00:41:29.990 --> 00:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to you know we're talking
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
about quarterly or I mean it the amount
 
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
of the amount of um of of pasas and all
 
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
all of these types of chemicals and a
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of other ones that is being
 
00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:47.400 align:start position:0%
trucked out you know to different places
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
to be able to be treated is huge so I I
 
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:51.800 align:start position:0%
kind of want to understand like
 
00:41:54.430 --> 00:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
frequency but then the second thing is
 
00:41:58.109 --> 00:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
um we know that we know that you can't
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
really separate at this point there's
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
activated carbons that take away a
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
decent amount of past I've been kind of
 
00:42:08.430 --> 00:42:08.440 align:start position:0%
studying this for a little bit now um
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
but in a sense you you really can't
 
00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
remove it you really can't separate it
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
out from the leech eight so what's the
 
00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
point of testing it if it goes to a
 
00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:21.280 align:start position:0%
facility where we then separate out the
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
we're able to separate out but not get
 
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
rid of the pasas right and then it just
 
00:42:28.109 --> 00:42:28.119 align:start position:0%
gets trucked back in and put back into a
 
00:42:29.549 --> 00:42:29.559 align:start position:0%
landfill because that's actually what's
 
00:42:31.309 --> 00:42:31.319 align:start position:0%
happening right now it's a it's a
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
vicious circle Yeah well yeah there's a
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
lot to unpack there so
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of this rule is to make
 
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
sure that we are getting data and there
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
are some frequencies for testing um
 
00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:46.760 align:start position:0%
they're not but they're not intended to
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
evaluate the quality of Lee leaving the
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
site each day that's not the purpose of
 
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
our rule our rule is that we want to
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
have data where we understand the
 
00:42:56.670 --> 00:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
quality of your lee8 over time so that
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
we understand you know and that can how
 
00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:00.920 align:start position:0%
a Lee a changes not necessarily with
 
00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:02.680 align:start position:0%
respect to pasas but its other
 
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
parameters can have uh can give us
 
00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
insight and information to how the
 
00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:09.200 align:start position:0%
landfill is operating it can give us
 
00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:12.440 align:start position:0%
information about uh the the oxidation
 
00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:14.760 align:start position:0%
or or or anoxic conditions in the
 
00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:16.400 align:start position:0%
landfill it can give us information
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
about how the cover system and the liner
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
system are performing that's the purpose
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
for that and we're adding past
 
00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
specifically because we know moving
 
00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:28.720 align:start position:0%
forward that there are very likely to be
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
increased scrutiny on and and
 
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
limitations on what wastewater treatment
 
00:43:35.109 --> 00:43:35.119 align:start position:0%
plants Municipal plants that accept
 
00:43:37.349 --> 00:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
these materials um are going to be able
 
00:43:38.430 --> 00:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
to do with it or what they're going to
 
00:43:40.510 --> 00:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
be required to do with it so we don't
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
want to be flat-footed as that advances
 
00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:44.920 align:start position:0%
we want to understand what lee8 looks
 
00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:47.400 align:start position:0%
like at these facilities with respect to
 
00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
pasas um what happens right now is that
 
00:43:51.990 --> 00:43:52.000 align:start position:0%
you know these these landfills generate
 
00:43:53.549 --> 00:43:53.559 align:start position:0%
tremendous amounts of Lee it has to be
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
said I think the total for one recent
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
year was around 12 million G gallons if
 
00:43:59.309 --> 00:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
we look at all of our facilities in
 
00:44:02.589 --> 00:44:02.599 align:start position:0%
aggregate um it's excuse
 
00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:04.760 align:start position:0%
me I think it's around 100 million
 
00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:06.640 align:start position:0%
gallons forgive me one of the facilities
 
00:44:09.549 --> 00:44:09.559 align:start position:0%
was 12 million so it's a lot of lee8 and
 
00:44:11.589 --> 00:44:11.599 align:start position:0%
it goes to a number of wastewater
 
00:44:13.829 --> 00:44:13.839 align:start position:0%
treatment plants each facili is required
 
00:44:15.549 --> 00:44:15.559 align:start position:0%
to have identified at least two
 
00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:17.160 align:start position:0%
Wastewater plants that will accept their
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
leech a so they always have an outlet
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
for it because you can't stop it from
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
being generated right so um what happens
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
at those facilities right now um you're
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
right those those processes that are
 
00:44:29.630 --> 00:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
used at a typical wastewater treatment
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
plant um do not treat past in any
 
00:44:35.670 --> 00:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
meaningful way they essentially bated
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
some of it remains in the liquid portion
 
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559 align:start position:0%
the treated effluent that gets
 
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
discharged to rivers in most cases um
 
00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
and some of it goes into the partitions
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
into the sludge and ends up being in the
 
00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
sludge um as we move forward there are a
 
00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
number of facilities um TurnKey landfill
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
in Rochester is traing for pasas um at
 
00:44:57.710 --> 00:44:57.720 align:start position:0%
least a significant portion of their
 
00:44:59.230 --> 00:44:59.240 align:start position:0%
leech eight they have a pretty
 
00:45:00.950 --> 00:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
sophisticated wastewater treatment plant
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
there where they treat um where they've
 
00:45:04.990 --> 00:45:05.000 align:start position:0%
treated even before anybody was thinking
 
00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
about past they were treating their
 
00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
leech eight for other purposes because
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
in order to send it to the Rochester
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant it needed to meet
 
00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
certain standards so um as part of that
 
00:45:19.589 --> 00:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
um they do a rever a reverse osmosis
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
process that pretty effectively reduces
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
and removes P from their leech eight um
 
00:45:28.030 --> 00:45:28.040 align:start position:0%
and there the question is what are you
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
going to do with that you know you get a
 
00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
you get a concentrate from that what are
 
00:45:32.270 --> 00:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
you going to do with that my
 
00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:33.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is that for a long time
 
00:45:35.109 --> 00:45:35.119 align:start position:0%
they were sending it to one of their New
 
00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:37.280 align:start position:0%
York facilities that was doing further
 
00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
treatment I'm not sure what they're
 
00:45:42.109 --> 00:45:42.119 align:start position:0%
doing with it right now there's a lot of
 
00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
um work going on right now with new
 
00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
technologies um there's super critical
 
00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
water oxidation there's reverse osmosis
 
00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
there's granulate activated carbon and a
 
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
lot of work is going on as we speak to
 
00:45:57.549 --> 00:45:57.559 align:start position:0%
evaluate how
 
00:45:59.950 --> 00:45:59.960 align:start position:0%
landfill leech AIDS can be treated by
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
those methods and I think that if we
 
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
look to the Future what we're going to
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
have and we most probably people
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
probably know it was announced in early
 
00:46:10.790 --> 00:46:10.800 align:start position:0%
April I think April 10th that EPA has
 
00:46:13.950 --> 00:46:13.960 align:start position:0%
finalized its P drinking water maximum
 
00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
contaminant limit particularly for pooa
 
00:46:18.549 --> 00:46:18.559 align:start position:0%
and posos which are two of the compounds
 
00:46:20.349 --> 00:46:20.359 align:start position:0%
that we deal with most in New Hampshire
 
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
to four parts per trillion and then um
 
00:46:25.990 --> 00:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
that is eventually not quite yet because
 
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
it's a drinking water standard but
 
00:46:30.150 --> 00:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
eventually that's going to translate to
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
um some limitations on Wastewater plants
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
so if you have a uh drinking water
 
00:46:38.270 --> 00:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
intake on a river say the marac river um
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
where and we do have that we have you
 
00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
know facilities penchuk and and uh and
 
00:46:44.589 --> 00:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
uh and Manchester pull water from the
 
00:46:48.430 --> 00:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
marac river um if you have a Wastewater
 
00:46:51.150 --> 00:46:51.160 align:start position:0%
Plant that's within 20 mi Upstream of
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
that what drinking water intake you're
 
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
going to need to make sure that your
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
discharge meets that drinking water St
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
standard so that's going to mean right
 
00:47:01.270 --> 00:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
now you know we see as you get into the
 
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
upper reaches of the miramac I think
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
we're seeing ambient concentrations of
 
00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
pasas on the order of 2 to three to four
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
um and then as you get into the lower
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
portion of the marac in the southern
 
00:47:14.589 --> 00:47:14.599 align:start position:0%
part of the state there are times when
 
00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:16.720 align:start position:0%
it's above four it's still single digits
 
00:47:18.829 --> 00:47:18.839 align:start position:0%
but it's above four so that's going to
 
00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
be a concern I mean those and I I don't
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
want to cause Panic the uh the um the
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
folks who are pulling drink water are
 
00:47:29.190 --> 00:47:29.200 align:start position:0%
are treating with carbon to make sure it
 
00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
meets standards before they send it to
 
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
their customers but that's a long way of
 
00:47:35.069 --> 00:47:35.079 align:start position:0%
saying there's going to be a lot going
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
on with respect to how we handle um all
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
Wastewater and it has to be said that um
 
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
while Landfield le8 has significant
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
concentrations of pasas the wastewaters
 
00:47:49.109 --> 00:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
coming into Wastewater facilities have
 
00:47:51.630 --> 00:47:51.640 align:start position:0%
lower concentrations but their volume is
 
00:47:54.670 --> 00:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
much higher so it may seem a little
 
00:47:56.349 --> 00:47:56.359 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive but what you'll find
 
00:47:58.589 --> 00:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
like the waste the minaki river base in
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%
Franklin which is the plant that the
 
00:48:03.790 --> 00:48:03.800 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire operates um takes
 
00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
um leech 8 from the Bethlehem landfill
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
and you know they did an analysis of
 
00:48:11.030 --> 00:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
their flows and the the average
 
00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
concentration of pasas in their incoming
 
00:48:15.069 --> 00:48:15.079 align:start position:0%
flows and then that leech eight and the
 
00:48:17.470 --> 00:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
volumes of that and the reality is is
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't really move the needle
 
00:48:21.750 --> 00:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
at that particular plan because the the
 
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
relative concentration or the relative
 
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
mass coming in from the high volumes of
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
flow they're getting from their regular
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
customers kind of is what controls what
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
their eventual P effluent concentrations
 
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
are more so than the much smaller
 
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
volumes but higher concentration of P
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
coming in from Le okay that's and that's
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
awesome except for we're looking at
 
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
landfill mhm and so the sludge does that
 
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
go back into landfill or does that go
 
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:52.280 align:start position:0%
another place in many cases I opened up
 
00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.309 align:start position:0%
another place in many cases I opened up
Pandora's

00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
Pandora's
 
00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:57.040 align:start position:0%
Box app
 
00:48:59.549 --> 00:48:59.559 align:start position:0%
that's that's fine so so yeah it depends
 
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:02.720 align:start position:0%
um there are um a number of facilities
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
that do landfill their wastewater
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
treatment sludge so there is you know
 
00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
sort of that Circle that representative
 
00:49:11.309 --> 00:49:11.319 align:start position:0%
paten is referring to where leech a
 
00:49:13.789 --> 00:49:13.799 align:start position:0%
comes in they treat it some of it goes
 
00:49:16.069 --> 00:49:16.079 align:start position:0%
out in the treated effluent to the river
 
00:49:17.710 --> 00:49:17.720 align:start position:0%
some of it gets partitioned into the
 
00:49:20.069 --> 00:49:20.079 align:start position:0%
sludge and in some cases that sludge may
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
be going back to landfill okay is that
 
00:49:24.750 --> 00:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
is that I mean to me that doesn't make
 
00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
sense is it possible to
 
00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
write that into the rules
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
that that that I mean why would you
 
00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
separate it out if you're just going to
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
put it back
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
in well
 
00:49:41.190 --> 00:49:41.200 align:start position:0%
um I I think you could probably say that
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
about a lot of contaminants because the
 
00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
sludge has a lot of things in it and um
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
the you know for better for worse um
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
obviously the leate needs to be treated
 
00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:51.880 align:start position:0%
and the receiving stream at the
 
00:49:53.829 --> 00:49:53.839 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant needs the quality of
 
00:49:55.789 --> 00:49:55.799 align:start position:0%
that stream needs to be protected so
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to do whatever treatment
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
they can um and then make sure that
 
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
their treated effluent meets all the
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
standards for discharge to the river and
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
then you have to do something with the
 
00:50:08.829 --> 00:50:08.839 align:start position:0%
sludge and uh the safest and most
 
00:50:10.589 --> 00:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
effective way to manage that sludge at
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
present is to put it back in the
 
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
landfill okay understand
 
00:50:20.510 --> 00:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
um uh represent Murray then represent
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
Penza uh thank you um so one of the
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
things that I was looking at and and I
 
00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:27.720 align:start position:0%
think you know that I've been uh looking
 
00:50:30.270 --> 00:50:30.280 align:start position:0%
into some of the changes you made I
 
00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:35.200 align:start position:0%
think in 8067 L and 80706 and I thought
 
00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
I was confusing the same thing at once
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
but one is post closure and one is
 
00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere else um and it was around
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
incident reporting mhm and so I went
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
back and took a very good look at
 
00:50:47.870 --> 00:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
incident reporting and I understand
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's a different rules section and we
 
00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:51.960 align:start position:0%
could slice this a couple of different
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
ways um the current you know the current
 
00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
suggestion that you all have is to
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
revert or to refer back to the 17 uh
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
1000 section
 
00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
10509 um but previously you had given
 
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:06.720 align:start position:0%
sort of metrics for date and time of
 
00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
notifying like the length of time I
 
00:51:11.549 --> 00:51:11.559 align:start position:0%
think it was said within one week of the
 
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
discovery of an issue um so my question
 
00:51:17.910 --> 00:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
to you is uh when I looked at the 1000
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
section um the language in the 1000
 
00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
section sort of is kind of squishy it's
 
00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
open it says as soon is um I believe it
 
00:51:32.950 --> 00:51:32.960 align:start position:0%
says I'm looking here per becomes aware
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
yeah and so um it's kind of that
 
00:51:38.670 --> 00:51:38.680 align:start position:0%
open-ended sort
 
00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
of situation we find ourselves in so
 
00:51:43.230 --> 00:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
what does that mean does that mean
 
00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:47.559 align:start position:0%
within 24 hours 48 hours you know I or
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
is that immed like immediately someone
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
picks up the phone because it's verbally
 
00:51:53.470 --> 00:51:53.480 align:start position:0%
for the most part here and then there's
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
not much in writing so I just was
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
curious about that so yeah we've talked
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
about this I think our last time so
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for thank you for keeping it
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
on the Forefront
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
um immediately means different things to
 
00:52:10.950 --> 00:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
different people right um we take in um
 
00:52:14.710 --> 00:52:14.720 align:start position:0%
information and incidents uh verbally
 
00:52:17.069 --> 00:52:17.079 align:start position:0%
sort of enough to to understand how long
 
00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
it should take um but that shouldn't be
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
a guessing game for the Pere so like
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
like we mentioned last time our goal is
 
00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
to open that setback up very soon and
 
00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
Des squishy that rule right so it's it's
 
00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
not it isn't helpful to have something
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
that you're kind of bandying back and
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
forth on well did that is that really
 
00:52:35.510 --> 00:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
immediately or not so we're going to
 
00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:36.880 align:start position:0%
work we're going to work to chip away at
 
00:52:38.589 --> 00:52:38.599 align:start position:0%
that rule to make it much clearer for
 
00:52:41.069 --> 00:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
the per and and us us as well so in and
 
00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
may I follow up please so in the
 
00:52:44.789 --> 00:52:44.799 align:start position:0%
drafting process as it exists now I'm
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand when
 
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
I think about registering my thoughts
 
00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:53.720 align:start position:0%
with you all in that way um what is
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
suggested currently is um would you
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
point us to exactly to where you're
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
looking at so I'm sure we're yes thank
 
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:05.400 align:start position:0%
you this was again on that
 
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
um let me go back and look again on the
 
00:53:14.109 --> 00:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
um I think the March 8th 24
 
00:53:20.789 --> 00:53:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:27.309 align:start position:0%
 
8070

00:53:27.309 --> 00:53:27.319 align:start position:0%
8070
 
00:53:30.349 --> 00:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
80706 which says post closure
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
use okay so one of those it says um just
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
that uh e little bracket e if damage
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
occurs to any component of the landfill
 
00:53:43.829 --> 00:53:43.839 align:start position:0%
closure system during the post closure
 
00:53:45.630 --> 00:53:45.640 align:start position:0%
use the d uh the damage shall be
 
00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:48.040 align:start position:0%
reported in a timely manner and the
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
incident reported to the department in
 
00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
in accordance with uh
 
00:53:55.430 --> 00:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
1059 so it's it's all over that sort of
 
00:53:58.630 --> 00:53:58.640 align:start position:0%
section and then the one above and
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
8067 okay right so uh what how I how I
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
how I would read this as a perit is I
 
00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:07.559 align:start position:0%
need to take care of the damage
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
immediately concurrently I need to
 
00:54:12.069 --> 00:54:12.079 align:start position:0%
report it verbally and I need to follow
 
00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
up with an incident report within five
 
00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:17.030 align:start position:0%
up with an incident report within five
working

00:54:17.030 --> 00:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
days so it's not it's not a I have to I
 
00:54:22.270 --> 00:54:22.280 align:start position:0%
have to fix it in a timely manner first
 
00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:24.680 align:start position:0%
and then I get to wait a certain amount
 
00:54:28.150 --> 00:54:28.160 align:start position:0%
of time to verbally report and um report
 
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:30.799 align:start position:0%
in writing do separate so you take care
 
00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
of it at the same time you need to call
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
the department and you need to uh file
 
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
an incident report great okay well I'll
 
00:54:38.190 --> 00:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
share my thoughts in further detail
 
00:54:42.190 --> 00:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks good represent pz
 
00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:44.359 align:start position:0%
okay okay so this is going to go back to
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
the past piece and and what triggered my
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
this question has a lot to do with
 
00:54:52.670 --> 00:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
number 17 on here so as as you may or
 
00:54:55.150 --> 00:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
may not know our entire committee here
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
as well as you know just our full
 
00:54:59.549 --> 00:54:59.559 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture committee
 
00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:01.160 align:start position:0%
and I believe that the Senate has copied
 
00:55:03.549 --> 00:55:03.559 align:start position:0%
on this too um we
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
receive letters that are from that are
 
00:55:08.710 --> 00:55:08.720 align:start position:0%
going to Dees we've received letters
 
00:55:11.309 --> 00:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
that are coming back from Dees so you
 
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
recently sent a letter um to the
 
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
attorney for the North Country Alliance
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
for balance change and I'm going to read
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
this stating that P and other
 
00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
contamination on an offsite at Bethlehem
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
is not coming from an active landfill
 
00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:29.039 align:start position:0%
leak but can be attributed to the
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
countless spills and accidents over the
 
00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:35.440 align:start position:0%
years so my first question is is that
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
supposed to be
 
00:55:39.829 --> 00:55:39.839 align:start position:0%
okay accidents and Spills we're just
 
00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
thinking that that's okay it's not part
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
of the rule making yes it is because it
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
has everything to do it has everything
 
00:55:50.870 --> 00:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
we're so I want to understand because if
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
we're if we're gonna we're gonna add in
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
a requirement here for testing of leech
 
00:56:02.109 --> 00:56:02.119 align:start position:0%
eight and we're going to be looking at P
 
00:56:05.950 --> 00:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
if we if we have folks now in an active
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
landfill status that are saying hello
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
there's a problem and we're just saying
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
oh well that's just from spills that's
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
just from accidents so I just don't
 
00:56:18.589 --> 00:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
understand what are what are we doing
 
00:56:23.109 --> 00:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
we're not investigating it um you know
 
00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:25.680 align:start position:0%
is there a liner leak at NCS why why
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
aren't we looking at that like I just I
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
don't understand that we're we're we're
 
00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:31.880 align:start position:0%
building all of these rules right to
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
have these safeguards in place when we
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
have stuff going on right now so why
 
00:56:39.029 --> 00:56:39.039 align:start position:0%
aren't we looking at stuffs that's going
 
00:56:40.670 --> 00:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
on right
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
now there there are no circumstances
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
where we become aware that there's been
 
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
an accident or a spill or a release
 
00:56:50.589 --> 00:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
where we don't require followup or we
 
00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
don't make the applicant investigate
 
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
that and address the release so that it
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't create a groundwater problem
 
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%
that these rules in fact lay out the
 
00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:04.680 align:start position:0%
provisions for that and so
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
um that is that's not intended in any
 
00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
way to suggest that that's okay it's
 
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
never okay when there's a spill or
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
release of leech eight and when it occur
 
00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
but it does occur and it occurs at all
 
00:57:19.710 --> 00:57:19.720 align:start position:0%
of our
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
facilities at one time or another and
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
when that happens there's a very
 
00:57:26.589 --> 00:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
specific process for invest ating the
 
00:57:29.309 --> 00:57:29.319 align:start position:0%
nature of that um and and getting to the
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
bottom of it making sure that it doesn't
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
happen again and remediating any of the
 
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:39.190 --> 00:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
occurred isn't there fines that are
 
00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
involved in that too there can be
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely so the spill that took place
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
at NCS ncees or whatever in
 
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
2021 there haveen from what I've looked
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
at there's been no fines imposed and all
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
of that that's one of the largest leate
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
spills that we've had in the state I
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
think by far from my investigation we
 
00:58:04.109 --> 00:58:04.119 align:start position:0%
don't discuss our enforcement matters
 
00:58:06.470 --> 00:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
that with
 
00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
that's I'm fine whatever any further
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
questions all
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.029 --> 00:58:30.039 align:start position:0%
yes please thank you Mr chair uh so I
 
00:58:31.829 --> 00:58:31.839 align:start position:0%
did want to ask it was an email I sent
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
out actually on Sunday uh to uh uh
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
direct whims I think actually
 
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
uh I think Sarah uas krent I put on
 
00:58:44.069 --> 00:58:44.079 align:start position:0%
there instead of my apologies uh and
 
00:58:47.190 --> 00:58:47.200 align:start position:0%
also uh you guys on on Sunday and the
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
question was about um and this goes
 
00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
to how we can tell our constituents that
 
00:58:59.710 --> 00:58:59.720 align:start position:0%
this is a process that is driven
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
by public health and the need to protect
 
00:59:04.349 --> 00:59:04.359 align:start position:0%
the environment more than it's driven by
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
economic interests right and then so my
 
00:59:06.359 --> 00:59:07.910 align:start position:0%
economic interests right and then so my
question

00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
was whether
 
00:59:14.309 --> 00:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
the rules that the first draft of rules
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
in October right if we were still
 
00:59:20.589 --> 00:59:20.599 align:start position:0%
looking at those rules if the proposed
 
00:59:23.309 --> 00:59:23.319 align:start position:0%
landfill in Dalton would have been able
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
to meet some in particular the uh
 
00:59:26.559 --> 00:59:27.620 align:start position:0%
to meet some in particular the uh
Hydro

00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:27.630 align:start position:0%
Hydro
 
00:59:27.630 --> 00:59:29.029 align:start position:0%
Hydro
[Music]

00:59:29.029 --> 00:59:29.039 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:59:32.029 --> 00:59:32.039 align:start position:0%
um why is the terms escaping me
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
hydraulic cond thank you thank you
 
00:59:38.309 --> 00:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
hydraulic conductivity uh me standard in
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
that because that's one of the things
 
00:59:41.109 --> 00:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
that has been decreased over the course
 
00:59:42.910 --> 00:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
of the rules because I think it's going
 
00:59:45.349 --> 00:59:45.359 align:start position:0%
to be really hard for us to convince the
 
00:59:47.470 --> 00:59:47.480 align:start position:0%
public especially people in the North
 
00:59:50.829 --> 00:59:50.839 align:start position:0%
Country That That economic interests
 
00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
aren't driving this if you know that GS
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
cell permit would not have qualified
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
under the October rules but would now
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
qualify under current rules as they've
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
been revised especially since as you've
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
pointed out right you those changes have
 
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:13.440 align:start position:0%
been made in large part because you said
 
01:00:16.589 --> 01:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
you listened to the regulated industry
 
01:00:20.190 --> 01:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
one of whom uh is the company who uh has
 
01:00:22.270 --> 01:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
that permit so this this is
 
01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:23.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a product of the fact that
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
you're in the very unenviable situation
 
01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
of being
 
01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
of looking at a permit application at
 
01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
the same time that you're making rules
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
and the public has to know that those
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
two things are not related to each other
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
and the best way that I can think of is
 
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
to ask the question given the permit
 
01:00:41.230 --> 01:00:41.240 align:start position:0%
that is in front of you would that
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
permit have passed under the the
 
01:00:47.390 --> 01:00:47.400 align:start position:0%
stricter rules that were in place in
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
October um and would they uh would they
 
01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:52.359 align:start position:0%
meet especially the hydraulic
 
01:00:55.150 --> 01:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
conductivity standard that is in the
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
rules as we see them now yeah I I don't
 
01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:00.440 align:start position:0%
know the answer to that we heard from a
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
broad spectrum of landfill operators and
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
owners across the state who all
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
uniformly Express concerns about that
 
01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:11.160 align:start position:0%
provision and and the um Express
 
01:01:14.470 --> 01:01:14.480 align:start position:0%
concerns that existing facilities or new
 
01:01:17.750 --> 01:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
facilities could not be um could not be
 
01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
permitted under that provision and so we
 
01:01:24.549 --> 01:01:24.559 align:start position:0%
um we looked at that and and we made the
 
01:01:26.309 --> 01:01:26.319 align:start position:0%
decisions we made about where we thought
 
01:01:29.349 --> 01:01:29.359 align:start position:0%
the proposed rule ought to be um I don't
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
we we don't have yet a complete
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
application for the facility that you
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
referenced um and I don't honestly know
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
you know until we reviewed that and
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
looked at all the data once it's
 
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
complete um I don't know whe whether it
 
01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:46.720 align:start position:0%
would have met that prior draft proposed
 
01:01:51.269 --> 01:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
rule from October or not okay thank
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
you all
 
01:01:56.230 --> 01:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
right thank you so much for your time
 
01:01:58.829 --> 01:01:58.839 align:start position:0%
this is a a lot of a lot of hard work
 
01:02:01.990 --> 01:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for that very helpful for us
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
um still some questions out there but
 
01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:04.510 align:start position:0%
um still some questions out there but
moving

01:02:04.510 --> 01:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
