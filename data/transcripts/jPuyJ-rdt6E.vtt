00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
about that and so we wanted to just we
 

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:49.270 align:start position:0%
about that and so we wanted to just we
wanted<00:20:46.520><c> to</c><00:20:46.760><c> have</c><00:20:46.880><c> it</c><00:20:47.320><c> placed</c><00:20:47.720><c> in</c><00:20:47.880><c> the</c><00:20:48.120><c> per</c><00:20:48.799><c> in</c><00:20:48.919><c> a</c>

wanted to have it placed in the per in a

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
in a spot where it would be very obvious
 

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.149 align:start position:0%
in a spot where it would be very obvious
that<00:20:52.559><c> this</c><00:20:53.000><c> in</c><00:20:53.400><c> this</c><00:20:53.760><c> is</c><00:20:54.200><c> specifically</c>

00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
that this in this is specifically
 

00:20:55.159 --> 00:20:57.470 align:start position:0%
that this in this is specifically
covered<00:20:56.159><c> um</c><00:20:56.320><c> and</c><00:20:56.440><c> I</c><00:20:56.520><c> think</c><00:20:56.679><c> that</c><00:20:56.840><c> makes</c><00:20:57.120><c> sense</c>

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
covered um and I think that makes sense
 

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:59.149 align:start position:0%
covered um and I think that makes sense
because<00:20:57.799><c> it</c><00:20:58.320><c> uh</c>

00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
because it uh
 

00:20:59.159 --> 00:21:01.990 align:start position:0%
because it uh
it<00:20:59.480><c> I</c><00:20:59.559><c> mean</c><00:20:59.799><c> it</c><00:21:00.360><c> my</c><00:21:01.080><c> my</c><00:21:01.520><c> understanding</c><00:21:01.760><c> of</c><00:21:01.880><c> the</c>

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
it I mean it my my understanding of the
 

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.750 align:start position:0%
it I mean it my my understanding of the
law<00:21:02.320><c> is</c><00:21:02.480><c> that</c><00:21:02.679><c> it</c><00:21:03.159><c> it</c><00:21:03.440><c> it</c><00:21:03.559><c> is</c><00:21:03.799><c> covered</c><00:21:04.320><c> but</c><00:21:04.640><c> we</c>

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
law is that it it it is covered but we
 

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.070 align:start position:0%
law is that it it it is covered but we
just<00:21:04.880><c> want</c><00:21:05.000><c> to</c><00:21:05.159><c> make</c><00:21:05.320><c> it</c><00:21:06.039><c> absolutely</c><00:21:06.679><c> clear</c>

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
just want to make it absolutely clear
 

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.350 align:start position:0%
just want to make it absolutely clear
and<00:21:07.200><c> so</c><00:21:07.720><c> you</c><00:21:07.840><c> know</c><00:21:08.080><c> maybe</c><00:21:08.840><c> in</c><00:21:08.960><c> some</c><00:21:09.159><c> sense</c>

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
and so you know maybe in some sense
 

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.149 align:start position:0%
and so you know maybe in some sense
we're<00:21:09.520><c> being</c><00:21:09.679><c> a</c><00:21:09.799><c> little</c><00:21:10.039><c> repetitive</c><00:21:10.640><c> but</c><00:21:11.000><c> in</c>

00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
we're being a little repetitive but in
 

00:21:11.159 --> 00:21:12.710 align:start position:0%
we're being a little repetitive but in
this<00:21:11.520><c> in</c><00:21:11.640><c> this</c><00:21:11.799><c> circumstance</c><00:21:12.400><c> I</c><00:21:12.480><c> think</c><00:21:12.600><c> it</c>

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
this in this circumstance I think it
 

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:16.190 align:start position:0%
this in this circumstance I think it
makes<00:21:13.000><c> sense</c><00:21:13.960><c> um</c><00:21:14.200><c> with</c><00:21:14.400><c> that</c><00:21:14.799><c> I'm</c><00:21:15.799><c> we</c><00:21:15.960><c> have</c><00:21:16.080><c> a</c>

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
makes sense um with that I'm we have a
 

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.909 align:start position:0%
makes sense um with that I'm we have a

01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as well and I think
 

01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:09.310 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as well and I think
should<01:58:07.679><c> be</c><01:58:07.800><c> able</c><01:58:08.040><c> to</c><01:58:08.199><c> make</c><01:58:08.480><c> public</c><01:58:08.760><c> records</c>

01:58:09.310 --> 01:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
should be able to make public records
 

01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:11.990 align:start position:0%
should be able to make public records

01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
requests I I do think that this could be
 

01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.669 align:start position:0%
requests I I do think that this could be
construed<01:58:12.880><c> as</c><01:58:13.239><c> potentially</c><01:58:14.079><c> uh</c><01:58:14.199><c> excluding</c>

01:58:14.669 --> 01:58:14.679 align:start position:0%

01:58:14.679 --> 01:58:17.149 align:start position:0%
construed as potentially uh excluding

01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
them from making requests and so I think
 

01:58:17.159 --> 01:58:20.350 align:start position:0%
them from making requests and so I think
at<01:58:17.320><c> its</c><01:58:17.560><c> core</c><01:58:17.960><c> I</c><01:58:18.040><c> think</c><01:58:18.560><c> what</c><01:58:18.719><c> HB</c><01:58:19.159><c> 74</c><01:58:19.800><c> could</c><01:58:19.960><c> be</c>

01:58:20.350 --> 01:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
at its core I think what HB 74 could be
 

01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:23.629 align:start position:0%
at its core I think what HB 74 could be

01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
not saying intentionally but it would
 

01:58:24.960 --> 01:58:27.189 align:start position:0%
not saying intentionally but it would

01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%

a little more far-reaching than uh you
 

02:16:14.599 --> 02:16:17.549 align:start position:0%
a little more far-reaching than uh you
anticipate<02:16:15.599><c> oh</c><02:16:15.840><c> I</c><02:16:16.000><c> I</c><02:16:16.079><c> should</c><02:16:16.280><c> have</c><02:16:16.440><c> a</c><02:16:16.599><c> question</c>

02:16:17.549 --> 02:16:17.559 align:start position:0%
anticipate oh I I should have a question
 

02:16:17.559 --> 02:16:20.669 align:start position:0%
anticipate oh I I should have a question
right<02:16:18.559><c> isn't</c><02:16:18.960><c> isn't</c><02:16:19.280><c> that</c><02:16:19.520><c> true</c><02:16:20.239><c> isn't</c><02:16:20.520><c> that</c>

05:02:15.430 --> 05:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
don't I mean the biggest thing on it is
 

05:02:15.440 --> 05:02:17.830 align:start position:0%
don't I mean the biggest thing on it is
has<05:02:15.600><c> the</c><05:02:15.798><c> patron</c><05:02:16.200><c> code</c><05:02:16.520><c> on</c>

has the patron code on
 

05:02:17.840 --> 05:02:20.948 align:start position:0%
has the patron code on
it<05:02:18.840><c> so</c><05:02:19.160><c> it's</c><05:02:19.400><c> it's</c><05:02:19.520><c> a</c><05:02:19.680><c> code</c><05:02:19.958><c> that</c>

05:02:20.948 --> 05:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
it so it's it's a code that
 

05:02:20.958 --> 05:02:24.430 align:start position:0%
it so it's it's a code that
identifies<05:02:21.958><c> that's</c><05:02:22.240><c> very</c><05:02:22.638><c> specific</c><05:02:23.320><c> to</c><05:02:24.160><c> the</c>

hamstring them at all and so I'm kind of
going<06:03:14.718><c> to</c><06:03:14.920><c> ignore</c><06:03:15.400><c> that</c><06:03:15.638><c> and</c><06:03:15.798><c> what</c><06:03:15.958><c> if</c><06:03:16.160><c> they</c><06:03:16.718><c> do</c>

06:03:20.468 --> 06:03:20.478 align:start position:0%
uh just disregard the uh law so there
 

06:03:20.478 --> 06:03:22.430 align:start position:0%
uh just disregard the uh law so there
should<06:03:20.680><c> be</c><06:03:20.840><c> a</c><06:03:21.040><c> penalty</c><06:03:21.878><c> it</c><06:03:21.958><c> doesn't</c><06:03:22.200><c> have</c><06:03:22.320><c> to</c>

06:03:22.430 --> 06:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
should be a penalty it doesn't have to
 

06:03:22.440 --> 06:03:25.628 align:start position:0%
should be a penalty it doesn't have to
be<06:03:22.600><c> a</c><06:03:22.760><c> huge</c><06:03:23.080><c> one</c><06:03:23.478><c> but</c><06:03:24.040><c> bills</c><06:03:24.680><c> that</c><06:03:25.000><c> don't</c><06:03:25.280><c> have</c>

06:03:25.628 --> 06:03:25.638 align:start position:0%
be a huge one but bills that don't have
 

06:03:25.638 --> 06:03:30.030 align:start position:0%
be a huge one but bills that don't have

06:03:33.070 --> 06:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
employees uh they're often ignored so I
 

06:03:33.080 --> 06:03:34.590 align:start position:0%
employees uh they're often ignored so I
think<06:03:33.280><c> there</c><06:03:33.400><c> should</c><06:03:33.600><c> be</c><06:03:33.718><c> a</c><06:03:33.840><c> little</c><06:03:34.120><c> penalty</c>

06:03:34.590 --> 06:03:34.600 align:start position:0%
think there should be a little penalty
 

06:03:34.600 --> 06:03:37.230 align:start position:0%
think there should be a little penalty
in<06:03:34.798><c> here</c><06:03:35.000><c> if</c><06:03:35.120><c> they</c><06:03:35.280><c> disregard</c><06:03:36.040><c> the</c><06:03:36.160><c> law</c><06:03:36.878><c> and</c>

06:03:37.230 --> 06:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
in here if they disregard the law and
 

06:03:37.240 --> 06:03:39.270 align:start position:0%
in here if they disregard the law and

06:22:13.190 --> 06:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they have to follow up with the

06:22:15.718 --> 06:22:17.788 align:start position:0%
parent and determine whether or not they

06:22:17.788 --> 06:22:17.798 align:start position:0%

06:23:13.680 --> 06:23:17.548 align:start position:0%
know as far as as the kids I don't know
if<06:23:13.840><c> I</c><06:23:14.000><c> see</c><06:23:14.600><c> that</c><06:23:15.200><c> parents</c><06:23:16.160><c> doing</c><06:23:16.600><c> that</c>

06:23:17.548 --> 06:23:17.558 align:start position:0%
if I see that parents doing that
 

06:23:17.558 --> 06:23:19.910 align:start position:0%
if I see that parents doing that
so<06:23:18.558><c> I</c><06:23:18.760><c> I</c><06:23:18.840><c> don't</c><06:23:19.120><c> I'm</c><06:23:19.240><c> not</c><06:23:19.360><c> sure</c><06:23:19.558><c> there's</c><06:23:19.718><c> a</c>

06:23:19.910 --> 06:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
so I I don't I'm not sure there's a
 

06:23:19.920 --> 06:23:21.910 align:start position:0%
so I I don't I'm not sure there's a
question<06:23:20.240><c> there</c><06:23:20.798><c> maybe</c><06:23:21.120><c> maybe</c><06:23:21.320><c> there</c><06:23:21.440><c> is</c><06:23:21.840><c> I</c>

06:23:21.910 --> 06:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
question there maybe maybe there is I
 

06:23:21.920 --> 06:23:24.110 align:start position:0%
question there maybe maybe there is I
think<06:23:22.040><c> it's</c><06:23:22.160><c> a</c><06:23:22.240><c> more</c><06:23:22.440><c> ter</c><06:23:23.120><c> ter</c><06:23:23.520><c> approach</c><06:23:23.840><c> but</c><06:23:23.958><c> I</c>

06:23:24.110 --> 06:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
think it's a more ter ter approach but I
 

06:23:24.120 --> 06:23:26.628 align:start position:0%
think it's a more ter ter approach but I
I<06:23:24.160><c> mean</c><06:23:24.280><c> I</c><06:23:24.638><c> understand</c><06:23:24.958><c> the</c><06:23:25.958><c> making</c><06:23:26.360><c> the</c><06:23:26.440><c> kids</c>

06:23:26.628 --> 06:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
I mean I understand the making the kids
 

06:23:26.638 --> 06:23:28.190 align:start position:0%
I mean I understand the making the kids
are<06:23:26.958><c> like</c><06:23:27.200><c> when</c><06:23:27.360><c> the</c><06:23:27.478><c> kids</c><06:23:27.680><c> go</c><06:23:27.840><c> into</c><06:23:28.040><c> the</c>

06:23:28.190 --> 06:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
are like when the kids go into the

are like when the kids go into the
