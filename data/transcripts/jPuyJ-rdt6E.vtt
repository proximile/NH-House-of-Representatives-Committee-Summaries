and uh uh we just couldn't be helped so
 
00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:38.680 align:start position:0%
first um before we begin I'm going to
 
00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
ask uh representative Andrew if she
 
00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:44.720 align:start position:0%

Allegiance I PL aliance to the flag of

Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liy and
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.910 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.430 align:start position:0%
and
um

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
yes before you start could I ask you a
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
question of course thank you very much
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
um it's come to my attention that on
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
Monday um when we have a hearing on a
 
00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:26.240 align:start position:0%
bill that um there is going to be an
 
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
amendment um that as of a I would call
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
non gerain but apparently the speaker
 
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't um that will go to the committee
 
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
and I wonder
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
if um you will be making that public
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
before the hearing so that people who
 
00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
come to
 
00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
testify will know what um is likely to
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
transpire uh yes the answer to that
 
00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:01.240 align:start position:0%
question is yes um and um my
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
my understanding um was a little bit
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
different than than than yours and there
 
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
that um not that the speaker had
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
determined that the amendment was
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
Germain but that um it that uh we needed
 
00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
that we would have a because it was non-
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
gerain we would have a hearing on on the
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
amendment as well as on the bill and we
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
will do both of those on Monday um but
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
but the answer
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
to your question is yes I think the the
 
00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:34.279 align:start position:0%
rules require that there be that you
 
00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
know if there's if there's a uh an
 
00:12:38.829 --> 00:12:38.839 align:start position:0%
amendment that is non main that it' be
 
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
available um I think 24 hours in advance
 
00:12:43.949 --> 00:12:43.959 align:start position:0%
and yes that will so yes it will be it
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
will be available and so that will
 
00:12:47.949 --> 00:12:47.959 align:start position:0%
appear also in the calendar that comes
 
00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
out tomorrow it will appear in the
 
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:51.320 align:start position:0%
calendar yes thank you very much I
 
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:53.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate that Mr chair thank you so
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
the first bill we're going to uh uh open
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
the hearing on is um House Bill 6 six
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
and since I'm the prime sponsor I'm
 
00:13:03.269 --> 00:13:03.279 align:start position:0%
going to leave this seat and turn it
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%

00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
66 thank you uh Mr chair members of the
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
committee um I
 
00:13:51.269 --> 00:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
uh am the prime sponsor of this bill and
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
um as you will see this bill is
 
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.509 align:start position:0%
um as you will see this bill is
designed

00:13:56.509 --> 00:13:56.519 align:start position:0%
designed
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
um to accomplish a a a couple of things
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:14:05.350 --> 00:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
primary thing that it is designed to do
 
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
is to remove the word
 
00:14:12.389 --> 00:14:12.399 align:start position:0%
citizen um where it appears uh in the in
 
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
the right to no law and to replace that
 
00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
with the word with uh the term any
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
person um so that um it would permit
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
any it would permit any person to make a
 
00:14:29.829 --> 00:14:29.839 align:start position:0%
request for uh
 
00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
the any information that is subject to
 
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
um the right to no law um I should
 
00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:40.470 align:start position:0%
um the right to no law um I should
note

00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
note
 
00:14:44.189 --> 00:14:44.199 align:start position:0%
that although the right to no law as it
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
has existed for a number of years in a
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:52.360 align:start position:0%
places um which are specifically you can
 
00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
see that those places in the bill
 
00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
because I replace citizen with any
 
00:14:58.590 --> 00:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
person um in the in the proposed
 
00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.829 align:start position:0%
person um in the in the proposed
legislation

00:14:59.829 --> 00:14:59.839 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:15:03.870 --> 00:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
but um although the word citizen is used
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
as a at a couple of places in the bill
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
um it's important to understand that
 
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
until an issue
 
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:16.759 align:start position:0%
arose couple of years ago I think
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
regarding um Rochester where where a um
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
uh the the municipality took the
 
00:15:27.829 --> 00:15:27.839 align:start position:0%
position that someone was not entitled
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
to uh received certain records because
 
00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
they were not a citizen of New Hampshire
 
00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
um that
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
issue had never as far as I'm aware and
 
00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
I I think there are other Witnesses who
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
may have done more research than on this
 
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:43.920 align:start position:0%
than I have but that it had never been
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
an issue about um who was entitled to uh
 
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.110 align:start position:0%
an issue about um who was entitled to uh
request

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
request
 
00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
information um and as I understand it
 
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
and again I stand to be corrected on
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
this I but my understanding is that in
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
the past there have been requests made
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
particularly by business interests who
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
were out of state requested information
 
00:16:08.309 --> 00:16:08.319 align:start position:0%
from some either from the state or some
 
00:16:11.189 --> 00:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
municipality for some purpose you know
 
00:16:13.389 --> 00:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
some legitimate business purpose but
 
00:16:15.670 --> 00:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
they were out of state at anyway it had
 
00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:18.399 align:start position:0%
not been a it had not been an issue so
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
this is designed to um remove the the uh
 
00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
requirement of citizenship and and and
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
incidentally I should just point out
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:16:31.749 --> 00:16:31.759 align:start position:0%
where the where the current law uses the
 
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
term citizen it doesn't say what that
 
00:16:37.269 --> 00:16:37.279 align:start position:0%
means is it a citizen of the
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
municipality which um uh you know that's
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
one possible interpretation is it a
 
00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
citizen of the State of New Hampshire is
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
it a citizen of the United
 
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
States I mean IO or I suppose I suppose
 
00:16:52.069 --> 00:16:52.079 align:start position:0%
some people could say is it a citizen of
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
the world if that if if the court were
 
00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
to interpret it that way uh then we I
 
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
guess maybe we wouldn't have to have
 
00:17:02.189 --> 00:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
this change but um I I think it's um
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
it's not at all clear what the word
 
00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
citizen um was intended to mean um the
 
00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
other thing that this bill uh does is it
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
um basically says that if you are
 
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.870 align:start position:0%
um basically says that if you are
requesting

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
information um you you as the
 
00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
requester kind of have control over the
 
00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079 align:start position:0%
way you want the information and as long
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
as and I'm I'm
 
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of par I'm I'm summarizing here
 
00:17:33.630 --> 00:17:33.640 align:start position:0%
rather than quoting the language of the
 
00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
bill but it basically says you as a
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
requestor have the right to to ask that
 
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
the information be provided in the
 
00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
format that you want it so if you want
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
it electronically you can ask for that
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
if you want it in paper I guess you can
 
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
ask for that too um the only restriction
 
00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
is that the municipality or the or the
 
00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:57.640 align:start position:0%
respond the respondent governmental body
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
um does not have to provide it in a
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
format that they don't
 
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
have um or that is kind of unusual or if
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
the request is uh would be unduly
 
00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
burdensome or wouldn't somehow uh uh
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
pose a threat to uh the you know the the
 
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the record of your
 
00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:23.799 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping system so if any of those
 
00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
situations exist then the municipality
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
can legitimately say no where you know
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
you've asked for in in this format but
 
00:18:33.149 --> 00:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
we can't do that uh for legitimate
 
00:18:35.710 --> 00:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
reasons of security or it's unduly
 
00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
burdensome what or whatever but unless
 
00:18:39.190 --> 00:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
they can say that then they have to
 
00:18:42.029 --> 00:18:42.039 align:start position:0%
comply with your request and I think the
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
concern there is um
 
00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
it it shouldn't be the case that a
 
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.590 align:start position:0%
it it shouldn't be the case that a
governmental

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
governmental
 
00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
body um can kind of discourage you
 
00:19:00.590 --> 00:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
a a a request by basically saying well
 
00:19:05.789 --> 00:19:05.799 align:start position:0%
if you sure you can get this information
 
00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:08.919 align:start position:0%
but you have to come to the municipality
 
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
you can't ask for it electronically you
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
have to come to the municipality uh to
 
00:19:17.350 --> 00:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
make the request or um we're only going
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
to you know we're only going to give it
 
00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:21.200 align:start position:0%
to you in hard copy and it's going to
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
we're charging you whatever that you
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
know whatever the charge can be per page
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
um whereas it would be a lot less L
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
expensive and uh and a lot more
 
00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
convenient if they could just request it
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
um electronically so that's where the
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
other thing that it's designed to
 
00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:40.039 align:start position:0%
accomplish and then the third um thing
 
00:19:40.039 --> 00:19:41.310 align:start position:0%
accomplish and then the third um thing
is

00:19:41.310 --> 00:19:41.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:44.880 align:start position:0%
um and this this is at the
 
00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:48.200 align:start position:0%
um uh this I included this at the
 
00:19:50.789 --> 00:19:50.799 align:start position:0%
suggestion of uh my colleague who behind
 
00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
me representative Edwards um to
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
specifically put in the sections that um
 
00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
you you you'll see it in a a specific
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
reference to that among the documents
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
that have to be provided are preliminary
 
00:20:10.029 --> 00:20:10.039 align:start position:0%
drafts that are circulated to a quorum
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
or a majority of the public body now I
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
should point out there that this is not
 
00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:21.799 align:start position:0%
really even if we didn't have that even
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
if we didn't put this language in there
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
are there's other language in the right
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
to no law even at present that basically
 
00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
um would require that to be provided
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
anyway but apparently it has um there's
 
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:38.590 align:start position:0%
anyway but apparently it has um there's
been

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
some uh there's been some uh question
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
about that and so we wanted to just we
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
wanted to have it placed in the per in a
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
in a spot where it would be very obvious
 
00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:55.159 align:start position:0%
that this in this is specifically
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
covered um and I think that makes sense
 
00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
because it uh
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
it I mean it my my understanding of the
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
law is that it it it is covered but we
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
just want to make it absolutely clear
 
00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
and so you know maybe in some sense
 
00:21:11.149 --> 00:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
we're being a little repetitive but in
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
this in this circumstance I think it
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
makes sense um with that I'm we have a
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
busy day and I'm going to shut up and
 
00:21:19.549 --> 00:21:19.559 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to take any questions that
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
anyone might have thank you any
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:30.110 --> 00:21:30.120 align:start position:0%
perch hit the butt thank you Mr chair
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you representative for
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question um actually I have
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
two but my first question is just to be
 
00:21:41.110 --> 00:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
clear on the any person and
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that um under current
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
theory corporations or persons and and
 
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
the like there's no limitation then on
 
00:21:57.669 --> 00:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
anyone worldwide anywhere um making a
 
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
request does person doesn't have to show
 
00:22:03.390 --> 00:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
up could be a as much a bot Farm in
 
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
Russia could be you know somebody
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere there's no limitations is that
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
right no that's true and you know that I
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
I I I you're you're MIM you're you're
 
00:22:16.990 --> 00:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
sort of uh touching on a discussion I
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
had with my colleague behind me just
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
before before we got started this
 
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
morning it's true I mean um
 
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
and you know I I suppose that that could
 
00:22:34.029 --> 00:22:34.039 align:start position:0%
be um a concern I I guess what I would
 
00:22:36.549 --> 00:22:36.559 align:start position:0%
what I would say in response to that is
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
this you know
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
if if we were to say
 
00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:45.149 align:start position:0%
if if we were to say
instead

00:22:45.149 --> 00:22:45.159 align:start position:0%
instead
 
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
um citizen means citizen of New
 
00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:49.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and only a citizen of New
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or a domiciliary of New
 
00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:55.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I I wonder whether that
 
00:22:57.269 --> 00:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
would really
 
00:23:00.269 --> 00:23:00.279 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
much of a restriction in other words if
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
you had you know the bot the bot Farm in
 
00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:09.919 align:start position:0%
uh uh the Bad actors in Russia or China
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
or the Middle East or whatever that
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to request some information from
 
00:23:18.950 --> 00:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
some municipality in in New Hampshire um
 
00:23:20.990 --> 00:23:21.000 align:start position:0%
would they really be deter I mean would
 
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
would they really not be able to find
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
some you know somebody some dupe in New
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to be able to uh make the
 
00:23:32.029 --> 00:23:32.039 align:start position:0%
claim for them um it seems to me you
 
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
know it would that be a a real
 
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
restriction a real limitation you know a
 
00:23:40.029 --> 00:23:40.039 align:start position:0%
real protection against those kind of
 
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
Bad actors I tend to think not more
 
00:23:45.149 --> 00:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
importantly I think this is the the
 
00:23:47.029 --> 00:23:47.039 align:start position:0%
other thing I think is really important
 
00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
is even though the
 
00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
only time that this issue of citizenship
 
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
was raised was as I said was in this
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
Rochester case I'm not aware that over
 
00:24:00.909 --> 00:24:00.919 align:start position:0%
you know however many years the right to
 
00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
no law has been in effect we've had that
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
kind of problem that you
 
00:24:10.269 --> 00:24:10.279 align:start position:0%
know um Bad actors in Syria or China or
 
00:24:13.350 --> 00:24:13.360 align:start position:0%
whatever have been requesting
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
information uh from you know
 
00:24:19.230 --> 00:24:19.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities so that's that's that's
 
00:24:23.230 --> 00:24:23.240 align:start position:0%
probably too long an answer yes good uh
 
00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
just just a second quick question and
 
00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
related to that is is the the funding
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
there's no limit on the cost of this
 
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
um Bill uh which I gather will be born
 
00:24:43.389 --> 00:24:43.399 align:start position:0%
by municipalities and towns rather than
 
00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:47.000 align:start position:0%
the state uh do you have since the
 
00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:50.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal note kind
 
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
of shrugs and says we can't even
 
00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:54.520 align:start position:0%
calculate how much is this is going to
 
00:24:57.909 --> 00:24:57.919 align:start position:0%
cost do you have any sense of of what uh
 
00:24:57.919 --> 00:24:59.110 align:start position:0%
cost do you have any sense of of what uh
addition

00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
addition
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
tax burden were being PL will be placed
 
00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
on municipalities and towns you know I I
 
00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
I guess again I come back to i
 
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.510 align:start position:0%
I guess again I come back to i
i

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
in given that there has never been as
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
again other than this Rochester case
 
00:25:20.389 --> 00:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
there has never been an issue about
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
limiting the
 
00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:24.630 align:start position:0%
limiting the
requesters

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
requesters
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
um I I'm not sure that there really is
 
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
is a basis to say this is going to cost
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
you know either municipalities or the
 
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
state um more money in fact you know in
 
00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:39.559 align:start position:0%
many in in some ways it may be that it
 
00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
would be by making it more by allowing
 
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities to to respond in more
 
00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
efficient ways um it may be that it
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
actually saves money I don't know I the
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
short answer is I really don't know
 
00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.149 align:start position:0%
short answer is I really don't know
thank

00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
you I I'll save it for the next
 
00:25:58.830 --> 00:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
chair thank you um representative for
 
00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question um my question is
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
around the impetus of adding on um page
 
00:26:07.389 --> 00:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
one line 17 the preliminary draft
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
circulated um can you speak to that I
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
guess I guess I want to give an example
 
00:26:12.470 --> 00:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
like um I'm chair of the golf sound
 
00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
budget committee and we might have
 
00:26:15.789 --> 00:26:15.799 align:start position:0%
circulated a draft of like the
 
00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.240 align:start position:0%
presentation we are going to distribute
 
00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:20.320 align:start position:0%
during a public hearing and we may not
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
want to have disclosed it right away
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
seeing how it might have incorrect
 
00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
information or you know was a working
 
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
document um so my concern is that
 
00:26:31.830 --> 00:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
it it may add to confusion for members
 
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
of the public to have these working
 
00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
documents disclosed um so I'm wondering
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
what the impotence was behind adding
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
that part of into the Bild I I think
 
00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
that the um and I I'll I it may be that
 
00:26:46.029 --> 00:26:46.039 align:start position:0%
the that representative Edwards can give
 
00:26:48.029 --> 00:26:48.039 align:start position:0%
you more detail than I can but my
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
understanding is and I think he's
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
correct on this that that
 
00:26:55.549 --> 00:26:55.559 align:start position:0%
that those materials would already be
 
00:26:57.909 --> 00:26:57.919 align:start position:0%
included under the existing language of
 
00:26:59.909 --> 00:26:59.919 align:start position:0%
the right to no law not and I'm not
 
00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:01.240 align:start position:0%
please understand I'm not saying that
 
00:27:03.029 --> 00:27:03.039 align:start position:0%
there's some language that says
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
preliminary drafts circulated to the
 
00:27:07.389 --> 00:27:07.399 align:start position:0%
major but I think there is language that
 
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
says if if there if documents that are
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
um provided to uh the majority of a
 
00:27:19.389 --> 00:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
committee are are um are covered by the
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
right to no law um and so I think you
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
know could there be I don't s i don't
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
suggest that there couldn't be some
 
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
um people who might be confused with a
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
preliminary draft if it was later
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
changed but you know
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
that's I guess that's the burden is on
 
00:27:41.230 --> 00:27:41.240 align:start position:0%
them to make sure that you know that
 
00:27:43.830 --> 00:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
they're that it's a final version before
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
they uh if they're gonna you know take a
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:52.039 align:start position:0%
something any other qu
 
00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
questions n seeing none thank you very
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%

00:28:58.990 --> 00:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
Johnston thank you Mr chairman uh my
 
00:29:00.909 --> 00:29:00.919 align:start position:0%
name is Cordell Johnston I'm an attorney
 
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
in private practice uh I represent a
 
00:29:07.549 --> 00:29:07.559 align:start position:0%
small number of municipalities my my law
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
practice is limited to representing
 
00:29:10.110 --> 00:29:10.120 align:start position:0%
cities and
 
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
towns um I also represent the New
 
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire City and City and town clerks
 
00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
Association although I am not here on
 
00:29:20.029 --> 00:29:20.039 align:start position:0%
their behalf I am not their lobbyist
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
they have someone else who does that I'm
 
00:29:25.909 --> 00:29:25.919 align:start position:0%
speaking only for myself
 
00:29:28.549 --> 00:29:28.559 align:start position:0%
um and I
 
00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:32.200 align:start position:0%
oppose uh most of what's in this bill my
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
concern is not so much the part about
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
changing every citizen to any person
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
although I would prefer that that stay
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
the way it is my concern is the part
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
about having to deliver govern
 
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
governmental records to anyone who asks
 
00:29:51.909 --> 00:29:51.919 align:start position:0%
for them because right now um there's
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
been a few references to people out of
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
state making requests for governmental
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
records and and when they do it usually
 
00:30:01.430 --> 00:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the purpose of
 
00:30:03.389 --> 00:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
the right to no law which is open
 
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
government usually it's some business
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
entity that is trying to drum up
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
business the dog food company wants a
 
00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:13.960 align:start position:0%
list of the people who have licensed
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
dogs or the real estate company wants a
 
00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
list of real estate
 
00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
transactions sometimes it's a political
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
thing I've seen requests from both the
 
00:30:27.509 --> 00:30:27.519 align:start position:0%
Democratic and Republican parties uh
 
00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:29.799 align:start position:0%
sort of on fishing
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
Expeditions with a law firm from
 
00:30:34.029 --> 00:30:34.039 align:start position:0%
Washington asking for all kinds of
 
00:30:34.039 --> 00:30:35.430 align:start position:0%
Washington asking for all kinds of
election

00:30:35.430 --> 00:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:39.320 align:start position:0%
information um and under the current
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
law the response is what I tell my
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
clients is you are welcome to get this
 
00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
information it is available at the Town
 
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:52.760 align:start position:0%
Hall and you can come and get it you
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
know these are our hours that almost
 
00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
always puts an end to it because it
 
00:30:59.629 --> 00:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
really is a fishing
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
Expedition uh the local residents who
 
00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:04.480 align:start position:0%
are actually interested in open
 
00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
government want to know what their town
 
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
is up to they have no problem coming to
 
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:10.840 align:start position:0%
town hall and getting and getting the
 
00:31:13.070 --> 00:31:13.080 align:start position:0%
records and in fact in most Cas or in a
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
lot of cases the town will just email it
 
00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:17.440 align:start position:0%
to them just as as a courtesy but they
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
are not required to do that the current
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
law says you can come to town hall and
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
get it and my concern is that under this
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
bill lines
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
27 to 28 on page one the I think it's
 
00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
page one yeah the public body your
 
00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039 align:start position:0%
agency shall provide such records
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
electronically or by
 
00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
mail so uh Mr chairman you talked about
 
00:31:47.149 --> 00:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
uh making it easier because they they
 
00:31:49.950 --> 00:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
can send it electronically if I'm the
 
00:31:52.629 --> 00:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
the bad actor in Russia or wherever I
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
can say I want you to mail these to me I
 
00:31:57.549 --> 00:31:57.559 align:start position:0%
want the selectman's minutes for the
 
00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
last 20 years and the town clerk is
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
going to have to make hard copies of
 
00:32:05.310 --> 00:32:05.320 align:start position:0%
those minutes box them up and send them
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
to me in Russia or Bina fazo or wherever
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
I am that's a huge burden and those
 
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
requests from out of state or even out
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
of country they don't come in every day
 
00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
but they come in fairly often I've seen
 
00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:21.159 align:start position:0%
that for all of the towns that I
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
represent so that that is a huge burden
 
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:29.440 align:start position:0%
and and I urge you not to do that um
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
as I said you know the purpose of the
 
00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:32.919 align:start position:0%
right to no law and the Supreme Court
 
00:32:34.629 --> 00:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
has said this on many occasions is to
 
00:32:37.029 --> 00:32:37.039 align:start position:0%
enable citiz citizens to know what their
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
government is up to it's not to Pro be a
 
00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:44.519 align:start position:0%
research arm for a business or you know
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
a doctoral student who's working on his

thesis and want wants to do research
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
about town meeting law in New Hampshire

for his PhD at the University of Oregon
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
um when those out of state
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
interests are as I say on a fishing
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
expedition to see oh what's the law in
 
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.110 align:start position:0%
expedition to see oh what's the law in
New

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.120 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire please don't make local
 
00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:11.559 align:start position:0%
government workers don't make the town
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
clerk or the Town Administrator go back
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
into their documents and pull those out
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
and make copies of them and S send them
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
to to uh these people who have no
 
00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:25.000 align:start position:0%
interest in in the town the actual town
 
00:33:28.389 --> 00:33:28.399 align:start position:0%
government um
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
I I would Al also comment
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
um if I want if I'm a citizen and I want
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
these records and I want them
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
electronically I already have the right
 
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
to get them electronically if if they
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
exist electronically the Supreme Court
 
00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
has said if they exist electronically
 
00:33:47.669 --> 00:33:47.679 align:start position:0%
and it's reasonably possible to provide
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
them electronically and the person asks
 
00:33:51.789 --> 00:33:51.799 align:start position:0%
for them electronically you have to give
 
00:33:51.799 --> 00:33:52.789 align:start position:0%
for them electronically you have to give
them

00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:33:55.029 --> 00:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
electronically um so I I don't think
 
00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
that's a problem the last thing I would
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
say is agree the part about preliminary
 
00:34:03.389 --> 00:34:03.399 align:start position:0%
drafts I think it's very clear those are
 
00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
already subject to disclosure if they
 
00:34:07.869 --> 00:34:07.879 align:start position:0%
went to a quorum or a majority of the
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
body uh representative Alexander's
 
00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:13.399 align:start position:0%
concern I understand it when when one of
 
00:34:16.349 --> 00:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
my towns ask me about that I say don't
 
00:34:18.109 --> 00:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
send it if you don't want to disclose it
 
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
don't give it to a majority of the body
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
as long as it's just a draft and it
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't go to a majority it's not
 
00:34:26.310 --> 00:34:26.320 align:start position:0%
disclosable but if it goes to a majority
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
it is so I don't think you need that
 
00:34:30.990 --> 00:34:31.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't really hurt to put that in there
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
other than I think it clutters up the
 
00:34:36.710 --> 00:34:36.720 align:start position:0%
law and I I'm not in favor of adding
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
stuff that you don't need um it wouldn't
 
00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
be the end of the world if you had that
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
but I just don't think it's necessary
 
00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:45.320 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have and I'd be happy
 
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
to answer questions thank you questions
 
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
for yes representative
 
00:34:53.149 --> 00:34:53.159 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you very much Mr chair um uh
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
welcome um Mr Johnson it's good to see
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
you again we haven't seen you for a
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
while since you've left the municipal
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
Association nice to see you those of you
 
00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
who I used to know uh and um I think
 
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
you've had enough experience here to to
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
know that one thing we do not do is
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
ascribe to
 
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
others um their
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
motives as to why they are doing
 
00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
something and uh a lot of your testimony
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
was based on ascribing the the motives
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
of others whoop excuse me
 
00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:35.240 align:start position:0%
um I am particularly interested in
 
00:35:37.870 --> 00:35:37.880 align:start position:0%
knowing were you still at the municipal
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
Association when the Rochester case
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
unfolded no no I was not and do you have
 
00:35:47.190 --> 00:35:47.200 align:start position:0%
if could I just ask one more of course
 
00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:53.720 align:start position:0%
do you have any um uh opinions on um the
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh decision of the court on the RO
 
00:36:02.109 --> 00:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
case I actually did that go to the
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court okay so I so I don't know
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
that much about it but I my what I heard
 
00:36:12.190 --> 00:36:12.200 align:start position:0%
is I think it was a newspaper maybe
 
00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:14.240 align:start position:0%
based in Maine that wanted the
 
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
information and the city said you're not
 
00:36:18.430 --> 00:36:18.440 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire resident so you don't
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
get it um and and I may be wrong about
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
that people behind me may know more
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
about it than than I do I'll tell you if
 
00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
if I had been advising them I would have
 
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
said just give it to them you know it's
 
00:36:36.430 --> 00:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a big deal um and I mean I
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
don't have any problem at all with the
 
00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
idea that the Boston Globe or the
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
Burlington Free Press or the main
 
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
Portland whatever it is should be
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
getting asking information and getting
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
it about um government in New Hampshire
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
they cover New Hampshire and that's fine
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
um so as I say my concern is not so much
 
00:37:00.230 --> 00:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
the any person it's that you have to
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
deliver it to them and if I if I got one
 
00:37:05.109 --> 00:37:05.119 align:start position:0%
of my towns got that request from a
 
00:37:07.910 --> 00:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
newspaper in Maine I would probably say
 
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:10.040 align:start position:0%
just send it to them but if they want
 
00:37:12.589 --> 00:37:12.599 align:start position:0%
I'd say tell them it's here you can come
 
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
and get it but I wouldn't deny the
 
00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
request going back to motives I agree we
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
don't need to ascribe motives my only
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
point is if if if you're going to
 
00:37:27.630 --> 00:37:27.640 align:start position:0%
require uh Town employees to send stuff
 
00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:30.079 align:start position:0%
to anyone who asks for it anywhere in
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
the world that's a big that's a big
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
burden thank you other questions yes
 
00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:39.560 align:start position:0%
representative peternell and thank you
 
00:37:41.550 --> 00:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and thank you for answering
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
my question um my concern is we have a I
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
live on lake wiip pasak and not on the
 
00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
lake but near the lake and in a town on
 
00:37:54.670 --> 00:37:54.680 align:start position:0%
the lake and we have a lot of people who
 
00:37:56.630 --> 00:37:56.640 align:start position:0%
have second homes and things like that
 
00:37:59.510 --> 00:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
would there be a def defition of um
 
00:38:03.230 --> 00:38:03.240 align:start position:0%
someone who could request um information
 
00:38:04.750 --> 00:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
from a town a
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
municipality that would include someone
 
00:38:10.069 --> 00:38:10.079 align:start position:0%
who owns a residence or a business in
 
00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire but is not necessarily a
 
00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
citizen of New Hampshire that that's
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
where I'm having a hard time with this
 
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
because it certainly needs to be broader
 
00:38:19.950 --> 00:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
than somebody who's just living in New
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or resident of New Hampshire
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
or a voter in New Hampshire because
 
00:38:24.589 --> 00:38:24.599 align:start position:0%
there are other people who have property
 
00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:28.599 align:start position:0%
rights in New Hampshire I I think
 
00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:30.200 align:start position:0%
that may be addressed in the next bill
 
00:38:34.309 --> 00:38:34.319 align:start position:0%
House Bill 74 um and
 
00:38:37.829 --> 00:38:37.839 align:start position:0%
again it if you want to say anyone who
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
is a resident of or owns property in or
 
00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:42.920 align:start position:0%
is a taxpayer in the state of New
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's that's fine um and
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
again I don't even if it's even if you
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
don't limit it to that my concern is not
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
so much request from out of state but
 
00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
the obligation to deliver the to deliver
 
00:39:00.109 --> 00:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
the records thank you very much other
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.349 --> 00:39:06.359 align:start position:0%
bur thank you sir thank you Mr chair I
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
had a question on D I believe that's
 
00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.589 align:start position:0%
had a question on D I believe that's
page

00:39:10.589 --> 00:39:10.599 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:13.720 align:start position:0%
two okay it said the public body or
 
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:16.640 align:start position:0%
agency shall not require the to provide
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
records electronically if it lacks the
 
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
technological capability and I'm just
 
00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
wondering is there any responsibility on
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
the part of that particular business to
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
either classify themselves or inform
 
00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
somebody that they're not technically
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
logical technologically capable or how
 
00:39:37.230 --> 00:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
does that work I I think under this bill
 
00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
and and and I don't think that really
 
00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
changes the law because again as I said
 
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
the the Supreme Court has said if you
 
00:39:46.510 --> 00:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
have it in electronic format and can
 
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
provide it reasonably uh you have the
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
obligation to do so so whether under
 
00:39:56.309 --> 00:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
current law or under this if a town re
 
00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
receives a request and requestor wants
 
00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
the information uh in electronic form
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
and say it's I don't know something from
 
00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
the 1850s that exists only on paper and
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
it's a very small town they don't even
 
00:40:09.790 --> 00:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
have a scanner or they're concerned
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
about damaging the document or something
 
00:40:14.309 --> 00:40:14.319 align:start position:0%
like that they would just say we don't
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
have the capacity to do this or it would
 
00:40:19.309 --> 00:40:19.319 align:start position:0%
it would present a risk of harm and
 
00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
therefore we'll provide this in paper
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
form only and it would just be a
 
00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
statement like that I think
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
think followup sir yes so at this point
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
um people don't have to report the fact
 
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
that they're not capable or anything of
 
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.030 align:start position:0%
that they're not capable or anything of
the

00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
such currently again if if someone
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
requests something in electronic form
 
00:40:44.589 --> 00:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
and the town can't provide it in
 
00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:47.880 align:start position:0%
electronic form for whatever reason they
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
they would have an obligation to say we
 
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
cannot provide this in electronic form
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
because we don't have the capability or
 
00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
for whatever
 
00:40:58.349 --> 00:40:58.359 align:start position:0%
reason you sir other questions for this
 
00:41:00.589 --> 00:41:00.599 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
00:41:02.589 --> 00:41:02.599 align:start position:0%

thank

00:41:33.750 --> 00:41:33.760 align:start position:0%

would
 
00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
think um thank you members of the
 
00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:46.359 align:start position:0%
committee Mr chairman my name is yil
 
00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
biset I'm the legal director of the ACLU
 
00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh we're here in
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
support of HB 66 and um I just kind of
 
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:57.240 align:start position:0%
want to walk through um the reason
 
00:41:59.950 --> 00:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
reasons why we think this is a very uh
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
positive bill for transparency but also
 
00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
a very modest and reasonable one and so
 
00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
um those are the things I'd like to to
 
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
talk um to talk briefly about first I do
 
00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
want to just address representative
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
Alexander's comment on the preliminary
 
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:14.319 align:start position:0%
drafts piece that is not going to be the
 
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
focus of my testimony but we are not
 
00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to the language here uh mainly
 
00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:20.680 align:start position:0%
because I think the language dealing
 
00:42:23.309 --> 00:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
with preliminary drafts here um in the
 
00:42:26.870 --> 00:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
meeting context roughly uh mirrors the
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
ex exemption language for documents in
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
91 A5 which does exempt preliminary
 
00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:33.559 align:start position:0%
drafts I actually think it makes some
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
sense to create parody um with respect
 
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
to exemptions in the public meeting
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
context and in the documents um the
 
00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
documents context
 
00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:45.400 align:start position:0%
um and I also just want to Echo and
 
00:42:46.990 --> 00:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
thank the committee and and chairman
 
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
Lynn especially for um his work on this
 
00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:52.119 align:start position:0%
bill this bill does have some history we
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh this committee dealt with a similar
 
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
version of this bill last year with
 
00:42:59.470 --> 00:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
respect to to 10 60 um
 
00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:01.960 align:start position:0%
1069 um I do just want to kind of get a
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
couple things out of the way I I think
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
there's been some discussion of Russian
 
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
Bots you know or or foreign agents doing
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
document requests to our cities and
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
towns I am not aware of that happening
 
00:43:15.510 --> 00:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
um in New Hampshire so I just do just
 
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
want to highlight that I know there are
 
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
always concerns you know with respect to
 
00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.069 align:start position:0%
always concerns you know with respect to
fishing

00:43:20.069 --> 00:43:20.079 align:start position:0%
fishing
 
00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:22.040 align:start position:0%
Expeditions uh with respect to
 
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
individuals and entities making requests
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
but of course I think one city or Town's
 
00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:28.440 align:start position:0%
view of a fish of a fishing Expedition
 
00:43:29.670 --> 00:43:29.680 align:start position:0%
is another
 
00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
person's uh you know uh view that
 
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
they're making legitimate efforts right
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
to try to learn what their government is
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
up to and I always operate uh under the
 
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:39.880 align:start position:0%
assumption that people are engaging in
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
good faith requests and that has been um
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding and what I've witnessed
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh in the 12 years uh I've been in the
 
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
state and myself have been making uh
 
00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
requests for information for government
 
00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
entities first I want to get to the
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
question of uh citizen uh citizenship um
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
or that that change that's being made
 
00:44:03.470 --> 00:44:03.480 align:start position:0%
here from citizen to
 
00:44:06.990 --> 00:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
person this is clarifying this doesn't
 
00:44:09.630 --> 00:44:09.640 align:start position:0%
actually in my view change the law at
 
00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:11.640 align:start position:0%
all so it is not going to add any cost
 
00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
to cities and towns that are not already
 
00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
born um so I just really I think want to
 
00:44:18.829 --> 00:44:18.839 align:start position:0%
make that very clear that I think the
 
00:44:21.990 --> 00:44:22.000 align:start position:0%
notion that it is person not citizen uh
 
00:44:24.589 --> 00:44:24.599 align:start position:0%
is already reflected in case law and how
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
RSA 91a has tradition been interpreted
 
00:44:30.109 --> 00:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
with respect to who is eligible for
 
00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
making requests and that's because you
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
need to look at this um Statute in its
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
full context so in other provisions of
 
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
91a there are phrases um with respect to
 
00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
any person AG reeved there are phrases
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
that talk about the public or people
 
00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's in part one article 8 our
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional analog to uh the right to
 
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
government transparency and so when you
 
00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:54.520 align:start position:0%
look at that Statute in context until
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
recently it has really always been
 
00:44:58.589 --> 00:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
viewed as as any person could make a
 
00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:01.480 align:start position:0%
request is eligible to make a request
 
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
now until recently we've seen I think
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
what I view is an a Very an outlier
 
00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
interpretation by one city in town that
 
00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:10.040 align:start position:0%
that's not what it means and fortunately
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
the courts have resolved that it said
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
that isn't what it means um but I do
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
think you know I always respect and
 
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
appreciate let's clarify the law if
 
00:45:21.150 --> 00:45:21.160 align:start position:0%
there's any ambiguity so any individual
 
00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:23.319 align:start position:0%
can read a statute and understand what
 
00:45:25.030 --> 00:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
their rights are and I think that's what
 
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
this clarifying language does but in my
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
view it doesn't expand 91a or really in
 
00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
any way change the law and how we have
 
00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
all kind of historically viewed who is
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
eligible to make um make make a request
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
um again with respect to the citizenship
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
question uh in this change I have heard
 
00:45:47.109 --> 00:45:47.119 align:start position:0%
some comments some concerns about
 
00:45:50.950 --> 00:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
burdens we we actually last year I think
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
um made some accommodations to address
 
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
the concerns that cities and towns had
 
00:45:57.670 --> 00:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
about burdensome requests so that is the
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
lens that I think is the vehicle if
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
cities and towns have concerns where
 
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:05.680 align:start position:0%
they can have those um uh those concerns
 
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:07.720 align:start position:0%
raised and uh to be very clear about
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
that that bill was hb12 and what that
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
did was impose certain costs on uh
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
voluminous requests with respect to
 
00:46:17.270 --> 00:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
Communications that were in excess of
 
00:46:20.589 --> 00:46:20.599 align:start position:0%
250 Communications so so I think that
 
00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
was very reasonable and in return
 
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
frankly I think we should be making
 
00:46:27.390 --> 00:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable changes here not only with
 
00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
respect to the clarifying language
 
00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:31.040 align:start position:0%
concerning person and eligibility to
 
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
make a request but also with respect to
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
what I think has become I think an
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunate practice not of not all
 
00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:41.720 align:start position:0%
towns but some cities and towns when
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
it's really easy for them to mail or
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
email documents to say nope you need to
 
00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
come and show up um this has happened to
 
00:46:52.270 --> 00:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
me and others including media Outlets we
 
00:46:54.309 --> 00:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
identify in our testimony some cities
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
and towns that have done this so I'll
 
00:46:58.349 --> 00:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
give you an example a very clear example
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
I you know I or anyone wants a two-page
 
00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:03.640 align:start position:0%
police report it's not memorialized in
 
00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:06.280 align:start position:0%
in an email file it's a document that's
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
electronically maintained that is or can
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
be converted into a PDF hey can you just
 
00:47:13.349 --> 00:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
send me the police report so I don't
 
00:47:15.069 --> 00:47:15.079 align:start position:0%
have to travel 50 miles or if someone
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
wants a disability they don't have to
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know get out of their house to get
 
00:47:21.309 --> 00:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
access to it and cities and towns many
 
00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
uh I don't want to say many some um are
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
saying nope you need to show up that is
 
00:47:27.349 --> 00:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
our policy because we have legal
 
00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
authority to do so I just don't think
 
00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's fair and frankly I don't think
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
that's consistent with the spirit of 91a
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
which is a transparency statute it's not
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
a secrecy statute it's not a burden
 
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
statute it is a transparency statute and
 
00:47:43.950 --> 00:47:43.960 align:start position:0%
so that's what I think the second part
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
of this bill really does frankly I think
 
00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
in a very reasonable way because of
 
00:47:50.069 --> 00:47:50.079 align:start position:0%
course there are going to be concerns
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
about burden from cities and towns but
 
00:47:54.750 --> 00:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
this bill I think in many ways
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
accommodates that they're not required
 
00:47:58.589 --> 00:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
to provide records electronically in a
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
format other than the format in which
 
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
the body regularly maintains that
 
00:48:03.910 --> 00:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
information the bill adds that the
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
public body or agency sh shall not be
 
00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:07.599 align:start position:0%
required to provide records
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
electronically it lacks the the
 
00:48:11.349 --> 00:48:11.359 align:start position:0%
technological capability to do so so
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
there what that language is dealing with
 
00:48:15.549 --> 00:48:15.559 align:start position:0%
is the capability of the public body to
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
produce it and if it's burden burdensome
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
for them to do so they're not required
 
00:48:22.990 --> 00:48:23.000 align:start position:0%
to do it so if there are burdens with
 
00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:25.160 align:start position:0%
respect to the dissemination they're
 
00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
covered under this particular statute so
 
00:48:30.069 --> 00:48:30.079 align:start position:0%
I think
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
um and and again as well if they're
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about the burden on scope and
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
the volume of production again hb10 102
 
00:48:40.349 --> 00:48:40.359 align:start position:0%
allows for costs uh in certain
 
00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:43.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances to be uh to be produced in
 
00:48:45.470 --> 00:48:45.480 align:start position:0%
that particular case so I think this law
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
really addresses um you know many of
 
00:48:50.109 --> 00:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
This concerns with respect to again
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
further burdens on municipalities
 
00:48:53.549 --> 00:48:53.559 align:start position:0%
they're already going to have the
 
00:48:55.710 --> 00:48:55.720 align:start position:0%
documents printed out right in many
 
00:48:57.990 --> 00:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
instances so we're just talking about
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
how the documents get to the person and
 
00:49:03.309 --> 00:49:03.319 align:start position:0%
if the person wants it by mail they are
 
00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:05.480 align:start position:0%
oblig uh the person who is making that
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%
request gets to pay or has to pay for
 
00:49:09.549 --> 00:49:09.559 align:start position:0%
the mailing as well so again I think
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
this is totally fair and totally
 
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable and I think addresses a
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
concern that we've seen with respect to
 
00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
uh some municipalities so um with that
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll kind of close my testimony but
 
00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:21.960 align:start position:0%
I want to thank uh the chairman and
 
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:23.240 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for uh
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
considering this legislation all right
 
00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%

00:49:49.750 --> 00:49:49.760 align:start position:0%

Christina thank you chairman Lyn thank
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee my name is
 
00:49:55.069 --> 00:49:55.079 align:start position:0%
Barrett Christina I am the executive
 
00:49:56.309 --> 00:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire school
 
00:49:59.190 --> 00:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
board Association we are opposed to
 
00:50:02.109 --> 00:50:02.119 align:start position:0%
House Bill 66 and just so it's on the
 
00:50:03.950 --> 00:50:03.960 align:start position:0%
record I won't be testifying on the next
 
00:50:06.069 --> 00:50:06.079 align:start position:0%
next bill what we do support House Bill
 
00:50:07.870 --> 00:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
74 I did sign in support but I'll save
 
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
rediscussed before me previously touched
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
on all the Salan points that the school
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
boards Association has and the concerns
 
00:50:23.670 --> 00:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh that nhba has with opening up the
 
00:50:26.670 --> 00:50:26.680 align:start position:0%
right to no law to any person
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
potentially Nationwide um when nhba
 
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
speaks to our members and and we hear
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
about out of state um individuals
 
00:50:38.069 --> 00:50:38.079 align:start position:0%
requesting information from local school
 
00:50:40.430 --> 00:50:40.440 align:start position:0%
districts most of the time or many of
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
the times it's an outof State requester
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
it's a commercial Enterprise that is
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
looking for information about students
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
and parents to Market particular
 
00:50:53.309 --> 00:50:53.319 align:start position:0%
particular items I've gotten questions
 
00:50:55.549 --> 00:50:55.559 align:start position:0%
from school boards or superintendents
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
primarily in the past about out ofate
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
driver education programs out ofate
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
companies looking to sell software
 
00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:04.520 align:start position:0%
platforms and programs to parents and
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
students um private tutoring companies
 
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
that are looking to sell their services
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
to students um and all private entities
 
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
that are assisting with with with
 
00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:17.240 align:start position:0%
college recruiting they're seeking names
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
addresses phone numbers email addresses
 
00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
of parents and students to actively
 
00:51:24.430 --> 00:51:24.440 align:start position:0%
Market information and are not
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily asking for information about
 
00:51:29.549 --> 00:51:29.559 align:start position:0%
government proceedings so that is why
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
nhba would have concerns with opening
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
this up to any person as opposed to
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
putting some level of restriction to an
 
00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
individual who has a um a um a Nexus if
 
00:51:43.589 --> 00:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
you will with um with New Hampshire
 
00:51:45.390 --> 00:51:45.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's taxpayer status
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not that's a resident of New
 
00:51:48.069 --> 00:51:48.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire whatever language might come
 
00:51:50.589 --> 00:51:50.599 align:start position:0%
out of this the other concern that NH
 
00:51:53.789 --> 00:51:53.799 align:start position:0%
hsba has um that Mr biset talked about
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
as well too is is the emailing of the
 
00:51:57.750 --> 00:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
records the emailing of their records
 
00:51:59.950 --> 00:51:59.960 align:start position:0%
and providing them in electronic format
 
00:52:03.549 --> 00:52:03.559 align:start position:0%
in and of itself is not problematic when
 
00:52:05.630 --> 00:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
it's a person in your community or a
 
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
person in your state seeking actual
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
government records rather than
 
00:52:11.750 --> 00:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
information that is maintained or held
 
00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
by the government such as names and
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
addresses and email addresses and phone
 
00:52:18.589 --> 00:52:18.599 align:start position:0%
numbers and things of that nature but um
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
as I believe Mr Johnson said when we
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
would get an out of when nsba would
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
receive a a a a phone call or an inquiry
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
from a superintendent saying I got a
 
00:52:28.829 --> 00:52:28.839 align:start position:0%
right to no law request from a company
 
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
in California asking for these things
 
00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
our response would be the same happy to
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
provide them to you they're at the
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
central office office is open until 4:30
 
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
come pick them up and we often would
 
00:52:40.829 --> 00:52:40.839 align:start position:0%
never hear from that corporate entity
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
again that's looking for these looking
 
00:52:44.549 --> 00:52:44.559 align:start position:0%
for these materials to Market their
 
00:52:46.789 --> 00:52:46.799 align:start position:0%
their their their their Wares to to New
 
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens um likewise um you
 
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
know I'm not familiar with all the facts
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
um of of the Rochester matter but you
 
00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:55.720 align:start position:0%
know perhaps a little bit of Common
 
00:52:57.390 --> 00:52:57.400 align:start position:0%
Sense could have prevailed and and the
 
00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
documents could have been provided
 
00:53:01.109 --> 00:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
rather than having to go through bill
 
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
after Bill after Bill and and and many
 
00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:05.559 align:start position:0%
hours in this in this in this in this
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
room so the emailing um themselves again
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
is is not the problem the problem is
 
00:53:11.789 --> 00:53:11.799 align:start position:0%
when we're coupling that with out of
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
state entities who have no connection no
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
Nexus to New Hampshire don't pay taxes
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
here don't have any connection to the
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
state but are seeking not even
 
00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
governmental information but rather
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
personal information that is being held
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
by held by um by the government and in
 
00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
databases and student student addresses
 
00:53:32.109 --> 00:53:32.119 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature so for those
 
00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
reasons the school boards Association
 
00:53:35.910 --> 00:53:35.920 align:start position:0%
opposes House Bill 66 we do support
 
00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
House Bill 74 um and I'm happy to answer
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
any questions that the that the
 
00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee may have thank you questions
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
for this W representative Alexander um
 
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:45.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr
 
00:53:46.870 --> 00:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
Christina for being here I struggle to
 
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
see honestly what like the difference
 
00:53:51.630 --> 00:53:51.640 align:start position:0%
like really what it would do to further
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
Define it as a citizen of New Hampshire
 
00:53:55.549 --> 00:53:55.559 align:start position:0%
taxpayer because hypothetically you
 
00:53:58.750 --> 00:53:58.760 align:start position:0%
could just you know find somebody you
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
know in New Hampshire to request the
 
00:54:03.390 --> 00:54:03.400 align:start position:0%
documents so I don't I don't
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
understand why you'd be opposed to this
 
00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
version in supportive of the other
 
00:54:09.870 --> 00:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
version when they they practically do
 
00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
the same thing sure thank thank thank
 
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
you for the question representative so I
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
mean I I I will tell you just
 
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
anecdotally from my own experiences
 
00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
answering these questions from school
 
00:54:21.349 --> 00:54:21.359 align:start position:0%
boards and school superintendents over
 
00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
the years if that driver's education
 
00:54:26.470 --> 00:54:26.480 align:start position:0%
company or that private Tutoring company
 
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:27.920 align:start position:0%
California really wanted that
 
00:54:29.309 --> 00:54:29.319 align:start position:0%
information they would do that they
 
00:54:30.589 --> 00:54:30.599 align:start position:0%
would contact somebody from New
 
00:54:32.829 --> 00:54:32.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and say contact the conquered
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
school district and request this
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
information for us I have not seen that
 
00:54:38.789 --> 00:54:38.799 align:start position:0%
happen when when when the advice that
 
00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:40.839 align:start position:0%
I've told the superintendent has been to
 
00:54:42.510 --> 00:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
tell the company we'll print them off
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
for you 25 cents a page they're at the
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
central office we usually get no further
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
response from the from that outof state
 
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
private company if they really wanted
 
00:54:52.349 --> 00:54:52.359 align:start position:0%
the information that was that important
 
00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
to them I think they would do exactly
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
what you're asking representative but in
 
00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
my experience they have not done that
 
00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:00.520 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this W
 
00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:01.710 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this W
representative

00:55:01.710 --> 00:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
Smith um thank you it's a minor question
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
is there a particular tax that you
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
believe someone has to be paying in
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
order to be eligible thank you for the
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
question representative representative P
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
I was thinking of your comments about
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
you have people who don't reside in New
 
00:55:21.069 --> 00:55:21.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but may may own a home in New
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um if you were to just say a
 
00:55:26.349 --> 00:55:26.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayer that might be a little bit too
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
Brad because my thought using
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
representative Pell's circumstance you
 
00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:33.160 align:start position:0%
may have somebody from Anchorage Alaska
 
00:55:35.230 --> 00:55:35.240 align:start position:0%
who is vacationing in wolfboro and rents
 
00:55:38.029 --> 00:55:38.039 align:start position:0%
a hotel and goes to a bar and buys a
 
00:55:40.349 --> 00:55:40.359 align:start position:0%
burger and beer they're paying a room
 
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
and meals tax somewhere along the way
 
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:43.960 align:start position:0%
aren't they is that a sufficient enough
 
00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
Nexus to New Hampshire for us to open
 
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:50.200 align:start position:0%
them up to you know make them you know
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
um allow them access under their right
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
to no law I don't have a specific
 
00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
question to that to answer to your
 
00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
question repres incentive but maybe
 
00:56:00.349 --> 00:56:00.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayer would not be the proper the
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
proper language to use and whatever
 
00:56:04.230 --> 00:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
whatever comes out of these these
 
00:56:07.789 --> 00:56:07.799 align:start position:0%
bills other questions for this witness
 
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much sir next
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
please Coco welcome good morning thank
 
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:29.559 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair good morning Judiciary
 
00:56:31.549 --> 00:56:31.559 align:start position:0%
Committee members I'm going to apologize
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
in advance this will be my longest
 
00:56:34.990 --> 00:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
testimony of the day and I promise after
 
00:56:36.549 --> 00:56:36.559 align:start position:0%
this it's all going to be very very
 
00:56:39.710 --> 00:56:39.720 align:start position:0%
short um I represent right to know New
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire which is an all volunteer
 
00:56:42.710 --> 00:56:42.720 align:start position:0%
Grassroots group of individuals
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
concerned with transparency and
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
effective implementation of 91a in
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
keeping with the spirit of public access
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
to public information we've been
 
00:56:51.789 --> 00:56:51.799 align:start position:0%
involved in the formation of right to no
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
related legislation since approximately
 
00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
2012 and we have a broad base of members
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
and interested participants with real
 
00:56:59.789 --> 00:56:59.799 align:start position:0%
world experience in nuanced applications
 
00:57:01.870 --> 00:57:01.880 align:start position:0%
of the right to no law we strongly
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
support HB 66 which clarifies the
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
standard for allowing individuals to
 
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
request information under New
 
00:57:09.549 --> 00:57:09.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's right to know law and
 
00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
introduces routine 21st century business
 
00:57:14.589 --> 00:57:14.599 align:start position:0%
practices notably the use of electronic
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
communications imagine that in the
 
00:57:20.430 --> 00:57:20.440 align:start position:0%
implementation of RSA 91a we very much
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh the sponsors of this bill
 
00:57:24.309 --> 00:57:24.319 align:start position:0%
bringing this back to the table this is
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
an issue that was discussed at length um
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
and last year and I'll go into a little
 
00:57:30.470 --> 00:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
bit of the history on that later in my
 
00:57:32.829 --> 00:57:32.839 align:start position:0%
testimony the need for this language to
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
now be added and clarified in statute
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
appears to stem largely from
 
00:57:38.789 --> 00:57:38.799 align:start position:0%
applications of the law being put
 
00:57:41.309 --> 00:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
forward by a particular municipality and
 
00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
also the New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:57:45.549 --> 00:57:45.559 align:start position:0%
Association regarding replacement of the
 
00:57:47.470 --> 00:57:47.480 align:start position:0%
term citizen I will assume most of the
 
00:57:49.549 --> 00:57:49.559 align:start position:0%
committee is now familiar with that
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
ongoing case there are multiple other
 
00:57:54.430 --> 00:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
reasons that a non-citizen may be
 
00:57:55.710 --> 00:57:55.720 align:start position:0%
reasonably considered to have an
 
00:57:57.470 --> 00:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
interest that information and I think
 
00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
representative partell hit on that U Mr
 
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
B uh Bonet hit on that as well um they
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
may have children in a different school
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
system from their community of residents
 
00:58:08.349 --> 00:58:08.359 align:start position:0%
they may be a property owner they may
 
00:58:10.029 --> 00:58:10.039 align:start position:0%
pay taxes in a jurisdiction but not
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
reside there Etc they may also have a
 
00:58:14.430 --> 00:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
vested interest in issues related to
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
transit or
 
00:58:18.069 --> 00:58:18.079 align:start position:0%
health what members of this committee
 
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
may not be familiar with and I'm going
 
00:58:22.029 --> 00:58:22.039 align:start position:0%
to get a little into the Weeds on this
 
00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:23.680 align:start position:0%
is the fact that under the Attorney
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
General's 2015 memorandum on on the
 
00:58:30.150 --> 00:58:30.160 align:start position:0%
right to no law on page 39 the AG noted
 
00:58:34.630 --> 00:58:34.640 align:start position:0%
that RSA 91 A4 refers to Citizens but
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
the right to no law does not define this
 
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:40.000 align:start position:0%
term and uses it nowhere else instead
 
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
the statute emphasizes accountability to
 
00:58:46.349 --> 00:58:46.359 align:start position:0%
the people accessibility to the public
 
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
and the goals of a Democratic Society an
 
00:58:52.349 --> 00:58:52.359 align:start position:0%
agency should not therefore require
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
persons requesting access to public
 
00:58:56.230 --> 00:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
documents to demonstrate that they
 
00:58:58.829 --> 00:58:58.839 align:start position:0%
citizens of either New Hampshire or the
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
United States that was the
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
interpretation of the law as it is now
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
currently written that language in the
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
reissued memorandum from the AG's office
 
00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:11.240 align:start position:0%
is notably absent and it was issued just
 
00:59:14.829 --> 00:59:14.839 align:start position:0%
last year however historically that is
 
00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:16.240 align:start position:0%
the interpretation that we have been
 
00:59:17.950 --> 00:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
using in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:59:19.870 --> 00:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
until we ran into this situation with
 
00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.829 align:start position:0%
until we ran into this situation with
Rochester's

00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:21.839 align:start position:0%
Rochester's
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
interpretation since the US Supreme
 
00:59:26.190 --> 00:59:26.200 align:start position:0%
Court case of MC Bernie versus young in
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
13 some public bodies in New Hampshire
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
have been applying findings also
 
00:59:31.510 --> 00:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
relevant to the state of Virginia
 
00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:34.200 align:start position:0%
Freedom of Information Act to bodies in
 
00:59:36.630 --> 00:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire nhma is one of those who
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
recommended that approach stating in
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
their training materials that there is
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
no definition of citizen or Statute in
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
relevant case law but presumably should
 
00:59:46.710 --> 00:59:46.720 align:start position:0%
be a New Hampshire citizen in part we
 
00:59:48.589 --> 00:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
believe that is why some of these issues
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
are now arising verbally during that
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
training Council referenced mcer versus
 
00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:54.880 align:start position:0%
young right to know believes this
 
00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
interpretation is being used an error
 
00:59:59.470 --> 00:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
and the AG's footnote from 2015 confirms
 
01:00:02.069 --> 01:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
that I won't go into some of the details
 
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:04.200 align:start position:0%
about that particular case but it is
 
01:00:06.549 --> 01:00:06.559 align:start position:0%
very specific to Virginia state law
 
01:00:08.390 --> 01:00:08.400 align:start position:0%
which clearly defines who does and does
 
01:00:10.109 --> 01:00:10.119 align:start position:0%
not have access to information and it
 
01:00:11.910 --> 01:00:11.920 align:start position:0%
cannot cleanly be extrapolated to New
 
01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:13.240 align:start position:0%
Hamshire statute and I'm happy to
 
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
discuss that offline with anybody that
 
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:16.280 align:start position:0%
has questions about
 
01:00:18.910 --> 01:00:18.920 align:start position:0%
that despite this fact MC Bernie and the
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
idea that communities might deny records
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
based on citizenship has worked its way
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
into at least two right to know policies
 
01:00:27.069 --> 01:00:27.079 align:start position:0%
that I aware of and been and into the
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
heavily used right to know training
 
01:00:30.430 --> 01:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
that's given by nhma and that needs to
 
01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.470 align:start position:0%
that's given by nhma and that needs to
be

01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:31.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:00:33.950 --> 01:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
corrected this bill also allows for the
 
01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
use of electronic communications to be
 
01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
used to transfer records when the public
 
01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:40.520 align:start position:0%
body has the technological capacity to
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
do so um there has been some discussion
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
previously about the need for this
 
01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:48.359 align:start position:0%
language um in this in the case that was
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
previously presented to this committee
 
01:00:51.990 --> 01:00:52.000 align:start position:0%
last year a right to no training that
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
was put forward led to the conclusion by
 
01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
communities that they could not transfer
 
01:00:57.910 --> 01:00:57.920 align:start position:0%
information electronically and must
 
01:00:59.750 --> 01:00:59.760 align:start position:0%
require individuals to appear in order
 
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
to request that information that is not
 
01:01:04.870 --> 01:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
the case they do have that option we
 
01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
have also um been surprised to hear
 
01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
concerns that anyone anywhere could
 
01:01:10.150 --> 01:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
request records from Municipal
 
01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:12.200 align:start position:0%
governments via an emailed request that
 
01:01:14.510 --> 01:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
is largely already the case in addition
 
01:01:16.430 --> 01:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
to 91a not being limited to New
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens it does not require
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
that a person submit a request in a
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
certain format an emailed request can
 
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
constitute a formal request for
 
01:01:27.870 --> 01:01:27.880 align:start position:0%
information under 91a and many if not
 
01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:30.760 align:start position:0%
most public bodies already accept
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
those uh we have also heard uh concerns
 
01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
about Municipal governments being
 
01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
obliged to send records electronically
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
most communities are doing that as well
 
01:01:42.190 --> 01:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
when that is not possible electronic
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
transfer using a thumb drive or a data
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
device is fairly
 
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
routine the real need from this for this
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
language stems from public bodies who
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
have chosen to adhere to very specific
 
01:01:53.029 --> 01:01:53.039 align:start position:0%
language in the statute and require that
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
Quest requesters show up in person and
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
on time it is usually and you have heard
 
01:02:00.269 --> 01:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
it here in testimony prior to me used as
 
01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:02.720 align:start position:0%
a deterrent and to decrease the volume
 
01:02:04.630 --> 01:02:04.640 align:start position:0%
of the requests received that is not in
 
01:02:06.029 --> 01:02:06.039 align:start position:0%
keeping with the spirit of the right to
 
01:02:07.630 --> 01:02:07.640 align:start position:0%
know law which is the only law that
 
01:02:10.230 --> 01:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
guarantees public access to public
 
01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:12.640 align:start position:0%
information in many cases the use of an
 
01:02:14.349 --> 01:02:14.359 align:start position:0%
electronic transfer is actually more
 
01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
efficient it uses less labor than the
 
01:02:18.309 --> 01:02:18.319 align:start position:0%
production of hardcopy documents and the
 
01:02:19.589 --> 01:02:19.599 align:start position:0%
idea that they are more costly or
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
Troublesome to the public body is really
 
01:02:23.430 --> 01:02:23.440 align:start position:0%
a difficult argument to
 
01:02:25.589 --> 01:02:25.599 align:start position:0%
believe there also seems to be a focus
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
on knowing who the requesters are and
 
01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:29.839 align:start position:0%
having them physically come in to the
 
01:02:33.750 --> 01:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
office um the most recent uh legislative
 
01:02:36.349 --> 01:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
bulletin put out by nhma states that any
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
individual anywhere could make a request
 
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
without ever sitting foot in the state
 
01:02:42.309 --> 01:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire let alone in your town
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
hall as if that is expected and required
 
01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
right now it is not however um and to to
 
01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:53.079 align:start position:0%
extrapolate on that in censabella the
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court stated that
 
01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
it would not be unreasonable able for a
 
01:02:58.950 --> 01:02:58.960 align:start position:0%
requestor to desire anonymity in the
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
early stages when making a right to no
 
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
law request such requests May implicate
 
01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:05.000 align:start position:0%
political policy or public interest
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
considerations particularly when the
 
01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:08.440 align:start position:0%
request is pursued by a whistleblower or
 
01:03:10.510 --> 01:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
an advocacy organization we would
 
01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
recommend that the New Hampshire General
 
01:03:13.470 --> 01:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
Court respond in keeping with this
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
finding whenever the question of
 
01:03:17.269 --> 01:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
identifying individual requesters and
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
physically having them come in does that
 
01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:20.390 align:start position:0%
physically having them come in does that
comes

01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
comes
 
01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
up finally we have also heard concerns
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
and we heard them today about Russia AI
 
01:03:30.430 --> 01:03:30.440 align:start position:0%
Bots that's been put out to the
 
01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:32.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities as a
 
01:03:35.150 --> 01:03:35.160 align:start position:0%
concern um as the Superior Court ruling
 
01:03:37.510 --> 01:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
in the city of Rochester case States in
 
01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000 align:start position:0%
during the oral argument the city
 
01:03:40.670 --> 01:03:40.680 align:start position:0%
identified practical concerns and
 
01:03:42.269 --> 01:03:42.279 align:start position:0%
difficulties that come from lengthly
 
01:03:44.349 --> 01:03:44.359 align:start position:0%
records requests from people outside the
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
United States of the country whatever
 
01:03:48.510 --> 01:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
the merits of those concerns the court
 
01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:50.440 align:start position:0%
could not and it then went on to say it
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
can't tailor the language the
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
legislature does need to do that but I
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
would extrapolate on that to say that
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
when creating law this committee should
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
be dealing with realistic and carefully
 
01:04:02.029 --> 01:04:02.039 align:start position:0%
detailed examples rather than
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
hypothetical scenarios that postulate
 
01:04:05.670 --> 01:04:05.680 align:start position:0%
unlikely outcomes when the right to no
 
01:04:07.829 --> 01:04:07.839 align:start position:0%
law is being discussed this is what
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
happened last year when a version of
 
01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
this bill came before this committee
 
01:04:14.549 --> 01:04:14.559 align:start position:0%
passed the house passed the Senate went
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
to Committee of conference it was sunk
 
01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:19.240 align:start position:0%
by claims of an unreasonably large right
 
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:21.160 align:start position:0%
to no request that purportedly asked for
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
all police records from an entire police
 
01:04:25.309 --> 01:04:25.319 align:start position:0%
department in reality that request
 
01:04:27.549 --> 01:04:27.559 align:start position:0%
turned out to be a specific request for
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
internal affairs reports for a very set
 
01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
period of time I do not want to see this
 
01:04:35.430 --> 01:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
committee misled by her hyperbole again
 
01:04:38.269 --> 01:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
if nhma feels that AI Bots are a concern
 
01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:40.119 align:start position:0%
as I've seen in their legislative
 
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
bulletin or others are concerned about
 
01:04:44.109 --> 01:04:44.119 align:start position:0%
Russia I would like to see examples of
 
01:04:45.829 --> 01:04:45.839 align:start position:0%
those attempts and a working group
 
01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
established to come up with a solution
 
01:04:49.750 --> 01:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
the same is true of the aforementioned
 
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
Bad actors and costs and I do want to
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
take a moment to address the issue of
 
01:04:57.549 --> 01:04:57.559 align:start position:0%
large requests and costs we spent quite
 
01:05:00.109 --> 01:05:00.119 align:start position:0%
a bit of time last year on HB
 
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
10002 trying to negotiate a solution
 
01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:04.640 align:start position:0%
that would allow municipalities to
 
01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:06.559 align:start position:0%
navigate difficult requests from
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
requesters like the corporate ones that
 
01:05:10.789 --> 01:05:10.799 align:start position:0%
have presented to been presented to this
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
committee during prior
 
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
testimony communities have the ability
 
01:05:18.589 --> 01:05:18.599 align:start position:0%
to say no to those requests under a
 
01:05:20.670 --> 01:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
variety in a variety of different ways
 
01:05:22.269 --> 01:05:22.279 align:start position:0%
they are not required to compile
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
information that is not already compiled
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
they are not required to release
 
01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
personal ident personally identifiable
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
information such as the school board was
 
01:05:34.470 --> 01:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
noting about names addresses and email
 
01:05:38.349 --> 01:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
addresses um there are ways to work
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
around those large requests and now
 
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
there is a process in place for managing
 
01:05:43.870 --> 01:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
them and potentially
 
01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:46.119 align:start position:0%
charging I want this committee to be
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
very clear that that is something that
 
01:05:51.309 --> 01:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
we put into place to try and alleviate
 
01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
I will conclude my testimony thank you
 
01:06:00.430 --> 01:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this
 
01:06:03.150 --> 01:06:03.160 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:07.240 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on uh uh Sarah
 
01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:19.309 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on uh uh Sarah

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
please good morning my name is Sarah
 
01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
Burke Cohen I represent the New
 
01:06:25.870 --> 01:06:25.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal Association as you
 
01:06:27.750 --> 01:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
may know the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
Association is a member organization of
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire
 
01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:35.839 align:start position:0%
municipalities nhma opposes HB 66 for
 
01:06:39.309 --> 01:06:39.319 align:start position:0%
several reasons first this bill as
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
you've heard will broaden the definition
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
of a requestor to any person anywhere in
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
the world no ties to New Hampshire this
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
seems to go counter to what is laid out
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
in both article 8 of the New Hampshire
 
01:06:52.710 --> 01:06:52.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution stating that the government
 
01:06:55.069 --> 01:06:55.079 align:start position:0%
be responsive responsive to the people
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
who form Med it in statutory language in
 
01:07:00.029 --> 01:07:00.039 align:start position:0%
RSA 91a referencing the right of every
 
01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
citizen to access governmental records
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
although the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
has never ruled on the definition of
 
01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
citizen within RSA 91a it can reasonably
 
01:07:12.549 --> 01:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
be interpreted to mean the
 
01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
statute gives rights only to residents
 
01:07:17.069 --> 01:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire which we believe
 
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
appropriate this interpretation seems to
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
be supported by the New Hampshire
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court repeated use of the
 
01:07:24.829 --> 01:07:24.839 align:start position:0%
statement that the purpose of the right
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
to no law is to provide the utmost
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
information to the public about what is
 
01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
going on what its government is up
 
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
to further the right to know on budsman
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
has interpreted in his capacity that a
 
01:07:42.349 --> 01:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
requestor under right RSA 91a must have
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
ties to New Hampshire to make a request
 
01:07:47.349 --> 01:07:47.359 align:start position:0%
under the statute taken together the New
 
01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution right to no
 
01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
statute New Hampshire Supreme Court case
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
law and the right to no Ombudsman
 
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that a requester under RSA
 
01:07:59.390 --> 01:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
91a was meant to reference citizens of
 
01:08:01.470 --> 01:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire not residents of
 
01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
California Florida or a foreign country
 
01:08:05.789 --> 01:08:05.799 align:start position:0%
as those persons who have no need to
 
01:08:07.390 --> 01:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
know what the government of Milford is
 
01:08:10.109 --> 01:08:10.119 align:start position:0%
up to this interpretation allows
 
01:08:11.950 --> 01:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities to not waste their time
 
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire taxpayers money
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
fulfilling requests from business
 
01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:17.920 align:start position:0%
political organ organizations reporters
 
01:08:19.870 --> 01:08:19.880 align:start position:0%
and college students who have no
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
connection to New Hampshire but want a
 
01:08:23.990 --> 01:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
municipality to do their academic
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
political or industry research SE for
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
them secondly HB 66 will require
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities to both accept record
 
01:08:34.229 --> 01:08:34.239 align:start position:0%
requests by mail or electronically and
 
01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
affirmatively send records by the means
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
elected by the requestor to include mail
 
01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:40.149 align:start position:0%
elected by the requestor to include mail
or

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
electronically given the proposed
 
01:08:44.390 --> 01:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
expansion of the definition of requestor
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
this bill will requir that government
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
agencies send records by mail or email
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
requesters prerogative to any person
 
01:08:53.669 --> 01:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the world this bill would
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
for example require Miss municipality to
 
01:08:59.669 --> 01:08:59.679 align:start position:0%
locate copy and mail thousands of pages
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
meeting of meeting minutes or other
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
government documents to a a person
 
01:09:06.910 --> 01:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
outside the country or require every
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
town in the state of in the state to
 
01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:11.239 align:start position:0%
email a Colorado Corporation information
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
on registered dog owners so that the
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
corporation could Market pet products to
 
01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
them moreover this bill creates
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
significant privacy and safety concerns
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire citizens it will allow
 
01:09:26.910 --> 01:09:26.920 align:start position:0%
outof State entities to have unfettered
 
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
ability to demand and receive any type
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
of public information they can think of
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
from public agency although each piece
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
of requested information may not alone
 
01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
con constit P constitute personally
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
identifying information a bad actor
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
could acquire and put together enough
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
pieces of public information on a
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
resident permits blue blueprints
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
registration addresses tax payments Etc
 
01:09:52.709 --> 01:09:52.719 align:start position:0%
to create a so-called targeting package
 
01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
on that person and with the increasing
 
01:09:56.910 --> 01:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
use of the artificial artificial
 
01:09:59.070 --> 01:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
intelligent artificial intelligence and
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
Bots these types of requests will only
 
01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
become more frequent and honorous and
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
paid for by New Hampshire
 
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
taxpayers electronic delivery will also
 
01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
mean there will be limited or no
 
01:10:10.709 --> 01:10:10.719 align:start position:0%
assurance that the record is received by
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
the requestor with no Assurance it would
 
01:10:15.470 --> 01:10:15.480 align:start position:0%
be ripe for complaints to the on budsman
 
01:10:17.669 --> 01:10:17.679 align:start position:0%
or lawsuits in Superior Court alleging
 
01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
that the government failed to deliver
 
01:10:22.030 --> 01:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
records within the statutorily specified
 
01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
time when it turns out that the
 
01:10:26.030 --> 01:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
requestor email address was was wrong
 
01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
the requester's handwriting was
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
ineligible or some other Factor outside
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
of the government's control prevented
 
01:10:32.590 --> 01:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
the records from getting into the right
 
01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
hands it will be too late as significant
 
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
amounts of taxpayer money will have been
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
spent electronic delivery of Records
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
also opens governments to security risks
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
by accidentally providing metadata in a
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
common file format and fulfilling these
 
01:10:49.030 --> 01:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
requests can often take additional hours
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
or even days to complete which means
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
that the cost of sending responses to
 
01:10:54.270 --> 01:10:54.280 align:start position:0%
out of state or out of country
 
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
requesters will be borne by the New
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpayer through expending the
 
01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:00.760 align:start position:0%
resources it takes to fulfill the
 
01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
request and the diversion of resources
 
01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
from other possibly more urgent task
 
01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
with no recoupable costs in some HB 66
 
01:11:11.550 --> 01:11:11.560 align:start position:0%
will create an immense burden on
 
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the state it will it
 
01:11:17.270 --> 01:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
will on it in which online profiles and
 
01:11:19.030 --> 01:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
email addresses from entities that have
 
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
no ties excuse me no ties with New
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire can be used to mislead or
 
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
misrepresent who is requesting records
 
01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.000 align:start position:0%
and from municipalities municipalities
 
01:11:29.229 --> 01:11:29.239 align:start position:0%
will be required to provide the
 
01:11:31.229 --> 01:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
requesting information electronically
 
01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
which may create security risks to both
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
the municipality and potentially
 
01:11:38.149 --> 01:11:38.159 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire nhma supports
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
RSA 91 as it 91a as it is currently
 
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
written and that the citizens of New
 
01:11:44.470 --> 01:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire who appear in person at Town
 
01:11:46.430 --> 01:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
Halls attorney licensed in the state
 
01:11:48.430 --> 01:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
well-known advocacy organizations and
 
01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
news organizations who report on New
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and others who allegedly act
 
01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the people of the State of
 
01:11:56.350 --> 01:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are reasonably entitled to
 
01:11:59.310 --> 01:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
information from its municipalities um
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
and HMA urges the committee to reject
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm open to questions
 
01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
questions for this wit representative
 
01:12:08.830 --> 01:12:08.840 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair Mr chair before
 
01:12:13.030 --> 01:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
I ask Miss con a question could um I ask
 
01:12:16.950 --> 01:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
you if the um budsman is um on the list
 
01:12:21.790 --> 01:12:21.800 align:start position:0%
of people to testify because since um
 
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh a stated position of his was was
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned um and it doesn't really jive
 
01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:33.400 align:start position:0%
with what I understand has happened I I
 
01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
just want to know if we're going to be
 
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
able to address that he is not on the
 
01:12:41.390 --> 01:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
list of witnesses um I know I notice
 
01:12:44.790 --> 01:12:44.800 align:start position:0%
that he's here and if he wanted to be um
 
01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh I wonder if at the appropriate time
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
we could hear from him um to just make
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
sure um
 
01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if this is a a a reference
 
01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:00.189 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if this is a a a reference
that

01:13:00.189 --> 01:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:03.880 align:start position:0%
um maybe I'm of the wrong generation but
 
01:13:06.390 --> 01:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know if Miss con if you have
 
01:13:10.830 --> 01:13:10.840 align:start position:0%
ever read um about Henny peny in the sky
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
is falling um uh because it certainly
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
seems to me to be a basis of all of your
 
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
testimony I know your
 
01:13:25.750 --> 01:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
predecessor was involved
 
01:13:29.669 --> 01:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
over many years are really working hard
 
01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
to have
 
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
91a do what we all hoped it would do and
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
I I guess I'm not quite speechless about
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
all the things that you alluded to
 
01:13:49.629 --> 01:13:49.639 align:start position:0%
alluding to something about the
 
01:13:53.189 --> 01:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman and allude to all these people
 
01:13:56.709 --> 01:13:56.719 align:start position:0%
who um uh are out there to get us or to
 
01:13:58.830 --> 01:13:58.840 align:start position:0%
get the municipal Association and I
 
01:14:01.470 --> 01:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could give us just the
 
01:14:04.350 --> 01:14:04.360 align:start position:0%
facts ma'am could you give me a list of
 
01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
where people from other countries always
 
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
countries with uh political philosophies
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
that differ from ours have asked uh
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
local communities to give them
 
01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
information could you give me a list of
 
01:14:20.629 --> 01:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
all of the businesses um that have made
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
life difficult for municipal
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
associations could you in fact document
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
all of the claims that you have made so
 
01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
that you could assure hny Penney that
 
01:14:36.189 --> 01:14:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
falling I can certainly look into that
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I would appreciate
 
01:14:43.669 --> 01:14:43.679 align:start position:0%
that because I would imagine you I don't
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
know what your professional training is
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
but whatever it is I assume your own
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
personal standards as such that you
 
01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:51.960 align:start position:0%
would not want to say things that you
 
01:14:55.149 --> 01:14:55.159 align:start position:0%
could not factually document I can
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
certainly contact the municipalities and
 
01:14:57.199 --> 01:14:58.149 align:start position:0%
certainly contact the municipalities and
have

01:14:58.149 --> 01:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
them you know put together a list for me
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
I would be ever so grateful thank you
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness yes
 
01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative Manos thank you Mr chair
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you Miss Cohen for taking my
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
question I wanted to know whether you're
 
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
familiar with the order that was entered
 
01:15:18.990 --> 01:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
in the Superior Court in the city of
 
01:15:21.950 --> 01:15:21.960 align:start position:0%
Rochester case I am familiar with that
 
01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
there is an order entered yes and does
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
the association
 
01:15:31.149 --> 01:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
disagree with the with the order and how
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
91a was interpreted in this particular
 
01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
case I
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
would I would need to reread the order
 
01:15:43.470 --> 01:15:43.480 align:start position:0%
right now but my understanding is that
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
there needs to be ties my understanding
 
01:15:47.590 --> 01:15:47.600 align:start position:0%
is that there needs to be some ties to
 
01:15:50.390 --> 01:15:50.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for that the records were
 
01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:54.440 align:start position:0%
were excuse me that the the records were
 
01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.550 align:start position:0%
were excuse me that the the records were
released

01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
released
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
to the the um person requesting them
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
from Maine as he was reporting on New
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
news would you um formally let us know
 
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:13.320 align:start position:0%
what the association's position is on
 
01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:14.110 align:start position:0%
what the association's position is on
the

01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
order I can thank you other questions
 
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:20.280 align:start position:0%
for this witness yes representative
 
01:16:22.590 --> 01:16:22.600 align:start position:0%
Andrew thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question for years I have
 
01:16:28.310 --> 01:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
been receiving
 
01:16:31.030 --> 01:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
electronic information from my school
 
01:16:33.510 --> 01:16:33.520 align:start position:0%
district from the town from a lot of
 
01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:36.760 align:start position:0%
places and I have never had any that I
 
01:16:40.910 --> 01:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
didn't receive can you give us a list of
 
01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:44.440 align:start position:0%
specific cases where electronic was sent
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
out and never received by the person
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
it I can look into
 
01:16:59.390 --> 01:16:59.400 align:start position:0%
that other questions for this witness
 
01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:02.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative petno thank you um if
 
01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
if you have written testimony I would
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
appreciate thank
 
01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:10.159 align:start position:0%
you other questions seeing none thank
 
01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
you very much ma'am and you know before
 
01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
I call on the before I call on the next
 
01:17:18.669 --> 01:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
witness can I just ask um if you have
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
written testimony we certainly want to
 
01:17:23.070 --> 01:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
receive it please do not hesitate to
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
give it to us but I I think it is it is
 
01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
generally not helpful for someone to
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
come up and just read their WR written
 
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
testimony so if you have uh please give
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
us your written testimony and we're
 
01:17:38.790 --> 01:17:38.800 align:start position:0%
happy to hear you testify orally but it
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
it's not particularly helpful to us if
 
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:44.400 align:start position:0%
you just sit there and read you know um
 
01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:46.280 align:start position:0%
your written uh written testimony
 
01:17:48.590 --> 01:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
because we can do that just as well as
 
01:17:50.790 --> 01:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
as you can right with that I'm going to
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:04.669 --> 01:18:04.679 align:start position:0%
on there it is there you go thank you
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
okay good morning I have no written
 
01:18:09.990 --> 01:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
testimony so um and I want to thank the
 
01:18:12.350 --> 01:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill I'm representing
 
01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:14.199 align:start position:0%
um right to know New Hampshire and
 
01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
myself to some extent um I'm I'm very
 
01:18:18.669 --> 01:18:18.679 align:start position:0%
appreciative that this bill was brought
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
forward um I I listened carefully to the
 
01:18:25.390 --> 01:18:25.400 align:start position:0%
last presentation and I don't think that
 
01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
the situation is the problem that was
 
01:18:29.629 --> 01:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
presented the way it was presented you
 
01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
know NASA receives lots of rights to
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
know requests last year they had about
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
350 a certain uh number of those maybe a
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
dozen were from outside um the state
 
01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
organization seeking records the city
 
01:18:45.070 --> 01:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
has always complied and and um given
 
01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
information to those requests I can tell
 
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
you that I have gone just after the UN
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
budsman um meeting last week that I came
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
up and testified on I submitted some
 
01:18:58.510 --> 01:18:58.520 align:start position:0%
requests to other states to get there on
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
budsman and um right to know um policies
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
and procedures that they have in their
 
01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
states and their reporting requirements
 
01:19:09.070 --> 01:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
essentially I made a records request as
 
01:19:11.709 --> 01:19:11.719 align:start position:0%
a New Hampshire citizen to other states
 
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
and I think that's very reasonable I
 
01:19:17.709 --> 01:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
also get um requests myself in
 
01:19:20.110 --> 01:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
information all the time from Foya
 
01:19:22.510 --> 01:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
groups that are seeking information from
 
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:24.520 align:start position:0%
our state and I notice Foya requests
 
01:19:27.709 --> 01:19:27.719 align:start position:0%
that come into NASA seeking records on
 
01:19:30.910 --> 01:19:30.920 align:start position:0%
how New Hampshire handles um certain
 
01:19:33.550 --> 01:19:33.560 align:start position:0%
right to know issues um to look at it
 
01:19:35.950 --> 01:19:35.960 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of the country
 
01:19:38.430 --> 01:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
responding to information requests and I
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
think that's all very reasonable um so
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
the concept of a person um in having to
 
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
be a citizen of New Hampshire I think
 
01:19:50.430 --> 01:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
we're getting we're we're blowing that
 
01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:52.840 align:start position:0%
up too much and that I I had written
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
down that Henny Penny sky is falling
 
01:19:57.870 --> 01:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
story too because that is exactly what I
 
01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
felt I heard and I I think a lot of
 
01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
times you you get this presentation that
 
01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:04.719 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a disaster it's going
 
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:07.480 align:start position:0%
to open Pandora's box and it doesn't and
 
01:20:09.510 --> 01:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
to give you an example of that in nashwa
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
when I was trying to get records off of
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
backup tape the city said oh this is
 
01:20:15.270 --> 01:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
going to be a disaster everyone's going
 
01:20:18.030 --> 01:20:18.040 align:start position:0%
to flood us that was in 2021 they have
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
never had a request for records off of
 
01:20:23.430 --> 01:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
backup tape again it was one isolated
 
01:20:25.629 --> 01:20:25.639 align:start position:0%
incident of records that were moved to
 
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
back up in just a month 30 days which
 
01:20:31.390 --> 01:20:31.400 align:start position:0%
was very quickly and the judge said you
 
01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
can have those it never happened it
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
didn't open Pandora's Box it didn't
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
create the problem so as far as so I I
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
really think that I I like the way the
 
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
definition of a person is in here I
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
don't think you're going to create this
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
huge problem for municipalities NASA has
 
01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
not complained at all about uh requests
 
01:20:53.189 --> 01:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
coming in from other states or countries
 
01:20:55.229 --> 01:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
and they do come they complain about
 
01:20:56.709 --> 01:20:56.719 align:start position:0%
their citizens doing them that's their
 
01:21:01.189 --> 01:21:01.199 align:start position:0%
focus not not other people so um I think
 
01:21:03.669 --> 01:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
that's not as big an issue Electronic
 
01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
media and taking records in electronic
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
format big supporter of that Nashville
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
really only does electronic format and
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
has only for 5 years uh this is the
 
01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
world we live in it's far more efficient
 
01:21:17.669 --> 01:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
and effective I don't think you're going
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
to have all these technology problems
 
01:21:20.709 --> 01:21:20.719 align:start position:0%
that they're looking at you're going to
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
encounter some but you are able to move
 
01:21:27.629 --> 01:21:27.639 align:start position:0%
the records without compiling much less
 
01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:30.400 align:start position:0%
inexpensively um you know and and the
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
whole purpose is getting information out
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
as quickly as you can to the requester
 
01:21:37.270 --> 01:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
and this is a way of doing it and you
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
know I can't imagine these uh
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities that are demanding you
 
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
come in face to face take their copies
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
that They're copying pay a fee that
 
01:21:49.629 --> 01:21:49.639 align:start position:0%
that's even necessary anymore I mean so
 
01:21:52.229 --> 01:21:52.239 align:start position:0%
much is in electronic format and I ask
 
01:21:54.950 --> 01:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
you to consider RSA 33a for Municipal
 
01:21:57.590 --> 01:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
record retention we certainly permit our
 
01:22:00.229 --> 01:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
paper files stored that need to be
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
stored for years or forever to be put on
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
electronic media that's part of the the
 
01:22:07.709 --> 01:22:07.719 align:start position:0%
law you you know paper doesn't last for
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
any ever we are the the agencies are
 
01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
allowed to create Electronic media for
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
all of those records and they do and the
 
01:22:17.590 --> 01:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
only requirement is is that they have to
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
update it periodically you can't leave
 
01:22:21.830 --> 01:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
information on a floppy drive for 30
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
years and then go to retrieve it and no
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
one has the drive anymore so you do have
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
to move it to the proper um storage
 
01:22:30.070 --> 01:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
format but they do that to consolidate
 
01:22:32.070 --> 01:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
to minimize Vault space and to get a
 
01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
handle on the records it's available
 
01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
it's the world we live in today and I
 
01:22:38.350 --> 01:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
think that is just perfect and I really
 
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate this Bill thank you very much
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
01:22:45.030 --> 01:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on representative
 
01:22:46.679 --> 01:22:51.790 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on representative
Jess

01:22:51.790 --> 01:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.270 --> 01:22:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.950 --> 01:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
me that way I can stand up without the
 
01:23:02.910 --> 01:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
seats sticking to me but uh I'm I'm a
 
01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards representing
 
01:23:08.430 --> 01:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 31 um uh that's
 
01:23:11.790 --> 01:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
Auburn Chester uh Candia and
 
01:23:14.709 --> 01:23:14.719 align:start position:0%
Deerfield I uh I'm I'm not speaking in
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
my role as a State Rep uh right now I'm
 
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
speaking uh as an
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
experienced um uh risk assessment risk
 
01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
man manager um both in the it area uh
 
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:31.840 align:start position:0%
and also in physical defense uh with
 
01:23:33.990 --> 01:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
experience in places like
 
01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan and I I just want to speak
 
01:23:39.750 --> 01:23:39.760 align:start position:0%
on defense of um the Henny Penney
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
comments um uh professional Risk
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
Managers are obligated to follow solid
 
01:23:51.110 --> 01:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
risk assessment uh practices and and
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
that basically uh means that you're
 
01:23:56.709 --> 01:23:56.719 align:start position:0%
supposed to be able to take a look at
 
01:23:59.229 --> 01:23:59.239 align:start position:0%
any kind of a risk that may occur that
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
will damage the Integrity of your
 
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
operation or your system and do two
 
01:24:07.229 --> 01:24:07.239 align:start position:0%
things you perform a probability
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
assessment how probable is something to
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
happen and uh what would be the impact
 
01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
um and if you take those two factors you
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
can figure if it's highly probable with
 
01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
a huge impact you definitely want to put
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
it into your risk mitigation strategy
 
01:24:27.870 --> 01:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
IES and if it's not at all probable or
 
01:24:30.669 --> 01:24:30.679 align:start position:0%
it's not going to have an impact then
 
01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:35.320 align:start position:0%
you can ignore it with some comfort um
 
01:24:38.510 --> 01:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
but um but it seems as though we're
 
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
trying to um anticipate a serious risk
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
assessment on what might happen if this
 
01:24:50.189 --> 01:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
law gets opened up and I don't think you
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
should Forstall a serious professional
 
01:24:57.510 --> 01:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
conversation on that um things that
 
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
maybe uh that have occurred that there
 
01:25:03.070 --> 01:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
were people who said oh that'll never
 
01:25:04.990 --> 01:25:05.000 align:start position:0%
happen only Henny Penney would come up
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
with that uh you the Titanic HD an
 
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
iceberg had people should have been
 
01:25:12.629 --> 01:25:12.639 align:start position:0%
thinking might we hit an iceberg in the
 
01:25:16.109 --> 01:25:16.119 align:start position:0%
winter in the North Sea uh covid came up
 
01:25:18.629 --> 01:25:18.639 align:start position:0%
we hadn't had a pandemic in a 100 years
 
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
it might have been a good idea to have a
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
risk management strategy that was better
 
01:25:25.149 --> 01:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
to deal with the pandemic
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
9/11 occurred that had never happened
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
before we probably should have had a
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
good plan or at least some sort of a
 
01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
risk mitigation to try to prevent that
 
01:25:36.950 --> 01:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
sort of thing from happening uh the
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
South Carolina or the excuse me the
 
01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
South California fires that that had
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
never happened in a 100 years it
 
01:25:46.430 --> 01:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
probably would have been a good thing to
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
have a risk management strategy to
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
anticipate something like that just
 
01:25:53.830 --> 01:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
dismissing and demeaning the possible
 
01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.229 align:start position:0%
dismissing and demeaning the possible
real

01:25:55.229 --> 01:25:55.239 align:start position:0%
real
 
01:25:58.109 --> 01:25:58.119 align:start position:0%
is not a professional way of going in my
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
view and so when these folks come up and
 
01:26:04.470 --> 01:26:04.480 align:start position:0%
like the municipal Association and and
 
01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
and share with us as a legislator from
 
01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:09.400 align:start position:0%
their experience the kinds of things
 
01:26:11.070 --> 01:26:11.080 align:start position:0%
that they've been seeing and what their
 
01:26:13.390 --> 01:26:13.400 align:start position:0%
professional instincts are I think we
 
01:26:15.550 --> 01:26:15.560 align:start position:0%
should be listening to them instead of
 
01:26:18.030 --> 01:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
demanding they produce data that no
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
other witness is being asked to produce
 
01:26:23.950 --> 01:26:23.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm perhaps reacting a little bit
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
but uh but I'm I'm I'm kind of offended
 
01:26:31.229 --> 01:26:31.239 align:start position:0%
the way um Ms Cohen was was treated and
 
01:26:33.830 --> 01:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
and how she was dismissed out of hand
 
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:35.639 align:start position:0%
when she was sharing with the
 
01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
legislature some serious concerns in the
 
01:26:42.109 --> 01:26:42.119 align:start position:0%
IT world we constantly worried about
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
things like denial of service attacks on
 
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
our it infrastructure what is being
 
01:26:50.790 --> 01:26:50.800 align:start position:0%
described by the municipal Association
 
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
is a type of a denial of service attack
 
01:26:57.229 --> 01:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
where if we open up the number of
 
01:27:00.870 --> 01:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities for somebody to to present
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
a right to know request we should
 
01:27:05.430 --> 01:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
anticipate the
 
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
possibility and of of a large number of
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
attacks happening to uh overwhelm our
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
systems as a political denial of service
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
attack so um I I I I like the idea
 
01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
earlier of somebody saying that there
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
should be a working group put together
 
01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:24.830 align:start position:0%
should be a working group put together
um

01:27:24.830 --> 01:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
um so that these kinds of things can be
 
01:27:32.270 --> 01:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
discussed and agreed to um that's um oh
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
and one other thing it's been said a
 
01:27:35.910 --> 01:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
couple of times that we can just use
 
01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
email or something to email a PDF I
 
01:27:41.270 --> 01:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
don't know how many of you have ever
 
01:27:44.550 --> 01:27:44.560 align:start position:0%
applied for a mortgage but if you apply
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
for a mortgage there's a a very formal
 
01:27:50.149 --> 01:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
process an IT system set up so that any
 
01:27:52.229 --> 01:27:52.239 align:start position:0%
electronic document they send you tons
 
01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:54.920 align:start position:0%
of them every electronic doc document
 
01:27:57.470 --> 01:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
that they send you comes with a docy
 
01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
sign so you have proof that the transfer
 
01:28:04.830 --> 01:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
took place to say oh we can just email
 
01:28:07.470 --> 01:28:07.480 align:start position:0%
that you still have to then have the
 
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
obligation to maintain a record uh that
 
01:28:12.870 --> 01:28:12.880 align:start position:0%
you've provided that document and it
 
01:28:15.550 --> 01:28:15.560 align:start position:0%
recurrently if you're just using email
 
01:28:18.310 --> 01:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
that system to assure that you've uh met
 
01:28:20.070 --> 01:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
your obligation to provide the
 
01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
electronic document then is done in
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
parallel and is is uh fraught with um
 
01:28:29.310 --> 01:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
mistakes and errors so I think if we
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
were to go to a wholesale cross the
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
state effort to um do electronic
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
transfer of all these documents we
 
01:28:40.470 --> 01:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
probably need to look at a serious
 
01:28:42.310 --> 01:28:42.320 align:start position:0%
investment in something like a docky
 
01:28:44.669 --> 01:28:44.679 align:start position:0%
sign system so that there's a valid
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
legal record that we've met Our
 
01:28:50.189 --> 01:28:50.199 align:start position:0%
obligation to transfer the documents uh
 
01:28:51.629 --> 01:28:51.639 align:start position:0%
that's really what I wanted to say
 
01:28:56.669 --> 01:28:56.679 align:start position:0%
relative to um um HP 66 thank you
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
represent questions for this
 
01:29:01.470 --> 01:29:01.480 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr chair thank you
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative um I was intrigued about
 
01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.629 align:start position:0%
representative um I was intrigued about
your

01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:29:13.629 --> 01:29:13.639 align:start position:0%
your wish that we do predictive thinking
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh as well in in addition to simply
 
01:29:20.030 --> 01:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
talking about what's been in the past so
 
01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:24.119 align:start position:0%
I want to ask you whether in terms of
 
01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:28.080 align:start position:0%
the new usages of algorithms the new
 
01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
usages of AI right um we've heard
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
references to commercial aggregation of
 
01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:39.760 align:start position:0%
data yep uh do you think those concerns
 
01:29:42.430 --> 01:29:42.440 align:start position:0%
with respect to right to know should
 
01:29:44.669 --> 01:29:44.679 align:start position:0%
just be dismissed no I think we really
 
01:29:47.310 --> 01:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
need to take a serious look at well
 
01:29:48.750 --> 01:29:48.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question but I think
 
01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
we should take a serious look at uh the
 
01:29:54.030 --> 01:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
rapidly changing landscape just
 
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
yesterday a half a trillion dollar deal
 
01:29:59.870 --> 01:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
was announced in order to massively
 
01:30:03.030 --> 01:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
develop AI capabilities now this is not
 
01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
a press release we would have heard two
 
01:30:07.109 --> 01:30:07.119 align:start position:0%
years ago so things are changing very
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
rapidly uh in the AI World there there
 
01:30:14.390 --> 01:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
would be nothing to preclude under uh uh
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
saying that uh any person anywhere
 
01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
located in any place when any person
 
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:24.520 align:start position:0%
could actually get immediately
 
01:30:27.709 --> 01:30:27.719 align:start position:0%
interpreted to be a a corporation uh
 
01:30:30.629 --> 01:30:30.639 align:start position:0%
which you know legally corporations are
 
01:30:34.830 --> 01:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
people uh for an entity uh anywhere in
 
01:30:38.669 --> 01:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
the world to be set up to use AI to
 
01:30:42.709 --> 01:30:42.719 align:start position:0%
generate um um commercial requests on a
 
01:30:46.510 --> 01:30:46.520 align:start position:0%
massive scale and given what we've seen
 
01:30:49.510 --> 01:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh I think in the last few years about
 
01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
uh using lawfare to slow down our
 
01:30:56.109 --> 01:30:56.119 align:start position:0%
legitimate political processes I think
 
01:30:58.270 --> 01:30:58.280 align:start position:0%
we could anticipate an entity
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
considering a massive denial of service
 
01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
attacks using AI supported engines in
 
01:31:09.109 --> 01:31:09.119 align:start position:0%
order to bog down government so much it
 
01:31:11.990 --> 01:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
can't operate and then we start to fall
 
01:31:14.950 --> 01:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
into violation of our legal obligations
 
01:31:19.470 --> 01:31:19.480 align:start position:0%
to transfer um the documents so so now
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
is going back to the idea of probability
 
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
and impact Act is that highly probable
 
01:31:28.990 --> 01:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
well not today should we be thinking 3
 
01:31:31.390 --> 01:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
years from now 10 years from now how far
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
into the future do you want to look I
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
think depending on your time Horizon
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's a legitimate threat um and what's
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
the impact of that I think the impact
 
01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
would be pretty serious because the
 
01:31:45.590 --> 01:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
legislature couldn't respond to provide
 
01:31:48.550 --> 01:31:48.560 align:start position:0%
the legal relief quickly and then we'd
 
01:31:51.629 --> 01:31:51.639 align:start position:0%
end up in court a lot so so I don't know
 
01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
if I answered your questions or I went
 
01:31:57.149 --> 01:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
too far but but um depending on the time
 
01:32:00.750 --> 01:32:00.760 align:start position:0%
Horizon you you give the threat the
 
01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:03.400 align:start position:0%
threat becomes more
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
likely other questions for this witness
 
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:32:10.470 --> 01:32:10.480 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards representative se
 
01:32:20.070 --> 01:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
please thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um I just
 
01:32:27.109 --> 01:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to read a an email I receiv
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
received from our town clerk um who
 
01:32:31.990 --> 01:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
expressed grave concern about this bill
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
based on the impact and uh before I get
 
01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:36.400 align:start position:0%
into that I should just say earlier this
 
01:32:39.669 --> 01:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
year um around the time of the election
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
in Durham our town clerk's office was
 
01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:46.119 align:start position:0%
subject I believe it was to um almost a
 
01:32:47.790 --> 01:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
thousand right I've lost track but it
 
01:32:49.470 --> 01:32:49.480 align:start position:0%
was some obscene number of right to no
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
request demanding records that were not
 
01:32:53.310 --> 01:32:53.320 align:start position:0%
actually legally entitled to the person
 
01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
who was request trusting them um but it
 
01:32:58.030 --> 01:32:58.040 align:start position:0%
was taking as you can imagine hours of
 
01:33:02.590 --> 01:33:02.600 align:start position:0%
time for legal processes to occur
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
um yes certainly um if I could just
 
01:33:06.950 --> 01:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
interrupt representative would you make
 
01:33:09.310 --> 01:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
clear that we in fact knew where those
 
01:33:10.830 --> 01:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
were coming from and they were all
 
01:33:13.310 --> 01:33:13.320 align:start position:0%
coming from the same person who was a
 
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
resident of of New Hampshire of
 
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
Durham the the right to no requests that
 
01:33:19.709 --> 01:33:19.719 align:start position:0%
were coming were in fact not from
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
someone who was a resident of our
 
01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
community as far as I know they were
 
01:33:26.189 --> 01:33:26.199 align:start position:0%
coming from um their or at least their
 
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
attorney who was submitting them was not
 
01:33:29.550 --> 01:33:29.560 align:start position:0%
a member of the community and was um on
 
01:33:31.189 --> 01:33:31.199 align:start position:0%
behalf of a member on behalf of of
 
01:33:32.629 --> 01:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
someone who was claiming to be a member
 
01:33:35.709 --> 01:33:35.719 align:start position:0%
of our community that's correct it's not
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
yes so but there there were it was
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
taking hours and hours and preventing
 
01:33:42.030 --> 01:33:42.040 align:start position:0%
them from being able to do legitimate
 
01:33:46.470 --> 01:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
business um during that time so
 
01:33:50.430 --> 01:33:50.440 align:start position:0%
um sorry let me where was I okay so um
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
if passed um HB 66 would create
 
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
significant issues for the town of
 
01:33:56.669 --> 01:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
Durham particularly the Durhamtown
 
01:33:58.950 --> 01:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
clerk's office the clerk's office is
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
minimally staffed with two and a half
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
employees a town cler for 40 plus hours
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
a deputy at 35 and an assistant at 20 to
 
01:34:08.109 --> 01:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
25 we are currently responsible for
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
multiple duties serving dual roses
 
01:34:12.790 --> 01:34:12.800 align:start position:0%
clerks and collectors our D duties of
 
01:34:14.550 --> 01:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
property tax collection water sewer
 
01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
collection and all clerk
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities like Motor Vehicle
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
Registration licensing and elections the
 
01:34:21.790 --> 01:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
current roles are already more complex
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
and difficult with new laws passed in 20
 
01:34:27.629 --> 01:34:27.639 align:start position:0%
24 if this law passes in 2025 staff
 
01:34:29.070 --> 01:34:29.080 align:start position:0%
would could be faced with requests for
 
01:34:31.149 --> 01:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
large volumes of information putting a
 
01:34:33.189 --> 01:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
strain on an already busy and minimally
 
01:34:35.149 --> 01:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
staffed office with no recourse except a
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
charge for photocopying costs and
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
postage after a grueling season of right
 
01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:42.920 align:start position:0%
to no requests in November 2024 and a
 
01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
series of trying First Amendment audits
 
01:34:48.629 --> 01:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
in December 2024 the Durham town clerk
 
01:34:49.950 --> 01:34:49.960 align:start position:0%
tax collector's office and the New
 
01:34:51.390 --> 01:34:51.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire City and town clerk's
 
01:34:53.790 --> 01:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
Association believe these bills will con
 
01:34:55.470 --> 01:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
continue a concerning Trend that targets
 
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities and local government
 
01:34:59.669 --> 01:34:59.679 align:start position:0%
officials um and
 
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
further by changing this to from citizen
 
01:35:06.669 --> 01:35:06.679 align:start position:0%
to person um and also mandating that
 
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
bills be sent electronically or by mail
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
rather than being made available allows
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
for electronic request with the request
 
01:35:15.990 --> 01:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
or choosing the method of delivery um it
 
01:35:17.990 --> 01:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh the organization opposes the bill
 
01:35:19.189 --> 01:35:19.199 align:start position:0%
because the use of person could lead to
 
01:35:21.390 --> 01:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
a flood of requests from non-residents
 
01:35:22.990 --> 01:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
including administrative burdens and
 
01:35:25.709 --> 01:35:25.719 align:start position:0%
cost four me municipalities um and it
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
could Aid in fraudulent activities and
 
01:35:29.910 --> 01:35:29.920 align:start position:0%
identity theft um including but not
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
limited to AI Bots posing as individuals
 
01:35:35.470 --> 01:35:35.480 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of har harvesting
 
01:35:37.229 --> 01:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
personal information from Municipal
 
01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
records so for all of those reasons I
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
agree with our town clerk I don't
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
support this bill I think that there are
 
01:35:45.270 --> 01:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
way too many challenges with it and it
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
needs to stay more limited thank you
 
01:35:49.709 --> 01:35:49.719 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yes
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative petno can you submit that
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
letter as written testimony for for the
 
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
committee please so I I do know that uh
 
01:35:58.229 --> 01:35:58.239 align:start position:0%
the town clerk has also sent it to
 
01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh Smith so that if I
 
01:36:02.030 --> 01:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
forget to do that between the two of us
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
we should hopefully remember but um
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative Smith most assuredly has
 
01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:07.560 align:start position:0%
a copy as does representative is
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%

um the use of the word Citizen and um I
 
01:37:11.550 --> 01:37:11.560 align:start position:0%
wonder if the quote accurately um

represented your views I believe we're
 
01:37:19.470 --> 01:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
talking about a case 2023 RKO 2023 D if
 
01:37:20.590 --> 01:37:20.600 align:start position:0%
I recall
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
08 it was a case in which uh can I just
 
01:37:26.109 --> 01:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
interrupt I assume the case you're going
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%

01:37:31.629 --> 01:37:31.639 align:start position:0%

point I know the case was taken to the
 
01:37:35.750 --> 01:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
superior court I know have no idea what
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
happens after a case comes out of my
 
01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
office I'm not I only find out if cases
 
01:37:42.950 --> 01:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
are appealed by people telling me
 
01:37:45.629 --> 01:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
they've been appealed okay um I'm I'm
 
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
not going to go into details of the case
 
01:37:50.229 --> 01:37:50.239 align:start position:0%
other than to say that my uh opinion in
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
that matter that was appealed to
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
Superior Court and affirmed by the
 
01:37:55.709 --> 01:37:55.719 align:start position:0%
superior court is available through my
 
01:37:59.350 --> 01:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
website which gives a link to which
 
01:38:01.229 --> 01:38:01.239 align:start position:0%
gives a link to the New Hampshire
 
01:38:03.870 --> 01:38:03.880 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court Law Library which has a
 
01:38:05.629 --> 01:38:05.639 align:start position:0%
lot of my decisions there or I could
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
provide you with a copy of 20238 if you
 
01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.709 align:start position:0%
provide you with a copy of 20238 if you
would

01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
like if you could just tell me do you
 
01:38:17.310 --> 01:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
agree with what was said as to what your
 
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
position was uh the opinion was uh
 
01:38:23.870 --> 01:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
specific to the facts of that case in
 
01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
that case one of the main things that I
 
01:38:30.270 --> 01:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
did was I deferred to the court and the
 
01:38:33.550 --> 01:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
legislature in regard to some of the
 
01:38:37.109 --> 01:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
definitions and in that case it in that
 
01:38:39.589 --> 01:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
on the facts of that particular case I
 
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
found for the uh for the claim it thank
 
01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:45.320 align:start position:0%
you very much and it was very kind of
 
01:38:46.510 --> 01:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
you to agree
 
01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:49.800 align:start position:0%
to all right uh and representative Lynn
 
01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:52.920 align:start position:0%
I I I don't think that anything has gone
 
01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
any further in that case but I don't
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
know that that's fine thank thank you
 
01:38:56.159 --> 01:38:58.990 align:start position:0%
know that that's fine thank thank you
very

01:38:58.990 --> 01:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:04.270 --> 01:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:07.470 --> 01:39:07.480 align:start position:0%
uh oh God
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
sure right um uh so I'm going to close
 
01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:25.350 --> 01:39:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.310 --> 01:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
former representative Josh
 
01:39:31.189 --> 01:39:31.199 align:start position:0%
Kella hello thank you for uh taking my
 
01:39:33.070 --> 01:39:33.080 align:start position:0%
my testimony one of uh is going to be
 
01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
very very short one of the things that I
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
didn't hear mentioned um about the
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
issues with Citizen and and clarify
 
01:39:45.790 --> 01:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
making it required to be a citizen or a
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
taxpayer or something like that is that
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
a municipality could require proof of
 
01:39:56.149 --> 01:39:56.159 align:start position:0%
citizenship or taxpayer status or some
 
01:39:58.750 --> 01:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
other you know residence or tied to New
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or some other um thing before
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
they consider it a valid request under
 
01:40:09.270 --> 01:40:09.280 align:start position:0%
91a and so we could get tied up in you
 
01:40:12.870 --> 01:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
know is this a a you know
 
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
expired uh license or how long ago was
 
01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
this lease or whatever the case is that
 
01:40:21.310 --> 01:40:21.320 align:start position:0%
someone needs to to prove that they have
 
01:40:24.990 --> 01:40:25.000 align:start position:0%
some tie to New Hampshire and so using
 
01:40:28.510 --> 01:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
the the language of person means that
 
01:40:32.350 --> 01:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
you don't need to prove that you you
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
know are like are a real person and not
 
01:40:38.470 --> 01:40:38.480 align:start position:0%
a computer program or um something like
 
01:40:41.629 --> 01:40:41.639 align:start position:0%
that uh to the municipality before they
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
accept your request and start that
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
deadline right they have a deadline to
 
01:40:48.750 --> 01:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
to meet those requests and if they you
 
01:40:50.669 --> 01:40:50.679 align:start position:0%
know go back and forth with you saying
 
01:40:52.910 --> 01:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
that you should prove that you are you
 
01:40:55.629 --> 01:40:55.639 align:start position:0%
know have this tied to New Hampshire I
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
think that this bill would um eliminate
 
01:41:02.510 --> 01:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
that potential uh hurdle so something to
 
01:41:04.270 --> 01:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
consider thank you questions for this
 
01:41:07.390 --> 01:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you
 
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely I have no other cards on this
 
01:41:12.189 --> 01:41:12.199 align:start position:0%
bill and so I'm going to close the
 
01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:33.109 --> 01:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
all right um so yeah as is obvious we're
 
01:41:35.070 --> 01:41:35.080 align:start position:0%
running quite a bit over um I guess what
 
01:41:37.229 --> 01:41:37.239 align:start position:0%
I would say is as we get close to the
 
01:41:39.030 --> 01:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
lunch hour if people we don't have to
 
01:41:40.790 --> 01:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
have a quorum for hearing so if people
 
01:41:43.189 --> 01:41:43.199 align:start position:0%
want to take a break to have lunch um
 
01:41:44.589 --> 01:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
we'll make sure I mean I'm going to be
 
01:41:48.030 --> 01:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
here um until people at least until
 
01:41:50.149 --> 01:41:50.159 align:start position:0%
people return um but and I think we
 
01:41:52.310 --> 01:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
should have you know at least a few
 
01:41:53.950 --> 01:41:53.960 align:start position:0%
Representatives here at at all times but
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
if people want to uh take a break for
 
01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
lunch that that's fine um I'm now going
 
01:42:01.870 --> 01:42:01.880 align:start position:0%
to open the hearing on the next bill
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
which is HB 74 and I would recognize U
 
01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
representative uh Edwards to um
 
01:42:13.470 --> 01:42:13.480 align:start position:0%
appear uh in in uh as a prime sponsor of
 
01:42:16.750 --> 01:42:16.760 align:start position:0%
that bill uh thank you Mr chair and uh
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
as I stated earlier I'm represenative
 
01:42:20.629 --> 01:42:20.639 align:start position:0%
Jess Edwards representing Rockingham
 
01:42:23.830 --> 01:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
District 31 that includes uh Auburn
 
01:42:28.470 --> 01:42:28.480 align:start position:0%
Candia Deerfield and Chester um uh House
 
01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:29.910 align:start position:0%
Candia Deerfield and Chester um uh House
Bill

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
01:42:33.310 --> 01:42:33.320 align:start position:0%
74 uh was intended over the summer
 
01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:38.639 align:start position:0%
months to be uh a a a method to which we
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh between the sponsor of the prior Bill
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
and this bill um uh to provide the this
 
01:42:48.990 --> 01:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
policy committee uh with a couple of
 
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
different ways to handle the Rochester
 
01:42:55.830 --> 01:42:55.840 align:start position:0%
case uh this this bill um attempts to
 
01:42:58.030 --> 01:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
address the issue of citizenship that
 
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
was brought up in the case and resolve
 
01:43:05.229 --> 01:43:05.239 align:start position:0%
it I think in a a much more narrow way
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
um uh and uh I and I think before we get
 
01:43:12.709 --> 01:43:12.719 align:start position:0%
into it um I I don't know the history
 
01:43:15.149 --> 01:43:15.159 align:start position:0%
and right to know apparently it's goes
 
01:43:20.109 --> 01:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
back to 2012 and earlier um it sounded
 
01:43:23.589 --> 01:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
as though the the purpose of of the
 
01:43:27.709 --> 01:43:27.719 align:start position:0%
right to no law is to provide uh our our
 
01:43:30.910 --> 01:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
citizens our voters an opportunity for
 
01:43:34.109 --> 01:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
them to have the transparency into what
 
01:43:37.950 --> 01:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
we do so that they can get involved we
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
are a very decentralized government in
 
01:43:42.790 --> 01:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that would be consistent
 
01:43:45.189 --> 01:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
with the idea that we want to uh be able
 
01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
to decentralize all the way to the
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
individual in our state so that they're
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
able to get involved and get engaged in
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
the school boards the select boards all
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
of those things right and and and so so
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
if that's the intent or the purpose of
 
01:44:04.229 --> 01:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
right to
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
know the question then gets to be is it
 
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
also the purpose of right to know to
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
provide support
 
01:44:14.950 --> 01:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
for potentially International commercial
 
01:44:17.589 --> 01:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
Enterprises trying to scrape data
 
01:44:20.310 --> 01:44:20.320 align:start position:0%
together in order to figure out how to
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
Market or sell it and I and I think that
 
01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
that fundamental determination of what
 
01:44:29.030 --> 01:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
the the purpose of this law is is is
 
01:44:31.470 --> 01:44:31.480 align:start position:0%
kind of fundamental to which way you may
 
01:44:34.870 --> 01:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
want to go but um let's let's let's
 
01:44:40.030 --> 01:44:40.040 align:start position:0%
touch Stone here on where we're at today
 
01:44:42.910 --> 01:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
where we're at today is if you look at
 
01:44:45.070 --> 01:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
um the definition of governmental
 
01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
proceedings and current law it means the
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
transaction of any functions affecting
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
any or all citizens of the state by a
 
01:44:58.149 --> 01:44:58.159 align:start position:0%
public body so in that language it it it
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
implies to me that the original purpose
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
was to uh support the citizens of the
 
01:45:08.709 --> 01:45:08.719 align:start position:0%
state and and not a broader category of
 
01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:11.960 align:start position:0%
all persons living anywhere in the world
 
01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
or corporations that that may represent
 
01:45:19.870 --> 01:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
them so so I so so I I I think if we
 
01:45:24.229 --> 01:45:24.239 align:start position:0%
want to stay more narrow uh what you see
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
is in line six and seven of HB
 
01:45:33.149 --> 01:45:33.159 align:start position:0%
74 um is uh citizen gets defined as
 
01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:36.080 align:start position:0%
meaning any person having a legal status
 
01:45:39.790 --> 01:45:39.800 align:start position:0%
in in relation to New Hampshire by
 
01:45:44.669 --> 01:45:44.679 align:start position:0%
virtue of do of domicile now why why was
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
the word domicile chosen well
 
01:45:51.390 --> 01:45:51.400 align:start position:0%
domicile ties uh one of the definitions
 
01:45:54.189 --> 01:45:54.199 align:start position:0%
in our statutes that I think is I
 
01:45:56.189 --> 01:45:56.199 align:start position:0%
understand is critical to all of our
 
01:46:00.189 --> 01:46:00.199 align:start position:0%
voting laws domicile is is fundamental
 
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
so that word was chosen to to to uh to
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
build on and to leverage the idea that
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
we want an informed public uh also the
 
01:46:12.990 --> 01:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
or statement connects it or any press
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
acting on informing the citizens well a
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
well-informed citizen is is important so
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
having press act to inform the public is
 
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
also important now I didn't Define press
 
01:46:29.310 --> 01:46:29.320 align:start position:0%
I could have but I didn't because
 
01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
personally I would Define it as as as
 
01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
any entity that is trying to take
 
01:46:37.589 --> 01:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
information and make it available to the
 
01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
public so that could be a 12-year-old
 
01:46:41.870 --> 01:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
writing a book report that gets
 
01:46:44.350 --> 01:46:44.360 align:start position:0%
published in the local newspaper that
 
01:46:47.709 --> 01:46:47.719 align:start position:0%
that that kid would be press uh in my
 
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
view of that definition but but I didn't
 
01:46:53.510 --> 01:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
I didn't go that far so
 
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
so what HB 74 does it offers the
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
committee uh sort of a an a way to just
 
01:47:02.790 --> 01:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
make a bare incremental change to the
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
law a small incremental change so that
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
the the the issue found in by the
 
01:47:12.149 --> 01:47:12.159 align:start position:0%
Rochester Court can be resolved um
 
01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
without opening it up to everything
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
everywhere at any time in the world um
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
so so I so I command line six and seven
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
as an alternative now now uh HB
 
01:47:36.229 --> 01:47:36.239 align:start position:0%
66 um shares with this one the idea of
 
01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
taking the preliminary the the words
 
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:40.920 align:start position:0%
preliminary draft circulated to a quorum
 
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
or a majority of the public body that
 
01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
does not change the law the that is
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
perfectly consistent with the law what
 
01:47:52.229 --> 01:47:52.239 align:start position:0%
it does is it takes from the deep bowels
 
01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
of the bill B um that uh obligation to
 
01:47:58.390 --> 01:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
share those kinds of
 
01:48:01.229 --> 01:48:01.239 align:start position:0%
documents uh cleans up the language to
 
01:48:03.390 --> 01:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
make it an affirmative instead of a
 
01:48:06.109 --> 01:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
negative and brings it up and elevates
 
01:48:08.550 --> 01:48:08.560 align:start position:0%
it higher in the bill so it's just
 
01:48:10.910 --> 01:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
easier for the public to interpret you
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
know I think it's kind of interesting
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
that this is a transparency Bill and
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
what this language does is it just makes
 
01:48:20.589 --> 01:48:20.599 align:start position:0%
it transparent what the purpos is now
 
01:48:23.629 --> 01:48:23.639 align:start position:0%
why did I think that needed to be done
 
01:48:27.189 --> 01:48:27.199 align:start position:0%
last term I had a reporter come to me a
 
01:48:30.310 --> 01:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
credible I think a credible reporter and
 
01:48:34.350 --> 01:48:34.360 align:start position:0%
uh she reported to me that um in her
 
01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
experience some of the more
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic public bodies used this
 
01:48:46.149 --> 01:48:46.159 align:start position:0%
technique where they would hide the ball
 
01:48:48.629 --> 01:48:48.639 align:start position:0%
they they would keep something in a
 
01:48:52.109 --> 01:48:52.119 align:start position:0%
draft status even though it was known to
 
01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:54.400 align:start position:0%
have gone out out to the people of the
 
01:48:57.310 --> 01:48:57.320 align:start position:0%
public body and just say no it's a draft
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
we don't publish drafts and then talking
 
01:49:04.430 --> 01:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
to the udman about that situation um uh
 
01:49:06.189 --> 01:49:06.199 align:start position:0%
three years ago at this
 
01:49:09.350 --> 01:49:09.360 align:start position:0%
point um it was it was clear to the
 
01:49:12.750 --> 01:49:12.760 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman that the draft after X days I
 
01:49:14.750 --> 01:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
think it was 10 or something like that
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
becomes accessible and um and and that
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
the entity that was hiding the ball if a
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
formal complaint had been filed would
 
01:49:28.790 --> 01:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
have been told to share the documents
 
01:49:32.310 --> 01:49:32.320 align:start position:0%
but that sort of process slows the whole
 
01:49:36.629 --> 01:49:36.639 align:start position:0%
thing down so if you have uh a a a
 
01:49:38.830 --> 01:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
public body that doesn't want to be
 
01:49:42.109 --> 01:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
transparent a technique that seems to be
 
01:49:46.750 --> 01:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
possible is is to play dumb and say it's
 
01:49:51.270 --> 01:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
a draft when uh a technical analysis of
 
01:49:53.149 --> 01:49:53.159 align:start position:0%
the situation would indicate
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
that it's a draft whose time has come
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
and should be made available upon
 
01:50:00.270 --> 01:50:00.280 align:start position:0%
request so this was meant to just bring
 
01:50:02.870 --> 01:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
it up higher so that it would be tougher
 
01:50:06.390 --> 01:50:06.400 align:start position:0%
to deny the obligations of all public
 
01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:12.910 align:start position:0%
to deny the obligations of all public
boards

01:50:12.910 --> 01:50:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.109 --> 01:50:16.119 align:start position:0%
um and I I said things in my previous
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
testimony that I would carry forward in
 
01:50:22.910 --> 01:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
here you know um email email management
 
01:50:25.350 --> 01:50:25.360 align:start position:0%
is a huge challenge you know that's why
 
01:50:28.470 --> 01:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
mortgage companies go to a much tougher
 
01:50:32.350 --> 01:50:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh system those are those cost money
 
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:35.440 align:start position:0%
maintaining uh email management records
 
01:50:38.790 --> 01:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
in parallel from email and stuff is in
 
01:50:40.830 --> 01:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
fact additional workload and creates
 
01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
additional risk for the entity so those
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
the evid the testimony that said there's
 
01:50:48.149 --> 01:50:48.159 align:start position:0%
no more work involved in just emailing
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
and it's simple that's not true uh
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
that's not that's not the full story
 
01:50:56.669 --> 01:50:56.679 align:start position:0%
um that's it that that's my testimony I
 
01:50:58.030 --> 01:50:58.040 align:start position:0%
didn't think it was going to be this
 
01:51:00.990 --> 01:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
complicated Mr chairman I I just thought
 
01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
this was going to lay it out pick a or
 
01:51:06.189 --> 01:51:06.199 align:start position:0%
pick B like a Chinese menu but man I
 
01:51:08.589 --> 01:51:08.599 align:start position:0%
learned a lot today so no I think we I
 
01:51:09.990 --> 01:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
think we both did I mean I think you
 
01:51:12.189 --> 01:51:12.199 align:start position:0%
know we both I I think we both had a
 
01:51:14.950 --> 01:51:14.960 align:start position:0%
sense that uh that we understood the
 
01:51:17.229 --> 01:51:17.239 align:start position:0%
issues and we both kind of I mean I
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
we're both supporters of both bills so I
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
I very much appreciate
 
01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
that I I'd add that we're both big
 
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
supporters of public transparency that
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
we want an informed public engaged in
 
01:51:32.470 --> 01:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
their government for sure questions for
 
01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
this wi representative
 
01:51:37.750 --> 01:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
HG yes I remember from my work on other
 
01:51:40.430 --> 01:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
topics that there is a definition
 
01:51:42.350 --> 01:51:42.360 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the rsas I apologize for
 
01:51:44.430 --> 01:51:44.440 align:start position:0%
not remembering exactly where it is but
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
um which says a citizen of New Hampshire
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
is a citizen of the United States and of
 
01:51:51.270 --> 01:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
course I guess we're having a nationwide
 
01:51:53.149 --> 01:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
debate about definition citizen but
 
01:51:55.310 --> 01:51:55.320 align:start position:0%
that's uh you introduced the bill before
 
01:51:57.189 --> 01:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
that happened but um anyway it's a
 
01:51:58.669 --> 01:51:58.679 align:start position:0%
citizen of the United States who's a
 
01:52:00.589 --> 01:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
resident of New Hampshire so why do we
 
01:52:04.030 --> 01:52:04.040 align:start position:0%
need uh a separate definition in this
 
01:52:05.830 --> 01:52:05.840 align:start position:0%
bill I can mean I understand you may
 
01:52:07.990 --> 01:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
want to include other people who aren't
 
01:52:10.270 --> 01:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire but like why
 
01:52:12.550 --> 01:52:12.560 align:start position:0%
redefine the word citizen when it's
 
01:52:15.390 --> 01:52:15.400 align:start position:0%
already clearly defined who's a citizen
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
of of New
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is there a question there do
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
you want me to like why yes why is it
 
01:52:25.470 --> 01:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
necessary giv that citizen of is already
 
01:52:28.109 --> 01:52:28.119 align:start position:0%
clearly defined so I'm not a lawyer it
 
01:52:30.589 --> 01:52:30.599 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like you have a good point
 
01:52:33.350 --> 01:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh the the the point I'm I'm advocating
 
01:52:36.189 --> 01:52:36.199 align:start position:0%
for is to go back to First principles
 
01:52:38.229 --> 01:52:38.239 align:start position:0%
what's the purpose of this bill the purp
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
or this law the purpose of this law to
 
01:52:42.990 --> 01:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
me seems to be we want a well-informed
 
01:52:45.229 --> 01:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
public that can be engaged in their
 
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
community and so uh if if this isn't the
 
01:52:52.069 --> 01:52:52.079 align:start position:0%
if redefining citizen in this context
 
01:52:54.510 --> 01:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
isn't the right way to do it you it
 
01:52:56.510 --> 01:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
still may be worth it to come up with a
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
word that we carve it out so that all of
 
01:53:02.790 --> 01:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
the effort our our hardworking uh civil
 
01:53:06.149 --> 01:53:06.159 align:start position:0%
servants put into feeding this bill uh
 
01:53:09.310 --> 01:53:09.320 align:start position:0%
are are really going to the ultimate uh
 
01:53:12.589 --> 01:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
purpose which is u a better informed
 
01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
more engaged New Hampshire
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
population okay fair enough I apologize
 
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
I was probably doing something I
 
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
criticized a lot which is like ask
 
01:53:24.589 --> 01:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
asking a question to make a point which
 
01:53:26.270 --> 01:53:26.280 align:start position:0%
can always be raised at a work session
 
01:53:28.229 --> 01:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
or executive session which both of which
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
we'll probably have shortly right uh
 
01:53:33.229 --> 01:53:33.239 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness thank
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
you very much representative Ed thank
 
01:53:37.069 --> 01:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you to the committee
 
01:53:40.750 --> 01:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
so what I want to say is um given that
 
01:53:42.669 --> 01:53:42.679 align:start position:0%
you know obviously we're going way over
 
01:53:44.830 --> 01:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
I have an I have not tremendous number
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
but some other Witnesses who I think
 
01:53:49.709 --> 01:53:49.719 align:start position:0%
have appeared previously uh to testify
 
01:53:52.830 --> 01:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
in HB 66 and I would appreciate if if as
 
01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
you come up to testify if you'd confine
 
01:54:00.950 --> 01:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
your remarks uh specifically to uh HP 74
 
01:54:04.510 --> 01:54:04.520 align:start position:0%
and also um I'm going to uh impose a
 
01:54:06.910 --> 01:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
three minute uh time limit so next I
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:23.189 --> 01:54:23.199 align:start position:0%
please red means
 
01:54:24.830 --> 01:54:24.840 align:start position:0%
good morning again I'm going to keep my
 
01:54:26.709 --> 01:54:26.719 align:start position:0%
comments very brief this time you
 
01:54:29.589 --> 01:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
understand our position um we oppose HB
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
um 74 I did want to touch on three
 
01:54:33.870 --> 01:54:33.880 align:start position:0%
points that I think the committee is may
 
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
not be um aware of the first is that
 
01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:38.350 align:start position:0%
not be um aware of the first is that
with

01:54:38.350 --> 01:54:38.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:54:41.109 --> 01:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
hb12 last year I just like to clarify
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
that the purpose of addressing that was
 
01:54:45.430 --> 01:54:45.440 align:start position:0%
the most costly and most timec consuming
 
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
requests which are electronic
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
communications are now restricted to 250
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
of those before um Community can start
 
01:54:56.310 --> 01:54:56.320 align:start position:0%
charging for those so just to be clear
 
01:54:57.990 --> 01:54:58.000 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about excessively
 
01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:00.159 align:start position:0%
large requests from what representative
 
01:55:02.069 --> 01:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
Edwards referenced as International
 
01:55:04.390 --> 01:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
commercial Enterprises they would have
 
01:55:08.350 --> 01:55:08.360 align:start position:0%
to be beyond that size in order to um
 
01:55:09.910 --> 01:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
they would have they would have to be
 
01:55:12.030 --> 01:55:12.040 align:start position:0%
that size or bigger in order to be able
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
to charge from but that is the threshold
 
01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:16.719 align:start position:0%
that we set for large requests um the
 
01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:18.639 align:start position:0%
second is that representative Edwards
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
was talking about the history of right
 
01:55:21.990 --> 01:55:22.000 align:start position:0%
to know and the idea that it is set up
 
01:55:24.629 --> 01:55:24.639 align:start position:0%
to be be available to Citizens I'd just
 
01:55:26.390 --> 01:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
like to quote article 8 of The
 
01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution which says to that end the
 
01:55:31.709 --> 01:55:31.719 align:start position:0%
Public's right of access to governmental
 
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
proceedings and Records shall not be
 
01:55:36.709 --> 01:55:36.719 align:start position:0%
unreasonably restricted the public also
 
01:55:38.589 --> 01:55:38.599 align:start position:0%
has a right to an orderly lawful and
 
01:55:40.510 --> 01:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
accountable government does not
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
reference the word citizen it does later
 
01:55:44.910 --> 01:55:44.920 align:start position:0%
use the word taxpayer which as suggested
 
01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
earlier can be uh pretty much anybody
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
that is paying a form of tax in the
 
01:55:51.589 --> 01:55:51.599 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so I wanted to
 
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
clarify that as as well and finally I do
 
01:55:56.270 --> 01:55:56.280 align:start position:0%
have a copy of the Superior Court ruling
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
from the Rochester case in front of me
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
and while I can't speak for the
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman I can say what the court had
 
01:56:04.270 --> 01:56:04.280 align:start position:0%
to say about it um the that issue was
 
01:56:07.229 --> 01:56:07.239 align:start position:0%
the fact that the uh individual who was
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
not a resident of the who was a resident
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
of the state of Maine was being refused
 
01:56:13.669 --> 01:56:13.679 align:start position:0%
information and what the Ombudsman and
 
01:56:15.750 --> 01:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court both clarified was
 
01:56:17.709 --> 01:56:17.719 align:start position:0%
that that individual though a resident
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
of Maine was representing an entity
 
01:56:22.750 --> 01:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
within the borders of New Hampshire and
 
01:56:24.830 --> 01:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
so it says and I'm quoting from the
 
01:56:26.990 --> 01:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
finding the Ombudsman found as a matter
 
01:56:29.109 --> 01:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
of fact to the contrary identifying the
 
01:56:31.990 --> 01:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
Rochester voice and not Mr Thorp as the
 
01:56:34.109 --> 01:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
claimant that was the issue that was
 
01:56:36.189 --> 01:56:36.199 align:start position:0%
settled there was no determination that
 
01:56:38.069 --> 01:56:38.079 align:start position:0%
someone had to have a tie to the state
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire in order to be eligible
 
01:56:41.830 --> 01:56:41.840 align:start position:0%
for information they simply made that
 
01:56:43.870 --> 01:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
distinction and moved forward with the
 
01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
idea that the claimant was already in
 
01:56:46.870 --> 01:56:46.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and that claim that they
 
01:56:49.229 --> 01:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
were not a citizen was not relevant
 
01:56:50.830 --> 01:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
thank you great thank you very much
 
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness seeing none
 
01:56:56.669 --> 01:56:56.679 align:start position:0%
thank you um J Binet Mr biset
 
01:56:58.950 --> 01:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:03.159 align:start position:0%
jel Binet with the ACLU of New Hampshire
 
01:57:06.589 --> 01:57:06.599 align:start position:0%
um I I do just want to
 
01:57:10.830 --> 01:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
um say with respect to HB 74 we want to
 
01:57:13.310 --> 01:57:13.320 align:start position:0%
articulate our appreciation uh for the
 
01:57:15.669 --> 01:57:15.679 align:start position:0%
sponsors uh again attempt to try to
 
01:57:17.510 --> 01:57:17.520 align:start position:0%
address this citizenship issue that has
 
01:57:20.270 --> 01:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
percolated because of uh one one Town's
 
01:57:23.350 --> 01:57:23.360 align:start position:0%
interpretation I do think that h b74 is
 
01:57:25.310 --> 01:57:25.320 align:start position:0%
too narrow and our strong preference
 
01:57:26.510 --> 01:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
with respect to how this should be
 
01:57:29.870 --> 01:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
resolved is uh is in the language of HB
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
66 which again doesn't expand 91a it
 
01:57:35.669 --> 01:57:35.679 align:start position:0%
just reflects the status quo that has
 
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
been the case for decades with the
 
01:57:39.149 --> 01:57:39.159 align:start position:0%
exception of this one Town's
 
01:57:40.510 --> 01:57:40.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation so I just want to
 
01:57:41.910 --> 01:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
reiterate that because I think that is
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
incredibly uh important from my vantage
 
01:57:47.790 --> 01:57:47.800 align:start position:0%
point but I do think HP 74 its attempt
 
01:57:51.350 --> 01:57:51.360 align:start position:0%
to resolve this is uh too narrow um this
 
01:57:54.270 --> 01:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
definition in H 74 would potentially
 
01:57:55.790 --> 01:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
exclude for example people that have
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
second homes in New Hampshire may even
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
pay property taxes here uh but they
 
01:58:01.790 --> 01:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be domiciled here because you
 
01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
can only have one domicile but of course
 
01:58:05.470 --> 01:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
they would have a significant investment
 
01:58:07.430 --> 01:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire as well and I think
 
01:58:09.310 --> 01:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
should be able to make public records
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
requests I I do think that this could be
 
01:58:14.669 --> 01:58:14.679 align:start position:0%
construed as potentially uh excluding
 
01:58:17.149 --> 01:58:17.159 align:start position:0%
them from making requests and so I think
 
01:58:20.350 --> 01:58:20.360 align:start position:0%
at its core I think what HB 74 could be
 
01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:23.639 align:start position:0%
doing um in making this change uh I'm
 
01:58:24.950 --> 01:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
not saying intentionally but it would
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
narrow 91a and that's just not something
 
01:58:29.310 --> 01:58:29.320 align:start position:0%
that we can support here I think in many
 
01:58:31.390 --> 01:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
ways we should be expanding our our
 
01:58:33.990 --> 01:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
public records laws so I just want to to
 
01:58:36.470 --> 01:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
convey that feedback and appreciate the
 
01:58:38.189 --> 01:58:38.199 align:start position:0%
committee's time in trying to resolve
 
01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
this issue thank you thank you questions
 
01:58:43.669 --> 01:58:43.679 align:start position:0%

HB 74 we believe it codifies what the
 
01:59:15.310 --> 01:59:15.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution RSA 91a and
 
01:59:17.350 --> 01:59:17.360 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court have
 
01:59:20.270 --> 01:59:20.280 align:start position:0%
pointed to that the transparency to
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
govern the transparency of government in
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is for those who um have

02:00:32.430 --> 02:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
like to go through just a little bit of
 
02:00:34.910 --> 02:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
the history of why I'm here and what I'm
 
02:00:38.430 --> 02:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
trying to do um in straford County our
 
02:00:41.790 --> 02:00:41.800 align:start position:0%
delegation prec covid as long as I've
 
02:00:45.709 --> 02:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
been there U no no member vote had ever
 
02:00:50.149 --> 02:00:50.159 align:start position:0%
been taken by phone or video during and
 
02:00:53.430 --> 02:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
post covid that became occasional issue
 
02:00:57.589 --> 02:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
a continual issue actually um I see we
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
have a couple members of the straford
 
02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
delegation on here besides myself each
 
02:01:05.550 --> 02:01:05.560 align:start position:0%
time a vote has been taken since that
 
02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
time I have raised objections to that
 
02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
vote uh for those who are not physically
 
02:01:13.470 --> 02:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
present including one of my own votes uh
 
02:01:16.470 --> 02:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
where I was out of the country and I I I
 
02:01:18.990 --> 02:01:19.000 align:start position:0%
voted and then I said I object to my own
 
02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
vote because I don't believe uh that's
 
02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:23.719 align:start position:0%
what should have have been done uh over
 
02:01:25.589 --> 02:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
these past few years I've had several
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
back and forth with uh our previous
 
02:01:30.550 --> 02:01:30.560 align:start position:0%
County attorney and the current County
 
02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:33.679 align:start position:0%
attorney uh and unfortunately uh their
 
02:01:37.709 --> 02:01:37.719 align:start position:0%
opinions did not um I don't believe were
 
02:01:39.830 --> 02:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
correct so I'm going to give you a real
 
02:01:44.109 --> 02:01:44.119 align:start position:0%
example of why I think this is
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
important about a year ago during a
 
02:01:49.750 --> 02:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
December meeting scheduled meeting a
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
member of our delegation uh instead of
 
02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:55.679 align:start position:0%
coming to the delegation meeting chose
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
to go to his girlfriend's house rather
 
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
than and rather than attend our
 
02:02:04.910 --> 02:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
delegation meeting and when I made it my
 
02:02:06.950 --> 02:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
objection to allowing uh the voting by
 
02:02:10.229 --> 02:02:10.239 align:start position:0%
Zoom which I always do he said well if I
 
02:02:12.270 --> 02:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
would have known rep turot was going to
 
02:02:14.870 --> 02:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
object I would have come
 
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
there this clearly indicated that his
 
02:02:21.550 --> 02:02:21.560 align:start position:0%
attendance could have been quote unquote
 
02:02:24.430 --> 02:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
reason reasonably practicable as the
 
02:02:28.709 --> 02:02:28.719 align:start position:0%
current irsa says he so he simply chose
 
02:02:28.719 --> 02:02:29.790 align:start position:0%
current irsa says he so he simply chose
a

02:02:29.790 --> 02:02:29.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:02:33.149 --> 02:02:33.159 align:start position:0%
u what was more convenient for
 
02:02:37.310 --> 02:02:37.320 align:start position:0%
him so what I'm trying to do is to set a
 
02:02:39.270 --> 02:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
higher standard there are a couple
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
things in the in in the bill what I'm
 
02:02:43.870 --> 02:02:43.880 align:start position:0%
trying to change one is to set a higher
 
02:02:47.310 --> 02:02:47.320 align:start position:0%
standard needed for attendance and then
 
02:02:52.310 --> 02:02:52.320 align:start position:0%
voting only by those uh at the meeting
 
02:02:54.149 --> 02:02:54.159 align:start position:0%
I think those who make the effort to
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
actually be present have taken the
 
02:02:58.790 --> 02:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility for their office uh
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
responsibly whether they were appointed
 
02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:01.350 align:start position:0%
responsibly whether they were appointed
or

02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:03:04.390 --> 02:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
elected conversely those who chose
 
02:03:07.390 --> 02:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
choose to participate remotely when they
 
02:03:10.709 --> 02:03:10.719 align:start position:0%
could have been present they Sher that
 
02:03:12.910 --> 02:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility as I said before prior to
 
02:03:15.470 --> 02:03:15.480 align:start position:0%
co this wasn't even an issue so we
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
should not be permitting now the
 
02:03:22.510 --> 02:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
the I'll say ridiculousness rather than
 
02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
Insanity that surrounded that period of
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
time to upend Decades of of Precedence
 
02:03:31.709 --> 02:03:31.719 align:start position:0%
and to be used that arbitrary president
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh precedence going
 
02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
forward here are some of the reasons um
 
02:03:39.950 --> 02:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
why I believe these changes are needing
 
02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:41.470 align:start position:0%
why I believe these changes are needing
uh

02:03:41.470 --> 02:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:45.069 --> 02:03:45.079 align:start position:0%
needed anybody not in a meeting room
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
cannot have a full sense or view of all
 
02:03:52.390 --> 02:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
that is going on um I can tell you
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
specifically as a negotiator uh I would
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
never hold a negotiating committee
 
02:04:00.510 --> 02:04:00.520 align:start position:0%
session uh with any of my team members
 
02:04:03.510 --> 02:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
not being present um I would not even
 
02:04:05.709 --> 02:04:05.719 align:start position:0%
allow them to participate via Zoom
 
02:04:08.149 --> 02:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
because there's so much you can gather
 
02:04:11.629 --> 02:04:11.639 align:start position:0%
from watching uh the people in
 
02:04:14.430 --> 02:04:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:17.750 --> 02:04:17.760 align:start position:0%
meeting another thing you can't take and
 
02:04:20.310 --> 02:04:20.320 align:start position:0%
and again for for me a lot of this
 
02:04:22.629 --> 02:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
revolves around the sford County
 
02:04:25.390 --> 02:04:25.400 align:start position:0%
delegation or a delegation but if you're
 
02:04:27.870 --> 02:04:27.880 align:start position:0%
absent and you're on Zoom you can't take
 
02:04:31.310 --> 02:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
part in any caucus which may preclude an
 
02:04:35.069 --> 02:04:35.079 align:start position:0%
important vote um that was the case for
 
02:04:37.790 --> 02:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
myself on the one time I missed a vote
 
02:04:41.069 --> 02:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
and I had to uh there was a caucus taken
 
02:04:43.589 --> 02:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
I couldn't be part of
 
02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
that audio and video can be and at least
 
02:04:50.589 --> 02:04:50.599 align:start position:0%
in straford county is very poor compared
 
02:04:52.430 --> 02:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
to being in person
 
02:04:55.629 --> 02:04:55.639 align:start position:0%
we've experienced very poor two-way
 
02:04:58.390 --> 02:04:58.400 align:start position:0%
Communications uh the public has a lot
 
02:05:01.470 --> 02:05:01.480 align:start position:0%
of times difficulty hearing delegation
 
02:05:04.030 --> 02:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
members who are not physically in
 
02:05:07.390 --> 02:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
attendance um I know I've had trouble
 
02:05:10.990 --> 02:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
when people are absent figuring out what
 
02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:19.149 --> 02:05:19.159 align:start position:0%
also as I was researching or getting
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
further into this I I noticed that
 
02:05:25.149 --> 02:05:25.159 align:start position:0%
what we have done in straford County uh
 
02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
in delegation meetings is you have to
 
02:05:30.510 --> 02:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
somehow positively confirm the
 
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
individual uh who is on
 
02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:36.350 align:start position:0%
individual uh who is on
zoom

02:05:36.350 --> 02:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
zoom
 
02:05:39.149 --> 02:05:39.159 align:start position:0%
and it was interesting to me to learn
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
that the actual
 
02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:43.679 align:start position:0%
member does not even have to be visually
 
02:05:46.950 --> 02:05:46.960 align:start position:0%
confirmed only by voice and I'm not
 
02:05:50.629 --> 02:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
sure that's the best thing we should be
 
02:05:52.870 --> 02:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
doing the last thing I'll say is the
 
02:05:54.270 --> 02:05:54.280 align:start position:0%
determination of
 
02:05:58.510 --> 02:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
current reasonably available is made by
 
02:05:59.790 --> 02:05:59.800 align:start position:0%
the chair of the
 
02:06:02.030 --> 02:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
delegation it can be extremely
 
02:06:05.709 --> 02:06:05.719 align:start position:0%
subjective and can also be in some cases
 
02:06:08.549 --> 02:06:08.559 align:start position:0%
politically motivated
 
02:06:11.229 --> 02:06:11.239 align:start position:0%
subjectiveness where we can has to be
 
02:06:15.149 --> 02:06:15.159 align:start position:0%
removed so we can Pro provide
 
02:06:17.790 --> 02:06:17.800 align:start position:0%
consistency so to the
 
02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
actual to the actual bill uh two parts
 
02:06:23.629 --> 02:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
the first
 
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
one I'm removing the words not
 
02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
reasonably practical and inserting the
 
02:06:29.800 --> 02:06:31.310 align:start position:0%
reasonably practical and inserting the
word

02:06:31.310 --> 02:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
word
 
02:06:34.109 --> 02:06:34.119 align:start position:0%
unavoidable and the reason for that is
 
02:06:37.069 --> 02:06:37.079 align:start position:0%
it creates in my opinion a a higher
 
02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
standard or a higher hurdle for that
 
02:06:44.510 --> 02:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
person uh who chooses not to participate
 
02:06:47.790 --> 02:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
in person uh again the example I gave
 
02:06:51.069 --> 02:06:51.079 align:start position:0%
you of the individual saying oh I could
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
have been there is a is a great
 
02:06:57.790 --> 02:06:57.800 align:start position:0%
example um the second part of the RSA
 
02:06:59.510 --> 02:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
that I'm trying to
 
02:07:03.069 --> 02:07:03.079 align:start position:0%
change is to disallow the
 
02:07:06.109 --> 02:07:06.119 align:start position:0%
voting um by anybody who is not
 
02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
physically present I know that's uh goes
 
02:07:13.390 --> 02:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
a little little far for many people um
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
and speaking with someone
 
02:07:19.270 --> 02:07:19.280 align:start position:0%
earlier um there might be a way to maybe
 
02:07:22.069 --> 02:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
amend it to add uh like another part of
 
02:07:29.470 --> 02:07:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:32.390 --> 02:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
situation so I'll conclude by saying
 
02:07:35.189 --> 02:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
that imperson participation essential
 
02:07:37.549 --> 02:07:37.559 align:start position:0%
for for fully transparent communication
 
02:07:40.350 --> 02:07:40.360 align:start position:0%
between the members of the body those
 
02:07:42.069 --> 02:07:42.079 align:start position:0%
elected or appointed to our public
 
02:07:44.069 --> 02:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
service positions must shoulder the
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
responsibility of their positions 100%
 
02:07:49.030 --> 02:07:49.040 align:start position:0%
of the time not only when it's
 
02:07:51.470 --> 02:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
convenient New Hampshire should not be
 
02:07:53.310 --> 02:07:53.320 align:start position:0%
deepening hundreds of years of the way
 
02:07:55.950 --> 02:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
we participate in public meetings by
 
02:07:58.229 --> 02:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
gradually excluding uh excusing
 
02:08:00.629 --> 02:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
ourselves from actually being there it's
 
02:08:03.030 --> 02:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
the old camel's head under the uh tent
 
02:08:05.270 --> 02:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
issue where you you start chipping away
 
02:08:07.669 --> 02:08:07.679 align:start position:0%
a little bit by little camel head the
 
02:08:09.510 --> 02:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
camel throws his head under the tent
 
02:08:11.549 --> 02:08:11.559 align:start position:0%
before you know it the whole body of the
 
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:13.800 align:start position:0%
camel is in
 
02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
there I say what what's next
 
02:08:18.350 --> 02:08:18.360 align:start position:0%
Representatives stay home rather than
 
02:08:19.589 --> 02:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
make their way to the State House
 
02:08:22.750 --> 02:08:22.760 align:start position:0%
chamber on session day and don't forget
 
02:08:25.549 --> 02:08:25.559 align:start position:0%
uh we actually had uh some of this being
 
02:08:29.229 --> 02:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
tried uh during Co and finally I'll
 
02:08:33.310 --> 02:08:33.320 align:start position:0%
leave you with a couple semi- rhetorical
 
02:08:36.549 --> 02:08:36.559 align:start position:0%
questions would this committee here ever
 
02:08:39.430 --> 02:08:39.440 align:start position:0%
allow somebody in executive session to
 
02:08:40.750 --> 02:08:40.760 align:start position:0%
vote via
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
Zoom I think the answer on that is
 
02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
no and one that our chairman or the
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
chairman of this committee might uh
 
02:08:51.589 --> 02:08:51.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate would you ever allow jurors
 
02:08:54.510 --> 02:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
in a trial to listen and participate in
 
02:08:57.069 --> 02:08:57.079 align:start position:0%
that trial while not be being physically
 
02:08:59.430 --> 02:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
in the courtroom and then vote on the
 
02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:00.549 align:start position:0%
in the courtroom and then vote on the
defendant's

02:09:00.549 --> 02:09:00.559 align:start position:0%
defendant's
 
02:09:03.790 --> 02:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
Fate again that's a no so with that I'll
 
02:09:05.229 --> 02:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions that you
 
02:09:09.870 --> 02:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
might have all right uh well sorry qu
 
02:09:12.750 --> 02:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
questions representative Rambo please
 
02:09:14.430 --> 02:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question I
 
02:09:18.310 --> 02:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
I just wondered if we have a
 
02:09:23.390 --> 02:09:23.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:24.709 --> 02:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
not reasonably practical perhaps there
 
02:09:26.790 --> 02:09:26.800 align:start position:0%
was not previously either but and would
 
02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
who would make that determination would
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
it still be the chair of the body under
 
02:09:35.549 --> 02:09:35.559 align:start position:0%
current rsas yes it would still be the
 
02:09:38.950 --> 02:09:38.960 align:start position:0%
chair okay thank you uh representative
 
02:09:40.709 --> 02:09:40.719 align:start position:0%
Smith you had a question no my question
 
02:09:43.270 --> 02:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
was the definition of my question was
 
02:09:45.669 --> 02:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
the definition of unavoidable I agree
 
02:09:48.709 --> 02:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
with you as you will know in principle
 
02:09:50.669 --> 02:09:50.679 align:start position:0%
but I'm not I don't quite see how
 
02:09:50.679 --> 02:09:53.350 align:start position:0%
but I'm not I don't quite see how
unavoidable

02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
answers the concern sure um as I said um
 
02:10:00.950 --> 02:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
I think the unavoid the word
 
02:10:06.350 --> 02:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
unavoidable is a a higher hurdle than
 
02:10:09.069 --> 02:10:09.079 align:start position:0%
reasonably practicable and I'll and I'll
 
02:10:13.149 --> 02:10:13.159 align:start position:0%
say this I I tried to find the the the
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
best definitions of the words I could
 
02:10:19.109 --> 02:10:19.119 align:start position:0%
the one I came up with that I think best
 
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
describes unavoidable was impossible to
 
02:10:26.470 --> 02:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
prevent I think that's says it pretty
 
02:10:27.790 --> 02:10:27.800 align:start position:0%
clearly for
 
02:10:30.149 --> 02:10:30.159 align:start position:0%
me uh whereas when I looked up
 
02:10:32.950 --> 02:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable I I just couldn't
 
02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
find for me something that hit the
 
02:10:37.870 --> 02:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
definition of reasonably the best the
 
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
word that kept coming up was feasible so
 
02:10:43.189 --> 02:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to what I'm trying to
 
02:10:45.030 --> 02:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
do and the sponsors co-sponsors are
 
02:10:47.109 --> 02:10:47.119 align:start position:0%
trying to do is just to set a higher
 
02:10:51.629 --> 02:10:51.639 align:start position:0%
standard now uh I've asked uh our
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
attorney uh in through multiple letters
 
02:10:59.270 --> 02:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
over the years give me some and even our
 
02:11:02.350 --> 02:11:02.360 align:start position:0%
chairman um give me some examples of
 
02:11:06.709 --> 02:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
what you would determine as
 
02:11:06.719 --> 02:11:08.390 align:start position:0%
what you would determine as
reasonably

02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
reasonably
 
02:11:11.069 --> 02:11:11.079 align:start position:0%
versus um I I've never asked about
 
02:11:13.709 --> 02:11:13.719 align:start position:0%
unavoidable because we haven't got there
 
02:11:16.270 --> 02:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
but I to give me some examples where is
 
02:11:18.950 --> 02:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
your line where is that Gray Line that
 
02:11:22.589 --> 02:11:22.599 align:start position:0%
above is reasonable and below is not and
 
02:11:24.510 --> 02:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
nobody wants to answer it and I
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
understand why because then you set a
 
02:11:29.270 --> 02:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
precedent that's why I want to make it
 
02:11:31.629 --> 02:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
unavoidable unavoidable is different
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
than reasonably
 
02:11:36.629 --> 02:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
available in my opinion all right other
 
02:11:38.589 --> 02:11:38.599 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yes
 
02:11:38.599 --> 02:11:41.310 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yes
representative

02:11:41.310 --> 02:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:44.229 --> 02:11:44.239 align:start position:0%
bur thank you for allowing me to ask
 
02:11:46.270 --> 02:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
this question thank you representative I
 
02:11:48.709 --> 02:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
did miss the first few minutes of your
 
02:11:50.910 --> 02:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
presentation so forgive me if you cover
 
02:11:53.629 --> 02:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
this I'm concerned about the definition
 
02:11:58.149 --> 02:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
of public body what this includes I know
 
02:12:00.990 --> 02:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
the uh right to no law has its its
 
02:12:03.470 --> 02:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
definitions in the like I assume you're
 
02:12:10.069 --> 02:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:13.390 --> 02:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
bodies as I said most of this developed
 
02:12:16.229 --> 02:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
because of the straford county
 
02:12:19.510 --> 02:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
delegation I am not changing the
 
02:12:22.790 --> 02:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
definition or intent of whatever that
 
02:12:25.549 --> 02:12:25.559 align:start position:0%
means uh that's not what I looked into
 
02:12:28.069 --> 02:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
the definition of public body I I'm
 
02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
looking into the ability to vote and
 
02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
what's deemed unavoidable can I follow
 
02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:37.000 align:start position:0%
up yes to follow up then since I'm not
 
02:12:39.709 --> 02:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
sure what your definition is it's
 
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
certainly not in in the legislation
 
02:12:46.750 --> 02:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
let's talk about a small town zoning
 
02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:49.149 align:start position:0%
let's talk about a small town zoning
board

02:12:49.149 --> 02:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:12:51.870 --> 02:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
um am I correct in
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
suggesting that I I come from a small
 
02:12:58.030 --> 02:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
town and we have a reasonably hard time
 
02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
getting people to serve on local boards
 
02:13:05.270 --> 02:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
and the like so um you're suggesting
 
02:13:09.390 --> 02:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
that it's the proper role of conquered
 
02:13:13.149 --> 02:13:13.159 align:start position:0%
to use the generic to decide for our
 
02:13:16.549 --> 02:13:16.559 align:start position:0%
town um what the attendance rules should
 
02:13:19.229 --> 02:13:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:23.589 --> 02:13:23.599 align:start position:0%
not under the rsas I am saying that
 
02:13:25.790 --> 02:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
anybody who accepts the responsibility
 
02:13:28.750 --> 02:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
or is elected to that um accepts a
 
02:13:31.470 --> 02:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
position appointed a position be elected
 
02:13:33.830 --> 02:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
to a position that yes indeed you you
 
02:13:35.510 --> 02:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
should take the responsibility to
 
02:13:38.510 --> 02:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
actually show up and I think when we get
 
02:13:40.430 --> 02:13:40.440 align:start position:0%
down to it when you're talking
 
02:13:43.870 --> 02:13:43.880 align:start position:0%
about local I would say the more local
 
02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:45.950 align:start position:0%
about local I would say the more local
you

02:13:45.950 --> 02:13:45.960 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:13:49.709 --> 02:13:49.719 align:start position:0%
get the easier for the individual to
 
02:13:51.950 --> 02:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
actually be there I mean we could take
 
02:13:54.270 --> 02:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
the let's take a delegation up in Coos
 
02:13:57.149 --> 02:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
County uh U you know a meeting for that
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
you could be coming from I don't know
 
02:14:01.709 --> 02:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
what 100 miles 80 miles your town of
 
02:14:03.229 --> 02:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
conquer if that's where you're from I
 
02:14:06.350 --> 02:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
guess no okay well con W land it's a
 
02:14:10.069 --> 02:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
small small town where we we know how to
 
02:14:12.790 --> 02:14:12.800 align:start position:0%
handle our Affairs more or less without
 
02:14:15.549 --> 02:14:15.559 align:start position:0%
conquer telling us how to run our
 
02:14:18.069 --> 02:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
boards then that's that would be up to
 
02:14:21.870 --> 02:14:21.880 align:start position:0%
you I guess but under this change
 
02:14:24.030 --> 02:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
it would require if you want to be
 
02:14:28.470 --> 02:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:30.870 --> 02:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
present right other questions for this
 
02:14:33.629 --> 02:14:33.639 align:start position:0%
witness representative Perez thank you
 
02:14:35.790 --> 02:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question it's my
 
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that this a member of the
 
02:14:41.109 --> 02:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
public body May participate that's
 
02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
already in the law you're not changing
 
02:14:45.350 --> 02:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
that at all are you representative I am
 
02:14:50.390 --> 02:14:50.400 align:start position:0%
not no okay so that is existing and this
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
bill does not change that at all that
 
02:14:55.229 --> 02:14:55.239 align:start position:0%
does not change the participation other
 
02:14:57.470 --> 02:14:57.480 align:start position:0%
than when you're changing the definition
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
from unavoidable
 
02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
to um reasonably practical um so no it
 
02:15:06.109 --> 02:15:06.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the attendance what it
 
02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
does change is in order to vote on an
 
02:15:13.870 --> 02:15:13.880 align:start position:0%
issue you must be physically present
 
02:15:15.629 --> 02:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all other questions
 
02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
representative trip and then
 
02:15:16.719 --> 02:15:19.030 align:start position:0%
representative trip and then
representative

02:15:19.030 --> 02:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:15:22.629 --> 02:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
H I know that uh
 
02:15:26.350 --> 02:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
in uh the municipality of dairy Our Town
 
02:15:30.229 --> 02:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
Charter defines
 
02:15:33.310 --> 02:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
uh how people can participate in a
 
02:15:36.350 --> 02:15:36.360 align:start position:0%
meeting without being there you know so
 
02:15:40.629 --> 02:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
I assume that uh uh this would change
 
02:15:45.149 --> 02:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
that uh or override that Charter
 
02:15:48.270 --> 02:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
condition uh it's this the same thing
 
02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
with the our zoning board uh you know
 
02:15:58.430 --> 02:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
they people people will call in and uh
 
02:16:01.149 --> 02:16:01.159 align:start position:0%
and uh participate in the meeting and
 
02:16:05.069 --> 02:16:05.079 align:start position:0%
and in fact actually uh vote on the uh
 
02:16:09.390 --> 02:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
case that's being discussed so I I think
 
02:16:11.310 --> 02:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
the the change that you're suggesting is
 
02:16:14.589 --> 02:16:14.599 align:start position:0%
a little more far-reaching than uh you
 
02:16:17.549 --> 02:16:17.559 align:start position:0%
anticipate oh I I should have a question
 
02:16:20.669 --> 02:16:20.679 align:start position:0%
right isn't isn't that true isn't that
 
02:16:20.679 --> 02:16:22.510 align:start position:0%
right isn't isn't that true isn't that
so

02:16:22.510 --> 02:16:22.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:16:24.510 --> 02:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
uh well it would depend I've you you
 
02:16:26.589 --> 02:16:26.599 align:start position:0%
talked about people calling and it does
 
02:16:29.870 --> 02:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
not change the Public's participation in
 
02:16:33.190 --> 02:16:33.200 align:start position:0%
anything it what it does is it
 
02:16:36.910 --> 02:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
specifies the individuals I mean your
 
02:16:39.589 --> 02:16:39.599 align:start position:0%
town may have rules on participation in
 
02:16:42.349 --> 02:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
meetings but this is this doesn't change
 
02:16:44.990 --> 02:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
that this this is an over this is
 
02:16:47.309 --> 02:16:47.319 align:start position:0%
already in the rsas the only thing that
 
02:16:51.870 --> 02:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
we're talking about is participation
 
02:16:54.549 --> 02:16:54.559 align:start position:0%
being AO unavoidable versus not
 
02:16:57.549 --> 02:16:57.559 align:start position:0%
reasonably practical that's
 
02:17:01.870 --> 02:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
all representative hgan um yes well
 
02:17:04.509 --> 02:17:04.519 align:start position:0%
first of all just first of all I just in
 
02:17:06.549 --> 02:17:06.559 align:start position:0%
full disclosure I myself am a member of
 
02:17:08.429 --> 02:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
the straford county delegation and in
 
02:17:10.230 --> 02:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
fact a member of the executive committee
 
02:17:13.990 --> 02:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
so the member in question um I'm not we
 
02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:15.519 align:start position:0%
don't want to get too much into the
 
02:17:16.750 --> 02:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
example we probably should a
 
02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
hypothetical about limiting it questions
 
02:17:21.910 --> 02:17:21.920 align:start position:0%
um why
 
02:17:25.070 --> 02:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
that that you know we had people who
 
02:17:26.950 --> 02:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
either missed meeting either zoomed into
 
02:17:28.589 --> 02:17:28.599 align:start position:0%
meetings and we had some cases of
 
02:17:30.870 --> 02:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
members who consistently missed meetings
 
02:17:34.429 --> 02:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
alog together so why is it why is it
 
02:17:37.790 --> 02:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
worse for someone to zoom into the
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
meeting then to not be there altogether
 
02:17:42.750 --> 02:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
as at least I'm um we had problems with
 
02:17:44.070 --> 02:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
some members of the delegation not
 
02:17:46.309 --> 02:17:46.319 align:start position:0%
showing up for anything so like why is
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
it worse why is it worse for someone to
 
02:17:52.309 --> 02:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
um zoom in then to not be there so I
 
02:17:54.270 --> 02:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
don't get it sure thank you for your
 
02:17:56.549 --> 02:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
question I covered that I thought pretty
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
well in my testimony what I'll be happy
 
02:18:00.990 --> 02:18:01.000 align:start position:0%
to do is give you a copy of my testimony
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
and the answer to your questions were
 
02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
would be in there right thanks other
 
02:18:08.589 --> 02:18:08.599 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yes represent
 
02:18:11.790 --> 02:18:11.800 align:start position:0%
beron thank you Mr
 
02:18:14.110 --> 02:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
chair my
 
02:18:17.150 --> 02:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
question my wife works at home and she
 
02:18:20.070 --> 02:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
works for a large Hospital in Boston so
 
02:18:23.429 --> 02:18:23.439 align:start position:0%
her whole day is on Zoom so are you just
 
02:18:27.030 --> 02:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:30.389 --> 02:18:30.399 align:start position:0%
information in the uh non Zoom
 
02:18:34.150 --> 02:18:34.160 align:start position:0%
preference um not really I'm I'm more
 
02:18:37.790 --> 02:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
concerned with the U you're talking
 
02:18:40.790 --> 02:18:40.800 align:start position:0%
about private business um this here
 
02:18:42.270 --> 02:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
pertains to the
 
02:18:46.110 --> 02:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
public um and 91a that's what this is
 
02:18:48.910 --> 02:18:48.920 align:start position:0%
about and as I I think I said in the
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
testimony I see a lot of problems with
 
02:18:53.190 --> 02:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
with um and again I'll give you the I'll
 
02:18:54.709 --> 02:18:54.719 align:start position:0%
give you a copy of those testimony so
 
02:18:57.389 --> 02:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
you can review it and see it um I'll
 
02:19:00.150 --> 02:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
send that to the chair or the committee
 
02:19:02.629 --> 02:19:02.639 align:start position:0%
um I I got to declassify couple things
 
02:19:04.469 --> 02:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
on here because I don't want certain
 
02:19:08.309 --> 02:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
names mentioned that was in my notes so
 
02:19:10.309 --> 02:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
uh but yeah um I'll be happy to send
 
02:19:12.830 --> 02:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
that to you all right other questions
 
02:19:14.429 --> 02:19:14.439 align:start position:0%
yes representative Alexander real quick
 
02:19:15.349 --> 02:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
02:19:17.429 --> 02:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
representative um I understand the bill
 
02:19:20.429 --> 02:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
is now in our hands but let me ask um
 
02:19:21.790 --> 02:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
would would you be opposed to an
 
02:19:23.429 --> 02:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
amendment that would remove everything
 
02:19:25.509 --> 02:19:25.519 align:start position:0%
after of section two of the
 
02:19:29.669 --> 02:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
bill and just update the the the bar
 
02:19:32.509 --> 02:19:32.519 align:start position:0%
that's needed to be absent from a public
 
02:19:34.709 --> 02:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
meeting or
 
02:19:37.669 --> 02:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
electronically um I I would be opposed
 
02:19:40.150 --> 02:19:40.160 align:start position:0%
to that I think there if you have issues
 
02:19:42.669 --> 02:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
with that second part as I said I I
 
02:19:44.190 --> 02:19:44.200 align:start position:0%
spoke with somebody
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
earlier and in the rsas let me see if I
 
02:19:51.710 --> 02:19:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:57.710 --> 02:19:57.720 align:start position:0%
um yeah what it's in the 91 A2 I believe
 
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
uh 3B and it talks about accepting an
 
02:20:03.950 --> 02:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
emergency a quarin of the public body
 
02:20:07.750 --> 02:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah I think um maybe in that
 
02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
section two uh
 
02:20:14.030 --> 02:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
that I'm adamant that I believe we
 
02:20:15.870 --> 02:20:15.880 align:start position:0%
should not be allowing people to vote on
 
02:20:17.469 --> 02:20:17.479 align:start position:0%
Zoom because of the issues that I
 
02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
brought up before that maybe that
 
02:20:23.790 --> 02:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
sentence could be changed to accept in
 
02:20:26.830 --> 02:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
an emergency and then continue down that
 
02:20:28.510 --> 02:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
I would not be opposed
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
to all right other question
 
02:20:33.070 --> 02:20:33.080 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you thanks
 
02:20:35.150 --> 02:20:35.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question would you be
 
02:20:37.790 --> 02:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
concerned with was one of your concerns
 
02:20:40.750 --> 02:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
possibly who would might be influencing
 
02:20:45.429 --> 02:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
a vote if a person was there by by Zoom
 
02:20:49.550 --> 02:20:49.560 align:start position:0%
because there's no way to say that if
 
02:20:52.389 --> 02:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
I'm on a zoom that and it's an important
 
02:20:54.910 --> 02:20:54.920 align:start position:0%
vote that someone's not holding a knife
 
02:20:56.950 --> 02:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
out of camera to me and telling me how
 
02:20:59.870 --> 02:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
to vote well I don't think that extreme
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
example might happen I I don't discount
 
02:21:05.110 --> 02:21:05.120 align:start position:0%
what you're saying um and again u i I
 
02:21:07.790 --> 02:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned in my research for this that
 
02:21:10.870 --> 02:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
current rsas only require that the
 
02:21:13.309 --> 02:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
person be able to be identified
 
02:21:16.870 --> 02:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
basically by V voice there is no uh
 
02:21:19.110 --> 02:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
visual confirmation of the purpose is
 
02:21:21.270 --> 02:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
that a possibility absolutely
 
02:21:24.070 --> 02:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
um yeah all right other questions for
 
02:21:26.349 --> 02:21:26.359 align:start position:0%
this witness seeing none thank you very
 
02:21:31.389 --> 02:21:31.399 align:start position:0%
much guys thank you uh next I'm G to uh
 
02:21:34.429 --> 02:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
call on Karen Rosenberg and um other
 
02:21:36.190 --> 02:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
than the sponsor representative turkot
 
02:21:38.070 --> 02:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask that U people please
 
02:21:40.550 --> 02:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
limit their testimony to three minutes M
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg oh I'm sorry I didn't
 
02:21:46.469 --> 02:21:46.479 align:start position:0%
representative uh representative SEL um
 
02:21:47.830 --> 02:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
sure and again please limit your
 
02:21:50.030 --> 02:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
testimony to three minutes absolutely
 
02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the record I am
 
02:21:53.910 --> 02:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lauren seelig and I
 
02:21:55.309 --> 02:21:55.319 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Durham which is in
 
02:21:58.630 --> 02:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
straford County um and I I would bring
 
02:22:02.510 --> 02:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
up a few points um this is an an issue
 
02:22:03.950 --> 02:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
that has been a
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
countywide uh debate for um a long time
 
02:22:10.950 --> 02:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
um and my experience is fundamentally
 
02:22:14.070 --> 02:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
that we've had a member of our Coalition
 
02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
who requested an attorney provide an
 
02:22:18.230 --> 02:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
answer the attorney's provided an answer
 
02:22:20.070 --> 02:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
that person hasn't likeed the answer so
 
02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
they've asked the the attorney to
 
02:22:22.469 --> 02:22:22.479 align:start position:0%
provide a different answer except the
 
02:22:24.510 --> 02:22:24.520 align:start position:0%
answer hasn't changed because it's still
 
02:22:27.190 --> 02:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
the answer and so they continue to seek
 
02:22:29.110 --> 02:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
different ways of of trying to get the
 
02:22:32.309 --> 02:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
answer they want um I I object to this
 
02:22:34.550 --> 02:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
bill for a number of reasons one I I'm
 
02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
someone who had to miss County meetings
 
02:22:38.670 --> 02:22:38.680 align:start position:0%
because at one point I had covid and
 
02:22:40.349 --> 02:22:40.359 align:start position:0%
rather than exposing the entire County
 
02:22:42.670 --> 02:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
delegation and members of the public to
 
02:22:45.710 --> 02:22:45.720 align:start position:0%
my very active covid and my fever of 101
 
02:22:48.030 --> 02:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
I chose to participate remotely to the
 
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
best of my ability and I was on camera
 
02:22:53.150 --> 02:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
per the RSA I had to stipulate that I
 
02:22:55.990 --> 02:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
was home in my room by myself that I had
 
02:22:57.790 --> 02:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
covid and that's why I was not
 
02:23:00.750 --> 02:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
participating um to be not allowed to
 
02:23:03.790 --> 02:23:03.800 align:start position:0%
vote because I was protecting the public
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
from uh catching a very contagious
 
02:23:08.070 --> 02:23:08.080 align:start position:0%
illness I thought was probably the more
 
02:23:10.469 --> 02:23:10.479 align:start position:0%
responsible choice was to not you know
 
02:23:12.309 --> 02:23:12.319 align:start position:0%
to be able to vote as best I could and
 
02:23:15.070 --> 02:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
participate um this is really a bill
 
02:23:17.429 --> 02:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
that that I think despite this sponsor's
 
02:23:19.349 --> 02:23:19.359 align:start position:0%
intention would in fact also impact all
 
02:23:21.910 --> 02:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
of the Town board's and meetings and at
 
02:23:24.269 --> 02:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
Town boards and meetings um again there
 
02:23:25.510 --> 02:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
are lots of different meetings that
 
02:23:27.710 --> 02:23:27.720 align:start position:0%
happen people can't necessarily attend
 
02:23:29.150 --> 02:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
everyone in person they may have to
 
02:23:30.670 --> 02:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
travel for business they may have
 
02:23:33.429 --> 02:23:33.439 align:start position:0%
personal reasons um it may be a child
 
02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
care issue for them to not be able to be
 
02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
there in person and as long as they're
 
02:23:39.630 --> 02:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
visible on zoom and identifying or on
 
02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
whatever method is being used and you
 
02:23:44.590 --> 02:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
can identify who they are there is no
 
02:23:46.510 --> 02:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
real justification for not allowing them
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
to have an active role in participating
 
02:23:51.349 --> 02:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
in those duties um all of those votes
 
02:23:53.670 --> 02:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
happen by roll call so that you know
 
02:23:55.790 --> 02:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
exactly and the public knows exactly how
 
02:23:57.510 --> 02:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
that person voted it's not different
 
02:23:58.990 --> 02:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
from them being in the room
 
02:24:01.309 --> 02:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
participating in a roll call vote um and
 
02:24:02.830 --> 02:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
it makes it actually more accountable
 
02:24:04.190 --> 02:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
than if it's in a room just by Voice
 
02:24:06.269 --> 02:24:06.279 align:start position:0%
vote so I would encourage you very
 
02:24:10.230 --> 02:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
strongly to uh to vote to uh in
 
02:24:12.070 --> 02:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate on this bill
 
02:24:13.870 --> 02:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
question uh representative
 
02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
Pera thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:24:18.309 --> 02:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so I just want to
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
see if I'm summarizing your testimony
 
02:24:23.750 --> 02:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
correctly so are you saying that even if
 
02:24:26.830 --> 02:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
your the absence of the
 
02:24:30.469 --> 02:24:30.479 align:start position:0%
um member is unavoidable and you listed
 
02:24:33.389 --> 02:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
several op um several instances where
 
02:24:35.349 --> 02:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
that would be unavoidable that you
 
02:24:37.030 --> 02:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
should still be allowed to vote I just
 
02:24:39.230 --> 02:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
want to clarify that that's I I I do
 
02:24:41.630 --> 02:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
believe that and in fact um it's
 
02:24:43.790 --> 02:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
currently listed as not reasonably
 
02:24:45.830 --> 02:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
practical and just in terms of the
 
02:24:48.590 --> 02:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
incident that the previous uh that the
 
02:24:50.950 --> 02:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor mentioned that was a who had
 
02:24:53.870 --> 02:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
left the state to go participate in a
 
02:24:55.990 --> 02:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
family event over a holiday time when we
 
02:24:58.710 --> 02:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
ended up having a a meeting and rather
 
02:25:00.429 --> 02:25:00.439 align:start position:0%
than leaving a family event to get back
 
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
for the vote he was choosing to
 
02:25:04.230 --> 02:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
participate remotely um it was only
 
02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
because the meeting went on for six
 
02:25:07.230 --> 02:25:07.240 align:start position:0%
hours that he said had he known it would
 
02:25:08.910 --> 02:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
be that long he would have driven back
 
02:25:11.150 --> 02:25:11.160 align:start position:0%
to be there in time for the vote but you
 
02:25:13.269 --> 02:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
know a six-hour drive to be there for a
 
02:25:15.150 --> 02:25:15.160 align:start position:0%
vote might not be practical for most
 
02:25:17.269 --> 02:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
people or
 
02:25:19.349 --> 02:25:19.359 align:start position:0%
avoidable other questions for the
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative Perez
 
02:25:24.110 --> 02:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my
 
02:25:27.429 --> 02:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
question I see a Pandora's Box do you
 
02:25:30.510 --> 02:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
believe that we as legislators should be
 
02:25:34.110 --> 02:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
able to participate and vote remotely I
 
02:25:36.550 --> 02:25:36.560 align:start position:0%
believe that for committee meetings
 
02:25:39.429 --> 02:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
where our vote is advisory and not uh
 
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
definitive that that yes we should be
 
02:25:44.710 --> 02:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
allowed to vote remotely if possible um
 
02:25:46.389 --> 02:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
it would certainly given the fact that
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
we get paid so little for those of us
 
02:25:51.469 --> 02:25:51.479 align:start position:0%
who are working to do so many different
 
02:25:53.990 --> 02:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
things to be able to be successful here
 
02:25:56.590 --> 02:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
um or in the case of when I had covid
 
02:26:00.349 --> 02:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
and couldn't be here in person um would
 
02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
I would be open to that however that's
 
02:26:04.469 --> 02:26:04.479 align:start position:0%
not how the legislature has chosen to
 
02:26:06.429 --> 02:26:06.439 align:start position:0%
move forward things it's not how we do
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
things here so I respect and honor the
 
02:26:10.790 --> 02:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
tradition of voting in person I believe
 
02:26:12.590 --> 02:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
on Full House session days we should be
 
02:26:16.150 --> 02:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
here followup yes so are you saying
 
02:26:19.230 --> 02:26:19.240 align:start position:0%
during executive sessions we should be
 
02:26:20.750 --> 02:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
able you you
 
02:26:22.269 --> 02:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
personally feel that we should be able
 
02:26:25.910 --> 02:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
to participate and vote remotely if if
 
02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
there were a way to ensure that we had
 
02:26:29.510 --> 02:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
full video coverage so that both the
 
02:26:31.030 --> 02:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
public and all the members in the room
 
02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
could fully hear and see the person
 
02:26:34.990 --> 02:26:35.000 align:start position:0%
participating remotely I would not
 
02:26:36.590 --> 02:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
object to it I'm not saying I'm
 
02:26:38.190 --> 02:26:38.200 align:start position:0%
promoting it but I would not object to
 
02:26:40.349 --> 02:26:40.359 align:start position:0%
that if that was something that we as a
 
02:26:43.349 --> 02:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
house voted to accept thank you any
 
02:26:44.990 --> 02:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness thank
 
02:26:46.590 --> 02:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
you seeing none thank you very much
 
02:26:49.750 --> 02:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh now Rosenberg Karen
 
02:26:49.760 --> 02:26:56.590 align:start position:0%
thank you uh now Rosenberg Karen
Rosenberg

02:26:56.590 --> 02:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:59.670 --> 02:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
please thank you good afternoon chairman
 
02:27:01.349 --> 02:27:01.359 align:start position:0%
Lynn Representatives members of the
 
02:27:03.309 --> 02:27:03.319 align:start position:0%
committee um my name is Karen Rosenberg
 
02:27:04.429 --> 02:27:04.439 align:start position:0%
I'm the policy director at the
 
02:27:06.190 --> 02:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center New Hampshire's
 
02:27:07.790 --> 02:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
protection and advocacy system for
 
02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities um we oppose
 
02:27:12.590 --> 02:27:12.600 align:start position:0%
this bill because we think that it's
 
02:27:14.630 --> 02:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
potentially discriminatory against
 
02:27:17.030 --> 02:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
people who experience disability who may
 
02:27:20.790 --> 02:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
not be able to attend meetings um of
 
02:27:22.510 --> 02:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
public bodies but who we want to
 
02:27:24.710 --> 02:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
encourage to be full participants in our
 
02:27:26.590 --> 02:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
communities and I think as
 
02:27:28.309 --> 02:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards mentioned one of
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
the purposes of 91a our right to no law
 
02:27:34.830 --> 02:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
is to encourage Civ Civic engagement and
 
02:27:34.840 --> 02:27:35.710 align:start position:0%
is to encourage Civ Civic engagement and
public

02:27:35.710 --> 02:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
participation and for people with
 
02:27:39.950 --> 02:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
disabilities it or people caring for
 
02:27:42.429 --> 02:27:42.439 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities it may be
 
02:27:44.269 --> 02:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
difficult at times to be able to attend
 
02:27:46.950 --> 02:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
a meeting is it completely unavoidable
 
02:27:48.990 --> 02:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
well some people might need specialized
 
02:27:51.429 --> 02:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
transportation to participate in person
 
02:27:54.110 --> 02:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
in a meeting and maybe if they knew 6
 
02:27:55.750 --> 02:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
months in advance that they were going
 
02:27:57.750 --> 02:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
to be scheduled to attend a meeting they
 
02:27:59.269 --> 02:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
could arrange that specialized
 
02:28:01.070 --> 02:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation but perhaps they're not
 
02:28:03.830 --> 02:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
going to know that and so it you know
 
02:28:05.710 --> 02:28:05.720 align:start position:0%
theoretically might be unavoidable but
 
02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
as a practical matter it might not be
 
02:28:09.469 --> 02:28:09.479 align:start position:0%
unavoidable for someone with a
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
disability to be able to get to a
 
02:28:14.990 --> 02:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
meeting um and then what this would do
 
02:28:17.510 --> 02:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
if a person was in a situation where
 
02:28:20.550 --> 02:28:20.560 align:start position:0%
they didn't reach this higher level of
 
02:28:23.230 --> 02:28:23.240 align:start position:0%
um unavoidable in order to participate
 
02:28:25.550 --> 02:28:25.560 align:start position:0%
remotely it would create like two
 
02:28:27.070 --> 02:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
categories of individuals who are
 
02:28:29.950 --> 02:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
members of public bodies members who are
 
02:28:31.510 --> 02:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
able to attend meetings and maybe and
 
02:28:33.550 --> 02:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
members who because of their disability
 
02:28:35.469 --> 02:28:35.479 align:start position:0%
are not able to attend and make them
 
02:28:37.550 --> 02:28:37.560 align:start position:0%
second class members of bodies by not
 
02:28:39.750 --> 02:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
permitting them to do what public body
 
02:28:42.510 --> 02:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
members need to do vote have a voice
 
02:28:45.670 --> 02:28:45.680 align:start position:0%
when people participate in public bodies
 
02:28:48.349 --> 02:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's at the local or county
 
02:28:50.710 --> 02:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
level or it's a state why body that
 
02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
meets un conquered it's to enable people
 
02:28:54.910 --> 02:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
to have a voice and make recommendations
 
02:28:57.070 --> 02:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
about really important issues like
 
02:28:59.230 --> 02:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
education of children with disabilities
 
02:29:01.590 --> 02:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
or quality of services for people who
 
02:29:03.710 --> 02:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
have developmental Ser disabilities and
 
02:29:07.309 --> 02:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
receive services and so um for those
 
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
reasons we think that this would be
 
02:29:10.790 --> 02:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
discriminatory it would take a step
 
02:29:13.150 --> 02:29:13.160 align:start position:0%
backwards in terms of encouraging Civic
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
engagement and and participation
 
02:29:17.870 --> 02:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
particularly among people who experience
 
02:29:20.110 --> 02:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
disability or care for people who
 
02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
experienc disability and may not be able
 
02:29:24.309 --> 02:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
to get away and I'm happy to answer any
 
02:29:25.590 --> 02:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
questions oh one thing I did want to
 
02:29:27.670 --> 02:29:27.680 align:start position:0%
mention representative Perez there is a
 
02:29:30.190 --> 02:29:30.200 align:start position:0%
requirement in current law that if
 
02:29:32.110 --> 02:29:32.120 align:start position:0%
someone participates remotely first of
 
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
all the the body has to allow that to
 
02:29:37.110 --> 02:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
happen so bodies can determine that they
 
02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
are not going to allow remote
 
02:29:41.269 --> 02:29:41.279 align:start position:0%
participation from a disability rights
 
02:29:42.550 --> 02:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
perspective of course we would hope they
 
02:29:44.990 --> 02:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
would but if someone does participate
 
02:29:46.750 --> 02:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
remotely our current Law requires that
 
02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
they identify anyone who's in the room
 
02:29:50.670 --> 02:29:50.680 align:start position:0%
with them so I I can understand it would
 
02:29:51.910 --> 02:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
be awkward to say someone's holding a
 
02:29:54.349 --> 02:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
knife at me but but they would have to
 
02:29:55.630 --> 02:29:55.640 align:start position:0%
at least acknowledge that there's
 
02:29:58.150 --> 02:29:58.160 align:start position:0%
another person in the room with
 
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
them other qu yes representative
 
02:30:05.550 --> 02:30:05.560 align:start position:0%
trip uh thank you uh do you happen to
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
know which RSA that uh is in yes which
 
02:30:11.190 --> 02:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
which one about the person announcing
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
that the person in the room with you uh
 
02:30:16.910 --> 02:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
people being the the group the public
 
02:30:19.429 --> 02:30:19.439 align:start position:0%
body being able to determine that
 
02:30:20.750 --> 02:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
someone can
 
02:30:24.950 --> 02:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
participate uh remotely yes it's in
 
02:30:30.870 --> 02:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
91a Roman um colon 2 um Roman
 
02:30:33.030 --> 02:30:33.040 align:start position:0%
three that's where it says a public body
 
02:30:35.269 --> 02:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
may but is not required to allow one or
 
02:30:36.950 --> 02:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
more persons
 
02:30:39.990 --> 02:30:40.000 align:start position:0%
participate other representative
 
02:30:42.389 --> 02:30:42.399 align:start position:0%
pno thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:30:45.670 --> 02:30:45.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question if I recall correctly
 
02:30:47.550 --> 02:30:47.560 align:start position:0%
we had a bill last year about the
 
02:30:50.349 --> 02:30:50.359 align:start position:0%
membership of a specific um commission
 
02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
or committee um and the membership of
 
02:30:54.309 --> 02:30:54.319 align:start position:0%
that committee and that was a
 
02:30:56.630 --> 02:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
significant concern with parental
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
participation that was required and we
 
02:31:01.190 --> 02:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
talked about whether or not people would
 
02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
be able we talked about different
 
02:31:05.429 --> 02:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
options for participation for those
 
02:31:08.550 --> 02:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
members um I can't remember did we agree
 
02:31:10.349 --> 02:31:10.359 align:start position:0%
I think what you're remembering is that
 
02:31:13.389 --> 02:31:13.399 align:start position:0%
it was a couple years ago actually and I
 
02:31:14.790 --> 02:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
mean there's all these numbers floating
 
02:31:16.870 --> 02:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
my head I think it was HB 308 but don't
 
02:31:19.590 --> 02:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
quote me on that um but it was it it did
 
02:31:21.630 --> 02:31:21.640 align:start position:0%
involve the reduction of the in-person
 
02:31:23.510 --> 02:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
quarum requirement is that the one that
 
02:31:26.750 --> 02:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
you're referring to it was HB 147 and
 
02:31:28.630 --> 02:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
was the oh that one that is that had to
 
02:31:31.469 --> 02:31:31.479 align:start position:0%
do with yeah that didn't really address
 
02:31:33.429 --> 02:31:33.439 align:start position:0%
remote participation so much that
 
02:31:36.150 --> 02:31:36.160 align:start position:0%
addressed um the membership of the act
 
02:31:38.110 --> 02:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
and who ought to be on it and how to
 
02:31:40.830 --> 02:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
encourage um participation by parents
 
02:31:42.910 --> 02:31:42.920 align:start position:0%
for whom it would be difficult so
 
02:31:45.630 --> 02:31:45.640 align:start position:0%
certainly allowing remote participation
 
02:31:47.790 --> 02:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
does enable parents who may have
 
02:31:49.309 --> 02:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
childcare responsibilities and other
 
02:31:51.269 --> 02:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
responsibil Le to a 10 but it wasn't
 
02:31:53.830 --> 02:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
just you spot on exactly what that was
 
02:31:56.469 --> 02:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
about but it touched on it um yeah thank
 
02:31:58.870 --> 02:31:58.880 align:start position:0%
you I I remember that it wasn't about
 
02:32:00.389 --> 02:32:00.399 align:start position:0%
how they could participate but I
 
02:32:01.910 --> 02:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
remember that being a discussion in the
 
02:32:03.030 --> 02:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
hearing so thank you very much I think
 
02:32:05.510 --> 02:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
your memory is correct other questions
 
02:32:08.309 --> 02:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
for this witness seeing none thank you
 
02:32:12.030 --> 02:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
very much Mr thank you next um I'm going
 
02:32:28.389 --> 02:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:30.670 --> 02:32:30.680 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Sarah bur Cohen and I
 
02:32:32.230 --> 02:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:32:34.389 --> 02:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
Association the New Hampshire Municipal
 
02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
Association opposes
 
02:32:40.830 --> 02:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
hb80 um currently the statute um lost my
 
02:32:42.510 --> 02:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
P train of thought I'm so sorry
 
02:32:44.670 --> 02:32:44.680 align:start position:0%
currently the statute um states that the
 
02:32:46.630 --> 02:32:46.640 align:start position:0%
public body May participate that's what
 
02:32:48.070 --> 02:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about so the public
 
02:32:50.630 --> 02:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
body has to agree to to electronic
 
02:32:53.309 --> 02:32:53.319 align:start position:0%
participation which we concur with Karen
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
we would hope they would do so um
 
02:32:59.070 --> 02:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
unreasonably practicable right now um is
 
02:33:01.389 --> 02:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
set by the chair but generally um we
 
02:33:04.030 --> 02:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
find it to mean illness scheduling
 
02:33:07.309 --> 02:33:07.319 align:start position:0%
issues um transportation issues and
 
02:33:09.349 --> 02:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
disability um though a person wouldn't
 
02:33:11.389 --> 02:33:11.399 align:start position:0%
be able to participate participate in
 
02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
person they're trying their best to
 
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
participate um by electronic means so
 
02:33:18.469 --> 02:33:18.479 align:start position:0%
their their voice and their voice of
 
02:33:20.590 --> 02:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
their constituents can be heard
 
02:33:24.030 --> 02:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
hb80 sets the standard for non inperson
 
02:33:26.110 --> 02:33:26.120 align:start position:0%
attendance to unavoidable unavoidable
 
02:33:29.190 --> 02:33:29.200 align:start position:0%
though undefined presumably um according
 
02:33:31.309 --> 02:33:31.319 align:start position:0%
to the sponsor is a higher burden so
 
02:33:37.429 --> 02:33:37.439 align:start position:0%
that um it would make it um so that it
 
02:33:39.750 --> 02:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
would prevent a person from um
 
02:33:41.389 --> 02:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
participating electronically who may be
 
02:33:43.389 --> 02:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
very ill but feels like they can still
 
02:33:46.469 --> 02:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
make it um and they do and maybe they
 
02:33:48.469 --> 02:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
infect the maybe they infect the public
 
02:33:51.630 --> 02:33:51.640 align:start position:0%
body if the public body allows
 
02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:52.870 align:start position:0%
body if the public body allows
participation

02:33:52.870 --> 02:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
participation
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
electronically um it seems
 
02:33:58.389 --> 02:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive as this bill um would
 
02:34:00.830 --> 02:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
allow if passed to take away that
 
02:34:02.990 --> 02:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
person's right to vote currently 91a
 
02:34:06.590 --> 02:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
requires um roll call votes for um when
 
02:34:09.269 --> 02:34:09.279 align:start position:0%
a public body has a member participating
 
02:34:12.870 --> 02:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
um electronically to ensure that that
 
02:34:14.750 --> 02:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
the votes are on record and the public
 
02:34:18.429 --> 02:34:18.439 align:start position:0%
has access to them um likewise when a
 
02:34:20.670 --> 02:34:20.680 align:start position:0%
person participates electronically that
 
02:34:23.269 --> 02:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
person needs to be the public needs to
 
02:34:25.870 --> 02:34:25.880 align:start position:0%
be able to hear that person as well as
 
02:34:27.389 --> 02:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
whoever is clerking or taking the
 
02:34:29.950 --> 02:34:29.960 align:start position:0%
minutes for that meeting to ensure that
 
02:34:34.150 --> 02:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
um their um uh their voice is
 
02:34:38.469 --> 02:34:38.479 align:start position:0%
heard instead HB uh 80 uh by taking away
 
02:34:40.429 --> 02:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
the person's right to vote who have has
 
02:34:42.469 --> 02:34:42.479 align:start position:0%
to uh participate electronically seems
 
02:34:45.710 --> 02:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
to punish that member um who is trying
 
02:34:48.309 --> 02:34:48.319 align:start position:0%
to balance their other obligations and
 
02:34:51.110 --> 02:34:51.120 align:start position:0%
participate uh in in
 
02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:53.790 align:start position:0%
participate uh in in
person

02:34:53.790 --> 02:34:53.800 align:start position:0%
person
 
02:34:59.630 --> 02:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
um H so uh to conclude in essence hb8
 
02:35:02.269 --> 02:35:02.279 align:start position:0%
endorses silencing votes and silencing
 
02:35:04.070 --> 02:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
voices that otherwise would have been
 
02:35:07.630 --> 02:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
able to participate um uh electronically
 
02:35:09.349 --> 02:35:09.359 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they can be heard I'll
 
02:35:12.429 --> 02:35:12.439 align:start position:0%
take any questions questions for this
 
02:35:15.349 --> 02:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very
 
02:35:20.309 --> 02:35:20.319 align:start position:0%
much um next uh uh
 
02:35:33.710 --> 02:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:36.150 --> 02:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
please thank you again chairman Lyn good
 
02:35:37.230 --> 02:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee
 
02:35:38.590 --> 02:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
Barrett Christina New Hampshire School
 
02:35:40.349 --> 02:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
Board Association I will be brief I
 
02:35:41.349 --> 02:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
understand I'm probably the last thing
 
02:35:43.429 --> 02:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
between many of you and a a warm bowl of
 
02:35:46.070 --> 02:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
soup on a on a cold Winter's Day School
 
02:35:47.910 --> 02:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
boards Association is opposed to House
 
02:35:51.269 --> 02:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
Bill 20 um in our experience um the
 
02:35:54.910 --> 02:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
electronic um uh uh the provisions in
 
02:35:56.990 --> 02:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
the statute that allow members of a
 
02:35:58.670 --> 02:35:58.680 align:start position:0%
public body to participate
 
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
electronically have been used without
 
02:36:02.590 --> 02:36:02.600 align:start position:0%
issue have been used sparingly and have
 
02:36:05.750 --> 02:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
been used properly um you know most of
 
02:36:08.030 --> 02:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
the time it is is a is a parent at home
 
02:36:10.429 --> 02:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
with a sick child or the babysitter fell
 
02:36:13.670 --> 02:36:13.680 align:start position:0%
through or a board member maybe uh
 
02:36:15.190 --> 02:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
called away to work they're they're
 
02:36:17.870 --> 02:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
they're in California on a for for work
 
02:36:20.190 --> 02:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
obligations we also think think that the
 
02:36:23.190 --> 02:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
existing law um still provides um
 
02:36:26.070 --> 02:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
sufficient um transparency uh for the
 
02:36:29.870 --> 02:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
public for example um you know me uh the
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
member of the public body may only meet
 
02:36:34.389 --> 02:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
when attendance is not practicable um
 
02:36:36.429 --> 02:36:36.439 align:start position:0%
each part of the meeting has to be um
 
02:36:38.230 --> 02:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
open to the public and shall be audible
 
02:36:39.630 --> 02:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
or otherwise
 
02:36:42.550 --> 02:36:42.560 align:start position:0%
discernable um should the me meetings uh
 
02:36:44.030 --> 02:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
held pursuant to the terms in this
 
02:36:45.590 --> 02:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph shall comply with all other
 
02:36:49.710 --> 02:36:49.720 align:start position:0%
requirements relative to to RSA 91a so
 
02:36:51.349 --> 02:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
we don't think that that the the
 
02:36:52.990 --> 02:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
changing the language from not
 
02:36:55.750 --> 02:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
reasonably practical to unavoidable is
 
02:36:57.950 --> 02:36:57.960 align:start position:0%
necessary um I don't know where that
 
02:36:59.550 --> 02:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
line is what makes something not
 
02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
reasonably practical unavoidable but we
 
02:37:05.030 --> 02:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
think um the not reasonably practical uh
 
02:37:06.910 --> 02:37:06.920 align:start position:0%
language meets the needs of our our
 
02:37:08.510 --> 02:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
local Schoolboard members many of whom
 
02:37:12.030 --> 02:37:12.040 align:start position:0%
are parents many of whom have kids um at
 
02:37:13.590 --> 02:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
at home that they're that they may have
 
02:37:15.110 --> 02:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
to tend to maybe not for the full
 
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
meeting but you may need to get the kid
 
02:37:18.510 --> 02:37:18.520 align:start position:0%
to bed before you can hop on the zoom
 
02:37:21.550 --> 02:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
and join the meeting uh nhba would also
 
02:37:24.590 --> 02:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
um uh oppose the language um that would
 
02:37:27.469 --> 02:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
restrict um uh a board member
 
02:37:30.269 --> 02:37:30.279 align:start position:0%
participating electronically from voting
 
02:37:31.950 --> 02:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
um the language of the of the bill says
 
02:37:34.309 --> 02:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
that the person is deemed present for
 
02:37:36.710 --> 02:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
purposes of the meeting but not present
 
02:37:39.389 --> 02:37:39.399 align:start position:0%
for except for voting purposes well if
 
02:37:41.309 --> 02:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
you're present at the meeting we would
 
02:37:42.870 --> 02:37:42.880 align:start position:0%
think that you should be able to allow

hoping to catch us up on this bill I'm
 
02:39:45.469 --> 02:39:45.479 align:start position:0%
trying to be as brief as possible um for
 
02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
the record my name is representative
 
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
Alexander this is my fourth term on
 
02:39:50.030 --> 02:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
Judiciary I'm serving um the town of
 
02:39:52.550 --> 02:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
Goffstown um this bill should be
 
02:39:54.110 --> 02:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
familiar if you have served on this
 
02:39:55.910 --> 02:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
Committee in the past there are some new
 
02:39:57.950 --> 02:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee but this bill
 
02:40:01.870 --> 02:40:01.880 align:start position:0%
was one that um last year um we had
 
02:40:04.190 --> 02:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
adopted as a non-gain amendment to
 
02:40:08.070 --> 02:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
enable municipalities the option of um
 
02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
transitioning their records to an
 
02:40:12.630 --> 02:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
electronic version um this makes a small
 
02:40:13.910 --> 02:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
small small
 
02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
appropriation um that I'm hoping we can
 
02:40:20.110 --> 02:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
um absorb in the budget um and and like
 
02:40:22.309 --> 02:40:22.319 align:start position:0%
I said this this would this would allow
 
02:40:24.830 --> 02:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
the opportunity for accessing public
 
02:40:26.670 --> 02:40:26.680 align:start position:0%
records electronically provided the
 
02:40:29.590 --> 02:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
municipality provides um a computer or
 
02:40:31.870 --> 02:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
some way to access it for free um so
 
02:40:33.510 --> 02:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
there's no additional like tax on
 
02:40:35.550 --> 02:40:35.560 align:start position:0%
somebody that would like to um access
 
02:40:38.710 --> 02:40:38.720 align:start position:0%
this data electronically um I think for
 
02:40:40.630 --> 02:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
the appropriation that's given that the
 
02:40:43.590 --> 02:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
amount of money that towns will save on
 
02:40:45.790 --> 02:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
not having should they choose to do this
 
02:40:48.309 --> 02:40:48.319 align:start position:0%
not having to store their data um in
 
02:40:50.590 --> 02:40:50.600 align:start position:0%
paper copies and the the the printing
 
02:40:53.790 --> 02:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
costs the storage costs um I think will
 
02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:55.550 align:start position:0%
costs the storage costs um I think will
hopefully

02:40:55.550 --> 02:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
um very much make up the cost of this
 
02:40:59.230 --> 02:40:59.240 align:start position:0%
bill I really hope that the committee
 
02:41:01.830 --> 02:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
will consider um supporting it as um
 
02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
former for former Judiciary committees
 
02:41:07.110 --> 02:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
have and um I have the state archist is
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
here to weigh in on this as is um uh the
 
02:41:10.990 --> 02:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office should
 
02:41:12.950 --> 02:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
needed but um I'm happy to answer
 
02:41:14.110 --> 02:41:14.120 align:start position:0%
questions but there are people here to
 
02:41:16.590 --> 02:41:16.600 align:start position:0%
answer questions as well so questions
 
02:41:17.950 --> 02:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
02:41:20.830 --> 02:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
witness yes representative Perez correct
 
02:41:23.990 --> 02:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
me didn't we pass last year that cities
 
02:41:26.670 --> 02:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
and towns had the were able to put it in
 
02:41:29.630 --> 02:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
the archives yes so this bill this bill
 
02:41:31.950 --> 02:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
passed Judiciary it passed the house um
 
02:41:35.269 --> 02:41:35.279 align:start position:0%
went to the Senate passed the Senate I
 
02:41:36.550 --> 02:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
believe it came back to the house and
 
02:41:38.230 --> 02:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
there was a funding issue with it um
 
02:41:39.790 --> 02:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
because it was second year in the bium
 
02:41:41.990 --> 02:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm reintroducing this so that we can
 
02:41:43.870 --> 02:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
hopefully absorb this into the budget um
 
02:41:47.070 --> 02:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
the very very small um appropriation
 
02:41:51.510 --> 02:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:53.110 --> 02:41:53.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much you very
 
02:41:55.590 --> 02:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
much oh I I have one other thing to add
 
02:41:57.750 --> 02:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
so um the archist in the Secretary of
 
02:41:59.870 --> 02:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
State's office is going to indicate that
 
02:42:02.309 --> 02:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
um the appropriation is a little bit off
 
02:42:04.309 --> 02:42:04.319 align:start position:0%
like a few thousand I believe it's like
 
02:42:06.510 --> 02:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
over under um I have an amendment
 
02:42:08.870 --> 02:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
drafted that will um fix that
 
02:42:11.110 --> 02:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation section six of the bill
 
02:42:13.469 --> 02:42:13.479 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to either do it during this
 
02:42:14.830 --> 02:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
executive session or if the committee
 
02:42:17.630 --> 02:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
would like to send it to finance um they
 
02:42:19.790 --> 02:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
can also hopefully adopt that Amendment
 
02:42:21.469 --> 02:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
so that's up to the committee um but I
 
02:42:22.469 --> 02:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
want to let you know I have an amendment
 
02:42:23.790 --> 02:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
in drafting sure you know I just
 
02:42:25.110 --> 02:42:25.120 align:start position:0%
question this is going to have to go to
 
02:42:26.830 --> 02:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
finance anyway isn't it I believe it's
 
02:42:29.309 --> 02:42:29.319 align:start position:0%
an early bill yeah all right all right
 
02:42:31.309 --> 02:42:31.319 align:start position:0%

Secretary of State's office I support
 
02:43:19.750 --> 02:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 164 relative to local records
 
02:43:21.990 --> 02:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
retention as the Director of archives
 
02:43:24.150 --> 02:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
and Records management for the state our
 
02:43:25.950 --> 02:43:25.960 align:start position:0%
division is often sought out by
 
02:43:28.150 --> 02:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
municipalities to answer their records
 
02:43:30.590 --> 02:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
related questions as you know New
 
02:43:32.389 --> 02:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has home to over 200
 
02:43:34.190 --> 02:43:34.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities each with their own
 
02:43:34.200 --> 02:43:35.190 align:start position:0%
municipalities each with their own
unique

02:43:35.190 --> 02:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
unique
 
02:43:37.550 --> 02:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
challenges a local government records
 
02:43:40.269 --> 02:43:40.279 align:start position:0%
manager plays a crucial role in ensuring
 
02:43:42.590 --> 02:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
efficient recordkeeping this role will
 
02:43:44.990 --> 02:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
allow us to reach every municipality to
 
02:43:46.990 --> 02:43:47.000 align:start position:0%
promote and Implement systematic
 
02:43:49.230 --> 02:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
organization preserve the historical
 
02:43:51.389 --> 02:43:51.399 align:start position:0%
records they do have train them on
 
02:43:53.590 --> 02:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
digitization and metadata
 
02:43:56.030 --> 02:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
standards and this not only streamlines
 
02:43:58.190 --> 02:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
our recordkeeping processes Statewide
 
02:44:00.790 --> 02:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
but it allows for quick retrieval of
 
02:44:02.910 --> 02:44:02.920 align:start position:0%
information this bill does not create
 
02:44:05.590 --> 02:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
any new positions under the Secretary of
 
02:44:07.790 --> 02:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
State's office but it does fund a
 
02:44:09.790 --> 02:44:09.800 align:start position:0%
position that is currently
 
02:44:11.750 --> 02:44:11.760 align:start position:0%
unfunded with the funding of this
 
02:44:13.710 --> 02:44:13.720 align:start position:0%
position we can better serve all of our
 
02:44:15.790 --> 02:44:15.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities by providing Outreach
 
02:44:18.550 --> 02:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
training best practices and a convenient
 
02:44:20.510 --> 02:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
Repository where their records can be
 
02:44:22.750 --> 02:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
both preserved and accessible to the
 
02:44:25.230 --> 02:44:25.240 align:start position:0%
public archives are arsenals of
 
02:44:27.469 --> 02:44:27.479 align:start position:0%
accountability we strive to preserve the
 
02:44:29.910 --> 02:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
historical record to promote government
 
02:44:32.389 --> 02:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
transparency increased access to records
 
02:44:34.349 --> 02:44:34.359 align:start position:0%
for the public allows citizens to
 
02:44:36.309 --> 02:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
monitor government activities and
 
02:44:38.110 --> 02:44:38.120 align:start position:0%
exercise their rights as informed
 
02:44:40.630 --> 02:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
citizens this bill is a step towards
 
02:44:42.670 --> 02:44:42.680 align:start position:0%
access thank you to the committee for
 
02:44:44.429 --> 02:44:44.439 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to speak and I'm happy
 
02:44:46.790 --> 02:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions questions for
 
02:44:48.830 --> 02:44:48.840 align:start position:0%
this witness yes representative Rono
 
02:44:49.990 --> 02:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank thankk you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:44:51.550 --> 02:44:51.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question as I am a new
 
02:44:53.550 --> 02:44:53.560 align:start position:0%
member of this committee uh I apologize
 
02:44:55.510 --> 02:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
that something was covered when similar
 
02:44:57.590 --> 02:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill came through last year um it and
 
02:44:58.550 --> 02:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
maybe it's better directed to
 
02:45:00.950 --> 02:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
represented Alexander is the idea that
 
02:45:03.469 --> 02:45:03.479 align:start position:0%
um the cost obviously of implementing
 
02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
this might be offset and part by um not
 
02:45:09.110 --> 02:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
needing to maintain the same paper
 
02:45:11.110 --> 02:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
records in the same manner uh going
 
02:45:13.269 --> 02:45:13.279 align:start position:0%
forward once they are on an electronic
 
02:45:15.670 --> 02:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
format and available to the public thank
 
02:45:17.309 --> 02:45:17.319 align:start position:0%

02:45:19.790 --> 02:45:19.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other question for this
 
02:45:22.070 --> 02:45:22.080 align:start position:0%

please not a problem thank you Mr chair
 
02:45:43.150 --> 02:45:43.160 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is uh Josh
 
02:45:47.150 --> 02:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
Vella uh former representative um I
 
02:45:50.990 --> 02:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
sponsored this bill last term last year
 
02:45:53.990 --> 02:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
and um the bill passed this committee
 
02:45:56.590 --> 02:45:56.600 align:start position:0%
and finance and it passed in the Senate
 
02:45:59.830 --> 02:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
and was uh tabled by the by their
 
02:46:01.429 --> 02:46:01.439 align:start position:0%
finance committee because there was
 
02:46:05.910 --> 02:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
insufficient funds um the idea behind
 
02:46:08.550 --> 02:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
this legislation is to provide an option
 
02:46:08.560 --> 02:46:09.349 align:start position:0%
this legislation is to provide an option
for

02:46:09.349 --> 02:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:46:12.750 --> 02:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities to
 
02:46:17.670 --> 02:46:17.680 align:start position:0%
um address some of their concerns about
 
02:46:21.670 --> 02:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
the overhead and their liability for for
 
02:46:24.950 --> 02:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
um maintaining the records in in often
 
02:46:27.190 --> 02:46:27.200 align:start position:0%
in boxes up in the basement or in the
 
02:46:32.910 --> 02:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
Attic um and also uh that you know we
 
02:46:35.190 --> 02:46:35.200 align:start position:0%
have the this concern earlier today
 
02:46:38.670 --> 02:46:38.680 align:start position:0%
about massive voluminous requests and
 
02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
the um cost that imposes on
 
02:46:44.510 --> 02:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities where this potential
 
02:46:47.550 --> 02:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
solution is to have a website that is
 
02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:49.230 align:start position:0%
solution is to have a website that is
access

02:46:49.230 --> 02:46:49.240 align:start position:0%
access
 
02:46:53.469 --> 02:46:53.479 align:start position:0%
accessible by anyone at any time um that
 
02:46:55.950 --> 02:46:55.960 align:start position:0%
if those records are uploaded to there
 
02:46:57.870 --> 02:46:57.880 align:start position:0%
they no longer need to store them in the
 
02:47:00.190 --> 02:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
Attic those municipalities they don't
 
02:47:02.750 --> 02:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
have to maintain that and if someone
 
02:47:04.670 --> 02:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
requests that information they just have
 
02:47:08.030 --> 02:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
to provide them them a free way to
 
02:47:10.830 --> 02:47:10.840 align:start position:0%
access that website if if that person is
 
02:47:16.230 --> 02:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
unable to do so on their own um and also
 
02:47:19.190 --> 02:47:19.200 align:start position:0%
the the main cost of this is for the
 
02:47:21.830 --> 02:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
employment of a person at the state to
 
02:47:23.910 --> 02:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
help assisting and answering questions
 
02:47:26.990 --> 02:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
from M municipalities on the best ways
 
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
to move you know keep their records and
 
02:47:35.230 --> 02:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
keep them uh uh accessible to people um
 
02:47:39.710 --> 02:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
and uh I am happy to uh answer any
 
02:47:41.790 --> 02:47:41.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you questions yes
 
02:47:41.800 --> 02:47:42.830 align:start position:0%
questions thank you questions yes
representative

02:47:42.830 --> 02:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:47:45.550 --> 02:47:45.560 align:start position:0%
B thank you
 
02:47:49.590 --> 02:47:49.600 align:start position:0%
chair I guess I'm just curious if you
 
02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
think that'll bring on any more it
 
02:47:54.750 --> 02:47:54.760 align:start position:0%
expenses for companies that you know may
 
02:47:57.870 --> 02:47:57.880 align:start position:0%
either need to digitalize or whatnot I
 
02:47:59.429 --> 02:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
don't know I figured you might have come
 
02:48:03.670 --> 02:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
across a few thank you for the question
 
02:48:11.429 --> 02:48:11.439 align:start position:0%
um the in my research um of this bill I
 
02:48:13.150 --> 02:48:13.160 align:start position:0%
am one of those people that requested a
 
02:48:15.269 --> 02:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
lot of documents from my town I have
 
02:48:18.429 --> 02:48:18.439 align:start position:0%
scanned probably 100,000 documents of my
 
02:48:18.439 --> 02:48:19.510 align:start position:0%
scanned probably 100,000 documents of my
town

02:48:19.510 --> 02:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
town
 
02:48:23.870 --> 02:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
records so I know what is what it takes
 
02:48:26.830 --> 02:48:26.840 align:start position:0%
to put in the effort to to scan that
 
02:48:29.389 --> 02:48:29.399 align:start position:0%
document and and upload it and there
 
02:48:31.750 --> 02:48:31.760 align:start position:0%
there could be if the municipality
 
02:48:33.269 --> 02:48:33.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to get rid of all of the
 
02:48:35.950 --> 02:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
documents and the up upstairs and just
 
02:48:37.910 --> 02:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
be like we're done with that there would
 
02:48:39.910 --> 02:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
could be a one-time expense that maybe
 
02:48:41.550 --> 02:48:41.560 align:start position:0%
would be a worn article or something at
 
02:48:44.870 --> 02:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
their local town but generally the
 
02:48:47.269 --> 02:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
ongoing if they if they chose not to do
 
02:48:50.469 --> 02:48:50.479 align:start position:0%
that that would that that those records
 
02:48:51.950 --> 02:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
could stay there and they would they
 
02:48:55.070 --> 02:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
would be requested the old way and um
 
02:48:58.110 --> 02:48:58.120 align:start position:0%
most records nowadays are already
 
02:49:00.429 --> 02:49:00.439 align:start position:0%
created in PDF format or whatever and so
 
02:49:02.910 --> 02:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
that they would be able to be uploaded
 
02:49:05.190 --> 02:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
the current documents right away and so
 
02:49:07.790 --> 02:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
even if they were like we're not we're
 
02:49:09.910 --> 02:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
not we're going to forgo the expense of
 
02:49:12.030 --> 02:49:12.040 align:start position:0%
digitizing what we already have we're
 
02:49:15.150 --> 02:49:15.160 align:start position:0%
just going to move forward then um they
 
02:49:17.229 --> 02:49:17.239 align:start position:0%
would at least limit their liability
 
02:49:19.630 --> 02:49:19.640 align:start position:0%
going forward right over time it would
 
02:49:23.309 --> 02:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
would reduce and so but you've heard I
 
02:49:25.870 --> 02:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
think some municipalities they have have
 
02:49:27.710 --> 02:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
gotten requests that cost them a
 
02:49:30.469 --> 02:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
significant amount of money and I would
 
02:49:32.830 --> 02:49:32.840 align:start position:0%
definitely pause it to my town that you
 
02:49:37.229 --> 02:49:37.239 align:start position:0%
know the the5 or $10,000 that that it
 
02:49:40.429 --> 02:49:40.439 align:start position:0%
cost to up uh scan all of those
 
02:49:44.030 --> 02:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
documents and put them on on the website
 
02:49:47.429 --> 02:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
uh is a good investment for the for the
 
02:49:51.389 --> 02:49:51.399 align:start position:0%
you know the uh 70th time that that
 
02:49:53.269 --> 02:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
thing that same piece of document gets
 
02:49:55.229 --> 02:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
requested right and in addition to the
 
02:49:57.670 --> 02:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
man hours that it requires to go get
 
02:50:00.590 --> 02:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
that and and provide it so I think it's
 
02:50:02.950 --> 02:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
a good investment of the state other
 
02:50:05.229 --> 02:50:05.239 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness seeing none
 
02:50:06.269 --> 02:50:06.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
02:50:08.950 --> 02:50:08.960 align:start position:0%
much next I'm going to call on Katherine
 
02:50:18.950 --> 02:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:22.030 --> 02:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
thank you committee members um right to
 
02:50:24.910 --> 02:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire supports HB 164 um I
 
02:50:27.070 --> 02:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make a couple of points
 
02:50:30.710 --> 02:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
that in many cases um the difficulty
 
02:50:32.349 --> 02:50:32.359 align:start position:0%
that communities have providing
 
02:50:33.670 --> 02:50:33.680 align:start position:0%
information when they feel that
 
02:50:35.110 --> 02:50:35.120 align:start position:0%
something is a larger burdensome
 
02:50:37.309 --> 02:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
requests stems from the the fact that
 
02:50:39.190 --> 02:50:39.200 align:start position:0%
they are not able to get those records
 
02:50:40.630 --> 02:50:40.640 align:start position:0%
electronically they're not already in a
 
02:50:42.910 --> 02:50:42.920 align:start position:0%
format that's easily accessible um and
 
02:50:44.830 --> 02:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
that makes the availability of Records
 
02:50:47.389 --> 02:50:47.399 align:start position:0%
uneven um over the geography of New
 
02:50:49.710 --> 02:50:49.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and over time um we do see
 
02:50:51.150 --> 02:50:51.160 align:start position:0%
this a lot when people come to us for
 
02:50:52.510 --> 02:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
assistance especially if they're looking
 
02:50:53.830 --> 02:50:53.840 align:start position:0%
to research an issue that has
 
02:50:57.309 --> 02:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
significant history in their Community
 
02:51:00.030 --> 02:51:00.040 align:start position:0%
um this bill was created and I don't
 
02:51:02.110 --> 02:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
think this has been discussed yet with a
 
02:51:04.550 --> 02:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
lot of input and support initially last
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
year when it first came before the
 
02:51:07.550 --> 02:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
committee from both the New Hampshire
 
02:51:09.229 --> 02:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association the New Hampshire
 
02:51:10.870 --> 02:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
State archives and right to know New
 
02:51:13.389 --> 02:51:13.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire this is um at a time was
 
02:51:16.229 --> 02:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
supported by all of them um if it is
 
02:51:18.830 --> 02:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
passed we are committed to encour in
 
02:51:20.469 --> 02:51:20.479 align:start position:0%
communities to take advantage of this
 
02:51:22.190 --> 02:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
option and I just wanted to share
 
02:51:23.710 --> 02:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
something that hasn't come up in
 
02:51:26.030 --> 02:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
discussion yet today which is New
 
02:51:27.750 --> 02:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is unique because we do not
 
02:51:29.550 --> 02:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
have an independent oversight body for
 
02:51:31.229 --> 02:51:31.239 align:start position:0%
transparency issues we have no
 
02:51:33.349 --> 02:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
requirement that local officials provide
 
02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
record management um a record management
 
02:51:38.229 --> 02:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
ENT entity and we do not require
 
02:51:41.550 --> 02:51:41.560 align:start position:0%
training in RSA 91a so even for people
 
02:51:43.469 --> 02:51:43.479 align:start position:0%
who are responsible for compliance with
 
02:51:46.229 --> 02:51:46.239 align:start position:0%
that law and so in reviewing other state
 
02:51:48.830 --> 02:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
laws regarding access to information I
 
02:51:50.750 --> 02:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
am consistently struck by the fact that
 
02:51:52.910 --> 02:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
most of those include a requirement that
 
02:51:54.469 --> 02:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
there be a responsible party and we
 
02:51:56.070 --> 02:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
don't have that in New Hampshire it's
 
02:51:58.389 --> 02:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
it's so Grassroots that we need a
 
02:52:00.309 --> 02:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
solution like this to at least make it
 
02:52:03.070 --> 02:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
equitably available um we rely on
 
02:52:05.469 --> 02:52:05.479 align:start position:0%
citizens entirely to access and question
 
02:52:07.190 --> 02:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
information as the only enforcement
 
02:52:09.710 --> 02:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
mechanism that we have for transparency
 
02:52:12.670 --> 02:52:12.680 align:start position:0%
and so um without that kind of support
 
02:52:14.190 --> 02:52:14.200 align:start position:0%
we're not surprised that public bodies
 
02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
are beginning to feel overburdened so we
 
02:52:18.150 --> 02:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
feel that this is a solution that will
 
02:52:21.150 --> 02:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
help to navigate those issues thank you
 
02:52:23.150 --> 02:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you questions for this witness
 
02:52:25.750 --> 02:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much next I'm
 
02:52:38.030 --> 02:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:41.030 --> 02:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
Cohen hello my name is Sarah Buren I
 
02:52:42.990 --> 02:52:43.000 align:start position:0%
represent the new New Hampshire
 
02:52:45.469 --> 02:52:45.479 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association as you may guess
 
02:52:47.269 --> 02:52:47.279 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Municipal Association
 
02:52:50.870 --> 02:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
support uh this legislation creation of
 
02:52:53.150 --> 02:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
a publicly accessible website for the
 
02:52:56.469 --> 02:52:56.479 align:start position:0%
retention of public and R I'm sorry for
 
02:52:58.710 --> 02:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
the retention and public access to
 
02:53:01.269 --> 02:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
electronics records would immensely um
 
02:53:03.630 --> 02:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
help be helpful for municipalities as it
 
02:53:07.070 --> 02:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
would allow request under RSA 91a to be
 
02:53:09.070 --> 02:53:09.080 align:start position:0%
processed more effectively and
 
02:53:12.150 --> 02:53:12.160 align:start position:0%
efficiently um as an individual could be
 
02:53:14.990 --> 02:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
pointed to the publicly ACC accessible
 
02:53:18.670 --> 02:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
website to retrieve requested records um
 
02:53:20.830 --> 02:53:20.840 align:start position:0%
we continue to strongly to support the
 
02:53:22.469 --> 02:53:22.479 align:start position:0%
local uh the hiring of a local
 
02:53:24.309 --> 02:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
government ma records manager to help
 
02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
guide municipalities um with their
 
02:53:30.070 --> 02:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
record retention policies um which um
 
02:53:32.910 --> 02:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
and so again um we uh support this uh
 
02:53:35.070 --> 02:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
legislation and urge you to do the same
 
02:53:38.190 --> 02:53:38.200 align:start position:0%

03:07:30.990 --> 03:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
open the uh reopen the hearings on the
 
03:07:32.830 --> 03:07:32.840 align:start position:0%
uh from the Judiciary
 
03:07:37.469 --> 03:07:37.479 align:start position:0%
Committee and we're now on to um HB
 
03:07:39.710 --> 03:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
265 and I'm going to recognize
 
03:07:43.150 --> 03:07:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:45.550 --> 03:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
kab thank you chairman Lynn and members
 
03:07:46.790 --> 03:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is
 
03:07:49.830 --> 03:07:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative Caitlyn cab I'm here to
 
03:07:54.750 --> 03:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 265 for the prime sponsor
 
03:07:56.110 --> 03:07:56.120 align:start position:0%
who couldn't be here right now I'm a
 
03:07:57.990 --> 03:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill so this bill
 
03:07:59.349 --> 03:07:59.359 align:start position:0%
simply just
 
03:08:02.469 --> 03:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
requires that minutes now contain the
 
03:08:04.070 --> 03:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
start time and the end time of the
 
03:08:06.349 --> 03:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
meeting and the name and the signature
 
03:08:08.790 --> 03:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
of the person who wrote the minutes and
 
03:08:10.429 --> 03:08:10.439 align:start position:0%
the reason behind the bill is there's
 
03:08:12.510 --> 03:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
been some instances
 
03:08:14.910 --> 03:08:14.920 align:start position:0%
where we would have meeting minutes and
 
03:08:17.550 --> 03:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
somebody would be referring to them and
 
03:08:19.710 --> 03:08:19.720 align:start position:0%
would be argued well we don't know if
 
03:08:21.389 --> 03:08:21.399 align:start position:0%
this is an official copy of the minutes
 
03:08:23.990 --> 03:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
or or anybody could have taken it this
 
03:08:25.309 --> 03:08:25.319 align:start position:0%
we don't know if it's an official record
 
03:08:28.269 --> 03:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
or not because some bodies do
 
03:08:31.229 --> 03:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
not vote on accepting their minutes or
 
03:08:33.269 --> 03:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
not and so it's become problematic in
 
03:08:35.469 --> 03:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
those scenarios happy to take any
 
03:08:38.469 --> 03:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
questions all right questions for this
 
03:08:41.469 --> 03:08:41.479 align:start position:0%
witness saying none thank you very much
 
03:08:44.630 --> 03:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative uh next I'm going to call
 
03:08:48.190 --> 03:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
on um
 
03:08:56.030 --> 03:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:58.830 --> 03:08:58.840 align:start position:0%
please Lori ortolano um representing
 
03:09:00.710 --> 03:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
right to know New Hampshire this is a
 
03:09:03.510 --> 03:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation we wrote and it's
 
03:09:05.469 --> 03:09:05.479 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward and simple and
 
03:09:07.710 --> 03:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative katab for
 
03:09:10.229 --> 03:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
for assisting us
 
03:09:13.590 --> 03:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
um the issue we found and what I found
 
03:09:15.990 --> 03:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
in nashwa is if I went into court with
 
03:09:18.550 --> 03:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
um minutes which I assumed to be
 
03:09:20.269 --> 03:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
certified records under Rules of
 
03:09:22.389 --> 03:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
Evidence the city was challenging those
 
03:09:24.269 --> 03:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
minutes because they had not been
 
03:09:29.630 --> 03:09:29.640 align:start position:0%
attested to um and and and then you know
 
03:09:32.150 --> 03:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
I didn't bring in witnesses to speak to
 
03:09:35.190 --> 03:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
those records so putting putting in a
 
03:09:37.150 --> 03:09:37.160 align:start position:0%
start and end time and putting in a
 
03:09:39.590 --> 03:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
signature of those records will go a
 
03:09:42.910 --> 03:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
long way to make them certified evidence
 
03:09:44.870 --> 03:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
for the judges to use in court and not
 
03:09:46.990 --> 03:09:47.000 align:start position:0%
get us um weighed down in trying to
 
03:09:51.269 --> 03:09:51.279 align:start position:0%
bring in city employees to testify to
 
03:09:54.790 --> 03:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
them and in one instance I had minutes
 
03:09:57.150 --> 03:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
that I thought were done by a board that
 
03:10:01.110 --> 03:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
had a recording um secretary that when I
 
03:10:03.070 --> 03:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
got into my trial there was no Discovery
 
03:10:05.150 --> 03:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
permitted through a series of questions
 
03:10:07.389 --> 03:10:07.399 align:start position:0%
it turned out the city was acting as the
 
03:10:09.950 --> 03:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
recording secretary and not even the
 
03:10:13.389 --> 03:10:13.399 align:start position:0%
board itself so it it would have made it
 
03:10:15.830 --> 03:10:15.840 align:start position:0%
very complex for me to even bring the
 
03:10:17.510 --> 03:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
right people in to figure out who had
 
03:10:19.389 --> 03:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
done the record the start and end time
 
03:10:22.190 --> 03:10:22.200 align:start position:0%
is really important I think in our city
 
03:10:24.550 --> 03:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
we have of course our Board of alderman
 
03:10:26.469 --> 03:10:26.479 align:start position:0%
which is our main board we have standing
 
03:10:28.309 --> 03:10:28.319 align:start position:0%
Boards of the board of alderman which is
 
03:10:30.750 --> 03:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
10 eight or 10 boards and those meetings
 
03:10:33.630 --> 03:10:33.640 align:start position:0%
are all televised so you can easily
 
03:10:35.550 --> 03:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
watch a meeting and look at YouTube and
 
03:10:37.110 --> 03:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
you you can see when it starts and when
 
03:10:39.229 --> 03:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
it ends and how long it is but there are
 
03:10:42.269 --> 03:10:42.279 align:start position:0%
approximately 30 other Committees of um
 
03:10:44.469 --> 03:10:44.479 align:start position:0%
appointed largely with volunteers and
 
03:10:47.750 --> 03:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
some liaison board members that are not
 
03:10:50.389 --> 03:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
televised and they are some of them are
 
03:10:53.070 --> 03:10:53.080 align:start position:0%
running pretty lengthy meetings and
 
03:10:54.950 --> 03:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
you're getting minutes that can be all
 
03:10:58.429 --> 03:10:58.439 align:start position:0%
of two sentences it it would be nice I
 
03:11:01.349 --> 03:11:01.359 align:start position:0%
started wondering uh especially um
 
03:11:02.990 --> 03:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
committees that are dealing with tens of
 
03:11:04.550 --> 03:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars of money and the
 
03:11:05.950 --> 03:11:05.960 align:start position:0%
records are coming out with just a
 
03:11:08.870 --> 03:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
couple sentences they seemed too brief
 
03:11:10.389 --> 03:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
but then again I don't have anything to
 
03:11:13.110 --> 03:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
go on to say uh you know how long did
 
03:11:15.870 --> 03:11:15.880 align:start position:0%
they meet if it's a 5-minute meeting for
 
03:11:18.349 --> 03:11:18.359 align:start position:0%
whatever reason then okay maybe two
 
03:11:20.750 --> 03:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
sentences is fine but if they met for an
 
03:11:23.030 --> 03:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
hour or even 30 minutes and the meeting
 
03:11:25.429 --> 03:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
and the notes are that short it's a good
 
03:11:27.830 --> 03:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
indication for citizens to go to those
 
03:11:30.190 --> 03:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
meetings and listen and be aware of
 
03:11:32.429 --> 03:11:32.439 align:start position:0%
what's going on and follow up so I think
 
03:11:34.030 --> 03:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
the start and end time would be very
 
03:11:36.229 --> 03:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
beneficial we also had a have a member
 
03:11:37.630 --> 03:11:37.640 align:start position:0%
of right to know New Hampshire who lives
 
03:11:39.830 --> 03:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
in the North Country some of the smaller
 
03:11:42.630 --> 03:11:42.640 align:start position:0%
towns are more laxed in posting their
 
03:11:44.590 --> 03:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
notices for meetings that are going to
 
03:11:46.870 --> 03:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
start at 7:00 but they start at like 10
 
03:11:47.870 --> 03:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
of 7
 
03:11:49.750 --> 03:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
they start 10 minutes early and so the
 
03:11:50.990 --> 03:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
public comes in and they've already
 
03:11:52.990 --> 03:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
voted on the first two agenda items and
 
03:11:56.030 --> 03:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
they're just rolling so by actually
 
03:11:58.830 --> 03:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
writing down the start time you will try
 
03:12:02.349 --> 03:12:02.359 align:start position:0%
to get them to align with their notices
 
03:12:04.190 --> 03:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
and the requirements of the law and I
 
03:12:05.990 --> 03:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
think it's a pretty simple thing change
 
03:12:07.190 --> 03:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
and I think it would be hugely
 
03:12:09.389 --> 03:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
beneficial so I would love to see your
 
03:12:11.309 --> 03:12:11.319 align:start position:0%
support thank you very much great
 
03:12:12.910 --> 03:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness yes
 
03:12:14.710 --> 03:12:14.720 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you thanks
 
03:12:16.950 --> 03:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
for my question um I live in London
 
03:12:19.710 --> 03:12:19.720 align:start position:0%
there and last year we had a yes there's
 
03:12:23.229 --> 03:12:23.239 align:start position:0%
a question we had a citizens petitioned
 
03:12:26.309 --> 03:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
to have all meetings recorded and yes it
 
03:12:28.870 --> 03:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
was just advisory but it did put
 
03:12:32.389 --> 03:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
pressure on them so they don't have to
 
03:12:34.229 --> 03:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
but I don't think we have any that are
 
03:12:36.469 --> 03:12:36.479 align:start position:0%
not recording literally we have someone
 
03:12:39.750 --> 03:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
going in with a um their iPhone and
 
03:12:42.710 --> 03:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
recording them doing being done have you
 
03:12:44.750 --> 03:12:44.760 align:start position:0%
thought about doing something to that
 
03:12:46.630 --> 03:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
have done it have asked I mean we have
 
03:12:48.670 --> 03:12:48.680 align:start position:0%
good tele capabilities and we have the
 
03:12:51.269 --> 03:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
chambers opened but some of these boards
 
03:12:54.150 --> 03:12:54.160 align:start position:0%
I think don't want to be televised they
 
03:12:56.429 --> 03:12:56.439 align:start position:0%
put in something that would make it the
 
03:12:58.910 --> 03:12:58.920 align:start position:0%
citizens decided that it had oh you're
 
03:13:00.830 --> 03:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
in a city sorry I'm in a city so we'd
 
03:13:02.830 --> 03:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
have to do it via petition it's a lot of
 
03:13:05.550 --> 03:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
hauling for 10% of a population but
 
03:13:07.630 --> 03:13:07.640 align:start position:0%
we've asked the board to do it there's
 
03:13:10.110 --> 03:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
been resistance um we could they could
 
03:13:11.870 --> 03:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
be doing a lot more to televised but
 
03:13:15.590 --> 03:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
they're pushing back on that so um so
 
03:13:17.389 --> 03:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
the next best thing is getting us start
 
03:13:19.950 --> 03:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
an end time and an attested record that
 
03:13:21.670 --> 03:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
we know who we can go to should we have
 
03:13:23.990 --> 03:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
a question on the record thank you all
 
03:13:25.990 --> 03:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
right other questions for this witness
 
03:13:28.070 --> 03:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
yes representative beron thank you so
 
03:13:29.710 --> 03:13:29.720 align:start position:0%
thank you chair I just wanted to make a
 
03:13:31.710 --> 03:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
comment that on another board that I'm
 
03:13:35.710 --> 03:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
on we um we
 
03:13:38.510 --> 03:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
definitely televise everything and we
 
03:13:40.190 --> 03:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
have quite an audience I'm really
 
03:13:42.590 --> 03:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
shocked by that so yeah so if you have a
 
03:13:44.910 --> 03:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
good system that'll should work well for
 
03:13:47.229 --> 03:13:47.239 align:start position:0%
you yeah oh I'd love to see it used more
 
03:13:48.870 --> 03:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
and the television station has offered
 
03:13:50.990 --> 03:13:51.000 align:start position:0%
to televise more and to have people
 
03:13:53.150 --> 03:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
there to televise but these boards are
 
03:13:55.150 --> 03:13:55.160 align:start position:0%
sticking in these little side rooms that
 
03:13:57.269 --> 03:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
aren't hooked up and that's where
 
03:14:01.150 --> 03:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
they're comfortable so yeah it's it's
 
03:14:04.110 --> 03:14:04.120 align:start position:0%
just a little bit of a fight that's all
 
03:14:05.670 --> 03:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
03:14:08.309 --> 03:14:08.319 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
03:14:11.269 --> 03:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
thank you um I don't have any other pink
 
03:14:15.750 --> 03:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
cards on HB 265 is there anyone else who
 
03:14:18.389 --> 03:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
wishes to be heard on HB
 
03:14:21.030 --> 03:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
265 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
03:14:22.550 --> 03:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
hearing on HP
 
03:14:25.309 --> 03:14:25.319 align:start position:0%
265 and again we are fairly lucky we
 
03:14:27.309 --> 03:14:27.319 align:start position:0%
have about 12 minutes before we start
 
03:14:29.990 --> 03:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
our next hearing so so we'll take a
 
03:14:31.870 --> 03:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
we'll take a brief recess again if you
 
03:14:35.429 --> 03:14:35.439 align:start position:0%
want to you know slipped a little bit of
 
03:14:37.469 --> 03:14:37.479 align:start position:0%
food or whatever that's this is the time
 
03:14:38.630 --> 03:14:38.640 align:start position:0%
to do it
 
03:14:41.630 --> 03:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
thanks where do you get coffee in this
 
03:14:46.030 --> 03:14:46.040 align:start position:0%

03:31:44.830 --> 03:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:44.840 --> 03:32:14.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:32:14.830 --> 03:32:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:14.840 --> 03:32:44.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

03:32:44.830 --> 03:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:22.950 --> 03:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:26.990 --> 03:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
it's uh now Beyond 130 so I'm going to

recognize the prime sponsor
 
03:33:58.429 --> 03:33:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:00.830 --> 03:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone I hope you had a
 
03:34:02.510 --> 03:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
quick lunch like I
 
03:34:05.710 --> 03:34:05.720 align:start position:0%
did uh okay I'm introducing House Bill
 
03:34:09.389 --> 03:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
114 and I know there's a lot of
 
03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
controversy over it the reason I
 
03:34:13.189 --> 03:34:13.199 align:start position:0%
submitted this
 
03:34:16.870 --> 03:34:16.880 align:start position:0%
bill is because I represent the
 
03:34:20.790 --> 03:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
citizens and the citizens when this bill
 
03:34:20.800 --> 03:34:22.110 align:start position:0%
citizens and the citizens when this bill
became

03:34:22.110 --> 03:34:22.120 align:start position:0%
became
 
03:34:25.550 --> 03:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
law many may not realize it they were
 
03:34:29.710 --> 03:34:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:33.550 --> 03:34:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:39.590 --> 03:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:43.590 --> 03:34:43.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I realize his problems
 
03:34:46.309 --> 03:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
with right to know when what we need to
 
03:34:48.710 --> 03:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
do and what we don't need to
 
03:34:51.429 --> 03:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
do personally I think we need to keep
 
03:34:56.590 --> 03:34:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:00.309 --> 03:35:00.319 align:start position:0%
possible unless absolutely necessary I
 
03:35:03.750 --> 03:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:07.630 --> 03:35:07.640 align:start position:0%
fees there are people that can afford
 
03:35:10.830 --> 03:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
fees when they ask for
 
03:35:13.070 --> 03:35:13.080 align:start position:0%
ex much
 
03:35:15.229 --> 03:35:15.239 align:start position:0%
information but then there's ordinary
 
03:35:15.239 --> 03:35:16.750 align:start position:0%
information but then there's ordinary
citizen

03:35:16.750 --> 03:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
citizen
 
03:35:20.030 --> 03:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
s that can't afford
 
03:35:25.030 --> 03:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
fees therefore they cannot ask for the
 
03:35:28.870 --> 03:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
information and the question I keep
 
03:35:28.880 --> 03:35:31.910 align:start position:0%
information and the question I keep
asking

03:35:31.910 --> 03:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:34.349 --> 03:35:34.359 align:start position:0%
myself and I'm
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
not trying to say anybody's guilty of
 
03:35:43.229 --> 03:35:43.239 align:start position:0%
anything but some of the places
 
03:35:46.510 --> 03:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities Etc
 
03:35:49.630 --> 03:35:49.640 align:start position:0%
that were saying they got too many
 
03:35:52.590 --> 03:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
requests they got too many big requests
 
03:35:57.670 --> 03:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
etc etc my question is were they guilty
 
03:36:01.189 --> 03:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
of anything and if a person cannot
 
03:36:05.710 --> 03:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
obtain the information that is
 
03:36:08.750 --> 03:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
theirs nobody will ever
 
03:36:12.910 --> 03:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
know and I firmly
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
believe there is a balance
 
03:36:19.630 --> 03:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
but the citizens have a right to know
 
03:36:23.710 --> 03:36:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:26.630 --> 03:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
government and the
 
03:36:29.590 --> 03:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
employees of all public
 
03:36:32.630 --> 03:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
entities work for the citizens and it's
 
03:36:35.389 --> 03:36:35.399 align:start position:0%
not the other way around so I'm just
 
03:36:37.429 --> 03:36:37.439 align:start position:0%
going to give you an example of
 
03:36:37.439 --> 03:36:41.150 align:start position:0%
going to give you an example of
excessive

03:36:41.150 --> 03:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:43.150 --> 03:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
information back in
 
03:36:46.510 --> 03:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
2015 that I had
 
03:36:48.469 --> 03:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
an individual came to
 
03:36:52.870 --> 03:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
me and said that our school
 
03:36:56.990 --> 03:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
district was going into nonpublic And
 
03:37:00.150 --> 03:37:00.160 align:start position:0%
discussing things and then come back out
 
03:37:03.389 --> 03:37:03.399 align:start position:0%
and vote on things etc
 
03:37:07.830 --> 03:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
etc me being me I started
 
03:37:10.830 --> 03:37:10.840 align:start position:0%
investigating I bet in the
 
03:37:15.070 --> 03:37:15.080 align:start position:0%
end I obtained and read between 10 and
 
03:37:20.389 --> 03:37:20.399 align:start position:0%
1550 year uh years of minutes of
 
03:37:23.229 --> 03:37:23.239 align:start position:0%
meetings now if I had had to pay for
 
03:37:27.309 --> 03:37:27.319 align:start position:0%
them I mean that's 150 200 Pages if I
 
03:37:30.830 --> 03:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
had had to purchase
 
03:37:35.910 --> 03:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
those I would never have been able to
 
03:37:38.710 --> 03:37:38.720 align:start position:0%
find out the truth of the matter and the
 
03:37:41.349 --> 03:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
truth of the matter was over a period of
 
03:37:44.189 --> 03:37:44.199 align:start position:0%
years our school board was going into
 
03:37:44.199 --> 03:37:46.550 align:start position:0%
years our school board was going into
non-public

03:37:46.550 --> 03:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
non-public
 
03:37:48.349 --> 03:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
and they were discussing things that
 
03:37:49.790 --> 03:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have been and then they'd
 
03:37:51.870 --> 03:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
come out and vote on
 
03:37:56.070 --> 03:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
them so then this other individual and
 
03:38:01.070 --> 03:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
I as Pro says once we got all our
 
03:38:01.080 --> 03:38:02.790 align:start position:0%
I as Pro says once we got all our
information

03:38:02.790 --> 03:38:02.800 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:38:06.110 --> 03:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
took the school district to
 
03:38:08.070 --> 03:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
court for
 
03:38:11.469 --> 03:38:11.479 align:start position:0%
violation of right to know and
 
03:38:15.030 --> 03:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
having gone into nonpublic and discussed
 
03:38:18.189 --> 03:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
things that shouldn't have we went as
 
03:38:21.630 --> 03:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
prosay which is I have respect anybody
 
03:38:23.750 --> 03:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
that goes in the court for prosay
 
03:38:25.349 --> 03:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
because we had no idea what we were
 
03:38:28.349 --> 03:38:28.359 align:start position:0%
doing but we won the
 
03:38:33.469 --> 03:38:33.479 align:start position:0%
case now if I had had to go again and
 
03:38:36.030 --> 03:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
pay for that
 
03:38:40.510 --> 03:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
information we would never have stopped
 
03:38:42.469 --> 03:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
the school board from discussing things
 
03:38:44.150 --> 03:38:44.160 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have and I mean one of
 
03:38:46.550 --> 03:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
the things they did if there was a
 
03:38:50.070 --> 03:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
vacancy for Schoolboard member they
 
03:38:51.550 --> 03:38:51.560 align:start position:0%
would go into
 
03:38:55.750 --> 03:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
nonpublic and discuss all the candidates
 
03:38:57.510 --> 03:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
and then they'd come out and vote on
 
03:38:59.990 --> 03:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
them and that's a no
 
03:39:04.070 --> 03:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
no and more recently I know that under
 
03:39:07.070 --> 03:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
the current law policies need to be set
 
03:39:09.630 --> 03:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
up and they haven't been so everybody's
 
03:39:12.189 --> 03:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
kind of doing what they have normally
 
03:39:14.830 --> 03:39:14.840 align:start position:0%
been doing and recently in my school
 
03:39:14.840 --> 03:39:16.189 align:start position:0%
been doing and recently in my school
district

03:39:16.189 --> 03:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
district
 
03:39:19.630 --> 03:39:19.640 align:start position:0%
again we ran into problems so I've been
 
03:39:23.630 --> 03:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
asking instead of asking for a whole big
 
03:39:26.469 --> 03:39:26.479 align:start position:0%
bunch of information I ask one question
 
03:39:30.710 --> 03:39:30.720 align:start position:0%
to a time so that I they won't charge me
 
03:39:32.429 --> 03:39:32.439 align:start position:0%
and what I found in the
 
03:39:35.150 --> 03:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
end was that we had a business
 
03:39:37.630 --> 03:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
administrator that resigned but it was
 
03:39:40.309 --> 03:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
never recorded in any minutes
 
03:39:42.910 --> 03:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere we had a school district we
 
03:39:45.630 --> 03:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
have a school district
 
03:39:48.269 --> 03:39:48.279 align:start position:0%
which I don't know what's going to
 
03:39:52.510 --> 03:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
happen we got too close to knowing the
 
03:39:54.630 --> 03:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
truth of what was going on in our school
 
03:39:56.950 --> 03:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
district when they suddenly came out
 
03:40:00.030 --> 03:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
with a paper and posted it that we had a
 
03:40:01.830 --> 03:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
deficit of a million dollars in our
 
03:40:04.510 --> 03:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
school district at the end of June
 
03:40:07.590 --> 03:40:07.600 align:start position:0%
2024 so I'm going to go back to the same
 
03:40:11.269 --> 03:40:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:14.950 --> 03:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
believe no fees should be charged and I
 
03:40:17.110 --> 03:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
know people disagree with me and that's
 
03:40:21.269 --> 03:40:21.279 align:start position:0%
okay but I stand for the citizens
 
03:40:24.309 --> 03:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
and I would like to see the current law
 
03:40:26.910 --> 03:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
repealed thank you all right questions
 
03:40:30.030 --> 03:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
for this witness representative
 
03:40:33.710 --> 03:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:40:33.720 --> 03:40:37.870 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr chair and thank you
representative

03:40:37.870 --> 03:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:42.670 --> 03:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
um when you speak of speaking for the
 
03:40:45.630 --> 03:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
citizens I want to ask you about about
 
03:40:47.429 --> 03:40:47.439 align:start position:0%
the citizen
 
03:40:50.229 --> 03:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers because none of this is
 
03:40:55.830 --> 03:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
free so do you have any sense of how
 
03:40:58.030 --> 03:40:58.040 align:start position:0%
much additional
 
03:41:02.510 --> 03:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
taxes the taxpayers will pay if the
 
03:41:05.670 --> 03:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
users don't contribute anything towards
 
03:41:12.269 --> 03:41:12.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:16.150 --> 03:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
no right other representative for
 
03:41:18.070 --> 03:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
03:41:20.070 --> 03:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
would you be
 
03:41:24.110 --> 03:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
um would you consider an amendment that
 
03:41:24.120 --> 03:41:25.950 align:start position:0%
um would you consider an amendment that
said

03:41:25.950 --> 03:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
said
 
03:41:30.429 --> 03:41:30.439 align:start position:0%
that citizens of a town or business in
 
03:41:34.269 --> 03:41:34.279 align:start position:0%
in a particular town did not have to pay
 
03:41:39.389 --> 03:41:39.399 align:start position:0%
fees but entities outside of the town
 
03:41:41.870 --> 03:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
would have to pay fees now I know the I
 
03:41:44.750 --> 03:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
know the the thing is well then you know
 
03:41:46.550 --> 03:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
they'll just get someone in town to
 
03:41:49.269 --> 03:41:49.279 align:start position:0%
submit it well we can't be police a lot
 
03:41:53.309 --> 03:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
of that happens but would you consider
 
03:41:57.229 --> 03:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
that if we made it for your town and any
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
business owner in your town there were
 
03:42:02.830 --> 03:42:02.840 align:start position:0%
no fees for
 
03:42:05.590 --> 03:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
them yeah that would be something to
 
03:42:08.670 --> 03:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
consider because many
 
03:42:12.750 --> 03:42:12.760 align:start position:0%
times when people request
 
03:42:16.110 --> 03:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
information it is within their town most
 
03:42:19.550 --> 03:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
people don't go to another town and ask
 
03:42:23.269 --> 03:42:23.279 align:start position:0%
for information and I yeah I I I think
 
03:42:25.269 --> 03:42:25.279 align:start position:0%
it's something if we could come up with
 
03:42:28.349 --> 03:42:28.359 align:start position:0%
the right amendment that within your own
 
03:42:32.429 --> 03:42:32.439 align:start position:0%
town citizens and businesses wouldn't
 
03:42:34.950 --> 03:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
have to pay but anybody outside of that
 
03:42:36.670 --> 03:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
they asked for information yes they
 
03:42:38.189 --> 03:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
would have to
 
03:42:41.110 --> 03:42:41.120 align:start position:0%
pay other questions for this
 
03:42:43.429 --> 03:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
03:42:45.550 --> 03:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
represent thank you next I'm going to
 
03:42:47.590 --> 03:42:47.600 align:start position:0%
call on representative col please
 
03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
representative col looking at col I'm
 
03:43:03.030 --> 03:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:05.710 --> 03:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman for the
 
03:43:08.429 --> 03:43:08.439 align:start position:0%
record I'm ré kulam from Hillsboro
 
03:43:12.189 --> 03:43:12.199 align:start position:0%
District 30 um I would like to speak in
 
03:43:15.550 --> 03:43:15.560 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill uh but I would like
 
03:43:18.189 --> 03:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
to also suggest maybe considering a
 
03:43:20.510 --> 03:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
couple of amendments such as the one
 
03:43:23.630 --> 03:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
that um representative Perez
 
03:43:26.110 --> 03:43:26.120 align:start position:0%
suggested except for there's a little
 
03:43:29.269 --> 03:43:29.279 align:start position:0%
bit of a conflict with just being the
 
03:43:31.550 --> 03:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
resident of the town because as a
 
03:43:33.910 --> 03:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative I actually represent four
 
03:43:35.630 --> 03:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
towns and there are times that I'm
 
03:43:38.149 --> 03:43:38.159 align:start position:0%
asking for information from one of the
 
03:43:41.950 --> 03:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
four towns uh so I have concerns over
 
03:43:43.149 --> 03:43:43.159 align:start position:0%
the fact that just because I don't live
 
03:43:45.229 --> 03:43:45.239 align:start position:0%
in a town you know and I'm asking for
 
03:43:46.590 --> 03:43:46.600 align:start position:0%
information I'm going to now have to
 
03:43:48.910 --> 03:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
maybe pay um for information from that
 
03:43:52.149 --> 03:43:52.159 align:start position:0%
town so um maybe if we're a New
 
03:43:54.510 --> 03:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Citizen and we pay taxes in
 
03:43:57.750 --> 03:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as most of US citizens do
 
03:43:59.910 --> 03:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
um that we could be open to this one of
 
03:44:01.830 --> 03:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
the problems I do see and I think is a
 
03:44:04.309 --> 03:44:04.319 align:start position:0%
legitimate problem um in talking with
 
03:44:06.990 --> 03:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
our police chief is that you know the
 
03:44:08.630 --> 03:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
the police department in my town got
 
03:44:10.910 --> 03:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
hammered with right to no requests and
 
03:44:12.630 --> 03:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
he does not do anything through email
 
03:44:14.510 --> 03:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
everything is paper requests uh he
 
03:44:16.590 --> 03:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
fulfills only with paper so he does
 
03:44:19.110 --> 03:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
incur an awful lot of money for that and
 
03:44:20.750 --> 03:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
what happens is often people will send
 
03:44:22.750 --> 03:44:22.760 align:start position:0%
in the request they occupy their time
 
03:44:24.670 --> 03:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
and they never come and pick them up so
 
03:44:26.429 --> 03:44:26.439 align:start position:0%
I do understand that there is a real
 
03:44:28.790 --> 03:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
problem to this however we have a
 
03:44:31.950 --> 03:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
problem on the other side as well um I
 
03:44:34.550 --> 03:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
actually identified an issue with a new
 
03:44:37.229 --> 03:44:37.239 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse that was put up in our town
 
03:44:38.870 --> 03:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
the greenhouse actually never had an
 
03:44:41.349 --> 03:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
inspection the final inspection the unit
 
03:44:43.429 --> 03:44:43.439 align:start position:0%
heater on it was actually installed
 
03:44:46.309 --> 03:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
incorrectly um so there were many issues
 
03:44:48.149 --> 03:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
I then started to ask for some right to
 
03:44:49.990 --> 03:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
know information while I was addressing
 
03:44:52.070 --> 03:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
the problem with them as far as this
 
03:44:54.429 --> 03:44:54.439 align:start position:0%
unit is not installed properly and what
 
03:44:56.070 --> 03:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
I noticed on their right to know sheet
 
03:44:57.670 --> 03:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
is that they calculated that it took
 
03:45:00.149 --> 03:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
them 14 hours of time to address my
 
03:45:01.990 --> 03:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
right to know request which is
 
03:45:03.790 --> 03:45:03.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely absurd for the information
 
03:45:06.429 --> 03:45:06.439 align:start position:0%
that I was asking and what I found out
 
03:45:08.269 --> 03:45:08.279 align:start position:0%
um was that the superintendent was
 
03:45:09.990 --> 03:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
holding meetings within the school
 
03:45:11.670 --> 03:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
district with the person who asked for
 
03:45:13.189 --> 03:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
the greenhouse with the facility
 
03:45:15.070 --> 03:45:15.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance team and they were trying to
 
03:45:16.950 --> 03:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
solve the problem about how did this
 
03:45:19.110 --> 03:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
unit heater get turned on it was a
 
03:45:20.429 --> 03:45:20.439 align:start position:0%
propane unit heater how did it get
 
03:45:22.550 --> 03:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
turned on without a g somebody with a
 
03:45:25.030 --> 03:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
gas license or somebody knowing that
 
03:45:27.710 --> 03:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
there was not a propane retrofit into it
 
03:45:30.469 --> 03:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
so anyways there's abuse at our school
 
03:45:32.750 --> 03:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
district and that she put 14 hours of
 
03:45:34.429 --> 03:45:34.439 align:start position:0%
time was needed to fulfill my right to
 
03:45:36.750 --> 03:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
no request which was false information
 
03:45:40.110 --> 03:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
so if we allow them to just build up
 
03:45:42.550 --> 03:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
that time and charge us for time then we
 
03:45:44.110 --> 03:45:44.120 align:start position:0%
have a problem because now I've got to
 
03:45:45.469 --> 03:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
try and fight it
 
03:45:46.950 --> 03:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
which I did try and they still didn't
 
03:45:49.149 --> 03:45:49.159 align:start position:0%
make an adjustment but we also had the
 
03:45:50.590 --> 03:45:50.600 align:start position:0%
problem on the other side with our
 
03:45:53.349 --> 03:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
police chief legitimately getting
 
03:45:56.550 --> 03:45:56.560 align:start position:0%
requests that are taking up time so
 
03:45:58.830 --> 03:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
where's the balance between the two and
 
03:46:00.750 --> 03:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
how can we make that work without
 
03:46:03.149 --> 03:46:03.159 align:start position:0%
charging us taxpayers more money to ask
 
03:46:04.790 --> 03:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
for the information that we have a right
 
03:46:07.550 --> 03:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
to know because our tax dollars are
 
03:46:10.389 --> 03:46:10.399 align:start position:0%
actually funding these things so I don't
 
03:46:12.309 --> 03:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
know what the right answer is as far as
 
03:46:14.269 --> 03:46:14.279 align:start position:0%
the the amendment I like the idea my
 
03:46:16.229 --> 03:46:16.239 align:start position:0%
thought well I was listening was that
 
03:46:18.030 --> 03:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
maybe we allow the New Hampshire
 
03:46:19.950 --> 03:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
residents to request right to know
 
03:46:22.349 --> 03:46:22.359 align:start position:0%
information for free and we try to
 
03:46:23.910 --> 03:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
encourage them to send as much as they
 
03:46:25.630 --> 03:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
can electronically and that it doesn't
 
03:46:28.389 --> 03:46:28.399 align:start position:0%
have to be done on paper um or you know
 
03:46:30.149 --> 03:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
we go in and we make our own copies with
 
03:46:31.870 --> 03:46:31.880 align:start position:0%
our phones I mean most everybody has an
 
03:46:33.950 --> 03:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
electronic device where we can scan
 
03:46:35.790 --> 03:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
documents now which is often what I do
 
03:46:38.110 --> 03:46:38.120 align:start position:0%
when I go to another town and they don't
 
03:46:40.630 --> 03:46:40.640 align:start position:0%
email me stuff I just go in and I scan
 
03:46:42.429 --> 03:46:42.439 align:start position:0%
it on my phone and then I print my own
 
03:46:46.389 --> 03:46:46.399 align:start position:0%
PDF when I get home so um I like the
 
03:46:48.910 --> 03:46:48.920 align:start position:0%
idea of not charging us fees don't like
 
03:46:50.550 --> 03:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
the idea of our police departments and
 
03:46:52.870 --> 03:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
other areas getting um you know
 
03:46:55.189 --> 03:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
unreasonable requests and asking for a
 
03:46:57.429 --> 03:46:57.439 align:start position:0%
lot of information and I don't like the
 
03:47:01.790 --> 03:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
idea of other departments inflating the
 
03:47:03.990 --> 03:47:04.000 align:start position:0%
the number that they need so that they
 
03:47:06.990 --> 03:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
can meet the requirements in our law
 
03:47:08.590 --> 03:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
that will allow them to
 
03:47:11.269 --> 03:47:11.279 align:start position:0%
charge all right thank you questions for
 
03:47:13.349 --> 03:47:13.359 align:start position:0%
this witness yes representative
 
03:47:15.550 --> 03:47:15.560 align:start position:0%
kop thank you chairman lynon thank you
 
03:47:18.429 --> 03:47:18.439 align:start position:0%
for taking my question rep c I wanted to
 
03:47:21.309 --> 03:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
ask are you aware that in current law
 
03:47:24.149 --> 03:47:24.159 align:start position:0%
that there is no charge for an amount of
 
03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
time and in fact what the current law
 
03:47:28.990 --> 03:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
has is that if you're requesting more
 
03:47:33.070 --> 03:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
than 250 Communications meaning emails
 
03:47:35.630 --> 03:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
that you could be charged up to $1 per
 
03:47:37.750 --> 03:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
communication and that's not per page
 
03:47:40.349 --> 03:47:40.359 align:start position:0%
that's per communication um anything
 
03:47:41.830 --> 03:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's under one subject is all
 
03:47:43.790 --> 03:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
considered one communication as well as
 
03:47:46.590 --> 03:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
any attachments so that it it is a
 
03:47:48.670 --> 03:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
static price for the number of records
 
03:47:48.680 --> 03:47:49.550 align:start position:0%
static price for the number of records
and

03:47:49.550 --> 03:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:47:53.349 --> 03:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
not by number of hours thank you for the
 
03:47:56.189 --> 03:47:56.199 align:start position:0%
question yes I'm aware uh I'm aware that
 
03:47:57.950 --> 03:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
we had made this change in the bill that
 
03:48:01.030 --> 03:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
was passed uh in the last session um
 
03:48:02.910 --> 03:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
however it concerns me that through the
 
03:48:04.510 --> 03:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
conversation and the amount of bills
 
03:48:06.309 --> 03:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
that we have coming up that there may be
 
03:48:08.389 --> 03:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
an attempt to try to go that direction
 
03:48:10.389 --> 03:48:10.399 align:start position:0%
again and I'm hoping that there isn't so
 
03:48:14.070 --> 03:48:14.080 align:start position:0%
I am aware of that um so thank you for
 
03:48:16.349 --> 03:48:16.359 align:start position:0%
the question
 
03:48:18.349 --> 03:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness
 
03:48:21.870 --> 03:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
representative Perez could we think
 
03:48:24.269 --> 03:48:24.279 align:start position:0%
about what are your thoughts on if we
 
03:48:28.990 --> 03:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
had it for um citizens but then because
 
03:48:33.189 --> 03:48:33.199 align:start position:0%
we're we're not uh we're not um we don't
 
03:48:36.990 --> 03:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
make money you know citizens but
 
03:48:41.910 --> 03:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
businesses had to um be charged because
 
03:48:44.149 --> 03:48:44.159 align:start position:0%
what happens like I know what happened
 
03:48:46.870 --> 03:48:46.880 align:start position:0%
in London when we had our town manager
 
03:48:48.830 --> 03:48:48.840 align:start position:0%
running actually for Senate a few years
 
03:48:52.389 --> 03:48:52.399 align:start position:0%
ago we had newspapers and places from
 
03:48:55.349 --> 03:48:55.359 align:start position:0%
all over the United States res
 
03:48:58.790 --> 03:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
requesting everything about him so maybe
 
03:49:00.990 --> 03:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
if we could make it so citizens weren't
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
charged but P but companies or
 
03:49:06.870 --> 03:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
businesses that were you know for profit
 
03:49:09.550 --> 03:49:09.560 align:start position:0%
as were not for profit would be charged
 
03:49:11.830 --> 03:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
would that cover what you're trying to
 
03:49:14.269 --> 03:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
cover as far as you know going from town
 
03:49:15.750 --> 03:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
to town
 
03:49:17.309 --> 03:49:17.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question that sounds
 
03:49:20.030 --> 03:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
like that could be a reasonable um
 
03:49:21.349 --> 03:49:21.359 align:start position:0%
solution as
 
03:49:24.349 --> 03:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
well other questions for this witness
 
03:49:25.990 --> 03:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
03:49:28.030 --> 03:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
you next I'm going to call on Katherine
 
03:49:28.040 --> 03:49:41.149 align:start position:0%
you next I'm going to call on Katherine
coko

03:49:41.149 --> 03:49:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:46.110 --> 03:49:46.120 align:start position:0%
please hello again hi um
 
03:49:47.550 --> 03:49:47.560 align:start position:0%
right to know New Hampshire struggled
 
03:49:51.790 --> 03:49:51.800 align:start position:0%
with this bill we spent a lot of time
 
03:49:54.349 --> 03:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
last year negotiating
 
03:49:57.510 --> 03:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
hb12 and we felt that we came up with an
 
03:50:00.990 --> 03:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
effective compromise that took number of
 
03:50:05.070 --> 03:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
hours out of the equation and focused on
 
03:50:07.910 --> 03:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
what we were being told were the most
 
03:50:10.349 --> 03:50:10.359 align:start position:0%
burdensome types of requests which were
 
03:50:12.349 --> 03:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
having to go through electronic
 
03:50:14.269 --> 03:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
communications and having to perform
 
03:50:14.279 --> 03:50:16.070 align:start position:0%
communications and having to perform
Reda

03:50:16.070 --> 03:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
Reda
 
03:50:19.149 --> 03:50:19.159 align:start position:0%
having this language that is now in
 
03:50:25.510 --> 03:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:27.790 --> 03:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
negotiation right to know New Hampshire
 
03:50:30.030 --> 03:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
opposes HB
 
03:50:32.990 --> 03:50:33.000 align:start position:0%
114 we think that strategically it can
 
03:50:36.309 --> 03:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
do more harm than good to go back and
 
03:50:39.710 --> 03:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
try to renegotiate um this
 
03:50:43.189 --> 03:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
scenario I we will say that generally
 
03:50:45.950 --> 03:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
what we have been hearing is that this
 
03:50:48.550 --> 03:50:48.560 align:start position:0%
rule is not being implemented in
 
03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities they are required to have
 
03:50:52.990 --> 03:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
a policy in place before they are
 
03:50:54.950 --> 03:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to charge anybody for records
 
03:50:56.670 --> 03:50:56.680 align:start position:0%
and we are aware of only a handful of
 
03:50:59.149 --> 03:50:59.159 align:start position:0%
communities who have actually done that
 
03:51:01.550 --> 03:51:01.560 align:start position:0%
we also feel that by addressing this
 
03:51:04.750 --> 03:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
major concern of public bodies we are
 
03:51:07.630 --> 03:51:07.640 align:start position:0%
removing barriers to making progress on
 
03:51:10.429 --> 03:51:10.439 align:start position:0%
other issues such as getting more timely
 
03:51:13.309 --> 03:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
responses communities now have no excuse
 
03:51:15.030 --> 03:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
to come back to us and say well the
 
03:51:17.110 --> 03:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
request might be too long take too be
 
03:51:18.349 --> 03:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
too hard and we have to have our
 
03:51:19.990 --> 03:51:20.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys go through them we've removed
 
03:51:22.590 --> 03:51:22.600 align:start position:0%
liability they can have it automatically
 
03:51:24.910 --> 03:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
reacted we feel like we've made
 
03:51:26.510 --> 03:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
significant concessions in the interest
 
03:51:28.269 --> 03:51:28.279 align:start position:0%
of moving right to know forward in other
 
03:51:31.070 --> 03:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
ways um and we expect that we'll be able
 
03:51:32.870 --> 03:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
to do that moving forward if this stays
 
03:51:35.590 --> 03:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
in statute that was not an easy decision
 
03:51:37.469 --> 03:51:37.479 align:start position:0%
for our group to come to I want to make
 
03:51:38.830 --> 03:51:38.840 align:start position:0%
that clear to this
 
03:51:41.309 --> 03:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
committee questions representative
 
03:51:43.149 --> 03:51:43.159 align:start position:0%
questions representative Perez thank you
 
03:51:44.710 --> 03:51:44.720 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my questions are you
 
03:51:47.670 --> 03:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
aware that what towns are doing now as
 
03:51:49.670 --> 03:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
they did to representative they're
 
03:51:52.710 --> 03:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
saying how many hours it took them and
 
03:51:55.550 --> 03:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
they're equating the hours that it took
 
03:51:57.870 --> 03:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
them to how much it's
 
03:52:02.670 --> 03:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
costing cost the the um citizens which
 
03:52:07.269 --> 03:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
really I mean it is it really inflates a
 
03:52:09.870 --> 03:52:09.880 align:start position:0%
lot and it I don't think that's imp
 
03:52:11.990 --> 03:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
passing at what people would have to pay
 
03:52:15.189 --> 03:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
I mean My Town put says oh this
 
03:52:17.830 --> 03:52:17.840 align:start position:0%
took so many hours and it seems to
 
03:52:19.590 --> 03:52:19.600 align:start position:0%
appear and whether they want to do it or
 
03:52:21.469 --> 03:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
they don't want to do it I can't prove
 
03:52:23.870 --> 03:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
that but sometimes it appears that way
 
03:52:27.070 --> 03:52:27.080 align:start position:0%
so to the citizens it makes it look like
 
03:52:29.229 --> 03:52:29.239 align:start position:0%
this is outrageous
 
03:52:33.070 --> 03:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
so I I I I am aware of that and I
 
03:52:34.510 --> 03:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question because it
 
03:52:36.389 --> 03:52:36.399 align:start position:0%
gives me the opportunity to point out
 
03:52:39.269 --> 03:52:39.279 align:start position:0%
that nowhere in statute is there a
 
03:52:41.550 --> 03:52:41.560 align:start position:0%
limitation on that number of hours it's
 
03:52:43.590 --> 03:52:43.600 align:start position:0%
very common for communities to come back
 
03:52:45.349 --> 03:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
and say we've spent x amount of time
 
03:52:47.110 --> 03:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
addressing this issue they do account
 
03:52:48.750 --> 03:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
for that in those ways and the City of
 
03:52:50.990 --> 03:52:51.000 align:start position:0%
NASA has made claims about the expenses
 
03:52:52.670 --> 03:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
associated with their requests which are
 
03:52:55.469 --> 03:52:55.479 align:start position:0%
fairly outrageous but that does not come
 
03:52:58.189 --> 03:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
back that's a PR issue it does not come
 
03:52:59.990 --> 03:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
back to the individual who's making the
 
03:53:01.750 --> 03:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
requests they are not being charged on
 
03:53:01.760 --> 03:53:02.790 align:start position:0%
requests they are not being charged on
that

03:53:02.790 --> 03:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:53:05.389 --> 03:53:05.399 align:start position:0%
basis right other questions for this
 
03:53:08.309 --> 03:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you thank you
 
03:53:11.590 --> 03:53:11.600 align:start position:0%

up thank you everybody my name is Al

brandano and I'm from Kensington New
 
03:53:29.550 --> 03:53:29.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I speak in in favor of
 
03:53:33.030 --> 03:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
this bill um I have three specific
 
03:53:35.429 --> 03:53:35.439 align:start position:0%
points one is first to talk about the
 
03:53:38.229 --> 03:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
memorandum that the Attorney General
 
03:53:42.149 --> 03:53:42.159 align:start position:0%
produced on 91a in March 24th 2024 this
 
03:53:44.469 --> 03:53:44.479 align:start position:0%
year A lot of people are not aware of it
 
03:53:47.469 --> 03:53:47.479 align:start position:0%
it's the first rewrite in 15 years and
 
03:53:51.830 --> 03:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
it's a very inclusive 254 Pages or so
 
03:53:53.429 --> 03:53:53.439 align:start position:0%
the second thing I'd like to bring up
 
03:53:56.110 --> 03:53:56.120 align:start position:0%
quickly is I should I feel like
 
03:53:57.990 --> 03:53:58.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes when it's 91a I should be on
 
03:54:01.309 --> 03:54:01.319 align:start position:0%
the Milk Carton uh for this because uh
 
03:54:03.149 --> 03:54:03.159 align:start position:0%
of my experience I want to just briefly
 
03:54:06.149 --> 03:54:06.159 align:start position:0%
tell you what's happened to me and three
 
03:54:10.389 --> 03:54:10.399 align:start position:0%
why I'm I'm I'm supporting this bill uh
 
03:54:12.149 --> 03:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
first uh New Hampshire attorney general
 
03:54:14.750 --> 03:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
March 24th was the first time in years
 
03:54:16.229 --> 03:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
of someone addressed
 
03:54:18.510 --> 03:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
91a uh the introduction New Hampshire
 
03:54:20.110 --> 03:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
Constitution provides the public the
 
03:54:22.070 --> 03:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
right to access government records
 
03:54:23.750 --> 03:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
proceedings and Records shall not be
 
03:54:26.870 --> 03:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
reason unreasonably restricted uh part
 
03:54:29.790 --> 03:54:29.800 align:start position:0%
one and uh part 8 and 38 of the New
 
03:54:31.990 --> 03:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution the basic
 
03:54:34.189 --> 03:54:34.199 align:start position:0%
philosophy is underlining the statutory
 
03:54:37.149 --> 03:54:37.159 align:start position:0%
process is simple openness in the
 
03:54:39.630 --> 03:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
conduct of public business is essential
 
03:54:41.830 --> 03:54:41.840 align:start position:0%
to a Democratic Society
 
03:54:44.710 --> 03:54:44.720 align:start position:0%
91a the New Hampshire Supreme Court has
 
03:54:46.750 --> 03:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
made clear that we'll resolve questions
 
03:54:48.950 --> 03:54:48.960 align:start position:0%
regarding the right to no law with a
 
03:54:51.790 --> 03:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
view to providing the utmost information
 
03:54:54.990 --> 03:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
in order to be both best effective and
 
03:54:59.349 --> 03:54:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:01.750 --> 03:55:01.760 align:start position:0%
objective the second part is I'd like to
 
03:55:04.429 --> 03:55:04.439 align:start position:0%
share with you a brief experience uh of
 
03:55:06.830 --> 03:55:06.840 align:start position:0%
the 91a process before I get to the
 
03:55:08.149 --> 03:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
other part
 
03:55:10.790 --> 03:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
um it's what what an individual can
 
03:55:12.830 --> 03:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
expect in New Hampshire uh I was
 
03:55:15.309 --> 03:55:15.319 align:start position:0%
involved in in 2020 2 and a case that
 
03:55:16.510 --> 03:55:16.520 align:start position:0%
went all the way to the New Hampshire
 
03:55:18.309 --> 03:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court on
 
03:55:21.750 --> 03:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
91a uh it it almost bankrupt my family
 
03:55:23.349 --> 03:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
uh it was a bad decision we believed
 
03:55:25.510 --> 03:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
that a lower court level had to appeal
 
03:55:28.950 --> 03:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
and went all the way and it was horrible
 
03:55:32.710 --> 03:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
horrible um the second part of it was um
 
03:55:34.710 --> 03:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
I had the the pleasure and I say the
 
03:55:37.229 --> 03:55:37.239 align:start position:0%
pleasure of of working with ob budsman
 
03:55:40.950 --> 03:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh Kur and and that next process having
 
03:55:43.070 --> 03:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
uh going through the first process
 
03:55:45.550 --> 03:55:45.560 align:start position:0%
legally uh there was another legal
 
03:55:47.269 --> 03:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
process that you provided which through
 
03:55:50.710 --> 03:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
the OB budsman process um the first one
 
03:55:53.309 --> 03:55:53.319 align:start position:0%
was um it's really kind of a misnomer
 
03:55:55.590 --> 03:55:55.600 align:start position:0%
when you say AB budsman because it's not
 
03:55:57.269 --> 03:55:57.279 align:start position:0%
the traditional thing he's an
 
03:55:59.750 --> 03:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
administrative law judge so when an
 
03:56:01.630 --> 03:56:01.640 align:start position:0%
individual like me goes there any
 
03:56:03.670 --> 03:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
individual any citizen you have to
 
03:56:06.750 --> 03:56:06.760 align:start position:0%
really almost have a law degree there is
 
03:56:10.149 --> 03:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
um uh there is a full it can be a trial
 
03:56:12.950 --> 03:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh you know Witnesses a statement of
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
facts all kinds of things that people
 
03:56:16.870 --> 03:56:16.880 align:start position:0%
regular people would not be aware of nor
 
03:56:20.070 --> 03:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
was I um I had two sessions two
 
03:56:22.830 --> 03:56:22.840 align:start position:0%
different issues uh there were both one
 
03:56:26.590 --> 03:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
was resolved and one was really uh we
 
03:56:28.670 --> 03:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
were able to work through that allowed
 
03:56:33.830 --> 03:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
for um there was hb1 154 and that that
 
03:56:37.269 --> 03:56:37.279 align:start position:0%
was an uh a bill that had 22 election
 
03:56:40.389 --> 03:56:40.399 align:start position:0%
law Pro uh issues brought up in it but
 
03:56:42.429 --> 03:56:42.439 align:start position:0%
the the chairman of that committee used
 
03:56:45.429 --> 03:56:45.439 align:start position:0%
this private email and that's the really
 
03:56:47.229 --> 03:56:47.239 align:start position:0%
the problem for that is that when
 
03:56:49.030 --> 03:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
someone uses their private email for
 
03:56:50.910 --> 03:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
public business when they leave they
 
03:56:53.429 --> 03:56:53.439 align:start position:0%
take those records with them so with the
 
03:56:55.189 --> 03:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
help of the onsman we were able to
 
03:56:57.309 --> 03:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
negotiate a settlement with the house
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
and allow all House Representatives now
 
03:57:01.630 --> 03:57:01.640 align:start position:0%
to use their government email rather
 
03:57:05.830 --> 03:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
than private email um and so what brings
 
03:57:08.510 --> 03:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
me to the end here is why I
 
03:57:10.830 --> 03:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
support uh
 
03:57:14.790 --> 03:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
hb14 you recently passed hb11
 
03:57:14.800 --> 03:57:15.469 align:start position:0%
hb14 you recently passed hb11
uh

03:57:15.469 --> 03:57:15.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:57:18.990 --> 03:57:19.000 align:start position:0%
102 to me it was a pay toplay uh you
 
03:57:21.070 --> 03:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
have further placed an unfair and unjust
 
03:57:23.870 --> 03:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
tax burden on the citizens that in
 
03:57:26.349 --> 03:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
essence these burdens is simply
 
03:57:29.070 --> 03:57:29.080 align:start position:0%
exercising their constitutional duties
 
03:57:32.389 --> 03:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
to hold exact oversight part one article
 
03:57:35.309 --> 03:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
38 is very clear it says exact for
 
03:57:37.670 --> 03:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
reason I don't think a lot of people
 
03:57:40.870 --> 03:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
understand that word uh there the term
 
03:57:43.030 --> 03:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
reasonable as defined by the Attorney
 
03:57:46.630 --> 03:57:46.640 align:start position:0%
General in March 202 4 clearly speaks of
 
03:57:48.950 --> 03:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
restrictions but yet it has no standing
 
03:57:51.870 --> 03:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
and contrary in 1784 is the Constitution
 
03:57:54.830 --> 03:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
is never been amended uh so we we're
 
03:57:57.309 --> 03:57:57.319 align:start position:0%
making laws that conflict with the
 
03:57:58.950 --> 03:57:58.960 align:start position:0%
constitution in my
 
03:58:02.870 --> 03:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
opinion um and our inali rights give us
 
03:58:04.870 --> 03:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
this right it's not a tax right it's not
 
03:58:06.469 --> 03:58:06.479 align:start position:0%
something that I I believe that we have
 
03:58:09.070 --> 03:58:09.080 align:start position:0%
to be taxed for or I have to adjudicate
 
03:58:11.590 --> 03:58:11.600 align:start position:0%
in some way or pay something that's part
 
03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
of our inable rights these are ours not
 
03:58:15.309 --> 03:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
to be taken
 
03:58:19.309 --> 03:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
away uh and last therefore uh this body
 
03:58:22.830 --> 03:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
must find and pass legislation actions
 
03:58:24.670 --> 03:58:24.680 align:start position:0%
that are unjust of the violation in the
 
03:58:27.469 --> 03:58:27.479 align:start position:0%
spirit intent of the Constitution and I
 
03:58:32.149 --> 03:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
think overturning uh hb12 at this point
 
03:58:35.189 --> 03:58:35.199 align:start position:0%
with this bill is um is the right thing
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
to do I'm open for any questions
 
03:58:39.830 --> 03:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
03:58:42.309 --> 03:58:42.319 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
03:58:47.030 --> 03:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
sir next I'm going to call on Alvin C
 
03:58:49.790 --> 03:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
please I'm sorry representative
 
03:58:54.429 --> 03:58:54.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:56.710 --> 03:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
that thank you Mr chairman and members
 
03:58:59.349 --> 03:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee um I'm representative
 
03:59:02.990 --> 03:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
Alvin C from Lowden and I serve lden and
 
03:59:04.269 --> 03:59:04.279 align:start position:0%
seven other
 
03:59:04.279 --> 03:59:06.110 align:start position:0%
seven other
towns

03:59:06.110 --> 03:59:06.120 align:start position:0%
towns
 
03:59:08.750 --> 03:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
I feel that the right to know for
 
03:59:11.429 --> 03:59:11.439 align:start position:0%
citizens should be uh shouldn't be hit
 
03:59:13.870 --> 03:59:13.880 align:start position:0%
with fees or taxes or whatever anybody
 
03:59:16.429 --> 03:59:16.439 align:start position:0%
might want to call them uh even if
 
03:59:18.590 --> 03:59:18.600 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
03:59:22.950 --> 03:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh a uh a minimum of free request before
 
03:59:27.630 --> 03:59:27.640 align:start position:0%
the fees hit in because sometimes it it
 
03:59:30.830 --> 03:59:30.840 align:start position:0%
takes numerous requests to dig down to
 
03:59:33.070 --> 03:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
find out the information that you're
 
03:59:34.710 --> 03:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
looking for and you've already heard
 
03:59:38.269 --> 03:59:38.279 align:start position:0%
people testify to that
 
03:59:43.389 --> 03:59:43.399 align:start position:0%
um so you know it gives a situ u a
 
03:59:47.229 --> 03:59:47.239 align:start position:0%
situation where the town or city itself
 
03:59:51.110 --> 03:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
can Stonewall and you know drag things
 
03:59:53.510 --> 03:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
out so you have to request more and more
 
03:59:55.309 --> 03:59:55.319 align:start position:0%
things just because you're not getting
 
03:59:57.910 --> 03:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
everything at once to the point where
 
04:00:00.229 --> 04:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
you're hitting the minimum you've hit
 
04:00:01.750 --> 04:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
the minimum and now you're getting build
 
04:00:01.760 --> 04:00:02.550 align:start position:0%
the minimum and now you're getting build
for

04:00:02.550 --> 04:00:02.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:00:02.560 --> 04:00:04.149 align:start position:0%
for
things

04:00:04.149 --> 04:00:04.159 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:00:08.790 --> 04:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
um and that is something that can um
 
04:00:12.550 --> 04:00:12.560 align:start position:0%
inhibit some people's ability to use the
 
04:00:15.630 --> 04:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
right to know uh to understand what
 
04:00:18.710 --> 04:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
their government is doing for them or to
 
04:00:24.070 --> 04:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
them uh while there have been uh abuses
 
04:00:26.790 --> 04:00:26.800 align:start position:0%
discussed it may be that the thing to do
 
04:00:29.309 --> 04:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
is to carefully analyze what the abuses
 
04:00:32.269 --> 04:00:32.279 align:start position:0%
are and take some sort of action to deal
 
04:00:37.510 --> 04:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
with those specific types of issues um
 
04:00:42.149 --> 04:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
maybe also uh you might be able to
 
04:00:44.590 --> 04:00:44.600 align:start position:0%
consider uh charging
 
04:00:48.110 --> 04:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
for out ofate research firms or law
 
04:00:50.750 --> 04:00:50.760 align:start position:0%
firms when they're doing a uh working on
 
04:00:52.870 --> 04:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
a case or something like that because
 
04:00:56.110 --> 04:00:56.120 align:start position:0%
that is something that would be uh
 
04:00:58.269 --> 04:00:58.279 align:start position:0%
buildable to their
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
client those are sort of things that I
 
04:01:04.429 --> 04:01:04.439 align:start position:0%
think might be useful there um and I've
 
04:01:07.189 --> 04:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
heard reports of people requesting lots
 
04:01:08.870 --> 04:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
of stuff and then not picking up the
 
04:01:11.309 --> 04:01:11.319 align:start position:0%
information that is something that
 
04:01:14.469 --> 04:01:14.479 align:start position:0%
should be addressed as to why that
 
04:01:16.790 --> 04:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
happened and I don't think there I don't
 
04:01:18.469 --> 04:01:18.479 align:start position:0%
know what kind of penalty there should
 
04:01:21.429 --> 04:01:21.439 align:start position:0%
be especially if it's just a
 
04:01:23.790 --> 04:01:23.800 align:start position:0%
citizen uh also one of the other things
 
04:01:26.990 --> 04:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
that I heard uh a couple people
 
04:01:31.189 --> 04:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
mention uh of just being able to
 
04:01:33.349 --> 04:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
research stuff in your particular town
 
04:01:33.359 --> 04:01:34.110 align:start position:0%
research stuff in your particular town
or

04:01:34.110 --> 04:01:34.120 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:01:37.550 --> 04:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
city um especially for Representatives
 
04:01:39.750 --> 04:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
who represent several towns I represent
 
04:01:44.229 --> 04:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
eight towns um but also there's several
 
04:01:46.149 --> 04:01:46.159 align:start position:0%
different school districts in the
 
04:01:49.349 --> 04:01:49.359 align:start position:0%
various towns that uh I represent so
 
04:01:51.870 --> 04:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
there's almost as many school districts
 
04:01:55.429 --> 04:01:55.439 align:start position:0%
in my town as there are town schools so
 
04:01:57.990 --> 04:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's just one of those things to to
 
04:02:03.149 --> 04:02:03.159 align:start position:0%
watch out for for U um if if you were to
 
04:02:06.229 --> 04:02:06.239 align:start position:0%
narrow it down to uh a person can only
 
04:02:08.950 --> 04:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
get something from their own town uh for
 
04:02:12.510 --> 04:02:12.520 align:start position:0%
me my school district the district
 
04:02:14.429 --> 04:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
headquarters is not in my
 
04:02:17.590 --> 04:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
town so that would be a
 
04:02:20.910 --> 04:02:20.920 align:start position:0%
different uh thing to look at uh with
 
04:02:22.670 --> 04:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
that I'll conclude and I'll take any
 
04:02:24.510 --> 04:02:24.520 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any questions for
 
04:02:24.520 --> 04:02:25.630 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any questions for
this

04:02:25.630 --> 04:02:25.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:02:27.990 --> 04:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
04:02:45.990 --> 04:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:47.910 --> 04:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Sarah Burke
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
Cohen I represent the New Hampshire
 
04:02:53.590 --> 04:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association NH HMA opposes
 
04:02:57.389 --> 04:02:57.399 align:start position:0%
hb14 um as you're aware hb14 eliminates
 
04:02:59.429 --> 04:02:59.439 align:start position:0%
the ability of both for both
 
04:03:01.750 --> 04:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the state to recoup
 
04:03:05.149 --> 04:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
cost associated with voluminous record
 
04:03:07.389 --> 04:03:07.399 align:start position:0%
requests the the bill asked public
 
04:03:09.630 --> 04:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
bodies many with limited staff to use
 
04:03:11.630 --> 04:03:11.640 align:start position:0%
precious resources compiling redacting
 
04:03:13.469 --> 04:03:13.479 align:start position:0%
scanning or copying documents to fill a
 
04:03:13.479 --> 04:03:14.349 align:start position:0%
scanning or copying documents to fill a
request

04:03:14.349 --> 04:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
request
 
04:03:17.710 --> 04:03:17.720 align:start position:0%
that can take hours or days uh due to
 
04:03:19.670 --> 04:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
the sheer volume of the request it
 
04:03:21.469 --> 04:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
further tells that limited staff it
 
04:03:23.790 --> 04:03:23.800 align:start position:0%
cannot attempt to negotiate a
 
04:03:25.870 --> 04:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
modification with the request to help
 
04:03:28.750 --> 04:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
narrow the request and finally it tells
 
04:03:30.670 --> 04:03:30.680 align:start position:0%
that staff that if they forget to redact
 
04:03:33.110 --> 04:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
something in the thousands of pages just
 
04:03:35.710 --> 04:03:35.720 align:start position:0%
produced that they that the town or city
 
04:03:37.630 --> 04:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
could be liable for that
 
04:03:40.790 --> 04:03:40.800 align:start position:0%
mistake which of course will likely let
 
04:03:47.070 --> 04:03:47.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:51.750 --> 04:03:51.760 align:start position:0%
instead the C the cost of fulfilling oh
 
04:03:54.269 --> 04:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
sorry the fee schedule in place prevents
 
04:03:56.229 --> 04:03:56.239 align:start position:0%
this from occurring and instead allows
 
04:03:58.309 --> 04:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
the public body to recoup some of the
 
04:04:00.710 --> 04:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
cost of responding without the fee
 
04:04:03.790 --> 04:04:03.800 align:start position:0%
schedule imagine being a small town um
 
04:04:05.750 --> 04:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
in which the staff made up of one or two
 
04:04:08.469 --> 04:04:08.479 align:start position:0%
people has to fulfill the voluminous
 
04:04:10.870 --> 04:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
record request what gets
 
04:04:13.710 --> 04:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
sacrificed um does the staff get paid
 
04:04:15.349 --> 04:04:15.359 align:start position:0%
over time to allow for the response to
 
04:04:17.950 --> 04:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
be completed and their other duties to
 
04:04:20.309 --> 04:04:20.319 align:start position:0%
be completed probably not because there
 
04:04:22.149 --> 04:04:22.159 align:start position:0%
may not be funding so what does get
 
04:04:24.349 --> 04:04:24.359 align:start position:0%
sacrificed and after taking the time to
 
04:04:26.429 --> 04:04:26.439 align:start position:0%
ensure every document has been redacted
 
04:04:28.830 --> 04:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
but missing something then what a
 
04:04:31.030 --> 04:04:31.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuit which means something else gets
 
04:04:33.389 --> 04:04:33.399 align:start position:0%
sacrificed because of a simple error
 
04:04:34.990 --> 04:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps the fee schedule currently in
 
04:04:37.349 --> 04:04:37.359 align:start position:0%
place isn't perfect but eliminating
 
04:04:39.590 --> 04:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
eliminating it before municipalities
 
04:04:44.429 --> 04:04:44.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:46.510 --> 04:04:46.520 align:start position:0%
to adopt and utilize it will require
 
04:04:48.309 --> 04:04:48.319 align:start position:0%
towns to sacrifice their resources to
 
04:04:50.670 --> 04:04:50.680 align:start position:0%
cover the cost of voluminous requests
 
04:04:52.630 --> 04:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
made by a requestor who may not even be
 
04:04:55.269 --> 04:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
a resident of that town who instead is
 
04:04:56.990 --> 04:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
angry with goals to punish and with no
 
04:04:59.349 --> 04:04:59.359 align:start position:0%
way to recoup the cost it will serve its
 
04:05:01.990 --> 04:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
purpose and truly punish a municipality
 
04:05:04.670 --> 04:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
the intent intent of RSA 91a is to allow
 
04:05:07.510 --> 04:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
for transpar transparency not an allow
 
04:05:10.070 --> 04:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
an individual to punish the public
 
04:05:13.110 --> 04:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
body I'll I'm open to questions and
 
04:05:15.950 --> 04:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:18.510 --> 04:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
witness do you have a do you have any do
 
04:05:20.030 --> 04:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
you have written statement I just have
 
04:05:22.149 --> 04:05:22.159 align:start position:0%
my notes okay no no that's fine okay all
 
04:05:23.910 --> 04:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
right seeing none thank you very much
 
04:05:25.910 --> 04:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um next I'm going to call on
 
04:05:28.830 --> 04:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
Lori orano who indicates that she
 
04:05:31.630 --> 04:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
supports and opposes the bill so I we'll
 
04:05:33.030 --> 04:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
be we'll be interested to hear what you
 
04:05:38.110 --> 04:05:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:42.510 --> 04:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
say Lori orano NASA okay so I'm wearing
 
04:05:45.469 --> 04:05:45.479 align:start position:0%
my right to know New Hampshire hat as um
 
04:05:47.590 --> 04:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
Catherine explained to you we had a
 
04:05:50.349 --> 04:05:50.359 align:start position:0%
difficult time coming to uh agreement on
 
04:05:52.550 --> 04:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
what to do with this bill uh we didn't
 
04:05:55.469 --> 04:05:55.479 align:start position:0%
want to jeopardize seeing the situation
 
04:05:57.229 --> 04:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
or create a situation where it could get
 
04:05:59.389 --> 04:05:59.399 align:start position:0%
worse we knew when this went forward to
 
04:06:01.429 --> 04:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
the Senate last year some of the
 
04:06:04.469 --> 04:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
Judiciary Senators felt very strongly
 
04:06:06.910 --> 04:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
about this language and even pushing
 
04:06:10.229 --> 04:06:10.239 align:start position:0%
more into it so we were concerned going
 
04:06:14.030 --> 04:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
forward to the um um you know the next
 
04:06:15.950 --> 04:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
branch that we would encounter
 
04:06:19.030 --> 04:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
difficulties trying to push this change
 
04:06:21.110 --> 04:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
um we want to make Katherine just handed
 
04:06:22.950 --> 04:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
me a little piece of paper we wanted to
 
04:06:25.710 --> 04:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
make it clear that the $250 cost covers
 
04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
a 30-day time frame so if you're trying
 
04:06:31.830 --> 04:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
to not pay the fees you can just at you
 
04:06:33.950 --> 04:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
know draw it out over a longer period of
 
04:06:37.189 --> 04:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
time so you're not charged and also um
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
the group as a whole would not support
 
04:06:41.510 --> 04:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
trying to distinguish between who's
 
04:06:44.229 --> 04:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
eligible and not eligible to avoid fees
 
04:06:46.189 --> 04:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
and the only reason is because it was
 
04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
something that was negotiated when hb12
 
04:06:52.950 --> 04:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
was handled last year and um it's being
 
04:06:56.189 --> 04:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
addressed in 66 and 74 we kind of feel
 
04:06:59.630 --> 04:06:59.640 align:start position:0%
HP so now if I speak to you as a
 
04:07:03.429 --> 04:07:03.439 align:start position:0%
citizen um as a citizen of nasua uh I
 
04:07:06.670 --> 04:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
like this bill um and because nashua's
 
04:07:10.149 --> 04:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
been so difficult uh NASA was a a force
 
04:07:13.070 --> 04:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
behind asking for these fees to be
 
04:07:13.080 --> 04:07:14.269 align:start position:0%
behind asking for these fees to be
imposed

04:07:14.269 --> 04:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
imposed
 
04:07:16.590 --> 04:07:16.600 align:start position:0%
uh they wrote letters and they had all
 
04:07:18.870 --> 04:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
27 Representatives take the position
 
04:07:21.269 --> 04:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
that uh a few people have cost us and
 
04:07:24.630 --> 04:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
won me uh the city upwards of a million
 
04:07:26.590 --> 04:07:26.600 align:start position:0%
dollars in processing the right to no
 
04:07:29.189 --> 04:07:29.199 align:start position:0%
requests and then last year and this
 
04:07:31.590 --> 04:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
legislation passed before it passed a
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
year prior I had asked the city to look
 
04:07:36.429 --> 04:07:36.439 align:start position:0%
into redaction software if they really
 
04:07:38.229 --> 04:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
felt that redactions were causing the
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
problems on emails consider doing that
 
04:07:42.990 --> 04:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
and they said we will we're going to
 
04:07:45.429 --> 04:07:45.439 align:start position:0%
research that and investigate and they
 
04:07:47.269 --> 04:07:47.279 align:start position:0%
proceeded not to do anything for 12
 
04:07:50.550 --> 04:07:50.560 align:start position:0%
months so at this year's um budget
 
04:07:52.229 --> 04:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
hearing in June where there's an open
 
04:07:54.870 --> 04:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
mic to ask questions I followed up and
 
04:07:57.149 --> 04:07:57.159 align:start position:0%
once again they have not moved forward
 
04:08:01.950 --> 04:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
on that so this legislation hb12 becomes
 
04:08:06.189 --> 04:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
um active becomes uh law and the City of
 
04:08:09.550 --> 04:08:09.560 align:start position:0%
NASA never wrote a policy to charge fees
 
04:08:11.990 --> 04:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
so there's no policy defined there's no
 
04:08:14.030 --> 04:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
redaction software and in fact they're
 
04:08:15.349 --> 04:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
not charging
 
04:08:19.630 --> 04:08:19.640 align:start position:0%
anything you know I feel like it was a
 
04:08:23.830 --> 04:08:23.840 align:start position:0%
lot of complaining for nothing and the
 
04:08:25.870 --> 04:08:25.880 align:start position:0%
concept that you pay a dollar per email
 
04:08:29.070 --> 04:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
above 250 disturbs me a lot because I
 
04:08:31.109 --> 04:08:31.119 align:start position:0%
just finished a request I want a supreme
 
04:08:33.990 --> 04:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
court order to get emails that were on
 
04:08:37.229 --> 04:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
this backup tape the city in uh October
 
04:08:38.990 --> 04:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
got the Mandate from the court and was
 
04:08:41.790 --> 04:08:41.800 align:start position:0%
supposed to start producing them well
 
04:08:44.790 --> 04:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
they downloaded them they told me there
 
04:08:47.630 --> 04:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
were 13300 emails and all of a sudden
 
04:08:49.070 --> 04:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
they started batching them out and the
 
04:08:51.710 --> 04:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
first batch was over 3,000 pages I I
 
04:08:53.550 --> 04:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
looked and there was an attachment that
 
04:08:56.309 --> 04:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
was 3,100 pages long that was a a
 
04:08:59.109 --> 04:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
database on the computer a public record
 
04:09:01.830 --> 04:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
so I said hey I don't want attachments
 
04:09:03.550 --> 04:09:03.560 align:start position:0%
don't even give them to me these emails
 
04:09:05.910 --> 04:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
are basic assessing emails they're very
 
04:09:08.229 --> 04:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
simple I know I'm not going to need the
 
04:09:10.389 --> 04:09:10.399 align:start position:0%
attachments a lot of it is all public
 
04:09:13.030 --> 04:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
record just don't bother reviewing those
 
04:09:14.710 --> 04:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
I don't want you to review and redact
 
04:09:16.630 --> 04:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
and they wrote back and said we have to
 
04:09:18.670 --> 04:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
review and redact them all you don't
 
04:09:21.030 --> 04:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
have an option this is the way we do it
 
04:09:24.109 --> 04:09:24.119 align:start position:0%
now now two years ago when I filed to
 
04:09:26.550 --> 04:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court the appeal had this
 
04:09:28.830 --> 04:09:28.840 align:start position:0%
order been filled the legal office did
 
04:09:30.790 --> 04:09:30.800 align:start position:0%
not do it that way they would give you
 
04:09:32.950 --> 04:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
emails if you said I don't want the
 
04:09:34.269 --> 04:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
attachments they wouldn't even bother
 
04:09:35.990 --> 04:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
looking at them they just get the order
 
04:09:38.229 --> 04:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
done but somewhere between two years
 
04:09:40.750 --> 04:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
they implemented a new unwritten policy
 
04:09:43.510 --> 04:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
not publicized only in the legal office
 
04:09:45.950 --> 04:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
other departments in NASA would not give
 
04:09:47.830 --> 04:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
you didn't have to give you attachments
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
but the legal office said you're getting
 
04:09:52.229 --> 04:09:52.239 align:start position:0%
every attachment it took eight months to
 
04:09:55.229 --> 04:09:55.239 align:start position:0%
finish the order there were over 7,000
 
04:09:58.030 --> 04:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
attachments I ended up with you know 80
 
04:10:02.030 --> 04:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
88,200 8300 records and it it just was
 
04:10:04.630 --> 04:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and most of those emails
 
04:10:07.030 --> 04:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
above the if you get charged a dollar a
 
04:10:09.830 --> 04:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
page there's simple emails like a single
 
04:10:12.510 --> 04:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
sentence can be three words five words
 
04:10:14.070 --> 04:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
10 words
 
04:10:16.389 --> 04:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
and that's femail so each one is
 
04:10:18.950 --> 04:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
distinct and I have to pay a dollar for
 
04:10:20.710 --> 04:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
every one of those that if you put them
 
04:10:22.630 --> 04:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
on one page a hundred of them would make
 
04:10:26.429 --> 04:10:26.439 align:start position:0%
one page of text it just seems absurd so
 
04:10:29.429 --> 04:10:29.439 align:start position:0%
the whole process in nasua is is really
 
04:10:31.429 --> 04:10:31.439 align:start position:0%
done to not be transparent and to be
 
04:10:34.070 --> 04:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
very destructive to Citizens and they
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
were the ones really pushing to get this
 
04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
legislation through and you know and
 
04:10:43.670 --> 04:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
have never used it so I yeah from my
 
04:10:45.630 --> 04:10:45.640 align:start position:0%
personal perspective I don't like the
 
04:10:48.910 --> 04:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
way it went and um I don't think
 
04:10:50.790 --> 04:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
citizens should be paying fees I think
 
04:10:53.109 --> 04:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
we got to we and I would work with my
 
04:10:55.830 --> 04:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
city anyway isn't that I don't pick them
 
04:10:58.229 --> 04:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
up or I'm not willing to work with them
 
04:10:59.830 --> 04:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
I would work with them anyway I could to
 
04:11:01.590 --> 04:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
reduce the burden but they will not
 
04:11:04.189 --> 04:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
permit it it is not permissible to do
 
04:11:06.790 --> 04:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
that that batch of emails I received my
 
04:11:09.349 --> 04:11:09.359 align:start position:0%
own personal abatement application at
 
04:11:11.590 --> 04:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
least 10 times in the records across 8
 
04:11:14.070 --> 04:11:14.080 align:start position:0%
months I didn't need my own 12-page
 
04:11:16.309 --> 04:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
application sent back to me and reviewed
 
04:11:16.319 --> 04:11:17.790 align:start position:0%
application sent back to me and reviewed
10

04:11:17.790 --> 04:11:17.800 align:start position:0%
10
 
04:11:21.070 --> 04:11:21.080 align:start position:0%
times and the way the email um costs are
 
04:11:23.429 --> 04:11:23.439 align:start position:0%
done threaded emails you're not charged
 
04:11:26.149 --> 04:11:26.159 align:start position:0%
for so if an email is sent and there's a
 
04:11:28.349 --> 04:11:28.359 align:start position:0%
response and it there's a record of six
 
04:11:30.349 --> 04:11:30.359 align:start position:0%
or seven emails that tied to one you're
 
04:11:32.429 --> 04:11:32.439 align:start position:0%
going to get charged for one email the
 
04:11:34.109 --> 04:11:34.119 align:start position:0%
problem in Nasha and I think in other
 
04:11:35.990 --> 04:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities is when they conduct
 
04:11:38.469 --> 04:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
email Ser searches these emails are
 
04:11:40.109 --> 04:11:40.119 align:start position:0%
coming up as single threads it's the
 
04:11:42.149 --> 04:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
same email but they're coming up over
 
04:11:44.750 --> 04:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
and over again what I see in my batches
 
04:11:46.910 --> 04:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
from NASA is I'll get the same email 10
 
04:11:49.830 --> 04:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
times spread out out over eight months
 
04:11:52.710 --> 04:11:52.720 align:start position:0%
or or 15 times I have to be paid I have
 
04:11:54.229 --> 04:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
to pay for each one of those because
 
04:11:56.670 --> 04:11:56.680 align:start position:0%
it's not on a Common Thread same record
 
04:11:58.590 --> 04:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
over and over and over again and there's
 
04:12:00.429 --> 04:12:00.439 align:start position:0%
no way to work to to to reduce the
 
04:12:02.149 --> 04:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
burden on that they're not willing to
 
04:12:05.710 --> 04:12:05.720 align:start position:0%
work with us so it's a painful piece of
 
04:12:08.469 --> 04:12:08.479 align:start position:0%
legislation I haven't been charged I
 
04:12:10.349 --> 04:12:10.359 align:start position:0%
mean if they had produced those records
 
04:12:12.389 --> 04:12:12.399 align:start position:0%
quickly for the supreme court order I
 
04:12:14.790 --> 04:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
could have paid upward of $900 I think
 
04:12:17.109 --> 04:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
that's a lot then it would have bothered
 
04:12:18.910 --> 04:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
me to pay that amount of
 
04:12:22.030 --> 04:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
money thank you questions for this
 
04:12:23.990 --> 04:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
witness so I you know I just want to
 
04:12:27.510 --> 04:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
make sure I'm understanding the am I
 
04:12:29.870 --> 04:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
correct I think I think I am but you
 
04:12:32.590 --> 04:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
tell me if if you think I'm not that in
 
04:12:37.670 --> 04:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
order for even for the charge of above
 
04:12:40.510 --> 04:12:40.520 align:start position:0%
250 uh email
 
04:12:42.990 --> 04:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
Communications the municipality can't do
 
04:12:45.429 --> 04:12:45.439 align:start position:0%
that unless they've adopted a policy
 
04:12:47.309 --> 04:12:47.319 align:start position:0%
correct and you're saying nasua has not
 
04:12:49.750 --> 04:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
adopted a policy no policy in NASA so n
 
04:12:54.070 --> 04:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
so I mean to the extent you're saying
 
04:12:56.670 --> 04:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
and excuse my using the colloquial but
 
04:12:59.149 --> 04:12:59.159 align:start position:0%
to the extent you're saying Nashua is
 
04:13:01.630 --> 04:13:01.640 align:start position:0%
kind of out to get people that want to
 
04:13:05.910 --> 04:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
want to uh file right to no requests by
 
04:13:08.670 --> 04:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
charging the money Nash was not doing
 
04:13:11.389 --> 04:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
that so I I guess I'm I'm a little
 
04:13:14.109 --> 04:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
confused what you you know if if na if
 
04:13:17.149 --> 04:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
we're to think that Nasha is this like
 
04:13:20.149 --> 04:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
evil entity why aren't they doing what
 
04:13:22.189 --> 04:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
they could be doing well that's a really
 
04:13:24.510 --> 04:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
good question why would they disparage
 
04:13:26.590 --> 04:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
citizens at the microphone in public
 
04:13:30.710 --> 04:13:30.720 align:start position:0%
meetings for years years rip us apart
 
04:13:33.030 --> 04:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
and then turn and write to all the
 
04:13:36.590 --> 04:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
legislators all of the SI the 27 um
 
04:13:39.309 --> 04:13:39.319 align:start position:0%
people supporting nasua to get up behind
 
04:13:41.550 --> 04:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
this bill and send information to the
 
04:13:43.510 --> 04:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
state saying we need this because our
 
04:13:45.510 --> 04:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
citizens are killing us and then do
 
04:13:48.790 --> 04:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
nothing and still complain that is an
 
04:13:51.630 --> 04:13:51.640 align:start position:0%
evil government that's an evil
 
04:13:54.229 --> 04:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
government okay what is with
 
04:13:57.070 --> 04:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
that what what is with that why do our
 
04:13:59.710 --> 04:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
reputations not matter and they could
 
04:14:01.830 --> 04:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
implement it at any time I don't know
 
04:14:04.510 --> 04:14:04.520 align:start position:0%
what they're doing honestly I don't
 
04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
understand what they're doing supposedly
 
04:14:08.349 --> 04:14:08.359 align:start position:0%
they're reviewing redaction software
 
04:14:10.389 --> 04:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
they did two companies there's a third
 
04:14:13.349 --> 04:14:13.359 align:start position:0%
one there's no update it's taken two
 
04:14:17.229 --> 04:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
years how hard is it to pick a software
 
04:14:20.389 --> 04:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
package okay all right other questions
 
04:14:21.309 --> 04:14:21.319 align:start position:0%
for this
 
04:14:23.670 --> 04:14:23.680 align:start position:0%

04:15:17.389 --> 04:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:20.750 --> 04:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
ah okay so um representative Alexander
 
04:15:21.830 --> 04:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
is here all right representative
 
04:15:25.309 --> 04:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
Alexander please um thank you Mr chair
 
04:15:26.950 --> 04:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:15:28.790 --> 04:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
my name is Joe Alexander I represent the
 
04:15:32.030 --> 04:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
town of gtown um I filed this bill on
 
04:15:33.790 --> 04:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
behalf of a constituent who I believe
 
04:15:36.309 --> 04:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
will be testifying today um this bill
 
04:15:40.149 --> 04:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
will do three things um first we'll give
 
04:15:41.950 --> 04:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
the public the right to attend a meeting
 
04:15:44.149 --> 04:15:44.159 align:start position:0%
where they are being spoken about in
 
04:15:46.790 --> 04:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
non-public it would make it would it
 
04:15:48.189 --> 04:15:48.199 align:start position:0%
would make a change in non-public
 
04:15:50.349 --> 04:15:50.359 align:start position:0%
sessions to give a citizen the right to
 
04:15:52.510 --> 04:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
attend a meeting in which they are being
 
04:15:55.630 --> 04:15:55.640 align:start position:0%
spoken about um it will give them the
 
04:15:57.910 --> 04:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
right to request an open meeting and
 
04:15:59.670 --> 04:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
then if the person requests an open
 
04:16:02.070 --> 04:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
meeting that shall be granted so um
 
04:16:04.309 --> 04:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
allowing a person to have transparency
 
04:16:06.790 --> 04:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
and and how they're being spoken about
 
04:16:09.830 --> 04:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
um I filed this bill um with that with
 
04:16:12.389 --> 04:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
those intentions I think um doing a
 
04:16:13.830 --> 04:16:13.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of more more research I think
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
there are some changes that I think I'd
 
04:16:18.269 --> 04:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
like to make um including notifying
 
04:16:20.229 --> 04:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
members of the public uh when they're
 
04:16:23.070 --> 04:16:23.080 align:start position:0%
being spoken about in non-public um and
 
04:16:24.710 --> 04:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
treating treating members of the public
 
04:16:26.990 --> 04:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
the same way as members of government
 
04:16:29.070 --> 04:16:29.080 align:start position:0%
would be treated in cases where they
 
04:16:31.309 --> 04:16:31.319 align:start position:0%
have a a a non-public session where they
 
04:16:33.030 --> 04:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
are being spoken about So currently
 
04:16:36.950 --> 04:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
under state law um a member of for
 
04:16:38.710 --> 04:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
instance the town of gtown that is being
 
04:16:41.030 --> 04:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
spoken about non-public has the right to
 
04:16:44.590 --> 04:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
wave that non-public um hearing to allow
 
04:16:45.990 --> 04:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
the conversation about them to be done
 
04:16:49.429 --> 04:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
in public um I'd like to consider that
 
04:16:52.710 --> 04:16:52.720 align:start position:0%
really is an intent of this bill so um I
 
04:16:55.349 --> 04:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
filed this bill I think I would like to
 
04:16:58.030 --> 04:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
see some work done to it so um I'm happy
 
04:16:59.790 --> 04:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
to hear feedback from other people they
 
04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
testify but um because it's in our
 
04:17:03.510 --> 04:17:03.520 align:start position:0%
committee hand I would request that we
 
04:17:06.269 --> 04:17:06.279 align:start position:0%
would get together and hopefully uh hash
 
04:17:08.950 --> 04:17:08.960 align:start position:0%
out and further details on it right all
 
04:17:10.910 --> 04:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
right questions for representative
 
04:17:14.990 --> 04:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:17.429 --> 04:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:17:21.710 --> 04:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative um just to start out with
 
04:17:24.870 --> 04:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
um how do you know or how would a body
 
04:17:26.189 --> 04:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
know in
 
04:17:28.990 --> 04:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
advance that somebody's name is not
 
04:17:32.070 --> 04:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
going to come up or is going to come up
 
04:17:36.109 --> 04:17:36.119 align:start position:0%
in a non-private session so that that
 
04:17:38.109 --> 04:17:38.119 align:start position:0%
person would have a right to come
 
04:17:42.469 --> 04:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
in ahead of time uh let's say they're
 
04:17:45.389 --> 04:17:45.399 align:start position:0%
the idea IDE is to talk about person a
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
and person B's name comes up um what
 
04:17:54.630 --> 04:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
happens to person's B person B's right
 
04:17:57.590 --> 04:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
under your bill to have attended the
 
04:18:00.750 --> 04:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
hearing where his name came up or her
 
04:18:02.550 --> 04:18:02.560 align:start position:0%
name well thank you representative for
 
04:18:04.429 --> 04:18:04.439 align:start position:0%
that question I would say that there's
 
04:18:06.630 --> 04:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
clearly outlined specific x amount of
 
04:18:09.149 --> 04:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
instances in which the member of the of
 
04:18:10.910 --> 04:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
the public body can go into non-public
 
04:18:13.389 --> 04:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
so my anticipation is they would know
 
04:18:15.030 --> 04:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
the general idea of the reason why
 
04:18:16.750 --> 04:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
they're going into non-public and then
 
04:18:18.990 --> 04:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
be able to notify the officials or or
 
04:18:20.030 --> 04:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
members of the public that they're
 
04:18:22.910 --> 04:18:22.920 align:start position:0%
speaking about um I think that adds a
 
04:18:24.950 --> 04:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
little like an extra layer to it but by
 
04:18:26.710 --> 04:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
saying they know ahead of time if
 
04:18:28.950 --> 04:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
they're going into non-public more often
 
04:18:30.710 --> 04:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
than not um because you have to State a
 
04:18:33.630 --> 04:18:33.640 align:start position:0%
specific reason to go into it so at that
 
04:18:35.389 --> 04:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
time they can then notify those members
 
04:18:37.349 --> 04:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
of of that are involved in certain
 
04:18:40.349 --> 04:18:40.359 align:start position:0%
situation and allow them to attend the
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
meeting follow go ahead f could follow
 
04:18:49.229 --> 04:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
up so let's say you've got a nonpublic
 
04:18:54.269 --> 04:18:54.279 align:start position:0%
meeting where three people are being
 
04:18:57.990 --> 04:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
discussed one wants the meeting to be
 
04:19:00.750 --> 04:19:00.760 align:start position:0%
public and two do not want the meeting
 
04:19:03.429 --> 04:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
to be public what happens well I think
 
04:19:04.830 --> 04:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
that's a good question for the committee
 
04:19:07.229 --> 04:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
and I uh invite you to maybe sit on
 
04:19:08.990 --> 04:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee with me to Hash that hash
 
04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
that out thank you
 
04:19:13.710 --> 04:19:13.720 align:start position:0%
representative other questions for this
 
04:19:14.990 --> 04:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
witness we don't spend enough time
 
04:19:17.349 --> 04:19:17.359 align:start position:0%
together over there all right thank you
 
04:19:19.990 --> 04:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
very much representative Alexander um
 
04:19:21.469 --> 04:19:21.479 align:start position:0%
representative um I'm sorry not
 
04:19:35.990 --> 04:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:40.510 --> 04:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
coko turned it off thank you again
 
04:19:43.269 --> 04:19:43.279 align:start position:0%
um right to know New Hampshire
 
04:19:47.349 --> 04:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
generally supports this bill um I do
 
04:19:50.149 --> 04:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
want to make a few clarifications um our
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
interpretation is a little bit different
 
04:19:55.429 --> 04:19:55.439 align:start position:0%
um than what representative Alexander
 
04:19:58.389 --> 04:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
just presented um he is talking about
 
04:20:00.950 --> 04:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
the ability to participate in a
 
04:20:03.229 --> 04:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
non-public session as a member of the
 
04:20:05.510 --> 04:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
public when we read this bill and
 
04:20:06.950 --> 04:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
discussed it with right to know we
 
04:20:09.510 --> 04:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
interpreted it to mean that the
 
04:20:12.750 --> 04:20:12.760 align:start position:0%
individual who is being spoken about um
 
04:20:15.550 --> 04:20:15.560 align:start position:0%
has the ability to not only request that
 
04:20:17.309 --> 04:20:17.319 align:start position:0%
the meeting be open which is already in
 
04:20:20.790 --> 04:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
statute but to be given information that
 
04:20:23.189 --> 04:20:23.199 align:start position:0%
that is about to happen and that there
 
04:20:26.510 --> 04:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
be a requirement that that requests that
 
04:20:28.710 --> 04:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
it be public be granted so that is a
 
04:20:30.790 --> 04:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
slightly different interpretation of the
 
04:20:33.469 --> 04:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
language and we would support um an
 
04:20:35.550 --> 04:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
amendment to that effect right to know
 
04:20:38.149 --> 04:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has consistant pushed this
 
04:20:41.630 --> 04:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
reputation question I can submit um some
 
04:20:44.550 --> 04:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
written testimony with examples um and
 
04:20:46.269 --> 04:20:46.279 align:start position:0%
and concerns that we have about how
 
04:20:48.990 --> 04:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
heavily used the reputation exemption is
 
04:20:50.469 --> 04:20:50.479 align:start position:0%
the one that I like to use because I
 
04:20:53.149 --> 04:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
find it so shocking and came from one of
 
04:20:56.550 --> 04:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
my uh local communities was the example
 
04:20:58.750 --> 04:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
where they went into non-public under
 
04:21:01.590 --> 04:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
reputation to discuss something and in
 
04:21:03.550 --> 04:21:03.560 align:start position:0%
the course of the conversation realized
 
04:21:05.710 --> 04:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
that they really did not have a basis
 
04:21:08.269 --> 04:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
for using reputation as the reason for
 
04:21:11.030 --> 04:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
this and so the conversation as it was
 
04:21:14.590 --> 04:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
then told to me for an opinion after the
 
04:21:17.149 --> 04:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
fact was
 
04:21:20.030 --> 04:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
well we need to say something bad about
 
04:21:23.590 --> 04:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
somebody so that we can stay within the
 
04:21:26.309 --> 04:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
rules and the reason that we went into
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
non-public and go ahead and seal those
 
04:21:30.590 --> 04:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
minutes providing somebody with prior
 
04:21:33.990 --> 04:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
notice would prevent that type of abuse
 
04:21:36.790 --> 04:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
that is an extreme example um but I do
 
04:21:38.790 --> 04:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
think it's it's very relevant to what
 
04:21:41.030 --> 04:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander is trying to
 
04:21:44.630 --> 04:21:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:46.269 --> 04:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
just see if I've covered
 
04:21:48.469 --> 04:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
everything so I I think the real
 
04:21:51.389 --> 04:21:51.399 align:start position:0%
question is the language now as we read
 
04:21:53.630 --> 04:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
it allows allows somebody to ask for
 
04:21:55.189 --> 04:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
that meeting to be available to the
 
04:21:57.510 --> 04:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
public um be held publicly so they can
 
04:21:59.790 --> 04:21:59.800 align:start position:0%
hear what's being said about them in
 
04:22:01.990 --> 04:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
reality an individual has no ability to
 
04:22:03.790 --> 04:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
exercise that right because they are not
 
04:22:05.429 --> 04:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
told that that is what is going to
 
04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
happen so whether we want to revise the
 
04:22:10.870 --> 04:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
legislation so that it addresses an open
 
04:22:12.550 --> 04:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
meeting where you're willing to have
 
04:22:14.429 --> 04:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
have that reputational discussion
 
04:22:17.670 --> 04:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
publicly stated or you want the
 
04:22:19.070 --> 04:22:19.080 align:start position:0%
individual to be able to go into
 
04:22:20.790 --> 04:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
non-public session there are ways to
 
04:22:22.269 --> 04:22:22.279 align:start position:0%
work that we have worked on this issue
 
04:22:23.710 --> 04:22:23.720 align:start position:0%
before and we would encourage having a
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
working group to address
 
04:22:29.510 --> 04:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
it representative Oran um yes thank you
 
04:22:32.990 --> 04:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
I missed the previous testimony but you
 
04:22:34.590 --> 04:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
probably thoughts do you have any
 
04:22:36.750 --> 04:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
thoughts about how if we move forward
 
04:22:38.309 --> 04:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
this how we'd amend it to cover the
 
04:22:40.870 --> 04:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
situation well the situation where
 
04:22:42.750 --> 04:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
multiple persons are involved than
 
04:22:44.670 --> 04:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
something they're discussing and even if
 
04:22:47.109 --> 04:22:47.119 align:start position:0%
even if one person thinks this doesn't
 
04:22:49.630 --> 04:22:49.640 align:start position:0%
adversely affect a reputation the open
 
04:22:51.910 --> 04:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
discussion might have might adversely
 
04:22:53.910 --> 04:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
affect the reputation of other parties
 
04:22:55.590 --> 04:22:55.600 align:start position:0%
involved in whatever the matter it is
 
04:22:58.030 --> 04:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
that's being discussed I do and I I
 
04:22:59.510 --> 04:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate the opportunity to speak to
 
04:23:02.030 --> 04:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
that representative Horgan so I I agree
 
04:23:04.429 --> 04:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
that most communities are well aware of
 
04:23:05.950 --> 04:23:05.960 align:start position:0%
what is going to be on the agenda for a
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
non-public session and what that topic
 
04:23:09.510 --> 04:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
will be and what it will likely touch on
 
04:23:10.910 --> 04:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
in my town you have to have your
 
04:23:13.189 --> 04:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
information in by Wednesday Thursday the
 
04:23:15.550 --> 04:23:15.560 align:start position:0%
agendas go out on Friday and typically
 
04:23:17.590 --> 04:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
the non-public sessions are planned in
 
04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
advance um I don't think it's
 
04:23:23.990 --> 04:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
unreasonable for a body to say this is
 
04:23:26.109 --> 04:23:26.119 align:start position:0%
touching on matters that we have not
 
04:23:27.670 --> 04:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
previously considered and aren't yet
 
04:23:30.229 --> 04:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
ready to discuss there's no reason that
 
04:23:32.790 --> 04:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
they can't postpone that discussion they
 
04:23:34.630 --> 04:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
have lots of leeway for emergency
 
04:23:36.670 --> 04:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
meetings if it really is that urgent
 
04:23:37.990 --> 04:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
they have the ability to have special
 
04:23:39.389 --> 04:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
meetings they could move forward with
 
04:23:42.109 --> 04:23:42.119 align:start position:0%
something that's posted within 24 hours
 
04:23:42.119 --> 04:23:45.149 align:start position:0%
something that's posted within 24 hours
so

04:23:45.149 --> 04:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:47.469 --> 04:23:47.479 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
04:23:50.149 --> 04:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
bir thank you Mr chair thank you I want
 
04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
to follow up because I'm sure you heard
 
04:23:54.990 --> 04:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
my questions uh to representative
 
04:24:00.750 --> 04:24:00.760 align:start position:0%
Alexander you seem to suggest that a
 
04:24:06.389 --> 04:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
um uh a board or or committee uh can
 
04:24:11.189 --> 04:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
figure out in advance of the discussion
 
04:24:16.750 --> 04:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
in uh um in PRI in the private session
 
04:24:18.389 --> 04:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
uh everything that's going to be
 
04:24:20.790 --> 04:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
discussed or every name that may come
 
04:24:22.910 --> 04:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
up so
 
04:24:25.510 --> 04:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
that the anybody's name who might come
 
04:24:27.750 --> 04:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
up can be notified or would come up
 
04:24:30.550 --> 04:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
might be notified ahead of time and then
 
04:24:32.469 --> 04:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
if that doesn't work out and the name
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
comes up everybody can just stop and
 
04:24:39.349 --> 04:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
restart again at the next scheduled
 
04:24:41.510 --> 04:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
meeting and then if the next scheduled
 
04:24:41.520 --> 04:24:42.990 align:start position:0%
meeting and then if the next scheduled
meeting

04:24:42.990 --> 04:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
04:24:45.269 --> 04:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
a name comes up then presumably you
 
04:24:48.389 --> 04:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
would stop and schedule it again I'm
 
04:24:51.070 --> 04:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
thinking about Personnel matters and how
 
04:24:55.030 --> 04:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
this would work uh because so you could
 
04:24:59.030 --> 04:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
be dealing with a uh uh an incident
 
04:25:01.349 --> 04:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
where somebody may have to be
 
04:25:04.030 --> 04:25:04.040 align:start position:0%
reprimanded or let go or whatever and
 
04:25:06.750 --> 04:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
that person says well so and so saw this
 
04:25:09.109 --> 04:25:09.119 align:start position:0%
well nobody knew that in advance then
 
04:25:11.309 --> 04:25:11.319 align:start position:0%
you just stop everything is that is that
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
the method you're you're suggesting it
 
04:25:15.550 --> 04:25:15.560 align:start position:0%
it is not I think there are a couple of
 
04:25:17.189 --> 04:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
things being conflated there the first
 
04:25:19.269 --> 04:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
is an assumption that the session would
 
04:25:20.950 --> 04:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
have to stop because it's a non-public
 
04:25:22.710 --> 04:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
the person could request that it be held
 
04:25:24.910 --> 04:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
openly and that wouldn't that wouldn't
 
04:25:27.389 --> 04:25:27.399 align:start position:0%
be an issue but you're speaking about
 
04:25:29.349 --> 04:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
employees and employees are covered
 
04:25:31.990 --> 04:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
under um other exemptions under the law
 
04:25:34.109 --> 04:25:34.119 align:start position:0%
that they either do or do not have a
 
04:25:36.830 --> 04:25:36.840 align:start position:0%
particular right to be part of a um
 
04:25:39.030 --> 04:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
discussion about them and what we are
 
04:25:41.469 --> 04:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
talking about is joke you member of the
 
04:25:43.870 --> 04:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
public who the board of Selectmen
 
04:25:45.910 --> 04:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
decides that they are going to discuss
 
04:25:48.269 --> 04:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
because um something has happened in
 
04:25:50.349 --> 04:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
town or there is some suspicion or
 
04:25:53.109 --> 04:25:53.119 align:start position:0%
something um we're not talking about
 
04:25:55.070 --> 04:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
employees and hearings they have their
 
04:25:58.309 --> 04:25:58.319 align:start position:0%
own processes and that's what my written
 
04:26:00.389 --> 04:26:00.399 align:start position:0%
testimony will speak to I can submit
 
04:26:02.590 --> 04:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
that to the committee as
 
04:26:06.830 --> 04:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
well other questions for this witness so
 
04:26:08.670 --> 04:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
I you know I I want to make sure that
 
04:26:12.710 --> 04:26:12.720 align:start position:0%
I'm understanding one thing um
 
04:26:16.149 --> 04:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
you you said that if I if I'm understand
 
04:26:18.229 --> 04:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure I have your position
 
04:26:22.710 --> 04:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
correctly you're saying that you would
 
04:26:25.750 --> 04:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
be you believe that if that if a person
 
04:26:27.750 --> 04:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
is being is going to be talked about in
 
04:26:30.229 --> 04:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
some adverse way at a meeting they
 
04:26:33.670 --> 04:26:33.680 align:start position:0%
should get a get notice and then B have
 
04:26:36.630 --> 04:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
a right to request that uh to request
 
04:26:40.550 --> 04:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
that the meeting be open and that that
 
04:26:43.389 --> 04:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
request would have to be granted
 
04:26:45.910 --> 04:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
we believe that the language that as we
 
04:26:47.990 --> 04:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
understood it proposed would do that
 
04:26:50.030 --> 04:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
what we understand is that right now an
 
04:26:53.030 --> 04:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
individual already has that right says
 
04:26:54.870 --> 04:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
anything that would other than a member
 
04:26:57.309 --> 04:26:57.319 align:start position:0%
of the public body itself unless such
 
04:27:00.070 --> 04:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
person requests an open meeting the
 
04:27:02.189 --> 04:27:02.199 align:start position:0%
challenge we run into is there's no
 
04:27:04.309 --> 04:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
notice there's no notice so how do you
 
04:27:05.670 --> 04:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
make that practicable so I guess the
 
04:27:07.510 --> 04:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
thing I want to I mean that that's one
 
04:27:10.229 --> 04:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
thing and at least speaking personally
 
04:27:13.109 --> 04:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
that might be something if if it
 
04:27:14.830 --> 04:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
you got to give notice and the person
 
04:27:17.550 --> 04:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
has the right to demand that the meeting
 
04:27:19.550 --> 04:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
be public that's one thing and I might
 
04:27:20.790 --> 04:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
be able to I'd want to think about it a
 
04:27:21.630 --> 04:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
little bit but I might be able to
 
04:27:25.149 --> 04:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
support that but are you saying that the
 
04:27:29.070 --> 04:27:29.080 align:start position:0%
person also should have the right to be
 
04:27:32.750 --> 04:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
notified and be present if even if the
 
04:27:34.590 --> 04:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
meeting is not going to be open to the
 
04:27:36.790 --> 04:27:36.800 align:start position:0%
public I think that's a separate issue
 
04:27:38.469 --> 04:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
and we didn't think that's what this
 
04:27:40.229 --> 04:27:40.239 align:start position:0%
legislation was addressing we have
 
04:27:42.630 --> 04:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
pushed for that in the past you would
 
04:27:44.830 --> 04:27:44.840 align:start position:0%
support that also we would support that
 
04:27:47.469 --> 04:27:47.479 align:start position:0%
but I I think we thought that this was
 
04:27:50.429 --> 04:27:50.439 align:start position:0%
taking a a simpler approach which is
 
04:27:53.070 --> 04:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
enabling a right that already exists
 
04:27:55.429 --> 04:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
under statute and the presumption is
 
04:27:56.950 --> 04:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
that if that person asks for that
 
04:27:59.109 --> 04:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
meeting to be open it will be granted
 
04:28:01.229 --> 04:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
but explicitly stating that is also
 
04:28:03.389 --> 04:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
helpful we weren't going down the
 
04:28:05.950 --> 04:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
non-public participation in non-public
 
04:28:07.910 --> 04:28:07.920 align:start position:0%
session conversation when we came into
 
04:28:10.189 --> 04:28:10.199 align:start position:0%
this hearing all right other questions
 
04:28:12.710 --> 04:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
for this witness saying none thank you
 
04:28:16.189 --> 04:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh next I'm going to call on
 
04:28:20.830 --> 04:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:23.630 --> 04:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
jeru and Mr Drew you've submitted
 
04:28:26.269 --> 04:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
written testimony so I which uh will be
 
04:28:27.590 --> 04:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
distributed to the members of the
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
committer have has been so I guess what
 
04:28:32.070 --> 04:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
I want to say is I don't want you to
 
04:28:34.109 --> 04:28:34.119 align:start position:0%
please don't just read your testimony I
 
04:28:35.750 --> 04:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
want you to if you have something you
 
04:28:39.750 --> 04:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
want to tell us um you know uh that's
 
04:28:43.349 --> 04:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
fine but it we're we can read as well as
 
04:28:45.429 --> 04:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
you can yeah no I'm not going to repeat
 
04:28:46.670 --> 04:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm just going to hit the
 
04:28:48.830 --> 04:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
highlights of it because from this
 
04:28:51.510 --> 04:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
discussion here it sounds like this
 
04:28:54.550 --> 04:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
whole thing's been twisted around now
 
04:28:56.189 --> 04:28:56.199 align:start position:0%
because it almost sounds like you're
 
04:28:59.229 --> 04:28:59.239 align:start position:0%
going you're talking about giving notice
 
04:29:01.429 --> 04:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
regardless no matter what if you're
 
04:29:03.469 --> 04:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
going to talk about a person you're
 
04:29:05.910 --> 04:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
going to give notice and this is one of
 
04:29:07.910 --> 04:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
my complaints because in vble versus
 
04:29:10.550 --> 04:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
town of Bridgewater they stated that
 
04:29:13.149 --> 04:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
Johnson versus Nash stated that
 
04:29:16.030 --> 04:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
basically unless such a person requests
 
04:29:18.910 --> 04:29:18.920 align:start position:0%
the meeting open that requires advanced
 
04:29:21.830 --> 04:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
notice so that's how the law is right
 
04:29:26.790 --> 04:29:26.800 align:start position:0%
now but in 2005 so now first off it
 
04:29:28.870 --> 04:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like no matter what if the
 
04:29:30.750 --> 04:29:30.760 align:start position:0%
according to the law the way the law is
 
04:29:33.070 --> 04:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
written and according to Johnson versus
 
04:29:36.389 --> 04:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
Nash if you were to talk about somebody
 
04:29:37.670 --> 04:29:37.680 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to give them advanced
 
04:29:39.990 --> 04:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
notice to give them an option to
 
04:29:42.830 --> 04:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
exercise that right to keep it open
 
04:29:44.429 --> 04:29:44.439 align:start position:0%
now in
 
04:29:48.030 --> 04:29:48.040 align:start position:0%
2005 I was before The Supreme Court and
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
I was arrested and prevented from
 
04:29:51.630 --> 04:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
attending a closed session which you
 
04:29:53.109 --> 04:29:53.119 align:start position:0%
some of you might have remembered that
 
04:29:55.950 --> 04:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
testimony in 2023 I mean I know you hear
 
04:29:58.349 --> 04:29:58.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of them but I was arrested
 
04:30:00.670 --> 04:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
prevented told to small town
 
04:30:05.590 --> 04:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
politics okay so now you got Johnson
 
04:30:08.070 --> 04:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
versus Nash that says I needed advanced
 
04:30:09.990 --> 04:30:10.000 align:start position:0%
notice and now you got a court case that
 
04:30:12.269 --> 04:30:12.279 align:start position:0%
says oh wait a minute no you don't have
 
04:30:14.750 --> 04:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
to give anybody advance notice so it's
 
04:30:17.189 --> 04:30:17.199 align:start position:0%
kind of contradicting themselves and you
 
04:30:19.950 --> 04:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
could say and you could present this
 
04:30:23.269 --> 04:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
argument that since the legislative fied
 
04:30:25.950 --> 04:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
to amend section c when they amended
 
04:30:28.750 --> 04:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
section A after the Johnson ruling that
 
04:30:31.630 --> 04:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent was to give us
 
04:30:34.550 --> 04:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
all notice before you talk about us but
 
04:30:37.309 --> 04:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
then in the 2023 legislative session
 
04:30:39.149 --> 04:30:39.159 align:start position:0%
under house bill
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
652 this committee said no we cannot
 
04:30:44.189 --> 04:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
give you that because it's going to
 
04:30:46.590 --> 04:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
interfere with investigations it's going
 
04:30:48.750 --> 04:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
to interfere with other statutes and all
 
04:30:51.030 --> 04:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
that you did not want to give regardless
 
04:30:54.189 --> 04:30:54.199 align:start position:0%
Clause so now we're I'm kind of confused
 
04:30:55.389 --> 04:30:55.399 align:start position:0%
because now it looks like we're still
 
04:30:58.109 --> 04:30:58.119 align:start position:0%
hindering here but you still have a
 
04:31:01.309 --> 04:31:01.319 align:start position:0%
statute here that says this thing and a
 
04:31:03.590 --> 04:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
Court ruling that says notice must be
 
04:31:05.950 --> 04:31:05.960 align:start position:0%
given all to everybody but then you got
 
04:31:08.469 --> 04:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
a Court ruling which you can't use in a
 
04:31:09.910 --> 04:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
court because it was a three judge
 
04:31:12.750 --> 04:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
ruling but a Supreme Court says oh no
 
04:31:14.189 --> 04:31:14.199 align:start position:0%
you don't have to give notice it's okay
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
to arrest and prevent him from attending
 
04:31:18.910 --> 04:31:18.920 align:start position:0%
and you don't even have to give them
 
04:31:20.750 --> 04:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
access to the minutes because that was
 
04:31:22.790 --> 04:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
the one thing I was asking for unless
 
04:31:25.309 --> 04:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
such person requests an open meeting
 
04:31:28.229 --> 04:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
well what's the time limit on that okay
 
04:31:29.630 --> 04:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
I missed the meeting I want to see the
 
04:31:31.910 --> 04:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes I'm requesting the
 
04:31:33.750 --> 04:31:33.760 align:start position:0%
meeting minutes open and that's when I
 
04:31:36.389 --> 04:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
was told no you can't see those meeting
 
04:31:38.149 --> 04:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
minut but that's kind of contradicting
 
04:31:40.189 --> 04:31:40.199 align:start position:0%
to your statute so I'm kind of trying to
 
04:31:42.870 --> 04:31:42.880 align:start position:0%
clarify the statute here and that's why
 
04:31:45.510 --> 04:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
I turned around and I just put because
 
04:31:47.790 --> 04:31:47.800 align:start position:0%
when you go to court and you're going to
 
04:31:50.389 --> 04:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
argue this in court no matter what the
 
04:31:51.670 --> 04:31:51.680 align:start position:0%
first thing the Court's going to do
 
04:31:53.870 --> 04:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
which you might be able to relate to
 
04:31:55.910 --> 04:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
this replin is they're going to say
 
04:31:57.630 --> 04:31:57.640 align:start position:0%
first off you have a right to that
 
04:31:59.510 --> 04:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
meeting because that's what happened
 
04:32:01.710 --> 04:32:01.720 align:start position:0%
when I went to the federal courts and
 
04:32:02.790 --> 04:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's what they're going to ask you
 
04:32:04.790 --> 04:32:04.800 align:start position:0%
have a right to this meeting the second
 
04:32:06.910 --> 04:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
thing they're going to ask is in a
 
04:32:10.670 --> 04:32:10.680 align:start position:0%
defamation what harm actually took place
 
04:32:12.870 --> 04:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
just because this board is talking about
 
04:32:15.990 --> 04:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
a person you have to show harm also took
 
04:32:18.590 --> 04:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
place to the reputation so I mean
 
04:32:21.790 --> 04:32:21.800 align:start position:0%
there's two big jums here but my point
 
04:32:24.630 --> 04:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
right here is if we have a right a due
 
04:32:27.550 --> 04:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
process right you should be able to
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
notif you should be notifying this
 
04:32:32.870 --> 04:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
person now in my interpretation what
 
04:32:35.229 --> 04:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
I've been hearing from this statute it
 
04:32:38.030 --> 04:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
seems most of the violations is because
 
04:32:40.510 --> 04:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
the towns and the municipalities aren't
 
04:32:43.149 --> 04:32:43.159 align:start position:0%
following the law
 
04:32:45.309 --> 04:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
I mean you got people talking about
 
04:32:47.189 --> 04:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
people and not you know I mean it it's
 
04:32:50.309 --> 04:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
just they're not following the laws here
 
04:32:53.189 --> 04:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
so I mean it's like what do you do I
 
04:32:56.990 --> 04:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
feel and I know in 2023 you might recall
 
04:32:58.429 --> 04:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
that argument because they were trying
 
04:33:01.550 --> 04:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
to Define that word right what is a
 
04:33:04.789 --> 04:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
right well I ask you at this point well
 
04:33:07.830 --> 04:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
if you got people here holding closed
 
04:33:10.390 --> 04:33:10.400 align:start position:0%
sessions and holding meetings why don't
 
04:33:12.990 --> 04:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
they have any idea what the due process
 
04:33:14.470 --> 04:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
right is because when you're talking
 
04:33:17.670 --> 04:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
notification you're talking due process
 
04:33:20.590 --> 04:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
rights and maybe it's a good idea for
 
04:33:22.830 --> 04:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
these municipalities and these people
 
04:33:24.910 --> 04:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
holding these closed sessions to stop
 
04:33:27.150 --> 04:33:27.160 align:start position:0%
and think and say hey does this person
 
04:33:28.949 --> 04:33:28.959 align:start position:0%
have a right maybe they should start
 
04:33:30.830 --> 04:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
thinking maybe they should start talking
 
04:33:32.869 --> 04:33:32.879 align:start position:0%
to the municipal
 
04:33:35.429 --> 04:33:35.439 align:start position:0%
Association and saying hey what is the
 
04:33:37.230 --> 04:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
person's due process right maybe they
 
04:33:38.949 --> 04:33:38.959 align:start position:0%
ought to be calling the do lawyers and
 
04:33:40.949 --> 04:33:40.959 align:start position:0%
talking to them and finding out before
 
04:33:42.230 --> 04:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
they're holding these
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
meetings that's my point and that's why
 
04:33:46.390 --> 04:33:46.400 align:start position:0%
I want this you know at least settled
 
04:33:48.429 --> 04:33:48.439 align:start position:0%
somehow I have no objection if you want
 
04:33:50.349 --> 04:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
to give a regardless Clause that's fine
 
04:33:52.310 --> 04:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
with me but from your other objections
 
04:33:54.629 --> 04:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
to interfering with investigations and
 
04:33:56.590 --> 04:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
other statutes isn't that still in
 
04:33:59.470 --> 04:33:59.480 align:start position:0%
effect here so I'm just trying to
 
04:34:02.109 --> 04:34:02.119 align:start position:0%
protect my due process rights and it all
 
04:34:04.349 --> 04:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
depends on the circumstances of the case
 
04:34:05.750 --> 04:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
and the Supreme Court and the New
 
04:34:07.310 --> 04:34:07.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court I should say us
 
04:34:09.910 --> 04:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire Supreme Courts cannot
 
04:34:12.230 --> 04:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
really Define it definitively it all
 
04:34:14.670 --> 04:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
depends on the circumstances one little
 
04:34:16.510 --> 04:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
change in the circumstance could change
 
04:34:18.789 --> 04:34:18.799 align:start position:0%
if you have a due process right so I
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
mean I would say I will I'm I'm for this
 
04:34:25.709 --> 04:34:25.719 align:start position:0%
bill it protects our new process rights
 
04:34:27.510 --> 04:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully and it'll get these people
 
04:34:29.670 --> 04:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
actually talking about what our rights
 
04:34:32.189 --> 04:34:32.199 align:start position:0%
are so any question thank questions for
 
04:34:32.199 --> 04:34:32.990 align:start position:0%
are so any question thank questions for
this

04:34:32.990 --> 04:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:34:35.349 --> 04:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
04:34:40.750 --> 04:34:40.760 align:start position:0%
sir thank you next uh uh uh Barrett
 
04:34:57.750 --> 04:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:58.949 --> 04:34:58.959 align:start position:0%
thank you again chairman Lyn good
 
04:35:00.429 --> 04:35:00.439 align:start position:0%
afternoon members of the committee Barr
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
school boards Association um chairman
 
04:35:03.910 --> 04:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
Lynn I know I put three minutes on my
 
04:35:05.510 --> 04:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
card this is a complex issue I may
 
04:35:06.990 --> 04:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
require a little bit more time at at
 
04:35:08.990 --> 04:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
your discretion sir no that's fine um
 
04:35:12.150 --> 04:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
and second um uh I I'm passing around a
 
04:35:14.029 --> 04:35:14.039 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment I did email this to
 
04:35:15.670 --> 04:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander yesterday we
 
04:35:18.269 --> 04:35:18.279 align:start position:0%
have not had an opportunity I have it I
 
04:35:19.910 --> 04:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
have I have it I'll check I was going to
 
04:35:21.269 --> 04:35:21.279 align:start position:0%
say I did not have you don't have it I
 
04:35:22.429 --> 04:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
was going to say I did not have an
 
04:35:24.869 --> 04:35:24.879 align:start position:0%
opportunity to touch base with repres
 
04:35:26.949 --> 04:35:26.959 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander regarding it
 
04:35:29.949 --> 04:35:29.959 align:start position:0%
second um I did check off support on my
 
04:35:32.070 --> 04:35:32.080 align:start position:0%
card if if that I'm going to take no
 
04:35:34.709 --> 04:35:34.719 align:start position:0%
position on the bill because I think I
 
04:35:37.670 --> 04:35:37.680 align:start position:0%
may have been um uh uh misconstruing
 
04:35:39.429 --> 04:35:39.439 align:start position:0%
what the purpose of the intent was and
 
04:35:41.670 --> 04:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
there seems to be some confusion going
 
04:35:43.709 --> 04:35:43.719 align:start position:0%
around the bill um going around relative
 
04:35:47.510 --> 04:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
to the the conversation I in trying to
 
04:35:49.349 --> 04:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
decipher the intent of the bill and some
 
04:35:51.470 --> 04:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
of the testimony of the people before me
 
04:35:53.670 --> 04:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
I think the confusion hinges on whether
 
04:35:56.150 --> 04:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
or not an individual has a right to
 
04:35:59.070 --> 04:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
attend a meeting in non-public session
 
04:36:00.949 --> 04:36:00.959 align:start position:0%
simply by the mere fact that the public
 
04:36:03.470 --> 04:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
body is going to discuss that individual
 
04:36:06.269 --> 04:36:06.279 align:start position:0%
in the non-public session NH hsba does
 
04:36:10.470 --> 04:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
not interpret 91 A3 paragraph 2C to mean
 
04:36:12.070 --> 04:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
that just because you were talking about
 
04:36:13.510 --> 04:36:13.520 align:start position:0%
somebody's reputation that that
 
04:36:15.551 --> 04:36:15.561 align:start position:0%
individual has a right to attend the
 
04:36:18.269 --> 04:36:18.279 align:start position:0%
non-public session where you're talking
 
04:36:22.150 --> 04:36:22.160 align:start position:0%
about them um related to that it's
 
04:36:25.310 --> 04:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
important to understand the context when
 
04:36:27.070 --> 04:36:27.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about school districts and
 
04:36:29.150 --> 04:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
I know we have at least two Schoolboard
 
04:36:31.070 --> 04:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
members on this committee when we're
 
04:36:34.029 --> 04:36:34.039 align:start position:0%
talking about student matters we always
 
04:36:36.869 --> 04:36:36.879 align:start position:0%
use paragraph C the reputation and that
 
04:36:40.269 --> 04:36:40.279 align:start position:0%
may be a hearing it may be simply the
 
04:36:42.070 --> 04:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
administration or the super intendent
 
04:36:45.029 --> 04:36:45.039 align:start position:0%
having to notify the school board that a
 
04:36:46.670 --> 04:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
student disciplinary matter may be
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
coming up and it you may not always have
 
04:36:51.390 --> 04:36:51.400 align:start position:0%
time to provide notice or put that on
 
04:36:52.990 --> 04:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
the agenda if the school board meeting
 
04:36:56.510 --> 04:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
is is on Wednesday night January 22nd at
 
04:36:59.390 --> 04:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
6 p.m. and that student did something
 
04:37:02.269 --> 04:37:02.279 align:start position:0%
problematic at 300 p.m. that afternoon
 
04:37:03.789 --> 04:37:03.799 align:start position:0%
and the police may have been called
 
04:37:05.189 --> 04:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
there may have been you know some sort
 
04:37:06.789 --> 04:37:06.799 align:start position:0%
of immediate suspension something
 
04:37:08.470 --> 04:37:08.480 align:start position:0%
relative to the health safety and
 
04:37:10.551 --> 04:37:10.561 align:start position:0%
Welfare of other students that
 
04:37:12.510 --> 04:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
superintendent has an obligation to
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
inform the school board that there was
 
04:37:16.510 --> 04:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
an incident at school the police were
 
04:37:19.470 --> 04:37:19.480 align:start position:0%
called we caught a student doing X Y and
 
04:37:22.230 --> 04:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
Z whatever it might be we always use
 
04:37:24.750 --> 04:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph C for student matters doesn't
 
04:37:28.429 --> 04:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
matter what the context is so there was
 
04:37:32.269 --> 04:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
also some discussion um and I think nhba
 
04:37:34.830 --> 04:37:34.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation that the right the the
 
04:37:37.029 --> 04:37:37.039 align:start position:0%
fact that a an individual is being
 
04:37:39.510 --> 04:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
discussed in a non-public session and
 
04:37:42.029 --> 04:37:42.039 align:start position:0%
the fact that their reputation May being
 
04:37:44.310 --> 04:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
discussed or come up does not give rise
 
04:37:47.670 --> 04:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
to a right to a hearing I have um I
 
04:37:49.470 --> 04:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
copied off some pertinent Provisions
 
04:37:55.150 --> 04:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
from this is civil Lingham SI i v a l i
 
04:38:01.750 --> 04:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
n g a m v Newton 174 New Hampshire 489
 
04:38:03.990 --> 04:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire 202 New Hampshire Supreme
 
04:38:04.000 --> 04:38:06.029 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire 202 New Hampshire Supreme
Court

04:38:06.029 --> 04:38:06.039 align:start position:0%
Court
 
04:38:08.869 --> 04:38:08.879 align:start position:0%
2021 um so here's the pertinent
 
04:38:11.709 --> 04:38:11.719 align:start position:0%
paragraph if you'll indulge me indeed we
 
04:38:14.029 --> 04:38:14.039 align:start position:0%
question to what extent Johnson has any
 
04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
precedential value given that it was
 
04:38:18.910 --> 04:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
decided after the legislature amended
 
04:38:20.709 --> 04:38:20.719 align:start position:0%
the language in RSA
 
04:38:24.390 --> 04:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
91a 3 paragraph 2A that we addressed in
 
04:38:26.470 --> 04:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
that opinion nevertheless the
 
04:38:29.070 --> 04:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
legislature has not amended the statute
 
04:38:31.869 --> 04:38:31.879 align:start position:0%
to confer the broad rights of notice to
 
04:38:33.750 --> 04:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
the minority suggests that the quote
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
reasoning of Johnson mandates here's the
 
04:38:38.510 --> 04:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
important aspect nor do we believe that
 
04:38:40.670 --> 04:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
this court or the legislature for that
 
04:38:44.269 --> 04:38:44.279 align:start position:0%
matter never intended to imply conferred
 
04:38:46.990 --> 04:38:47.000 align:start position:0%
to impliedly confer such an expansive
 
04:38:49.109 --> 04:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
right to notice upon an even broader
 
04:38:51.869 --> 04:38:51.879 align:start position:0%
category of Citizen I.E any person who
 
04:38:53.830 --> 04:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
might seek to prevent a public body from
 
04:38:56.189 --> 04:38:56.199 align:start position:0%
entering into a non-public session upon
 
04:38:58.109 --> 04:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
the assumption that the public bodies
 
04:39:00.750 --> 04:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
discussions quote would likely adversely
 
04:39:02.990 --> 04:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
affect her reputation RSC 91 A3
 
04:39:04.670 --> 04:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2C so the Supreme Court has
 
04:39:07.629 --> 04:39:07.639 align:start position:0%
said just because an individual's
 
04:39:09.470 --> 04:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
reputation may come up in a non-public
 
04:39:12.670 --> 04:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
session does not confer that right to to
 
04:39:14.949 --> 04:39:14.959 align:start position:0%
that individual to attend the meeting
 
04:39:17.670 --> 04:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
circling that back around to my proposed
 
04:39:21.310 --> 04:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
amendment I took language from RSA
 
04:39:28.070 --> 04:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
91 d a go 3 paragraph 2A which states
 
04:39:29.789 --> 04:39:29.799 align:start position:0%
only the following matters shall be
 
04:39:31.590 --> 04:39:31.600 align:start position:0%
discussed or acted upon a non-public
 
04:39:34.390 --> 04:39:34.400 align:start position:0%
session a the dismissal promotion or
 
04:39:36.990 --> 04:39:37.000 align:start position:0%
compensation of any Public Employee or
 
04:39:39.230 --> 04:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
the disciplining of such employee or the
 
04:39:41.110 --> 04:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
investigation of any charges against him
 
04:39:44.670 --> 04:39:44.680 align:start position:0%
or her unless the employee affected one
 
04:39:47.230 --> 04:39:47.240 align:start position:0%
has a right to a meeting and two
 
04:39:49.070 --> 04:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
requests that the meeting be open in
 
04:39:51.190 --> 04:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
which case the request shall be granted
 
04:39:53.510 --> 04:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
I copied that language and put it in in
 
04:39:54.868 --> 04:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
in in a proposed amendment to
 
04:39:57.190 --> 04:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander's bill now we
 
04:39:58.948 --> 04:39:58.958 align:start position:0%
have to ask the question where does the
 
04:40:00.670 --> 04:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
right to a meeting come from it can come
 
04:40:02.910 --> 04:40:02.920 align:start position:0%
from statute can come from Employment
 
04:40:05.910 --> 04:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
contract presumably a Schoolboard policy
 
04:40:09.430 --> 04:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
or perhaps administrative law so but
 
04:40:12.390 --> 04:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
again circling back around
 
04:40:14.110 --> 04:40:14.120 align:start position:0%
the right to attend the meeting has to
 
04:40:16.590 --> 04:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
be conferred first we have to ascertain
 
04:40:19.350 --> 04:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
where the source of that right is and a
 
04:40:21.470 --> 04:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
student context it would be through
 
04:40:23.070 --> 04:40:23.080 align:start position:0%
General due process if a student is
 
04:40:24.350 --> 04:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
being disciplined we have student
 
04:40:26.990 --> 04:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
discipline statutes across the across
 
04:40:29.310 --> 04:40:29.320 align:start position:0%
the hall and RSA 189 Federal
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
requirements relative to do notice and
 
04:40:33.310 --> 04:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
process and a hearing before a school
 
04:40:35.150 --> 04:40:35.160 align:start position:0%
board relative to and before a student
 
04:40:37.190 --> 04:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
is suspended for a certain number of
 
04:40:40.310 --> 04:40:40.320 align:start position:0%
days so I think that's it I hope I was
 
04:40:42.550 --> 04:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
clear I'm happy to answer any questions
 
04:40:44.150 --> 04:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
that the committee may
 
04:40:47.590 --> 04:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
have questions for this witness so I
 
04:40:51.070 --> 04:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
guess I just have a couple so um am I
 
04:40:53.150 --> 04:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
understanding that all I mean all of the
 
04:40:55.350 --> 04:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
things that you talked
 
04:40:59.990 --> 04:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
about contract right uh
 
04:41:03.910 --> 04:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
policy um that kind of thing am I would
 
04:41:06.390 --> 04:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
I be correct in understanding that most
 
04:41:09.190 --> 04:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
of the time in fact I mean I guess I
 
04:41:10.708 --> 04:41:10.718 align:start position:0%
would say all of the time that I could
 
04:41:12.350 --> 04:41:12.360 align:start position:0%
think of and maybe if you have other
 
04:41:15.590 --> 04:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
examples you know that are different
 
04:41:18.788 --> 04:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
please don't the doesn't that kind of a
 
04:41:19.948 --> 04:41:19.958 align:start position:0%
right let's say in a collective
 
04:41:22.310 --> 04:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement for
 
04:41:24.830 --> 04:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
example don't they usually say that the
 
04:41:29.030 --> 04:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
right to be present or to sort of
 
04:41:31.470 --> 04:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
understand applies in the situation
 
04:41:32.990 --> 04:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
where the board is going to take some
 
04:41:35.190 --> 04:41:35.200 align:start position:0%
action correct if they're gonna if the
 
04:41:37.948 --> 04:41:37.958 align:start position:0%
board is going to have a discussion but
 
04:41:39.550 --> 04:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
there they're not going to take any
 
04:41:41.830 --> 04:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
action I'm I'm I guess I'm not aware of
 
04:41:44.868 --> 04:41:44.878 align:start position:0%
any circumstance where you know where
 
04:41:46.990 --> 04:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
you would have I mean unless we decide
 
04:41:48.830 --> 04:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
to grant that but I'm not aware of any
 
04:41:50.670 --> 04:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
circumstance right now where you would
 
04:41:53.430 --> 04:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
have the right to know that correct
 
04:41:55.110 --> 04:41:55.120 align:start position:0%
exactly which is why we think that
 
04:41:58.628 --> 04:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
paragraph 2A of 91 A3 unless the
 
04:42:00.510 --> 04:42:00.520 align:start position:0%
affected employee has a right to a
 
04:42:02.390 --> 04:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
meeting and that right to a meeting I
 
04:42:04.590 --> 04:42:04.600 align:start position:0%
mean the other the other conflict is
 
04:42:08.628 --> 04:42:08.638 align:start position:0%
that the the right to no law uses the
 
04:42:08.638 --> 04:42:09.830 align:start position:0%
that the the right to no law uses the
phrase

04:42:09.830 --> 04:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
phrase
 
04:42:12.430 --> 04:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
meeting we have always interpreted that
 
04:42:13.670 --> 04:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
to mean the individual doesn't
 
04:42:15.510 --> 04:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a right to a meeting
 
04:42:18.948 --> 04:42:18.958 align:start position:0%
they have a right to a hearing which is
 
04:42:21.310 --> 04:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
different to some degree you know I have
 
04:42:23.788 --> 04:42:23.798 align:start position:0%
a right to attend a public meeting and
 
04:42:25.070 --> 04:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
if it's a Schoolboard meeting I have a
 
04:42:26.350 --> 04:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
right to engage in public comment
 
04:42:28.550 --> 04:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
through a statute a couple years ago but
 
04:42:30.910 --> 04:42:30.920 align:start position:0%
I don't have any other specific right
 
04:42:33.110 --> 04:42:33.120 align:start position:0%
granted upon me to other than attending
 
04:42:36.590 --> 04:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
a meeting under RSA 91a and we often con
 
04:42:40.310 --> 04:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
conf we often confuse the language in
 
04:42:44.750 --> 04:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
RSA 9 1 A3 it's a non-public session it
 
04:42:48.670 --> 04:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
is a session of a public meeting but yet
 
04:42:50.670 --> 04:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
for purposes that I don't know why this
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know this language in 9183 the
 
04:42:55.190 --> 04:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
non-public session statute a right to a
 
04:42:57.470 --> 04:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
meeting that predates my time at the
 
04:42:59.150 --> 04:42:59.160 align:start position:0%
school boards Association so I don't
 
04:43:00.750 --> 04:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
know what the legislative conversation
 
04:43:02.990 --> 04:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
was when this was initially drafted
 
04:43:06.070 --> 04:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
however many however many years ago um
 
04:43:08.550 --> 04:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
but so you know and and the other rights
 
04:43:10.510 --> 04:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of the due process this is not
 
04:43:12.550 --> 04:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
necessarily pertinent for this committee
 
04:43:14.868 --> 04:43:14.878 align:start position:0%
but um employee right under Collective
 
04:43:18.750 --> 04:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
bargain agreement or um RSC 1891 14a a
 
04:43:20.430 --> 04:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
teacher non-renewal or a teacher
 
04:43:22.230 --> 04:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
dismissal there is a Department of
 
04:43:25.030 --> 04:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
Education rule ed2 it's in the ed2 200s
 
04:43:26.470 --> 04:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
that lays out what the specific due
 
04:43:28.868 --> 04:43:28.878 align:start position:0%
process requirements are notice right to
 
04:43:31.030 --> 04:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
attend documents having have a
 
04:43:33.430 --> 04:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative cross-examine the the
 
04:43:35.430 --> 04:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
typical due process
 
04:43:38.390 --> 04:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
rights all right other questions for
 
04:43:41.430 --> 04:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
this witness seeing none Thank you very
 
04:43:43.230 --> 04:43:43.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:43:54.990 --> 04:43:55.000 align:start position:0%

Association uh nhma opposes hb3 313 um
 
04:44:08.910 --> 04:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to try to reiterate um
 
04:44:11.510 --> 04:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
what Mr Christina just said um or the
 
04:44:13.628 --> 04:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
previous testimony um the Supreme Court
 
04:44:16.670 --> 04:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
decision the Supreme Court found that uh
 
04:44:22.350 --> 04:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
it does uh it RSA uh 91a colon 3 Roman
 
04:44:24.550 --> 04:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
numeral 2C does not require an
 
04:44:26.230 --> 04:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
individual to give notice and a right to
 
04:44:28.868 --> 04:44:28.878 align:start position:0%
attend um the non-public session in
 
04:44:30.788 --> 04:44:30.798 align:start position:0%
which a discussion discussion May uh
 
04:44:33.628 --> 04:44:33.638 align:start position:0%
occur that may ad adversely affect the
 
04:44:33.638 --> 04:44:34.750 align:start position:0%
occur that may ad adversely affect the
individual's

04:44:34.750 --> 04:44:34.760 align:start position:0%
individual's
 
04:44:38.230 --> 04:44:38.240 align:start position:0%
reputation um I think that they realize
 
04:44:40.430 --> 04:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
and I think um it sounds like
 
04:44:42.310 --> 04:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander also has
 
04:44:44.070 --> 04:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
realized that there are some practical
 
04:44:46.868 --> 04:44:46.878 align:start position:0%
practical implications of the change
 
04:44:50.070 --> 04:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's proposed um how does it work does
 
04:44:52.628 --> 04:44:52.638 align:start position:0%
business cease um I think there was a
 
04:44:54.350 --> 04:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
question about what if there's people
 
04:44:57.070 --> 04:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
that are intertwined um who gets if
 
04:44:58.350 --> 04:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
someone wants to go to public session
 
04:44:59.948 --> 04:44:59.958 align:start position:0%
and someone doesn't what does that look
 
04:45:02.868 --> 04:45:02.878 align:start position:0%
like um there's a lot of questions I
 
04:45:05.990 --> 04:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
think that are are open with uh HB 313
 
04:45:09.788 --> 04:45:09.798 align:start position:0%
as it is um we think it's not practical
 
04:45:12.628 --> 04:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
um and um would end up actually
 
04:45:15.590 --> 04:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
adversely affecting maybe someone's in
 
04:45:18.390 --> 04:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
reputation um and that's not what by
 
04:45:20.550 --> 04:45:20.560 align:start position:0%
virtue of I by virtue of if it's
 
04:45:22.350 --> 04:45:22.360 align:start position:0%
somebody else that ends up in an open
 
04:45:25.190 --> 04:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
meeting that doesn't want to be there um
 
04:45:29.350 --> 04:45:29.360 align:start position:0%
so nhma we oppose this bill but um we
 
04:45:32.270 --> 04:45:32.280 align:start position:0%
would urge um a work session on it it
 
04:45:35.070 --> 04:45:35.080 align:start position:0%
sounds like potentially maybe there
 
04:45:36.990 --> 04:45:37.000 align:start position:0%
could be some work that's done that
 
04:45:38.510 --> 04:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
makes it more
 
04:45:41.670 --> 04:45:41.680 align:start position:0%
palatable I'm open to questions
 
04:45:45.390 --> 04:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
questions for this um witness seeing
 
04:45:49.110 --> 04:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much um is there
 
04:45:51.430 --> 04:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
anyone else here who wishes to be heard
 
04:45:54.030 --> 04:45:54.040 align:start position:0%
on HB
 
04:45:57.670 --> 04:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
313 seeing none I'm going to uh close
 
04:46:01.310 --> 04:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
the hearing on HB 313 and lo and behold
 
04:46:02.470 --> 04:46:02.480 align:start position:0%

04:46:17.310 --> 04:46:17.320 align:start position:0%
be inclined on pushing that out oh a
 
04:46:18.788 --> 04:46:18.798 align:start position:0%
month so that we have some time to work
 
04:46:20.350 --> 04:46:20.360 align:start position:0%

you hello everyone good
 
04:58:36.868 --> 04:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you Mr chair and members
 
04:58:39.590 --> 04:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
of the committee again my name is Lisa
 
04:58:42.470 --> 04:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
merer and I represent Hillsboro District
 
04:58:45.310 --> 04:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
44 I think this will be a pretty quick
 
04:58:49.590 --> 04:58:49.600 align:start position:0%
one for you so but we'll see so HPB 376
 
04:58:52.310 --> 04:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
is a very simple bill that revises one
 
04:58:55.590 --> 04:58:55.600 align:start position:0%
of the exemp exemptions in our right to
 
04:58:58.910 --> 04:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
no law to include but not limit to
 
04:59:01.910 --> 04:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
library cards and Library membership
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
status you see the term quote Library
 
04:59:08.510 --> 04:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
users is already mentioned as being
 
04:59:12.470 --> 04:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
Exempted Exempted in section 4 of 91a
 
04:59:15.548 --> 04:59:15.558 align:start position:0%
colon 5 but apparently that term needs
 
04:59:15.558 --> 04:59:17.070 align:start position:0%
colon 5 but apparently that term needs
further

04:59:17.070 --> 04:59:17.080 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:59:19.470 --> 04:59:19.480 align:start position:0%
clarification this exemption Amendment
 
04:59:22.310 --> 04:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
came about because of a situation that
 
04:59:24.628 --> 04:59:24.638 align:start position:0%
happened in our town almost a year ago
 
04:59:28.470 --> 04:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
today during our Town's local election
 
04:59:30.628 --> 04:59:30.638 align:start position:0%
the wife of our select board chair
 
04:59:33.190 --> 04:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
decided to file a right to know with our
 
04:59:38.030 --> 04:59:38.040 align:start position:0%
gtown Public Library asking if the six
 
04:59:40.070 --> 04:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
candidates running for Library Board of
 
04:59:43.510 --> 04:59:43.520 align:start position:0%
trustees held library cards the library
 
04:59:46.230 --> 04:59:46.240 align:start position:0%
director consulted with our town lier
 
04:59:48.990 --> 04:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
lawyer whoops
 
04:59:51.750 --> 04:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
lawyer I I that was just I did not mean
 
04:59:55.190 --> 04:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:55.200 --> 04:59:58.510 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:59:58.510 --> 04:59:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:01.708 --> 05:00:01.718 align:start position:0%
sorry oh boy it's been a long day town
 
05:00:05.070 --> 05:00:05.080 align:start position:0%
lawyer who in turn directed them to not
 
05:00:07.750 --> 05:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
only answer the question of whether or
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
not the candidates held library card
 
05:00:14.470 --> 05:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
but to release the actual library cards
 
05:00:17.110 --> 05:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
via email to the person who filed the
 
05:00:20.190 --> 05:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
right to know after that person who
 
05:00:22.470 --> 05:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
filed the right to know received the
 
05:00:25.750 --> 05:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
library cards from the library director
 
05:00:28.788 --> 05:00:28.798 align:start position:0%
via email she proceeded to post the
 
05:00:32.628 --> 05:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
cards all over social media the cards
 
05:00:35.070 --> 05:00:35.080 align:start position:0%
originally included their Patron codes
 
05:00:36.788 --> 05:00:36.798 align:start position:0%
and other personal
 
05:00:39.190 --> 05:00:39.200 align:start position:0%
information apparently the lawyer did
 
05:00:41.788 --> 05:00:41.798 align:start position:0%
not see the right to no exemption that
 
05:00:45.750 --> 05:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
says records pertaining to library user
 
05:00:48.190 --> 05:00:48.200 align:start position:0%
as referencing library
 
05:00:51.190 --> 05:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
cards many in our community agreed that
 
05:00:53.310 --> 05:00:53.320 align:start position:0%
this was an egregious invasion of
 
05:00:56.470 --> 05:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
privacy and should never happen again
 
05:00:58.868 --> 05:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
some not all of the library Board of
 
05:01:02.110 --> 05:01:02.120 align:start position:0%
trustee members were very unhappy this
 
05:01:05.110 --> 05:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
happened and said the law needed more
 
05:01:08.788 --> 05:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
clarity so this is that people with
 
05:01:11.510 --> 05:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
personal vendettas shouldn't be able to
 
05:01:15.110 --> 05:01:15.120 align:start position:0%
weaponize private private library cards
 
05:01:17.670 --> 05:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
and children's private
 
05:01:20.948 --> 05:01:20.958 align:start position:0%
information I ask you to pass this small
 
05:01:23.230 --> 05:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
but important bill revision so that this
 
05:01:25.948 --> 05:01:25.958 align:start position:0%
won't happen again to
 
05:01:28.310 --> 05:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
anyone and I will take questions
 
05:01:31.708 --> 05:01:31.718 align:start position:0%
questions for yes representative
 
05:01:34.590 --> 05:01:34.600 align:start position:0%
Perez were these individuals running for
 
05:01:37.670 --> 05:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
Library trustee yes all of them were all
 
05:01:39.910 --> 05:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
six yes were all running for Library
 
05:01:44.110 --> 05:01:44.120 align:start position:0%
trustee yes is it part of their Charter
 
05:01:48.030 --> 05:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
your library trustees that you must be a
 
05:01:50.750 --> 05:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
um have a library card to run for that
 
05:01:53.350 --> 05:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
no okay thank
 
05:01:56.948 --> 05:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
you other questions for this witness so
 
05:01:59.270 --> 05:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know I guess I have a I have a a
 
05:02:02.990 --> 05:02:03.000 align:start position:0%
question you the um you said that the
 
05:02:05.590 --> 05:02:05.600 align:start position:0%
library cards and
 
05:02:08.310 --> 05:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I just I I I I don't live in your
 
05:02:09.868 --> 05:02:09.878 align:start position:0%
town but I just want to see what my
 
05:02:13.070 --> 05:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
library card says I
 
05:02:15.430 --> 05:02:15.440 align:start position:0%
don't I mean the biggest thing on it is
 
05:02:17.830 --> 05:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
has the patron code on
 
05:02:20.948 --> 05:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
it so it's it's a code that
 
05:02:24.430 --> 05:02:24.440 align:start position:0%
identifies that's very specific to the
 
05:02:27.590 --> 05:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
the person and you can actually use that
 
05:02:30.350 --> 05:02:30.360 align:start position:0%
information yes so you know I guess what
 
05:02:33.910 --> 05:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to ask you is is this
 
05:02:36.470 --> 05:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
um that's that's a I mean I completely
 
05:02:39.350 --> 05:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
agree that's a huge concern of that but
 
05:02:41.270 --> 05:02:41.280 align:start position:0%
is the
 
05:02:41.280 --> 05:02:42.910 align:start position:0%
is the
is

05:02:42.910 --> 05:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:02:46.628 --> 05:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
the is the mere fact that you have or do
 
05:02:48.868 --> 05:02:48.878 align:start position:0%
not have a library card something that
 
05:02:51.670 --> 05:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
you think should be protected um yes and
 
05:02:53.590 --> 05:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
there is someone else uh who will
 
05:02:56.430 --> 05:02:56.440 align:start position:0%
testify as to why there are other
 
05:02:59.670 --> 05:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
reasons um that library cards and
 
05:03:03.548 --> 05:03:03.558 align:start position:0%
membership status should not be a public
 
05:03:05.590 --> 05:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
thing that can be released just because
 
05:03:07.948 --> 05:03:07.958 align:start position:0%
someone asked for it and it does set a
 
05:03:10.190 --> 05:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
horrible precedent even I mentioned it
 
05:03:12.430 --> 05:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
briefly at the end in regards to
 
05:03:15.070 --> 05:03:15.080 align:start position:0%
Children you know what's to stop this
 
05:03:17.750 --> 05:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
just what's to stop this person from
 
05:03:20.390 --> 05:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
digging even more into let's say there's
 
05:03:22.390 --> 05:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
a family she didn't like and she wants
 
05:03:24.590 --> 05:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
to air in for like where where does
 
05:03:28.470 --> 05:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
where's the line drawn so um but there's
 
05:03:29.990 --> 05:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's going to be someone else that's
 
05:03:32.788 --> 05:03:32.798 align:start position:0%
testifying as to uh right and I guess I
 
05:03:34.470 --> 05:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
mean I I guess what I'm but the only
 
05:03:36.548 --> 05:03:36.558 align:start position:0%
thing I'm thinking is this if you put
 
05:03:39.350 --> 05:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
aside the like the the you know the
 
05:03:42.070 --> 05:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
information on the card number and stuff
 
05:03:45.510 --> 05:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
that like the the code and all that I
 
05:03:48.270 --> 05:03:48.280 align:start position:0%
mean I'm I'm just thinking I mean if I
 
05:03:51.190 --> 05:03:51.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be particularly the example
 
05:03:53.628 --> 05:03:53.638 align:start position:0%
that was just given if somebody is
 
05:03:55.590 --> 05:03:55.600 align:start position:0%
running for Library
 
05:03:58.310 --> 05:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
trustee wouldn't it be a
 
05:04:01.390 --> 05:04:01.400 align:start position:0%
legitimate political question for
 
05:04:02.788 --> 05:04:02.798 align:start position:0%
somebody to say well you know wait
 
05:04:03.830 --> 05:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
minute this person wants to be the
 
05:04:06.390 --> 05:04:06.400 align:start position:0%
library trustee but person doesn't even
 
05:04:09.070 --> 05:04:09.080 align:start position:0%
have a library card well that's the
 
05:04:11.030 --> 05:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
thing though
 
05:04:14.350 --> 05:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
I that's up for to you to decide but
 
05:04:16.590 --> 05:04:16.600 align:start position:0%
they they took that One Step Beyond that
 
05:04:19.830 --> 05:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
was the original question is if um you
 
05:04:22.990 --> 05:04:23.000 align:start position:0%
know I personally don't care if people
 
05:04:26.110 --> 05:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
know if I have one or not um others do
 
05:04:29.548 --> 05:04:29.558 align:start position:0%
though and it
 
05:04:32.430 --> 05:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
just it just the membership status
 
05:04:37.110 --> 05:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
situation is again um there's there's
 
05:04:39.270 --> 05:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
domestic violence situations where that
 
05:04:41.868 --> 05:04:41.878 align:start position:0%
could be become a real issue if you have
 
05:04:45.628 --> 05:04:45.638 align:start position:0%
someone start uh a person who abuses
 
05:04:48.590 --> 05:04:48.600 align:start position:0%
women his wife walking trying to find
 
05:04:50.708 --> 05:04:50.718 align:start position:0%
his wife and starts walking into towns
 
05:04:52.390 --> 05:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
and oo this is the first place I'm going
 
05:04:54.430 --> 05:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
to go and see if they have a library
 
05:04:57.350 --> 05:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
card like there's there's there's it's
 
05:04:59.430 --> 05:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
no one I don't see how it would be
 
05:05:01.910 --> 05:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
anyone's business regardless of whether
 
05:05:04.628 --> 05:05:04.638 align:start position:0%
you're running for office or not if you
 
05:05:07.868 --> 05:05:07.878 align:start position:0%
have a library card that you could have
 
05:05:09.670 --> 05:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
one elsewhere you could have one in
 
05:05:14.310 --> 05:05:14.320 align:start position:0%
another town um so it it that that to me
 
05:05:17.190 --> 05:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
and many others in our town like I I'm I
 
05:05:19.070 --> 05:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
am currently on the library Board of
 
05:05:25.270 --> 05:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
Trustees now so um and we they were many
 
05:05:27.190 --> 05:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
of them were not happy that that
 
05:05:30.030 --> 05:05:30.040 align:start position:0%
happened so but to go back the original
 
05:05:32.708 --> 05:05:32.718 align:start position:0%
question from the person that asked the
 
05:05:34.670 --> 05:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
in the right to know that she requested
 
05:05:37.990 --> 05:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
asked if the people running had Library
 
05:05:40.708 --> 05:05:40.718 align:start position:0%
carts okay but it then all of a sudden
 
05:05:42.670 --> 05:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
it became a hey not only do they have
 
05:05:45.350 --> 05:05:45.360 align:start position:0%
library cards here they are how did it
 
05:05:48.788 --> 05:05:48.798 align:start position:0%
go from asking the question if to and
 
05:05:51.750 --> 05:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
here's all their library cards it just
 
05:05:56.190 --> 05:05:56.200 align:start position:0%
it m it made no sense um and then yeah
 
05:05:58.230 --> 05:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
there's and the person that did that
 
05:06:03.030 --> 05:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
there's just a a lot of things like this
 
05:06:05.830 --> 05:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
that happened on a regular basis and
 
05:06:08.350 --> 05:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
just to stop as I mentioned the
 
05:06:12.070 --> 05:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
weaponization of private information um
 
05:06:14.548 --> 05:06:14.558 align:start position:0%
that that's going to prevent people from
 
05:06:16.350 --> 05:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
running for stuff in the future if they
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
know that their privacy is going to be
 
05:06:21.708 --> 05:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
infringed on um and and they're going to
 
05:06:24.070 --> 05:06:24.080 align:start position:0%
you know use it to go after people I
 
05:06:26.230 --> 05:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
would never vote for someone whether or
 
05:06:28.990 --> 05:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
not they had a library card or not um
 
05:06:30.868 --> 05:06:30.878 align:start position:0%
you know to me I want to know why
 
05:06:32.110 --> 05:06:32.120 align:start position:0%
they're running and what they're running
 
05:06:35.548 --> 05:06:35.558 align:start position:0%
for and that's what I vote for so um and
 
05:06:38.548 --> 05:06:38.558 align:start position:0%
I don't know that if I if that person
 
05:06:40.310 --> 05:06:40.320 align:start position:0%
has a library card some else good for
 
05:06:44.948 --> 05:06:44.958 align:start position:0%
them it's none of my business so yes yes
 
05:06:47.830 --> 05:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative petno thank you very much
 
05:06:50.230 --> 05:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
this really isn't specific to the
 
05:06:53.510 --> 05:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
library card per se but libraries are
 
05:06:57.150 --> 05:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
free correct yes so it would in a
 
05:06:58.510 --> 05:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
situation where somebody is running for
 
05:07:01.788 --> 05:07:01.798 align:start position:0%
Library trustee in particular you might
 
05:07:03.708 --> 05:07:03.718 align:start position:0%
go to the library every day but not have
 
05:07:05.270 --> 05:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
a library card because you might sit and
 
05:07:07.788 --> 05:07:07.798 align:start position:0%
read the magazine the periodic people do
 
05:07:09.628 --> 05:07:09.638 align:start position:0%
that so yeah you could be a regular
 
05:07:11.868 --> 05:07:11.878 align:start position:0%
Patron so the fact in the particular
 
05:07:12.868 --> 05:07:12.878 align:start position:0%
situation where you're running for a
 
05:07:15.070 --> 05:07:15.080 align:start position:0%
library trustee it might not matter
 
05:07:17.150 --> 05:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
would would you agree with that might
 
05:07:18.868 --> 05:07:18.878 align:start position:0%
not matter it might not matter that you
 
05:07:20.708 --> 05:07:20.718 align:start position:0%
have a library card like that you're a
 
05:07:23.628 --> 05:07:23.638 align:start position:0%
regular patron of the library even
 
05:07:25.948 --> 05:07:25.958 align:start position:0%
exactly representative Bon and then
 
05:07:25.958 --> 05:07:29.190 align:start position:0%
exactly representative Bon and then
representative

05:07:29.190 --> 05:07:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:32.590 --> 05:07:32.600 align:start position:0%
alexand thank you chair Mr
 
05:07:35.310 --> 05:07:35.320 align:start position:0%
chair my kids got a library card when
 
05:07:37.948 --> 05:07:37.958 align:start position:0%
they could write and at this point they
 
05:07:41.070 --> 05:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
can probably still use that card but um
 
05:07:43.270 --> 05:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
let's say they were under 18 would I
 
05:07:46.430 --> 05:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
have to sort of take because I always to
 
05:07:48.430 --> 05:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
sort of not took control they had them
 
05:07:51.470 --> 05:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
all but at one point in time are kids
 
05:07:53.910 --> 05:07:53.920 align:start position:0%
identities are you suggesting that all
 
05:07:58.430 --> 05:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
of that be not available to the public I
 
05:08:00.670 --> 05:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
don't think someone should be able to
 
05:08:03.070 --> 05:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
like let's say uh you know my sister who
 
05:08:05.030 --> 05:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
has children that someone could say I I
 
05:08:07.470 --> 05:08:07.480 align:start position:0%
want to see all the library cards of of
 
05:08:10.470 --> 05:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
that person's children they're not my
 
05:08:13.110 --> 05:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know that why why would you want to
 
05:08:16.430 --> 05:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
do that number one um but this sets the
 
05:08:18.750 --> 05:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
precedent that they could I mean the
 
05:08:21.590 --> 05:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
current apparently the current law but
 
05:08:24.948 --> 05:08:24.958 align:start position:0%
keep in mind the current law does make a
 
05:08:27.708 --> 05:08:27.718 align:start position:0%
reference to records pertaining to
 
05:08:30.110 --> 05:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
library user
 
05:08:33.230 --> 05:08:33.240 align:start position:0%
so why would why would Library their
 
05:08:35.948 --> 05:08:35.958 align:start position:0%
cards which is part of I would think a
 
05:08:37.750 --> 05:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
person's Library
 
05:08:40.548 --> 05:08:40.558 align:start position:0%
record why would that not be part of the
 
05:08:42.750 --> 05:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
exemption so but
 
05:08:45.628 --> 05:08:45.638 align:start position:0%
apparently that's why I did this is to
 
05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
bring Clarity to the law because I was
 
05:08:54.230 --> 05:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
told that the term Library user was not
 
05:08:54.240 --> 05:08:55.670 align:start position:0%
told that the term Library user was not
good

05:08:55.670 --> 05:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
good
 
05:08:59.230 --> 05:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
enough followup yes please I just I just
 
05:09:01.670 --> 05:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask about I'm not going to ask
 
05:09:03.070 --> 05:09:03.080 align:start position:0%
you things about restrictions how long
 
05:09:04.750 --> 05:09:04.760 align:start position:0%
does a card I just wanted to know if my
 
05:09:08.708 --> 05:09:08.718 align:start position:0%
kids cards are still good but no but um
 
05:09:10.628 --> 05:09:10.638 align:start position:0%
I guess if this point in
 
05:09:10.638 --> 05:09:13.110 align:start position:0%
I guess if this point in
time

05:09:13.110 --> 05:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:09:15.070 --> 05:09:15.080 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I'm just trying to
 
05:09:17.270 --> 05:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
protect them as well I don't know if
 
05:09:19.830 --> 05:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
there's any protecting protection
 
05:09:23.590 --> 05:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
measures for under 18 under 16 I don't
 
05:09:26.070 --> 05:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
know what no that's all that you see in
 
05:09:28.510 --> 05:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
that law and I have it you know right
 
05:09:31.350 --> 05:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
here there's no age limits on anything
 
05:09:34.750 --> 05:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
in the current law it just says you know
 
05:09:37.548 --> 05:09:37.558 align:start position:0%
um and and these records are Exempted
 
05:09:40.390 --> 05:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
from right to know record pertaining to
 
05:09:43.030 --> 05:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
library user that's all it says right
 
05:09:47.230 --> 05:09:47.240 align:start position:0%
now now there is an R RSA 2011 Deco in
 
05:09:50.750 --> 05:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
11 which um which references
 
05:09:54.350 --> 05:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
Library users and records as well and I
 
05:09:56.150 --> 05:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
have a separate bill on
 
05:10:00.670 --> 05:10:00.680 align:start position:0%
that um just to kind of lock this up so
 
05:10:03.628 --> 05:10:03.638 align:start position:0%
that um you know people's privacy I'm
 
05:10:05.868 --> 05:10:05.878 align:start position:0%
just a huge proponent of privacy and
 
05:10:08.948 --> 05:10:08.958 align:start position:0%
this to me just went took it to a level
 
05:10:11.430 --> 05:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
that I and many others couldn't actually
 
05:10:13.868 --> 05:10:13.878 align:start position:0%
believe that person went to that
 
05:10:16.910 --> 05:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
level other question representative
 
05:10:20.390 --> 05:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
trip uh thank you for uh taking my
 
05:10:20.400 --> 05:10:24.390 align:start position:0%
trip uh thank you for uh taking my
question

05:10:24.390 --> 05:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:29.430 --> 05:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh since they were since the person that
 
05:10:31.868 --> 05:10:31.878 align:start position:0%
made the 91a
 
05:10:36.830 --> 05:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
request uh simply ask do they have cards
 
05:10:40.868 --> 05:10:40.878 align:start position:0%
M you know so uh do you know who gave
 
05:10:45.708 --> 05:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
the cards numbers to that person well
 
05:10:48.110 --> 05:10:48.120 align:start position:0%
when when the library cards were emailed
 
05:10:49.948 --> 05:10:49.958 align:start position:0%
to the person who filed the right to
 
05:10:53.190 --> 05:10:53.200 align:start position:0%
know originally like the the numbers do
 
05:10:55.070 --> 05:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
you mean Patron codes they're right
 
05:10:58.430 --> 05:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
there on the cards so so they were the
 
05:11:00.708 --> 05:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
actual like pictures of their cards oh
 
05:11:04.110 --> 05:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
were emailed so you know the uh the the
 
05:11:09.548 --> 05:11:09.558 align:start position:0%
thing that I find uh uh annoying is that
 
05:11:12.830 --> 05:11:12.840 align:start position:0%
uh were the
 
05:11:16.548 --> 05:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
uh back in 911 they they started
 
05:11:20.670 --> 05:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
researching people's Library uh history
 
05:11:23.310 --> 05:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
to see if they were terrorist you know
 
05:11:25.070 --> 05:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
do do you think that anything like that
 
05:11:28.350 --> 05:11:28.360 align:start position:0%
happened now there are other exceptions
 
05:11:31.788 --> 05:11:31.798 align:start position:0%
so so you can ask let's say that person
 
05:11:34.030 --> 05:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
is under investigation for something or
 
05:11:37.150 --> 05:11:37.160 align:start position:0%
a subpoena is filed that information can
 
05:11:40.830 --> 05:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
be released so that fall
 
05:11:43.708 --> 05:11:43.718 align:start position:0%
um you know outside of this exe this
 
05:11:46.190 --> 05:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
particular section of the exemption so
 
05:11:48.948 --> 05:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
there are situations where you can if
 
05:11:51.150 --> 05:11:51.160 align:start position:0%
someone like I said is is under
 
05:11:53.628 --> 05:11:53.638 align:start position:0%
investigation by the law or whatever if
 
05:11:55.510 --> 05:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
they have a subpoena they can they can
 
05:11:57.590 --> 05:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
they can access that information so
 
05:12:00.750 --> 05:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
there are you know but this wasn't
 
05:12:03.628 --> 05:12:03.638 align:start position:0%
that we weren't under investigation for
 
05:12:06.070 --> 05:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
anything so oh you were one of the
 
05:12:09.270 --> 05:12:09.280 align:start position:0%
people that had the card
 
05:12:12.590 --> 05:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
emailed to the requester well I was one
 
05:12:15.670 --> 05:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
of the people that didn't have a card oh
 
05:12:19.470 --> 05:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
so yeah isn't that yeah and I I don't it
 
05:12:21.310 --> 05:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
didn't bother me at all because I used
 
05:12:23.310 --> 05:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
to have a card I let it go during a
 
05:12:25.350 --> 05:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
certain period of
 
05:12:28.150 --> 05:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
time you know but and that doesn't
 
05:12:30.670 --> 05:12:30.680 align:start position:0%
bother me at all but it Bo but it
 
05:12:33.310 --> 05:12:33.320 align:start position:0%
bothers a lot of other people it it's
 
05:12:37.628 --> 05:12:37.638 align:start position:0%
when this happened um you know there are
 
05:12:39.750 --> 05:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
a certain
 
05:12:42.070 --> 05:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh Community there's a community in our
 
05:12:45.310 --> 05:12:45.320 align:start position:0%
town that was really bothered by this
 
05:12:50.990 --> 05:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
overreach of um privacy Invasion um and
 
05:12:53.990 --> 05:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
number one no no library card releasing
 
05:12:55.628 --> 05:12:55.638 align:start position:0%
and number two it's none of your
 
05:12:58.350 --> 05:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
business if I have a library card or not
 
05:13:01.350 --> 05:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
but I owned I owned that fact proudly
 
05:13:04.310 --> 05:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
but many others don't and don't want to
 
05:13:06.548 --> 05:13:06.558 align:start position:0%
so that's up to that person though that
 
05:13:09.868 --> 05:13:09.878 align:start position:0%
is information and a status that belongs
 
05:13:12.708 --> 05:13:12.718 align:start position:0%
to that person and it's there's no other
 
05:13:14.948 --> 05:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
there's no good reason why it doesn't
 
05:13:16.548 --> 05:13:16.558 align:start position:0%
matter if you're running for library or
 
05:13:21.708 --> 05:13:21.718 align:start position:0%
not um and I still got elected so yeah
 
05:13:23.990 --> 05:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
so it didn't obviously it didn't matter
 
05:13:26.788 --> 05:13:26.798 align:start position:0%
to many people
 
05:13:28.990 --> 05:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
yeah other question representative
 
05:13:31.190 --> 05:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair thank you
 
05:13:32.910 --> 05:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
so much um to my State Rep for taking my
 
05:13:36.230 --> 05:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
question um I am wondering based on the
 
05:13:38.470 --> 05:13:38.480 align:start position:0%
interpretation of how the Gown Library
 
05:13:41.150 --> 05:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
interpreted um RSA 9185 specifically
 
05:13:44.948 --> 05:13:44.958 align:start position:0%
Library user could I take a list of all
 
05:13:46.948 --> 05:13:46.958 align:start position:0%
people in gtown that registered to vote
 
05:13:49.270 --> 05:13:49.280 align:start position:0%
and voted in November 5th and then
 
05:13:52.430 --> 05:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
request a 91a on their library cards see
 
05:13:54.110 --> 05:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
how many people that voted in November
 
05:13:56.708 --> 05:13:56.718 align:start position:0%
5th have a library card 100% thank you
 
05:13:59.470 --> 05:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
that's a thank you very helpful there's
 
05:14:02.430 --> 05:14:02.440 align:start position:0%
no limits to what can be done with this
 
05:14:05.948 --> 05:14:05.958 align:start position:0%
right now so and that's what this is now
 
05:14:09.670 --> 05:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
is just there are some things that um
 
05:14:11.590 --> 05:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
and you know you can see it's probably
 
05:14:13.708 --> 05:14:13.718 align:start position:0%
10 10 words that I added to the
 
05:14:16.230 --> 05:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
amendment just to make it just to
 
05:14:20.390 --> 05:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
clarify that Library user includes your
 
05:14:22.548 --> 05:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
library card and whether or not you have
 
05:14:25.230 --> 05:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
one other questions yeah yes
 
05:14:26.350 --> 05:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
representative Perez and then
 
05:14:26.360 --> 05:14:27.590 align:start position:0%
representative Perez and then
representative

05:14:27.590 --> 05:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:14:30.350 --> 05:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
hgan if I'm running for Budget Committee
 
05:14:35.350 --> 05:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
in your town do they check and see if um
 
05:14:37.230 --> 05:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
I have a bank
 
05:14:39.470 --> 05:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
account I mean what what was the
 
05:14:41.708 --> 05:14:41.718 align:start position:0%
rationale behind doing that just to be
 
05:14:44.470 --> 05:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
nasty do is that how you feel it was and
 
05:14:47.110 --> 05:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
you got elected even though you were one
 
05:14:49.510 --> 05:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
who did not have a card it's interesting
 
05:14:52.270 --> 05:14:52.280 align:start position:0%
because this just came up at our library
 
05:14:54.750 --> 05:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
trustees that they wanted to know which
 
05:14:56.990 --> 05:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
one of the trustees had a library card
 
05:14:58.910 --> 05:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
and one of the trustees said that's
 
05:15:01.788 --> 05:15:01.798 align:start position:0%
nobody's business so yep agre
 
05:15:05.230 --> 05:15:05.240 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan um this
 
05:15:09.030 --> 05:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
probably would um would a uh town be
 
05:15:11.948 --> 05:15:11.958 align:start position:0%
able to make a rule that uh Library
 
05:15:14.070 --> 05:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
trustee candidates as a qualification
 
05:15:17.270 --> 05:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
had to be library card holders and or
 
05:15:19.590 --> 05:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
make make a rule that they get a library
 
05:15:20.910 --> 05:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
card if they don't already have one
 
05:15:23.628 --> 05:15:23.638 align:start position:0%
because I is that was
 
05:15:27.190 --> 05:15:27.200 align:start position:0%
that yeah yeah that would not be
 
05:15:28.830 --> 05:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
disallowed by the current law or this
 
05:15:32.750 --> 05:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
law you thinking yeah yeah yeah so I I
 
05:15:35.310 --> 05:15:35.320 align:start position:0%
guess other questions so I guess I'm I
 
05:15:36.750 --> 05:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
mean I just to sort of carry this
 
05:15:39.670 --> 05:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
through and I I I mean I'm I am
 
05:15:43.548 --> 05:15:43.558 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to the bill in the way the
 
05:15:46.070 --> 05:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
issues you rais but I just to follow up
 
05:15:49.270 --> 05:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
on this so if I mean if if I'm running
 
05:15:52.350 --> 05:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
for Library trustee and you know I have
 
05:15:52.360 --> 05:15:53.150 align:start position:0%
for Library trustee and you know I have
an

05:15:53.150 --> 05:15:53.160 align:start position:0%
an
 
05:15:55.350 --> 05:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
opponent do you think that it would not
 
05:15:57.868 --> 05:15:57.878 align:start position:0%
be an appropriate question at a forum
 
05:16:00.868 --> 05:16:00.878 align:start position:0%
for example for a voter to say hey Lynn
 
05:16:02.230 --> 05:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
you're running for Library trustee do
 
05:16:03.910 --> 05:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
you have a do you have a library card at
 
05:16:05.310 --> 05:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
your at the library you're running for
 
05:16:07.070 --> 05:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
trust VI sure they could do that but
 
05:16:09.948 --> 05:16:09.958 align:start position:0%
then it's then it's up to them to answer
 
05:16:11.628 --> 05:16:11.638 align:start position:0%
that question someone's not going to
 
05:16:14.270 --> 05:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
answer that for I don't want anyone I I
 
05:16:15.868 --> 05:16:15.878 align:start position:0%
understand but I guess the point is that
 
05:16:17.628 --> 05:16:17.638 align:start position:0%
what my point would be that it is
 
05:16:20.150 --> 05:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
relevant it is a relevant question if
 
05:16:22.548 --> 05:16:22.558 align:start position:0%
I'm running for Library trustee whether
 
05:16:25.150 --> 05:16:25.160 align:start position:0%
I have a library C it's not the end of
 
05:16:27.070 --> 05:16:27.080 align:start position:0%
the issue it may not be that doesn't
 
05:16:29.110 --> 05:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
mean if I don't have one I this specific
 
05:16:31.590 --> 05:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
to write to no request this isn't just
 
05:16:33.670 --> 05:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
I'm attending a candidates night and
 
05:16:35.708 --> 05:16:35.718 align:start position:0%
someone's asking me that question this
 
05:16:38.628 --> 05:16:38.638 align:start position:0%
is specific to the right to know law
 
05:16:40.990 --> 05:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
that you know so someone submits a right
 
05:16:43.830 --> 05:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
to know um and and you can see though
 
05:16:47.190 --> 05:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
even though they asked for membership
 
05:16:50.270 --> 05:16:50.280 align:start position:0%
status it they took it well beyond that
 
05:16:52.708 --> 05:16:52.718 align:start position:0%
right so that's why we're we're pushing
 
05:16:55.590 --> 05:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
the line further back to no actually
 
05:16:58.510 --> 05:16:58.520 align:start position:0%
none of this is anyone's business um and
 
05:17:00.430 --> 05:17:00.440 align:start position:0%
if they want to ask them that private
 
05:17:02.190 --> 05:17:02.200 align:start position:0%
question or a public question in a
 
05:17:04.390 --> 05:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
different Arena that's up to them and
 
05:17:05.788 --> 05:17:05.798 align:start position:0%
it's up to that candidate whether they
 
05:17:08.070 --> 05:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
want to answer that or not it shouldn't
 
05:17:09.628 --> 05:17:09.638 align:start position:0%
no one should be making that decision
 
05:17:11.708 --> 05:17:11.718 align:start position:0%
for them all right other questions for
 
05:17:14.150 --> 05:17:14.160 align:start position:0%

I'm a voter in town in Goth toown um and
 
05:17:59.150 --> 05:17:59.160 align:start position:0%
the library is very important to me I'm
 
05:18:01.548 --> 05:18:01.558 align:start position:0%
not super comfortable um doing this kind
 
05:18:04.310 --> 05:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
of thing um I did have written testimony
 
05:18:06.670 --> 05:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
but um some of the things that were
 
05:18:09.070 --> 05:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
already discussed um I'm going to jump
 
05:18:12.150 --> 05:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
around and address it um I first want to
 
05:18:13.910 --> 05:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
tell you that I'm not a lawyer and I
 
05:18:17.750 --> 05:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
have no legal background um I did read a
 
05:18:19.788 --> 05:18:19.798 align:start position:0%
lot of the documentation around the
 
05:18:22.948 --> 05:18:22.958 align:start position:0%
events most of this is posted online um
 
05:18:25.470 --> 05:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
and not online like on Facebook but on
 
05:18:27.708 --> 05:18:27.718 align:start position:0%
the town website and the libraries
 
05:18:31.110 --> 05:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
website um the events surrounding the
 
05:18:33.670 --> 05:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
things that were discussed um and in
 
05:18:36.868 --> 05:18:36.878 align:start position:0%
that um you will see a legal opinion
 
05:18:39.190 --> 05:18:39.200 align:start position:0%
that very much explains some of the
 
05:18:42.670 --> 05:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
questions that were coming up um in my
 
05:18:44.628 --> 05:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
written testimony here I have there will
 
05:18:46.548 --> 05:18:46.558 align:start position:0%
likely be discussion here about the
 
05:18:49.350 --> 05:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
actual card being revealed um the
 
05:18:52.190 --> 05:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
attorney in his response to the
 
05:18:55.070 --> 05:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
library's request for legal counsel on
 
05:18:59.390 --> 05:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
the the 91a request said that the it
 
05:19:03.030 --> 05:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
cannot be a yes or no question the the
 
05:19:05.390 --> 05:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
the library is not able to say yes this
 
05:19:07.310 --> 05:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
person has a card or no this person
 
05:19:10.230 --> 05:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a card they can only the
 
05:19:14.390 --> 05:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
the uh 91a is only for actual government
 
05:19:17.548 --> 05:19:17.558 align:start position:0%
records and the actual government record
 
05:19:21.070 --> 05:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
is the card okay so I hopefully that
 
05:19:23.590 --> 05:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
will clear up some of the questions that
 
05:19:25.910 --> 05:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
came up and again this was one lawyer's
 
05:19:28.510 --> 05:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
opinion and I'm not a lawyer but I um
 
05:19:31.670 --> 05:19:31.680 align:start position:0%
encourage you to um read the full
 
05:19:33.510 --> 05:19:33.520 align:start position:0%
communication that is posted it's a
 
05:19:34.830 --> 05:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
March 12th
 
05:19:38.030 --> 05:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
2024 press release um from the town of
 
05:19:40.470 --> 05:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
gtown it's posted on the town website as
 
05:19:45.670 --> 05:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:48.910 --> 05:19:48.920 align:start position:0%
um uh so hopefully that clears that up I
 
05:19:53.350 --> 05:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
am not clear on what I heard about um
 
05:19:56.230 --> 05:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
being able to access any information
 
05:20:00.708 --> 05:20:00.718 align:start position:0%
with a picture of my card um my card the
 
05:20:02.150 --> 05:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
front of it just has the golf town
 
05:20:04.390 --> 05:20:04.400 align:start position:0%
library logo the back of it yes it has a
 
05:20:07.628 --> 05:20:07.638 align:start position:0%
number on it but um I have a pin that
 
05:20:09.470 --> 05:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
goes with that so so I don't know how
 
05:20:12.708 --> 05:20:12.718 align:start position:0%
any information could be accessed um
 
05:20:16.150 --> 05:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
with just that code that was revealed um
 
05:20:18.628 --> 05:20:18.638 align:start position:0%
I don't agree with whoever posted it on
 
05:20:20.510 --> 05:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
Facebook I I don't agree with that at
 
05:20:24.030 --> 05:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
all but um the library did comply with
 
05:20:26.430 --> 05:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
the law and sought legal counsel for
 
05:20:26.440 --> 05:20:27.910 align:start position:0%
the law and sought legal counsel for
that

05:20:27.910 --> 05:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:30.270 --> 05:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
um and hopefully I'm I'm not taking up
 
05:20:31.868 --> 05:20:31.878 align:start position:0%
too much time but the purpose of the
 
05:20:34.270 --> 05:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
right to know is to provide transparency
 
05:20:36.030 --> 05:20:36.040 align:start position:0%
to the public about government agencies
 
05:20:37.990 --> 05:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
and their work and the library public
 
05:20:39.670 --> 05:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
libraries are kind of unique in that
 
05:20:41.788 --> 05:20:41.798 align:start position:0%
they're run by a Board of Trustees
 
05:20:45.030 --> 05:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
they're not run by um you know the town
 
05:20:48.270 --> 05:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
so they elect um trustees and as a voter
 
05:20:50.628 --> 05:20:50.638 align:start position:0%
yes that's very pertinent information to
 
05:20:54.270 --> 05:20:54.280 align:start position:0%
me uh whether or not the the um person
 
05:20:56.750 --> 05:20:56.760 align:start position:0%
the candidate has a library card or not
 
05:20:58.310 --> 05:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
and it really should be a very simple
 
05:21:00.230 --> 05:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
thing that someone uh just mentioned
 
05:21:02.070 --> 05:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
like can't we just ask the candidate
 
05:21:04.990 --> 05:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
well yes we can try that um but I do
 
05:21:07.670 --> 05:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
want you to know that um four of the
 
05:21:09.948 --> 05:21:09.958 align:start position:0%
sponsors all of the sponsors on this
 
05:21:13.030 --> 05:21:13.040 align:start position:0%
bill are go from gtown and only from
 
05:21:15.310 --> 05:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
gtown and I would hope that would
 
05:21:18.190 --> 05:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps flag some caution on your behalf
 
05:21:21.030 --> 05:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
and perhaps um do some deeper
 
05:21:23.190 --> 05:21:23.200 align:start position:0%
investigation four of the sponsors of
 
05:21:25.868 --> 05:21:25.878 align:start position:0%
this Bill had Direct um interactions
 
05:21:27.788 --> 05:21:27.798 align:start position:0%
over the past year year and a half with
 
05:21:30.190 --> 05:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
the library specifically including
 
05:21:32.230 --> 05:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
requesting the resignation of the board
 
05:21:35.070 --> 05:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
chair um openly and publicly stating
 
05:21:36.910 --> 05:21:36.920 align:start position:0%
that the library had broken the law when
 
05:21:40.590 --> 05:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
it had not and most recently um two of
 
05:21:44.310 --> 05:21:44.320 align:start position:0%
the sponsors sued the library um and
 
05:21:45.868 --> 05:21:45.878 align:start position:0%
that brings me to the point of asking
 
05:21:47.868 --> 05:21:47.878 align:start position:0%
the question the Ros Berry and Keith
 
05:21:50.708 --> 05:21:50.718 align:start position:0%
Murphy sued the gtown public library
 
05:21:52.390 --> 05:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
because the library was providing a
 
05:21:53.708 --> 05:21:53.718 align:start position:0%
public service that they have done
 
05:21:56.270 --> 05:21:56.280 align:start position:0%
multiple times in printing a candidate
 
05:21:59.190 --> 05:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
brochure the they throw out questions to
 
05:22:01.590 --> 05:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
the candidates the candidates respond
 
05:22:03.470 --> 05:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
they are printed oned Mr chair I'm
 
05:22:04.948 --> 05:22:04.958 align:start position:0%
unsure how this testimony has to relate
 
05:22:08.230 --> 05:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
to this specific bill um I can get to
 
05:22:11.788 --> 05:22:11.798 align:start position:0%
that because the um the people decided
 
05:22:14.150 --> 05:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
not to answer the questions they just
 
05:22:15.590 --> 05:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
didn't answer the questions so going
 
05:22:17.030 --> 05:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
back to shouldn't it be a simple matter
 
05:22:18.708 --> 05:22:18.718 align:start position:0%
of does the trustee candidate have a
 
05:22:21.230 --> 05:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
library card um they if they choose not
 
05:22:22.910 --> 05:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
to answer the question there should be a
 
05:22:27.070 --> 05:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
way for um the public to have that
 
05:22:28.430 --> 05:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
information that I think is very
 
05:22:32.070 --> 05:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
pertinent um in addition you know the
 
05:22:34.470 --> 05:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
library is a public building as it was
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh addressed and and mentioned and
 
05:22:39.628 --> 05:22:39.638 align:start position:0%
anybody could sit in the library and
 
05:22:41.190 --> 05:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
yeah you know you might see someone
 
05:22:42.670 --> 05:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
reading magazines and don't know whether
 
05:22:45.628 --> 05:22:45.638 align:start position:0%
they have a card or not but um you will
 
05:22:48.030 --> 05:22:48.040 align:start position:0%
see people check out at the circulation
 
05:22:49.670 --> 05:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
desk and hand their card and then a
 
05:22:51.310 --> 05:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
person can just sit there and keep track
 
05:22:55.510 --> 05:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
of who has a card um so the the library
 
05:22:58.670 --> 05:22:58.680 align:start position:0%
card itself is not a privacy issue
 
05:23:01.590 --> 05:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
because you're in a public library and
 
05:23:03.070 --> 05:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
it's very
 
05:23:06.310 --> 05:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
public so having the card is not the
 
05:23:08.990 --> 05:23:09.000 align:start position:0%
issue releasing information connected to
 
05:23:10.350 --> 05:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
the card how you use the card the
 
05:23:12.070 --> 05:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
materials you borrow yeah that's a whole
 
05:23:14.150 --> 05:23:14.160 align:start position:0%
different matter but that was not
 
05:23:17.230 --> 05:23:17.240 align:start position:0%
revealed um and so I I just caution you
 
05:23:19.510 --> 05:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
that asking for an exemption under this
 
05:23:23.070 --> 05:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
right to no law is is a huge ask and I I
 
05:23:24.510 --> 05:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
hope that you will weigh it very
 
05:23:26.670 --> 05:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
carefully and consider all the perhaps
 
05:23:28.670 --> 05:23:28.680 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences that may fall
 
05:23:31.190 --> 05:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
from that as well as you know a legal
 
05:23:34.230 --> 05:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
thing saying that you are denying uh
 
05:23:36.670 --> 05:23:36.680 align:start position:0%
government records um I'm a fierce
 
05:23:39.590 --> 05:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
advocate of privacy
 
05:23:41.628 --> 05:23:41.638 align:start position:0%
but I don't feel this uh releasing
 
05:23:44.628 --> 05:23:44.638 align:start position:0%
whether someone has a card or not is um
 
05:23:47.470 --> 05:23:47.480 align:start position:0%
a matter of privacy um it will open up
 
05:23:50.150 --> 05:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
subsequent legal questions and I guess
 
05:23:53.470 --> 05:23:53.480 align:start position:0%
lastly I I I and getting to how this
 
05:23:55.110 --> 05:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
relates you know I find it troubling
 
05:23:57.430 --> 05:23:57.440 align:start position:0%
that Lisa Meer in her candidacy for
 
05:23:59.910 --> 05:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
Library trustee in our town emphasized
 
05:24:01.830 --> 05:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
the need to being transparent bringing
 
05:24:04.670 --> 05:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
transparency to the library and Mr Barry
 
05:24:07.548 --> 05:24:07.558 align:start position:0%
I'm not I I really am not clear on how
 
05:24:10.350 --> 05:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
you know s getting into the details of a
 
05:24:12.230 --> 05:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
particular thing is is relevant here
 
05:24:14.910 --> 05:24:14.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay I apologize um I just feel
 
05:24:19.310 --> 05:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
that um they have um pursued Freedom of
 
05:24:21.708 --> 05:24:21.718 align:start position:0%
Information requests feeling that there
 
05:24:23.350 --> 05:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
a lot of that information is public
 
05:24:25.030 --> 05:24:25.040 align:start position:0%
including who submitted the questions on
 
05:24:26.830 --> 05:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
the candidate brochure but yet they're
 
05:24:28.750 --> 05:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
sponsoring a bill that is trying to
 
05:24:32.350 --> 05:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
limit transparency by um not allowing
 
05:24:35.708 --> 05:24:35.718 align:start position:0%
people to know who has a Liber card um
 
05:24:37.990 --> 05:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
and lastly I I think since Joe was
 
05:24:39.910 --> 05:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
direct involved in much of the above I
 
05:24:42.070 --> 05:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
think he should recuse himself from the
 
05:24:44.150 --> 05:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
discussion of the vote on this bill for
 
05:24:47.390 --> 05:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
the committee all right um any questions
 
05:24:49.310 --> 05:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
for this yes representative alexand
 
05:24:51.430 --> 05:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank you um chairman Lynn and thank you
 
05:24:53.750 --> 05:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um my question is
 
05:24:56.548 --> 05:24:56.558 align:start position:0%
regarding if you believe that the
 
05:24:58.708 --> 05:24:58.718 align:start position:0%
library card of victims of domestic
 
05:25:00.990 --> 05:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
violence such as myself should be
 
05:25:03.510 --> 05:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
disclosed to the public and if that is a
 
05:25:06.788 --> 05:25:06.798 align:start position:0%
safety concern is yes or
 
05:25:10.788 --> 05:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
no I'm not clear on the connection as to
 
05:25:12.868 --> 05:25:12.878 align:start position:0%
knowing whether you have a library card
 
05:25:15.548 --> 05:25:15.558 align:start position:0%
how that could possibly connect to
 
05:25:18.628 --> 05:25:18.638 align:start position:0%
domestic violence and forgive me if
 
05:25:21.230 --> 05:25:21.240 align:start position:0%
I'm if I'm not going there and I don't
 
05:25:23.548 --> 05:25:23.558 align:start position:0%
understand the connection thank you
 
05:25:25.868 --> 05:25:25.878 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness yes
 
05:25:28.548 --> 05:25:28.558 align:start position:0%
representative Perez are you aware that
 
05:25:30.590 --> 05:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
this is just a
 
05:25:34.788 --> 05:25:34.798 align:start position:0%
clarification of an existing law the law
 
05:25:37.110 --> 05:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
says I don't know the exact words but
 
05:25:39.270 --> 05:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
the law basically says say that you
 
05:25:43.750 --> 05:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
can't disclose Library users it's
 
05:25:46.270 --> 05:25:46.280 align:start position:0%
clarification which is something that we
 
05:25:49.150 --> 05:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
frequently do we had several bills this
 
05:25:51.788 --> 05:25:51.798 align:start position:0%
morning for clarification on Citizen and
 
05:25:53.470 --> 05:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
different things are you aware that
 
05:25:56.868 --> 05:25:56.878 align:start position:0%
there is already a law that says this
 
05:25:58.948 --> 05:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
basically should not have been done and
 
05:26:02.110 --> 05:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
this is a clarification of it well I I
 
05:26:04.190 --> 05:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's clear that it
 
05:26:05.548 --> 05:26:05.558 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been done because and
 
05:26:07.590 --> 05:26:07.600 align:start position:0%
again I'm not a lawyer so I think the
 
05:26:10.150 --> 05:26:10.160 align:start position:0%
committee needs that legal opinion the
 
05:26:12.788 --> 05:26:12.798 align:start position:0%
actual card is a government record and
 
05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
under the Freedom of Information that's
 
05:26:17.948 --> 05:26:17.958 align:start position:0%
available to the public so I'm not a
 
05:26:20.830 --> 05:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
lawyer I just read the legal
 
05:26:24.310 --> 05:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
opinion other questions seeing none
 
05:26:28.948 --> 05:26:28.958 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um next uh uh Henry
 
05:26:28.958 --> 05:26:29.990 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um next uh uh Henry
uh

05:26:29.990 --> 05:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:26:43.190 --> 05:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:45.510 --> 05:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
cool thank you Mr chair honorable
 
05:26:47.230 --> 05:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh for record I'm
 
05:26:49.070 --> 05:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
representative Henry gason gtown
 
05:26:51.670 --> 05:26:51.680 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 29th District uh I want to
 
05:26:55.670 --> 05:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
approach this from a Safety and Security
 
05:26:59.310 --> 05:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
standpoint um so I recognize that the
 
05:27:01.190 --> 05:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
law was applied the way the law was
 
05:27:03.230 --> 05:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
interpreted and I'm not refuting
 
05:27:05.230 --> 05:27:05.240 align:start position:0%
anything that has already happened I
 
05:27:07.708 --> 05:27:07.718 align:start position:0%
think that the importance of this law um
 
05:27:09.390 --> 05:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
which has been touched on Once by
 
05:27:10.750 --> 05:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander once by
 
05:27:14.270 --> 05:27:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative Maser is that this is the
 
05:27:16.190 --> 05:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
only government agency that I know of
 
05:27:18.350 --> 05:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
where I can do a right to request and I
 
05:27:20.470 --> 05:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
can figure out exactly where you are I
 
05:27:23.110 --> 05:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
can't walk up to the DMV and request
 
05:27:26.030 --> 05:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
your driver's license I can't go to the
 
05:27:27.670 --> 05:27:27.680 align:start position:0%
schools and request the names of the
 
05:27:29.708 --> 05:27:29.718 align:start position:0%
children going to those schools but I
 
05:27:32.390 --> 05:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
can go to the library and I can find out
 
05:27:33.670 --> 05:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not you're a registered
 
05:27:36.270 --> 05:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
member of that Library locally now in a
 
05:27:38.670 --> 05:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
domestic violence circumstance where
 
05:27:41.070 --> 05:27:41.080 align:start position:0%
partner possibly with children has
 
05:27:43.310 --> 05:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
relocated and does not want to be found
 
05:27:47.510 --> 05:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
by the offender an offender
 
05:27:51.628 --> 05:27:51.638 align:start position:0%
could um WR to know find out whether or
 
05:27:53.910 --> 05:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
not that family is registered in the
 
05:27:56.350 --> 05:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
library possibly find out whether or not
 
05:27:57.910 --> 05:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
the kids are involved in any programs in
 
05:28:00.270 --> 05:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
that Library this is the only place
 
05:28:02.110 --> 05:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
where I know other than that voting you
 
05:28:03.430 --> 05:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
know voting registration is public
 
05:28:04.868 --> 05:28:04.878 align:start position:0%
record but this is the only place that I
 
05:28:07.390 --> 05:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
know where I can do a right to know and
 
05:28:10.350 --> 05:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
I can find out exactly where a victim is
 
05:28:12.670 --> 05:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
where somebody trying to find a victim
 
05:28:15.030 --> 05:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
and that concerns me I believe that
 
05:28:17.628 --> 05:28:17.638 align:start position:0%
people have an inherent right to
 
05:28:19.990 --> 05:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
privacy and and I believe that it's the
 
05:28:21.750 --> 05:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
government's job to protect the rights
 
05:28:25.670 --> 05:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
of the people so from that perspective I
 
05:28:28.510 --> 05:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
think that we I I I would hope that this
 
05:28:32.548 --> 05:28:32.558 align:start position:0%
body would move to uh OTP this on the
 
05:28:35.190 --> 05:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
grounds of protecting the citizens from
 
05:28:38.270 --> 05:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
aant right to no requests
 
05:28:39.910 --> 05:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
any questions I'll conclude thank you
 
05:28:42.270 --> 05:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
sir uh questions for this
 
05:28:45.788 --> 05:28:45.798 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you very much
 
05:28:56.310 --> 05:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:59.390 --> 05:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
Coco thank you Mr chair uh right to know
 
05:29:01.628 --> 05:29:01.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire supports this bill um I
 
05:29:03.190 --> 05:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
will say that we met as an organization
 
05:29:05.390 --> 05:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
we were hard pressed to find a single
 
05:29:07.430 --> 05:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
example where personally identifiable
 
05:29:09.510 --> 05:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
information was of this kind was of
 
05:29:12.548 --> 05:29:12.558 align:start position:0%
interest and we feel that the bill um
 
05:29:15.670 --> 05:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
does is a clarifying Bill IT addresses
 
05:29:18.548 --> 05:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
something that we believed was already
 
05:29:21.270 --> 05:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
the case um I will also add that I took
 
05:29:24.430 --> 05:29:24.440 align:start position:0%
a quick look I'm a book nerd so um I
 
05:29:26.150 --> 05:29:26.160 align:start position:0%
jumped on the American Library
 
05:29:28.030 --> 05:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
Association website I would encourage
 
05:29:29.470 --> 05:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
committee members to go ahead and look
 
05:29:33.270 --> 05:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
at their stance on privacy and libraries
 
05:29:35.548 --> 05:29:35.558 align:start position:0%
um it's quite powerful and I would also
 
05:29:36.910 --> 05:29:36.920 align:start position:0%
state that from a right to know
 
05:29:39.230 --> 05:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
perspective I find it very interesting
 
05:29:41.430 --> 05:29:41.440 align:start position:0%
that uh and I'm hearing about this for
 
05:29:43.590 --> 05:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
the first time here so if I have this
 
05:29:46.628 --> 05:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
incorrect I apologize but it sounds like
 
05:29:49.310 --> 05:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
somebody issued a set of questions and
 
05:29:51.390 --> 05:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
rather than the typical response from a
 
05:29:54.270 --> 05:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
community which is under 91a we are not
 
05:29:56.310 --> 05:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
required to respond to
 
05:29:59.030 --> 05:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
questions somebody chose to go ahead
 
05:30:01.590 --> 05:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
pull records and furnish those that is
 
05:30:04.150 --> 05:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
unusual in my experience typically they
 
05:30:06.270 --> 05:30:06.280 align:start position:0%
will come back and say we can't answer a
 
05:30:07.670 --> 05:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
question you have to ask for a specific
 
05:30:09.310 --> 05:30:09.320 align:start position:0%
docum it does not sound like that
 
05:30:10.868 --> 05:30:10.878 align:start position:0%
happened in this case it sounds like
 
05:30:12.628 --> 05:30:12.638 align:start position:0%
this was clearly motivated by something
 
05:30:14.390 --> 05:30:14.400 align:start position:0%
else and I find that very interesting
 
05:30:16.670 --> 05:30:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's unusual thank
 
05:30:19.430 --> 05:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
you hang on questions for this witness
 
05:30:22.270 --> 05:30:22.280 align:start position:0%
anybody have questions right thank no
 
05:30:23.948 --> 05:30:23.958 align:start position:0%
questions sorry nobody does thank you
 
05:30:28.750 --> 05:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
very much right um is there anyone else
 
05:30:32.150 --> 05:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
uh who wishes to uh testify on House
 
05:30:32.160 --> 05:30:34.230 align:start position:0%
uh who wishes to uh testify on House
Bill

05:30:34.230 --> 05:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:30:36.948 --> 05:30:36.958 align:start position:0%
376 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
05:30:40.868 --> 05:30:40.878 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 376 and the
 
05:30:42.270 --> 05:30:42.280 align:start position:0%
committee will be very happy to know we
 
05:30:44.670 --> 05:30:44.680 align:start position:0%
are on to the last bill that we have
 
05:30:48.230 --> 05:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
assigned for uh hearing

05:30:50.718 --> 05:30:52.548 align:start position:0%

out after you can testify first but just
 
05:31:31.270 --> 05:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:33.390 --> 05:31:33.400 align:start position:0%
afterwards good to go good afternoon yes
 
05:31:35.430 --> 05:31:35.440 align:start position:0%
you're good to go thank you Mr chairman
 
05:31:36.948 --> 05:31:36.958 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is Mike
 
05:31:39.750 --> 05:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
Drago I represent the town of Raymond
 
05:31:43.868 --> 05:31:43.878 align:start position:0%
and I am going to introduce HB 273 which
 
05:31:46.110 --> 05:31:46.120 align:start position:0%
gives parents access to their child's
 
05:31:48.670 --> 05:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
Library records um right off the bat if
 
05:31:52.910 --> 05:31:52.920 align:start position:0%
this bill is passed it gives two real
 
05:31:55.548 --> 05:31:55.558 align:start position:0%
world implications um makes it easier
 
05:31:57.510 --> 05:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
for parents and I think for libraries in
 
05:32:00.350 --> 05:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
general one issue I actually ran into
 
05:32:03.510 --> 05:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
probably 14 months ago um I requested
 
05:32:06.310 --> 05:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
while my daughter was reading um a
 
05:32:08.390 --> 05:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
chapter book series on horses
 
05:32:10.628 --> 05:32:10.638 align:start position:0%
and uh the next book series was the next
 
05:32:12.110 --> 05:32:12.120 align:start position:0%
book in the series was out so I had
 
05:32:14.390 --> 05:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
requested that book for her and at the
 
05:32:17.110 --> 05:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
same time I was reading a World War II
 
05:32:19.990 --> 05:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
book um basically the author int um
 
05:32:22.030 --> 05:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
interviewed many different veterans
 
05:32:24.628 --> 05:32:24.638 align:start position:0%
about their experience um during combat
 
05:32:27.230 --> 05:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
and they put it all into one book so I I
 
05:32:29.230 --> 05:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
requested that book at the same time
 
05:32:31.590 --> 05:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
couple weeks went by and uh our library
 
05:32:32.990 --> 05:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
and email me saying one of your two
 
05:32:34.868 --> 05:32:34.878 align:start position:0%
books you requested is in I said oh
 
05:32:36.628 --> 05:32:36.638 align:start position:0%
great which book is it I was excited to
 
05:32:38.470 --> 05:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
start reading my book
 
05:32:40.110 --> 05:32:40.120 align:start position:0%
and uh and she said well I can't tell
 
05:32:41.390 --> 05:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
you that's it's against the
 
05:32:43.990 --> 05:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
law I didn't realize that I had
 
05:32:45.628 --> 05:32:45.638 align:start position:0%
accidentally requested both books under
 
05:32:47.868 --> 05:32:47.878 align:start position:0%
my daughter's library card and because
 
05:32:50.948 --> 05:32:50.958 align:start position:0%
it was under her card I had no access to
 
05:32:52.270 --> 05:32:52.280 align:start position:0%
what books were requested she couldn't
 
05:32:52.280 --> 05:32:52.990 align:start position:0%
what books were requested she couldn't
tell

05:32:52.990 --> 05:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
tell
 
05:32:55.470 --> 05:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
me I thought that was kind of odd but
 
05:32:57.548 --> 05:32:57.558 align:start position:0%
under current law that is how it how the
 
05:33:00.670 --> 05:33:00.680 align:start position:0%
law is written and um and so then on top
 
05:33:02.750 --> 05:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
of that I started thinking
 
05:33:05.270 --> 05:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
well our library charges late charges
 
05:33:08.030 --> 05:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
for any book that's overdue if my
 
05:33:09.788 --> 05:33:09.798 align:start position:0%
daughter happens to turn in a library
 
05:33:12.788 --> 05:33:12.798 align:start position:0%
card late I mean I library book late she
 
05:33:14.830 --> 05:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
has no source of income I'm the one
 
05:33:17.350 --> 05:33:17.360 align:start position:0%
responsible for paying for it how does
 
05:33:19.070 --> 05:33:19.080 align:start position:0%
it make sense that I am paying for a
 
05:33:21.708 --> 05:33:21.718 align:start position:0%
book that I have no access to I can't be
 
05:33:22.750 --> 05:33:22.760 align:start position:0%
told anything about what I am
 
05:33:25.190 --> 05:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
responsible for and if you take it a
 
05:33:25.200 --> 05:33:25.948 align:start position:0%
responsible for and if you take it a
step

05:33:25.948 --> 05:33:25.958 align:start position:0%
step
 
05:33:28.230 --> 05:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
further if that book accidentally gets
 
05:33:31.150 --> 05:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
lost I have to either find it or I have
 
05:33:33.670 --> 05:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
to buy it again I'm buying a book that I
 
05:33:35.830 --> 05:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
can't know anything about or two I'm
 
05:33:37.190 --> 05:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
trying to find a book that I have no
 
05:33:38.628 --> 05:33:38.638 align:start position:0%
idea what I'm looking for because I
 
05:33:40.750 --> 05:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
can't be told what to
 
05:33:43.030 --> 05:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
find I'm on a wild goose chase in my
 
05:33:44.510 --> 05:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
house trying to find a
 
05:33:46.750 --> 05:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
book so those are two real world
 
05:33:48.510 --> 05:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
implications um but we can also talk
 
05:33:51.070 --> 05:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
about the elephant in the room and that
 
05:33:53.628 --> 05:33:53.638 align:start position:0%
is uh the explicit material that's
 
05:33:55.390 --> 05:33:55.400 align:start position:0%
contained in books and those books are
 
05:33:59.270 --> 05:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
becoming more and more prevalent in our
 
05:34:02.510 --> 05:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
libraries and uh and
 
05:34:05.470 --> 05:34:05.480 align:start position:0%
so I approached this subject with our
 
05:34:08.230 --> 05:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
librarian and uh
 
05:34:10.868 --> 05:34:10.878 align:start position:0%
the issue is well let's go with this we
 
05:34:12.350 --> 05:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
all remember we're all the age where we
 
05:34:14.670 --> 05:34:14.680 align:start position:0%
remember uh movie rental stores the
 
05:34:17.628 --> 05:34:17.638 align:start position:0%
Blockbusters Etc and I remember my local
 
05:34:19.430 --> 05:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
one when I walk in the door to the left
 
05:34:21.628 --> 05:34:21.638 align:start position:0%
where the G movies the PG movies were to
 
05:34:23.670 --> 05:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
the right out by the counter with the R
 
05:34:25.230 --> 05:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
movies and behind the screen out back
 
05:34:27.350 --> 05:34:27.360 align:start position:0%
those were the X-ray
 
05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
movies we all knew the separation
 
05:34:30.868 --> 05:34:30.878 align:start position:0%
between them and you know you went to
 
05:34:32.788 --> 05:34:32.798 align:start position:0%
the appropriate area books don't have a
 
05:34:34.390 --> 05:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
rating system so they're just
 
05:34:36.708 --> 05:34:36.718 align:start position:0%
interspersed all through the library and
 
05:34:38.470 --> 05:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
why this is important is because the
 
05:34:40.430 --> 05:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
American Library Association gives a lot
 
05:34:43.430 --> 05:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
of I would say governance or allows
 
05:34:45.750 --> 05:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
libraries to follow certain rules and
 
05:34:47.868 --> 05:34:47.878 align:start position:0%
one of the thing they put out was What's
 
05:34:49.990 --> 05:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
called the library Bill of Rights and
 
05:34:52.230 --> 05:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
part of the Bill of Rights says any
 
05:34:54.750 --> 05:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
person of any age should be able to read
 
05:34:54.760 --> 05:34:55.910 align:start position:0%
person of any age should be able to read
any

05:34:55.910 --> 05:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:34:59.750 --> 05:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
book so any person any age any book in
 
05:35:01.708 --> 05:35:01.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire children at the age of six
 
05:35:04.030 --> 05:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
get library cards sometimes at the age
 
05:35:04.040 --> 05:35:04.830 align:start position:0%
get library cards sometimes at the age
of

05:35:04.830 --> 05:35:04.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:35:07.990 --> 05:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
five going by the Bill of Rights that I
 
05:35:11.708 --> 05:35:11.718 align:start position:0%
would say most if not all libraries
 
05:35:15.150 --> 05:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
follow gives any person in the library
 
05:35:16.590 --> 05:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
the ability to look at any book and now
 
05:35:18.270 --> 05:35:18.280 align:start position:0%
we know the types of books that are
 
05:35:20.750 --> 05:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
being bought for our our libraries and
 
05:35:22.430 --> 05:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
so I approached this with our librarian
 
05:35:24.110 --> 05:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
and I brought up the book gender queer
 
05:35:26.470 --> 05:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
which is kind of become famous over the
 
05:35:30.030 --> 05:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
past few years and and I and I
 
05:35:32.190 --> 05:35:32.200 align:start position:0%
said our job if this is going to be in
 
05:35:34.548 --> 05:35:34.558 align:start position:0%
the library is to protect kids uh and
 
05:35:36.628 --> 05:35:36.638 align:start position:0%
not every kid should be exposed to the
 
05:35:38.150 --> 05:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
material that's in these books and this
 
05:35:41.670 --> 05:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
one specifically and her response for
 
05:35:43.670 --> 05:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
the most part was if a child looks at
 
05:35:46.030 --> 05:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
this book and they want it I I think I'm
 
05:35:48.070 --> 05:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
protecting them by giving it to
 
05:35:51.990 --> 05:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
them and so I fundamentally disagree
 
05:35:53.390 --> 05:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
with that I think it's up to the parents
 
05:35:55.548 --> 05:35:55.558 align:start position:0%
to decide if the book is right for a
 
05:35:58.470 --> 05:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
child and by giving them access to see
 
05:36:00.070 --> 05:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
what the child is reading it gives them
 
05:36:01.990 --> 05:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
one more tool to you know make sure that
 
05:36:04.910 --> 05:36:04.920 align:start position:0%
they are seeing what they deem is
 
05:36:06.990 --> 05:36:07.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate and uh you know some of the
 
05:36:08.390 --> 05:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
people that
 
05:36:09.910 --> 05:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
would argue against this bill will say
 
05:36:11.910 --> 05:36:11.920 align:start position:0%
well it's the responsibility of the
 
05:36:13.430 --> 05:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
parent to pay attention to their child
 
05:36:15.788 --> 05:36:15.798 align:start position:0%
at all times and I I don't
 
05:36:18.628 --> 05:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
disagree I I try as hard as I can to
 
05:36:20.270 --> 05:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
always know what my kids are doing try
 
05:36:21.990 --> 05:36:22.000 align:start position:0%
to take care of them the right way but I
 
05:36:24.030 --> 05:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
do have five kids so when we go to the
 
05:36:26.230 --> 05:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
library one kid might be downstairs in
 
05:36:28.110 --> 05:36:28.120 align:start position:0%
the children's section one might be
 
05:36:29.788 --> 05:36:29.798 align:start position:0%
upstairs trying to get a movie so at any
 
05:36:31.628 --> 05:36:31.638 align:start position:0%
time they could technically take out a
 
05:36:34.750 --> 05:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
book and I won't know anything about it
 
05:36:38.548 --> 05:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
and and if I ask I can't be told
 
05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
and on top of that my library and I
 
05:36:43.070 --> 05:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
think probably most libraries have after
 
05:36:44.628 --> 05:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
school programs which I think are great
 
05:36:46.110 --> 05:36:46.120 align:start position:0%
you know they have a chess club or they
 
05:36:50.830 --> 05:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
have um uh teen tween book club or um
 
05:36:53.868 --> 05:36:53.878 align:start position:0%
Dungeons and Dragons well these clubs
 
05:36:56.548 --> 05:36:56.558 align:start position:0%
are me you know they have a chaperon who
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
runs the club or maybe it's one of the
 
05:36:59.350 --> 05:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
Librarians but they're meant for
 
05:36:59.360 --> 05:37:00.750 align:start position:0%
Librarians but they're meant for
peer-to-peer

05:37:00.750 --> 05:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
peer-to-peer
 
05:37:02.548 --> 05:37:02.558 align:start position:0%
interaction and the parent you know the
 
05:37:03.868 --> 05:37:03.878 align:start position:0%
kids might bike there after school or
 
05:37:05.390 --> 05:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
the kids will just drop them off I mean
 
05:37:06.350 --> 05:37:06.360 align:start position:0%
the parents will drop them off they're
 
05:37:07.708 --> 05:37:07.718 align:start position:0%
not meant for parents to be there there
 
05:37:09.628 --> 05:37:09.638 align:start position:0%
it's for them to be with their friends
 
05:37:11.628 --> 05:37:11.638 align:start position:0%
and enjoy the club so there's plenty of
 
05:37:14.548 --> 05:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
times in libraries when kids are not
 
05:37:16.990 --> 05:37:17.000 align:start position:0%
with their parents and at the end of the
 
05:37:19.510 --> 05:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
day it's up to the parents to know or be
 
05:37:21.430 --> 05:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
able to understand what the kids are
 
05:37:23.270 --> 05:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
reading and what they're taking out of
 
05:37:26.270 --> 05:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
the library and uh and this bill gives
 
05:37:29.070 --> 05:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
them that ability right thank you
 
05:37:30.510 --> 05:37:30.520 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
 
05:37:30.520 --> 05:37:31.708 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness
representative

05:37:31.708 --> 05:37:31.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:37:34.030 --> 05:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you thanks for taking my
 
05:37:36.190 --> 05:37:36.200 align:start position:0%
question are you aware that there are
 
05:37:39.948 --> 05:37:39.958 align:start position:0%
age restrictions you said on movies
 
05:37:43.670 --> 05:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
games also have age restrictions games
 
05:37:45.590 --> 05:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
that you can play and buy in dungeons
 
05:37:48.510 --> 05:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
all those games there are also age
 
05:37:51.910 --> 05:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
restrictions uh TV has age restrictions
 
05:37:54.310 --> 05:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
on it and magazines have age
 
05:37:56.350 --> 05:37:56.360 align:start position:0%
restrictions on them are you aware that
 
05:37:58.788 --> 05:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
all those have age restrictions yet we
 
05:38:01.830 --> 05:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
do not have them on books in the library
 
05:38:04.708 --> 05:38:04.718 align:start position:0%
yes I am and I don't know why we don't
 
05:38:07.628 --> 05:38:07.638 align:start position:0%
have them for books and libraries um I
 
05:38:08.830 --> 05:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
also don't know if that would be a state
 
05:38:11.390 --> 05:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
or a federal thing but yes I often
 
05:38:13.868 --> 05:38:13.878 align:start position:0%
wonder that followup followup yes are
 
05:38:16.670 --> 05:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
you aware that the New Hampshire State
 
05:38:20.030 --> 05:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
library has withdrawn from the American
 
05:38:24.390 --> 05:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
Library Association because of some of
 
05:38:24.400 --> 05:38:26.948 align:start position:0%
Library Association because of some of
their

05:38:26.948 --> 05:38:26.958 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:38:29.670 --> 05:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
unique I don't know the word I want to
 
05:38:32.230 --> 05:38:32.240 align:start position:0%
say things that have gone on with them
 
05:38:34.430 --> 05:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
are you aware that the America the State
 
05:38:37.150 --> 05:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
library has withdrawn their membership
 
05:38:38.670 --> 05:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
with then yeah thank you for the
 
05:38:40.868 --> 05:38:40.878 align:start position:0%
question I am well aware uh the American
 
05:38:43.708 --> 05:38:43.718 align:start position:0%
Library Association for for lack of
 
05:38:45.030 --> 05:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
better words is a political action
 
05:38:46.750 --> 05:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
committee funded by your taxpayer
 
05:38:49.310 --> 05:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
dollars uh so last year myself and
 
05:38:51.030 --> 05:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
representative who's actually sitting in
 
05:38:54.590 --> 05:38:54.600 align:start position:0%
the audience met with um the direct the
 
05:38:56.510 --> 05:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner over the libraries and we
 
05:38:58.150 --> 05:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
addressed our concerns and yes the state
 
05:39:00.350 --> 05:39:00.360 align:start position:0%
is now not part of the American Library
 
05:39:02.948 --> 05:39:02.958 align:start position:0%
Association and many towns are no longer
 
05:39:04.270 --> 05:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
part of it as
 
05:39:07.468 --> 05:39:07.478 align:start position:0%
well that I can't answer uh it's very
 
05:39:09.670 --> 05:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
hard on their website to find out who
 
05:39:12.910 --> 05:39:12.920 align:start position:0%
and who isn't a part of the Ala I would
 
05:39:16.110 --> 05:39:16.120 align:start position:0%
hope by seeing the State Library cut
 
05:39:18.510 --> 05:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
ties towns would follow suit but that's
 
05:39:20.350 --> 05:39:20.360 align:start position:0%
up to the individual Library trustee
 
05:39:21.868 --> 05:39:21.878 align:start position:0%
boards and individual Librarians and
 
05:39:24.150 --> 05:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
it's tough to tell what each one does
 
05:39:27.070 --> 05:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
one more quick question please
 
05:39:30.990 --> 05:39:31.000 align:start position:0%
sure wasn't this partially specific
 
05:39:32.430 --> 05:39:32.440 align:start position:0%
partially and
 
05:39:35.110 --> 05:39:35.120 align:start position:0%
specifically done for the protection of
 
05:39:35.120 --> 05:39:39.070 align:start position:0%
specifically done for the protection of
children

05:39:39.070 --> 05:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:42.430 --> 05:39:42.440 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what what wasn't what done um
 
05:39:45.030 --> 05:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
approaching the American libraries uh
 
05:39:47.430 --> 05:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
the state about the American Library
 
05:39:50.750 --> 05:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't that one of your issues with oh
 
05:39:52.830 --> 05:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so as I started looking into this I
 
05:39:54.110 --> 05:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
mean I've had issues with them for quite
 
05:39:55.390 --> 05:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
some time but as I started looking into
 
05:39:57.150 --> 05:39:57.160 align:start position:0%
this preparing for the meeting last year
 
05:39:59.468 --> 05:39:59.478 align:start position:0%
um the American Library Association has
 
05:40:01.868 --> 05:40:01.878 align:start position:0%
a bunch of um subgroups I kind of call
 
05:40:03.390 --> 05:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
them shell companies and one of them is
 
05:40:06.070 --> 05:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
every Library uh which actually one of
 
05:40:07.830 --> 05:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
the director the board of director
 
05:40:09.430 --> 05:40:09.440 align:start position:0%
actually used to be on the American
 
05:40:12.070 --> 05:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
Library Association board and basically
 
05:40:15.468 --> 05:40:15.478 align:start position:0%
their purpose is to further um the will
 
05:40:16.830 --> 05:40:16.840 align:start position:0%
of the American Library Association so
 
05:40:18.708 --> 05:40:18.718 align:start position:0%
as I started looking at that group last
 
05:40:20.070 --> 05:40:20.080 align:start position:0%
year I forget the bill number but it was
 
05:40:23.030 --> 05:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
one representative cordelli read excerpt
 
05:40:25.750 --> 05:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
from the book on the house floor uh they
 
05:40:28.910 --> 05:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
opposed that bill so yes this is a way
 
05:40:31.468 --> 05:40:31.478 align:start position:0%
trying to get the Ala out of the state
 
05:40:32.948 --> 05:40:32.958 align:start position:0%
was a way to protect kids because they
 
05:40:36.190 --> 05:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
were actively arguing against bills that
 
05:40:38.788 --> 05:40:38.798 align:start position:0%
um that I would say would protect kids
 
05:40:41.270 --> 05:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
by not exposing to this material all
 
05:40:43.430 --> 05:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
right yes representative
 
05:40:45.708 --> 05:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
Rambo thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
05:40:48.030 --> 05:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I see the
 
05:40:50.670 --> 05:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
proposed language um says that these
 
05:40:52.270 --> 05:40:52.280 align:start position:0%
records would be available to the parent
 
05:40:54.510 --> 05:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
or legal guardian when requested by the
 
05:40:55.830 --> 05:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
parent legal garden whose address
 
05:40:57.628 --> 05:40:57.638 align:start position:0%
matches that on the Minor's library
 
05:41:00.990 --> 05:41:01.000 align:start position:0%
account um does this take into account
 
05:41:03.350 --> 05:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
um if there's a disagreement between
 
05:41:04.910 --> 05:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
parents if there's a non-custodial
 
05:41:08.708 --> 05:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
parent um if there are circumstances
 
05:41:10.910 --> 05:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
between um legal circumstances that
 
05:41:12.150 --> 05:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
would prevent one parent from making
 
05:41:14.670 --> 05:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
that decision over another parent The
 
05:41:16.150 --> 05:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
Way It Was Written like that is because
 
05:41:18.788 --> 05:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
of um problems in the past where
 
05:41:20.230 --> 05:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
actually kind of like the last bill if
 
05:41:23.150 --> 05:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
there's um violence in the family so
 
05:41:26.510 --> 05:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's the parent that has the same
 
05:41:28.190 --> 05:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
address the one's living with to make
 
05:41:31.590 --> 05:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
sure that maybe it's not stranged spouse
 
05:41:33.990 --> 05:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
or something that uh is trying to catch
 
05:41:39.150 --> 05:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
up on their kids but have follow
 
05:41:41.788 --> 05:41:41.798 align:start position:0%
um to the extent there's concern about
 
05:41:43.708 --> 05:41:43.718 align:start position:0%
safety or security of children in a
 
05:41:45.190 --> 05:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances like that which we touched
 
05:41:48.350 --> 05:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
on in the prior hearing um expressing
 
05:41:50.350 --> 05:41:50.360 align:start position:0%
our Our concern for physical safety
 
05:41:52.430 --> 05:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
right for for folks with a library card
 
05:41:55.350 --> 05:41:55.360 align:start position:0%
or Library Patron and our prioritizing
 
05:41:58.350 --> 05:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
of privacy um you know many libraries
 
05:41:59.948 --> 05:41:59.958 align:start position:0%
allow children to be dropped off like
 
05:42:02.590 --> 05:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
you said for um after school activities
 
05:42:04.670 --> 05:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
seem like that um where they're not
 
05:42:06.910 --> 05:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
checking out books right that they may
 
05:42:10.670 --> 05:42:10.680 align:start position:0%
not be taking them out on an account
 
05:42:12.670 --> 05:42:12.680 align:start position:0%
um how does
 
05:42:15.230 --> 05:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
that square with this proposal in terms
 
05:42:19.150 --> 05:42:19.160 align:start position:0%
of um Librarians being expected
 
05:42:21.910 --> 05:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
to share with parents the materials that
 
05:42:23.990 --> 05:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
their children are consuming at the
 
05:42:26.750 --> 05:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
library or monitoring their children
 
05:42:29.070 --> 05:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
it's not the stuff that they're doing
 
05:42:30.350 --> 05:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
while they're in there it's the books
 
05:42:32.548 --> 05:42:32.558 align:start position:0%
that they're taking out what okay
 
05:42:34.150 --> 05:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
checking out versus reading while in the
 
05:42:36.270 --> 05:42:36.280 align:start position:0%
library yeah there's no way a librarian
 
05:42:37.548 --> 05:42:37.558 align:start position:0%
could be the police of every that's in
 
05:42:39.430 --> 05:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
the library it's the ones that they are
 
05:42:42.070 --> 05:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
actively taking out and taking home with
 
05:42:44.310 --> 05:42:44.320 align:start position:0%
them okay thank you for other question
 
05:42:44.320 --> 05:42:46.030 align:start position:0%
them okay thank you for other question
representative

05:42:46.030 --> 05:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:42:49.548 --> 05:42:49.558 align:start position:0%
orgon yes thank you so well as we
 
05:42:51.270 --> 05:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
pointed out most libraries have Open
 
05:42:53.788 --> 05:42:53.798 align:start position:0%
Stacks so anyone including a child can
 
05:42:55.430 --> 05:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
basically read anything that's in the
 
05:42:57.628 --> 05:42:57.638 align:start position:0%
collection um unless it's in a special
 
05:43:00.510 --> 05:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
part of the collection so I don't know I
 
05:43:02.190 --> 05:43:02.200 align:start position:0%
guess my first question is you're not
 
05:43:05.270 --> 05:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
favoring like uh eliminating having Open
 
05:43:07.670 --> 05:43:07.680 align:start position:0%
Stacks at public libraries so
 
05:43:09.390 --> 05:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
because you're obviously very concerned
 
05:43:11.548 --> 05:43:11.558 align:start position:0%
about especially probably presumably
 
05:43:14.030 --> 05:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
adolescence reading material that you
 
05:43:16.708 --> 05:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
think you should you think on issues
 
05:43:17.948 --> 05:43:17.958 align:start position:0%
that you don't want them to be reading
 
05:43:19.910 --> 05:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
about so that so you you're not you're
 
05:43:22.708 --> 05:43:22.718 align:start position:0%
not asking us to uh ban Open Stacks in
 
05:43:25.708 --> 05:43:25.718 align:start position:0%
public libraries oh no that's this bill
 
05:43:27.468 --> 05:43:27.478 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with that it just
 
05:43:30.708 --> 05:43:30.718 align:start position:0%
simply says that if the parent whose
 
05:43:33.468 --> 05:43:33.478 align:start position:0%
address matches the child's uh requests
 
05:43:36.750 --> 05:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
to see what books the child has taken
 
05:43:36.760 --> 05:43:37.590 align:start position:0%
to see what books the child has taken
out

05:43:37.590 --> 05:43:37.600 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:43:40.030 --> 05:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to see that like just
 
05:43:42.270 --> 05:43:42.280 align:start position:0%
follow yeah a related issue of common
 
05:43:45.190 --> 05:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
practice in many libraries U is to make
 
05:43:46.628 --> 05:43:46.638 align:start position:0%
at least some of the books they're in
 
05:43:48.788 --> 05:43:48.798 align:start position:0%
the building available for people
 
05:43:51.270 --> 05:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
including young people to take home for
 
05:43:53.468 --> 05:43:53.478 align:start position:0%
for free there sometimes it's just books
 
05:43:54.990 --> 05:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
have been cold from the collection but
 
05:43:58.110 --> 05:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's also books on topics that
 
05:43:58.120 --> 05:43:59.150 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's also books on topics that
they

05:43:59.150 --> 05:43:59.160 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:44:03.310 --> 05:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
feel users especially even um even like
 
05:44:05.430 --> 05:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh minor users might want to read about
 
05:44:06.750 --> 05:44:06.760 align:start position:0%
this stuff but for whatever reason they
 
05:44:10.788 --> 05:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
might be be reluctant to uh go up to the
 
05:44:12.788 --> 05:44:12.798 align:start position:0%
uh go up to the library counter and be
 
05:44:14.590 --> 05:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
recorded as checking it out so you think
 
05:44:16.430 --> 05:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
should they should libraries be able to
 
05:44:18.990 --> 05:44:19.000 align:start position:0%
continue those two practices of giving
 
05:44:21.830 --> 05:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
away or selling cold books and um also
 
05:44:23.910 --> 05:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
making certain materials available for
 
05:44:26.750 --> 05:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
free without need to check them
 
05:44:29.708 --> 05:44:29.718 align:start position:0%
out are they giving away for free I
 
05:44:31.270 --> 05:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
don't mean ask a question but are they
 
05:44:32.628 --> 05:44:32.638 align:start position:0%
giving them away for free and not
 
05:44:34.468 --> 05:44:34.478 align:start position:0%
intending to get them back like free
 
05:44:35.910 --> 05:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
like take them home and don't bring them
 
05:44:38.030 --> 05:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
back I
 
05:44:40.430 --> 05:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
think I think it's on the I think some
 
05:44:41.830 --> 05:44:41.840 align:start position:0%
some of these materials are on the honor
 
05:44:45.910 --> 05:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
System so they they feel um you know
 
05:44:47.390 --> 05:44:47.400 align:start position:0%
probably these are not the more
 
05:44:49.030 --> 05:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
expensive materials that are being put
 
05:44:51.990 --> 05:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
out there but um and of
 
05:44:54.070 --> 05:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
course what's the question again oh I
 
05:44:55.830 --> 05:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
was just uh responding to the question
 
05:44:59.548 --> 05:44:59.558 align:start position:0%
so like but um I was because I think he
 
05:45:03.310 --> 05:45:03.320 align:start position:0%
so that I was just uh not sure if he his
 
05:45:04.708 --> 05:45:04.718 align:start position:0%
understanding I understand the issue and
 
05:45:06.390 --> 05:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps I didn't phase the issue very
 
05:45:09.190 --> 05:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
clearly but um so so do you think we
 
05:45:11.270 --> 05:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
should restrict libraries from allowing
 
05:45:14.030 --> 05:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
miners to take anything home for free
 
05:45:17.868 --> 05:45:17.878 align:start position:0%
even from those type of uh shelves that
 
05:45:19.150 --> 05:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
don't actually have to be checked out
 
05:45:20.910 --> 05:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
although they probably most case bring
 
05:45:23.708 --> 05:45:23.718 align:start position:0%
back Andor like allowing children to
 
05:45:25.628 --> 05:45:25.638 align:start position:0%
participate in you know taking home cold
 
05:45:27.670 --> 05:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
books for free or buying books at at a
 
05:45:29.670 --> 05:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
library book book sale which so you
 
05:45:31.788 --> 05:45:31.798 align:start position:0%
think we should restrict that or not
 
05:45:33.390 --> 05:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
well that really has nothing to do with
 
05:45:36.548 --> 05:45:36.558 align:start position:0%
this bill but I will say if a library is
 
05:45:39.110 --> 05:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
allowing people to take out books uh
 
05:45:40.590 --> 05:45:40.600 align:start position:0%
without any sort of record I don't think
 
05:45:42.230 --> 05:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's a good use of taxpayer dollars
 
05:45:42.990 --> 05:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
because there's no guarantee you're
 
05:45:44.468 --> 05:45:44.478 align:start position:0%
going to get back and taxpayer dollars
 
05:45:45.948 --> 05:45:45.958 align:start position:0%
bought those books so there should be
 
05:45:47.468 --> 05:45:47.478 align:start position:0%
some way of making sure those books come
 
05:45:49.350 --> 05:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
back all right other questions for this
 
05:45:51.230 --> 05:45:51.240 align:start position:0%
word yes representative
 
05:45:55.030 --> 05:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
beron thank you Mr chair I know that uh
 
05:45:57.750 --> 05:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
we just made we just made some changes
 
05:46:01.190 --> 05:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
to things like libraries but we realize
 
05:46:03.150 --> 05:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
that kids sometimes don't want their
 
05:46:05.230 --> 05:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
families to know what they're reading
 
05:46:08.150 --> 05:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
simply because you know like for example
 
05:46:11.430 --> 05:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
you know students
 
05:46:14.468 --> 05:46:14.478 align:start position:0%
that so if they if they express
 
05:46:15.910 --> 05:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
different information when they're at
 
05:46:18.310 --> 05:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
school we decided you know we're not
 
05:46:20.910 --> 05:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
going to tell parents if it's a serious
 
05:46:22.430 --> 05:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
issue like that like if they don't want
 
05:46:24.310 --> 05:46:24.320 align:start position:0%
to know that if they if they don't want
 
05:46:26.310 --> 05:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
to know their they don't want their
 
05:46:28.468 --> 05:46:28.478 align:start position:0%
parents to know that type of thing so
 
05:46:31.990 --> 05:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering how that goes with
 
05:46:33.948 --> 05:46:33.958 align:start position:0%
this law right here you know with
 
05:46:35.948 --> 05:46:35.958 align:start position:0%
parents can just go and I guess not that
 
05:46:37.548 --> 05:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
you know everything about it but that's
 
05:46:39.548 --> 05:46:39.558 align:start position:0%
just my one concern for this is simply
 
05:46:41.670 --> 05:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
that if the parents still go and check
 
05:46:44.708 --> 05:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
out the books that their kids are having
 
05:46:47.948 --> 05:46:47.958 align:start position:0%
but um I know that's a different story
 
05:46:51.110 --> 05:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
but also we just went in the right
 
05:46:53.230 --> 05:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
direction and just said can I is is
 
05:46:56.150 --> 05:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
there I'm sorry is there a
 
05:46:58.708 --> 05:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
question what yeah I asked my question
 
05:47:01.230 --> 05:47:01.240 align:start position:0%
already I'm just trying to explain what
 
05:47:03.628 --> 05:47:03.638 align:start position:0%
theater and what it looks like when I
 
05:47:07.150 --> 05:47:07.160 align:start position:0%
would go there
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
they might want privacy when they go to
 
05:47:11.468 --> 05:47:11.478 align:start position:0%
the airport from their I mean to the um
 
05:47:14.390 --> 05:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
Library when they discuss it with their
 
05:47:17.350 --> 05:47:17.360 align:start position:0%
parents so I still don't know what the
 
05:47:19.708 --> 05:47:19.718 align:start position:0%
question is yeah no I I right I
 
05:47:22.190 --> 05:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
representative I I guess we really
 
05:47:23.910 --> 05:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
generally asked qu I mean that you made
 
05:47:25.670 --> 05:47:25.680 align:start position:0%
a statement and your statement may be
 
05:47:28.030 --> 05:47:28.040 align:start position:0%
you know I understand your concern but
 
05:47:39.310 --> 05:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:42.708 --> 05:47:42.718 align:start position:0%
no I yeah okay all right other questions
 
05:47:44.948 --> 05:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
representative Rambo thank you Mr sh I
 
05:47:46.750 --> 05:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
do have one more question um thank you
 
05:47:48.708 --> 05:47:48.718 align:start position:0%
for taking my question if I understand
 
05:47:53.868 --> 05:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
correctly um under RSA 2011- d11 apply
 
05:47:55.230 --> 05:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
School libraries and public libraries
 
05:47:56.628 --> 05:47:56.638 align:start position:0%
right this all falls under the same
 
05:48:01.510 --> 05:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
umbrella correct okay um are there any
 
05:48:05.030 --> 05:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any um conflicts that
 
05:48:07.830 --> 05:48:07.840 align:start position:0%
we create with other school privacy
 
05:48:09.628 --> 05:48:09.638 align:start position:0%
uh statutory rights for students in
 
05:48:11.910 --> 05:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
schools versus the town
 
05:48:14.310 --> 05:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
library I I don't there might be
 
05:48:15.990 --> 05:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
somebody else expert in that area that
 
05:48:17.350 --> 05:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
might be able to answer that okay that's
 
05:48:18.910 --> 05:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
right thank you other question
 
05:48:21.788 --> 05:48:21.798 align:start position:0%
representative trip uh I don't know did
 
05:48:24.070 --> 05:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
you ask about the school
 
05:48:26.430 --> 05:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
libraries I my quick research was
 
05:48:27.590 --> 05:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting that this would apply to both
 
05:48:29.070 --> 05:48:29.080 align:start position:0%
School libraries and public libraries
 
05:48:30.750 --> 05:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you but I'm seeing some
 
05:48:32.830 --> 05:48:32.840 align:start position:0%
head shaking so that that that maybe up
 
05:48:36.750 --> 05:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
for clarification no but uh uh would
 
05:48:39.030 --> 05:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
would you be open to amendment that uh
 
05:48:41.868 --> 05:48:41.878 align:start position:0%
would include School libraries in your
 
05:48:44.070 --> 05:48:44.080 align:start position:0%
bill I think the intent of the bill is
 
05:48:44.080 --> 05:48:45.270 align:start position:0%
bill I think the intent of the bill is
for

05:48:45.270 --> 05:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:48:45.280 --> 05:48:46.830 align:start position:0%
for
both

05:48:46.830 --> 05:48:46.840 align:start position:0%
both
 
05:48:49.708 --> 05:48:49.718 align:start position:0%
so it yeah it's it's libraries and
 
05:48:52.110 --> 05:48:52.120 align:start position:0%
general so the answer is yes yes okay
 
05:48:53.628 --> 05:48:53.638 align:start position:0%
thank you all right other questions for
 
05:48:56.350 --> 05:48:56.360 align:start position:0%
this witness seeing none thank you very
 
05:48:58.468 --> 05:48:58.478 align:start position:0%
much thank you next I'm going to call on
 
05:49:00.468 --> 05:49:00.478 align:start position:0%
representative uh Katherine Harvey
 
05:49:00.478 --> 05:49:17.390 align:start position:0%
representative uh Katherine Harvey
please

05:49:17.390 --> 05:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:19.510 --> 05:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh good afternoon
 
05:49:21.830 --> 05:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
committee um my name is representative
 
05:49:24.788 --> 05:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
Katherine Harvey I'm from chesher 6 and
 
05:49:27.548 --> 05:49:27.558 align:start position:0%
that means I represent Hinsdale uh
 
05:49:30.270 --> 05:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
Chesterfield and West Morland um I'm
 
05:49:33.430 --> 05:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
also the vice chair of uh New Hampshire
 
05:49:37.230 --> 05:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
library trustees Association and I chair
 
05:49:39.910 --> 05:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
its education committee um I'm here
 
05:49:43.350 --> 05:49:43.360 align:start position:0%
today to speak on behalf of NHL TA in
 
05:49:46.070 --> 05:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
opposition to bill um House Bill
 
05:49:49.310 --> 05:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
273 we see that there's two problems
 
05:49:51.708 --> 05:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
with this bill and you've touched on one
 
05:49:54.548 --> 05:49:54.558 align:start position:0%
of them uh briefly and that is the the
 
05:49:57.590 --> 05:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
wording that the address matches that of
 
05:50:01.150 --> 05:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
the minor um that's problematic because
 
05:50:03.788 --> 05:50:03.798 align:start position:0%
the person who is making that request is
 
05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
going to have to somehow prove to that
 
05:50:09.548 --> 05:50:09.558 align:start position:0%
uh circulation desk that they actually
 
05:50:11.788 --> 05:50:11.798 align:start position:0%
live at the address that they say they
 
05:50:14.270 --> 05:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
live at my driver's license does not
 
05:50:16.430 --> 05:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
have my address on it because I get my
 
05:50:21.830 --> 05:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
mail at a post office box um the um you
 
05:50:25.230 --> 05:50:25.240 align:start position:0%
could not make a request over the phone
 
05:50:28.350 --> 05:50:28.360 align:start position:0%
because the the address has to be
 
05:50:32.070 --> 05:50:32.080 align:start position:0%
verified in some way if the address of
 
05:50:34.310 --> 05:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
the person can be verified and that's
 
05:50:36.468 --> 05:50:36.478 align:start position:0%
going to have to be decided how it can
 
05:50:39.708 --> 05:50:39.718 align:start position:0%
be be verified there's there's no way
 
05:50:43.390 --> 05:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
that you know that uh the children live
 
05:50:46.230 --> 05:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
at that same address today's children
 
05:50:48.430 --> 05:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
live with aunts they live with
 
05:50:51.070 --> 05:50:51.080 align:start position:0%
grandparents they live in foster homes
 
05:50:53.310 --> 05:50:53.320 align:start position:0%
they live with boyfriends they're even
 
05:50:57.190 --> 05:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
homeless so it's not safe and it's not
 
05:51:00.910 --> 05:51:00.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable to assume that all of today's
 
05:51:04.230 --> 05:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
children live at the same address as
 
05:51:06.868 --> 05:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
whatever that parent or legal guardian
 
05:51:10.150 --> 05:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
is um presenting to the circulation desk
 
05:51:12.628 --> 05:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
and there is no way that the staff at
 
05:51:15.948 --> 05:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
that circulation desk can ascertain um
 
05:51:18.910 --> 05:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
whether that information is true or not
 
05:51:21.150 --> 05:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
uh the second problem with this bill is
 
05:51:23.948 --> 05:51:23.958 align:start position:0%
that most of our small rural libraries
 
05:51:26.468 --> 05:51:26.478 align:start position:0%
are not automated so when you check out
 
05:51:27.468 --> 05:51:27.478 align:start position:0%
a book They're checked out the
 
05:51:29.628 --> 05:51:29.638 align:start position:0%
oldfashioned way you probably remember
 
05:51:32.190 --> 05:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
the the cards and the date stamps and
 
05:51:35.070 --> 05:51:35.080 align:start position:0%
and then the cards are uh filed by the
 
05:51:37.030 --> 05:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
date that the book is due
 
05:51:39.750 --> 05:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
not by the person who took out the book
 
05:51:43.150 --> 05:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
so if I want to request what book
 
05:51:46.270 --> 05:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
someone has out a staff person is
 
05:51:49.110 --> 05:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
manually going to have to go through
 
05:51:54.350 --> 05:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
three to four uh weeks worth of cards as
 
05:51:57.670 --> 05:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
um as well as the overdue cards to see
 
05:52:00.990 --> 05:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
what books that person has taken out and
 
05:52:02.590 --> 05:52:02.600 align:start position:0%
then they're they're going to have to
 
05:52:05.590 --> 05:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
cross reference that number with the
 
05:52:09.910 --> 05:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
address to see if it is indeed the
 
05:52:11.390 --> 05:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
person that's standing in front of their
 
05:52:15.030 --> 05:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
circulation desk now if a library is
 
05:52:17.670 --> 05:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
automated um that process might be a
 
05:52:20.548 --> 05:52:20.558 align:start position:0%
little quicker but again you don't check
 
05:52:23.750 --> 05:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
books out by your name um this is my
 
05:52:27.150 --> 05:52:27.160 align:start position:0%
library card it's it just has a barcode
 
05:52:30.628 --> 05:52:30.638 align:start position:0%
on it so again somebody would have to
 
05:52:34.590 --> 05:52:34.600 align:start position:0%
cross reference my barcode to see if it
 
05:52:36.468 --> 05:52:36.478 align:start position:0%
matches the address that I'm Pres
 
05:52:40.110 --> 05:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
presenting at the circulation desk
 
05:52:43.910 --> 05:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
um if that can all be AC
 
05:52:46.430 --> 05:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
accomplished in all of New England
 
05:52:50.468 --> 05:52:50.478 align:start position:0%
libraries except for Mont um and um
 
05:52:53.110 --> 05:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
history of the books that you've taken
 
05:52:55.030 --> 05:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
out are
 
05:52:58.350 --> 05:52:58.360 align:start position:0%
deleted when the book comes back in
 
05:53:02.788 --> 05:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
Vermont deletes history after age 12 so
 
05:53:05.350 --> 05:53:05.360 align:start position:0%
if if you go to the computer the only
 
05:53:08.190 --> 05:53:08.200 align:start position:0%
books that it's going to show that are
 
05:53:10.310 --> 05:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
out of the library are the ones that are
 
05:53:14.030 --> 05:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
actually out of the library right then
 
05:53:17.030 --> 05:53:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's not going to show you the history
 
05:53:22.590 --> 05:53:22.600 align:start position:0%
of the usage of that person um so if you
 
05:53:25.110 --> 05:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
pass this bill there are significant
 
05:53:28.190 --> 05:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
costs that are going to be downshifted
 
05:53:32.868 --> 05:53:32.878 align:start position:0%
to the local library and the local taxes
 
05:53:35.788 --> 05:53:35.798 align:start position:0%
first if your library is not automated
 
05:53:37.468 --> 05:53:37.478 align:start position:0%
then your you're going to be paying for
 
05:53:40.030 --> 05:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
man hours of somebody going through
 
05:53:43.430 --> 05:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
those boxes of Date cards to see who has
 
05:53:46.990 --> 05:53:47.000 align:start position:0%
taken out what books um and that and
 
05:53:50.070 --> 05:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
that's that's expensive um if your
 
05:53:52.468 --> 05:53:52.478 align:start position:0%
library is automated you're going to
 
05:53:55.990 --> 05:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
have to upgrade your systems if you can
 
05:53:58.190 --> 05:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
um some of our libraries are automated
 
05:54:00.548 --> 05:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
but we're automated with Antiquated
 
05:54:04.190 --> 05:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
computer systems and you may not be able
 
05:54:05.590 --> 05:54:05.600 align:start position:0%
to upgrade them you may have to just
 
05:54:08.230 --> 05:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
purchase new computers um you're going
 
05:54:12.070 --> 05:54:12.080 align:start position:0%
to have to write new policies about how
 
05:54:14.510 --> 05:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
U this information is going to be shared
 
05:54:18.830 --> 05:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
policies are usually um given a once
 
05:54:21.310 --> 05:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
over by an attorney just to make sure
 
05:54:24.350 --> 05:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
that they uh pass muster so you're going
 
05:54:27.830 --> 05:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
to be paying for that as well um and the
 
05:54:30.670 --> 05:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
possibility of all of this happening
 
05:54:33.788 --> 05:54:33.798 align:start position:0%
within 60 days after the passage of this
 
05:54:36.030 --> 05:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
bill if it should pass is is really
 
05:54:38.670 --> 05:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
quite slim
 
05:54:42.190 --> 05:54:42.200 align:start position:0%
um so in addition to the address the
 
05:54:44.868 --> 05:54:44.878 align:start position:0%
cost and the the time that it just
 
05:54:46.868 --> 05:54:46.878 align:start position:0%
cannot be done in 60 days I would ask
 
05:54:50.468 --> 05:54:50.478 align:start position:0%
you to ital this bill um I would if I
 
05:54:53.548 --> 05:54:53.558 align:start position:0%
could um address just one issue and I I
 
05:54:55.150 --> 05:54:55.160 align:start position:0%
understand I'm talking from my personal
 
05:54:58.830 --> 05:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
library but um the idea was brought up
 
05:55:02.070 --> 05:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
that you might be paying for a book that
 
05:55:05.670 --> 05:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
you don't know um uh that your child has
 
05:55:08.310 --> 05:55:08.320 align:start position:0%
taken out
 
05:55:13.110 --> 05:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
libraries issue cards to children but
 
05:55:17.190 --> 05:55:17.200 align:start position:0%
those cards are linked to an adult card
 
05:55:20.150 --> 05:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
up until a certain age and the reason
 
05:55:22.670 --> 05:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
they're linked is just for that reason
 
05:55:27.070 --> 05:55:27.080 align:start position:0%
if a 5-year-old loses a book then um it
 
05:55:29.270 --> 05:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
would be up to the adult whose card is
 
05:55:32.190 --> 05:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
linked to his um to be able to pay for
 
05:55:35.548 --> 05:55:35.558 align:start position:0%
that book most libraries have a policy
 
05:55:36.788 --> 05:55:36.798 align:start position:0%
that states something something like
 
05:55:39.708 --> 05:55:39.718 align:start position:0%
that and they decide what age cards are
 
05:55:42.750 --> 05:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
not going to be linked to adult cards
 
05:55:42.760 --> 05:55:43.788 align:start position:0%
not going to be linked to adult cards
any

05:55:43.788 --> 05:55:43.798 align:start position:0%
any
 
05:55:46.468 --> 05:55:46.478 align:start position:0%
longer any questions thank you questions
 
05:55:49.190 --> 05:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
for this witness uh representative Pon I
 
05:55:51.110 --> 05:55:51.120 align:start position:0%
don't know I'm sorry I don't know
 
05:55:52.990 --> 05:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you chair Lyon thank you
 
05:55:56.390 --> 05:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um what is the
 
05:55:58.468 --> 05:55:58.478 align:start position:0%
maximum age that a card would be linked
 
05:56:01.708 --> 05:56:01.718 align:start position:0%
to a parents that a Minor's library card
 
05:56:03.910 --> 05:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
would be linked to a parents library
 
05:56:06.310 --> 05:56:06.320 align:start position:0%
card that's a policy that each and every
 
05:56:10.830 --> 05:56:10.840 align:start position:0%
Library um writes separately and um with
 
05:56:12.948 --> 05:56:12.958 align:start position:0%
their Board of Trustees the Board of
 
05:56:15.990 --> 05:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
Trustees major job is to write policy
 
05:56:17.910 --> 05:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
and that that would be their decision to
 
05:56:21.548 --> 05:56:21.558 align:start position:0%
make so I don't know that there there is
 
05:56:25.590 --> 05:56:25.600 align:start position:0%
no um uh
 
05:56:29.390 --> 05:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
age appropriate by there's no state
 
05:56:31.390 --> 05:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
level age is what I'm trying to say it's
 
05:56:33.628 --> 05:56:33.638 align:start position:0%
an individual libraries
 
05:56:37.350 --> 05:56:37.360 align:start position:0%
decision followup sure thank thank you
 
05:56:40.390 --> 05:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
um who informs the policy of each of
 
05:56:42.070 --> 05:56:42.080 align:start position:0%
these libraries or are they creating
 
05:56:45.390 --> 05:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
policy of their own
 
05:56:48.270 --> 05:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
accord I I'm not sure I totally
 
05:56:50.830 --> 05:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
understand the question but once uh
 
05:56:55.230 --> 05:56:55.240 align:start position:0%
Library trustees um write a policy and
 
05:56:58.590 --> 05:56:58.600 align:start position:0%
NHL ta has a list of uh recommended
 
05:57:00.990 --> 05:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
policies that every Library should have
 
05:57:04.788 --> 05:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
but once a library writes a policy it is
 
05:57:08.628 --> 05:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
um post if if they have a website it's
 
05:57:10.990 --> 05:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
posted on their website for anyone to
 
05:57:13.430 --> 05:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
see it if they don't there is certainly
 
05:57:16.390 --> 05:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
a policy manual in every library that
 
05:57:19.110 --> 05:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
you can see these policy manuals are
 
05:57:22.548 --> 05:57:22.558 align:start position:0%
passed out I was a trustee chair and I
 
05:57:25.510 --> 05:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh made sure that all of my um uh
 
05:57:27.628 --> 05:57:27.638 align:start position:0%
members of the trustees got a manual as
 
05:57:29.868 --> 05:57:29.878 align:start position:0%
well as the friends and and so
 
05:57:33.110 --> 05:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
forth is that the question yeah sure go
 
05:57:36.350 --> 05:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you uh if we have a state
 
05:57:36.360 --> 05:57:37.708 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you uh if we have a state
Library

05:57:37.708 --> 05:57:37.718 align:start position:0%
Library
 
05:57:41.110 --> 05:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
Association what is their job do they
 
05:57:43.670 --> 05:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
inform the libraries and the
 
05:57:47.030 --> 05:57:47.040 align:start position:0%
municipalities of how to create their
 
05:57:49.548 --> 05:57:49.558 align:start position:0%
policy or like like for so for example
 
05:57:50.948 --> 05:57:50.958 align:start position:0%
the School Board
 
05:57:53.230 --> 05:57:53.240 align:start position:0%
Association informs policy for the
 
05:57:55.708 --> 05:57:55.718 align:start position:0%
school boards is there an organization
 
05:57:58.750 --> 05:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
like that that informs the policy of the
 
05:58:01.270 --> 05:58:01.280 align:start position:0%
library the individual libraries so I'm
 
05:58:03.070 --> 05:58:03.080 align:start position:0%
here representing New Hampshire library
 
05:58:07.310 --> 05:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
trustees Association um and the the um
 
05:58:07.320 --> 05:58:08.590 align:start position:0%
trustees Association um and the the um
that

05:58:08.590 --> 05:58:08.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:58:13.548 --> 05:58:13.558 align:start position:0%
Association um H does not have
 
05:58:17.270 --> 05:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
um a definite jurisdiction over local
 
05:58:19.750 --> 05:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
libraries but we pre we prevent we
 
05:58:23.350 --> 05:58:23.360 align:start position:0%
present all kinds of we have a a a
 
05:58:26.110 --> 05:58:26.120 align:start position:0%
manual of things that Librarians and
 
05:58:27.948 --> 05:58:27.958 align:start position:0%
trustees should know concerning like
 
05:58:30.190 --> 05:58:30.200 align:start position:0%
duties and that kind of thing we also
 
05:58:32.830 --> 05:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
are an education organization so we
 
05:58:35.230 --> 05:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
present uh workshops our conferences
 
05:58:36.868 --> 05:58:36.878 align:start position:0%
coming up May 5th
 
05:58:41.030 --> 05:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
we uh have Regional workshops that local
 
05:58:44.190 --> 05:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
trustees can attend to ask questions and
 
05:58:48.270 --> 05:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
to um meet with other trustees but we we
 
05:58:51.510 --> 05:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
don't go into a library and say this is
 
05:58:54.910 --> 05:58:54.920 align:start position:0%
how you write your policy we would we do
 
05:58:57.750 --> 05:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
have a list of recommended policies
 
05:59:01.030 --> 05:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
suggest like circulation policy um
 
05:59:04.070 --> 05:59:04.080 align:start position:0%
overdue policies that kind of thing and
 
05:59:06.948 --> 05:59:06.958 align:start position:0%
I think the so I I assume the question I
 
05:59:08.350 --> 05:59:08.360 align:start position:0%
I think what she was getting at is do
 
05:59:10.910 --> 05:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
you among those rep recommended policies
 
05:59:14.708 --> 05:59:14.718 align:start position:0%
is there one that says this is the up to
 
05:59:19.628 --> 05:59:19.638 align:start position:0%
this age um parents should know no that
 
05:59:22.468 --> 05:59:22.478 align:start position:0%
that the it the recommendation is simply
 
05:59:25.230 --> 05:59:25.240 align:start position:0%
you should have this policy but it is up
 
05:59:28.270 --> 05:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
to every individual library to set that
 
05:59:32.150 --> 05:59:32.160 align:start position:0%
because nlta doesn't know your community
 
05:59:34.670 --> 05:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative Manion
 
05:59:36.468 --> 05:59:36.478 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for take my
 
05:59:38.548 --> 05:59:38.558 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned parents are
 
05:59:40.708 --> 05:59:40.718 align:start position:0%
linked cards are linked depending on
 
05:59:42.510 --> 05:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
what age it's 5 6 78 the library
 
05:59:45.948 --> 05:59:45.958 align:start position:0%
determines that um so if they notify the
 
05:59:47.708 --> 05:59:47.718 align:start position:0%
parent that the book is missing and
 
05:59:49.390 --> 05:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
that's why the card is linked do they
 
05:59:51.590 --> 05:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
notify the parent what the book is yes
 
05:59:54.030 --> 05:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other questions yes
 
05:59:54.040 --> 05:59:55.430 align:start position:0%
okay thank you other questions yes
representative

05:59:55.430 --> 05:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:59:58.190 --> 05:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
Burch thank you Mr chair thank you
 
06:00:01.948 --> 06:00:01.958 align:start position:0%
representative uh leaving out the the
 
06:00:04.430 --> 06:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
Practical implementation problems that
 
06:00:06.310 --> 06:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
you've talked about in this leg
 
06:00:09.868 --> 06:00:09.878 align:start position:0%
legislation um would it be fair to say
 
06:00:11.948 --> 06:00:11.958 align:start position:0%
that your organization
 
06:00:14.590 --> 06:00:14.600 align:start position:0%
believes that the purpose of libraries
 
06:00:17.948 --> 06:00:17.958 align:start position:0%
is to encourage people to
 
06:00:22.390 --> 06:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
read well of course it's the purpose of
 
06:00:24.670 --> 06:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
um any library to encourage people to
 
06:00:27.948 --> 06:00:27.958 align:start position:0%
read thank you um yes all right any
 
06:00:30.990 --> 06:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
other qu yes representative
 
06:00:33.670 --> 06:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
Oregon president Harvey would it be fair
 
06:00:36.350 --> 06:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
to attach one of our favorite lab to
 
06:00:38.070 --> 06:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
this bill based on the comments you made
 
06:00:39.750 --> 06:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
about the expense of complying with it
 
06:00:44.430 --> 06:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
which is unfunded mandate oh the cost is
 
06:00:47.270 --> 06:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
definitely an unfound founded mandate
 
06:00:51.110 --> 06:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
the the hours of of searching when you
 
06:00:53.390 --> 06:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
when you take out a book by a barcode or
 
06:00:56.030 --> 06:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
by a date stamp the hours of cross
 
06:00:59.350 --> 06:00:59.360 align:start position:0%
referencing is is just astronomical um
 
06:01:01.628 --> 06:01:01.638 align:start position:0%
not to mention if equipment has to be
 
06:01:05.468 --> 06:01:05.478 align:start position:0%
upgraded and so forth yes and and to do
 
06:01:09.030 --> 06:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
it in 60 days is other questions for
 
06:01:11.510 --> 06:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
this witness seeing none thank you very
 
06:01:21.670 --> 06:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:24.390 --> 06:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
please and you know uh we have a number
 
06:01:26.070 --> 06:01:26.080 align:start position:0%
of other Witnesses and given the hour
 
06:01:27.468 --> 06:01:27.478 align:start position:0%
I'm going to ask if you would please Mr
 
06:01:29.548 --> 06:01:29.558 align:start position:0%
fre try to limit your testimony to three
 
06:01:31.948 --> 06:01:31.958 align:start position:0%
minutes if you would please thank you uh
 
06:01:35.150 --> 06:01:35.160 align:start position:0%
yeah um Mr chairman committee members uh
 
06:01:37.150 --> 06:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
Aubrey freeden and I live in Bridgewater
 
06:01:41.590 --> 06:01:41.600 align:start position:0%
I speak in support of this bill um I
 
06:01:44.628 --> 06:01:44.638 align:start position:0%
didn't even realize that how this was
 
06:01:46.830 --> 06:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
kind of secretive that uh somebody's
 
06:01:49.788 --> 06:01:49.798 align:start position:0%
young as five could get a card and the
 
06:01:51.948 --> 06:01:51.958 align:start position:0%
parents are don't even have access to
 
06:01:55.230 --> 06:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
that that to me is um
 
06:01:58.510 --> 06:01:58.520 align:start position:0%
ridiculous and it's your job as a parent
 
06:02:00.070 --> 06:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
to kind of know I mean when they're
 
06:02:01.430 --> 06:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
older it's a little different you can
 
06:02:03.030 --> 06:02:03.040 align:start position:0%
kind of let go but certainly when
 
06:02:06.430 --> 06:02:06.440 align:start position:0%
they're young you kind of want to know
 
06:02:08.830 --> 06:02:08.840 align:start position:0%
what information they're accessing I
 
06:02:10.948 --> 06:02:10.958 align:start position:0%
mean this is a busy world there's tons
 
06:02:13.868 --> 06:02:13.878 align:start position:0%
of stuff out there there's bad stuff and
 
06:02:17.468 --> 06:02:17.478 align:start position:0%
as a parent that's your job to hate to
 
06:02:19.230 --> 06:02:19.240 align:start position:0%
say but you're kind of a dictator of
 
06:02:22.350 --> 06:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
your kids while they're young and so you
 
06:02:26.310 --> 06:02:26.320 align:start position:0%
should be able to access uh what books
 
06:02:28.468 --> 06:02:28.478 align:start position:0%
they're reading or maybe they've lost or
 
06:02:31.270 --> 06:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
whatever you should have Total Access
 
06:02:35.030 --> 06:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
and for Library Personnel to kind of
 
06:02:37.830 --> 06:02:37.840 align:start position:0%
hide this from parents or well we can't
 
06:02:39.350 --> 06:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know like you're a doctor like it's
 
06:02:42.150 --> 06:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
a confidentiality with your psychiatrist
 
06:02:44.468 --> 06:02:44.478 align:start position:0%
this is ridiculous we're talking kids
 
06:02:48.830 --> 06:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
here so I totally support this um and
 
06:02:51.830 --> 06:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
also the only thing I would say uh maybe
 
06:02:54.670 --> 06:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
could be a little better in this bill is
 
06:02:57.868 --> 06:02:57.878 align:start position:0%
there are no teeth in this um this is
 
06:03:00.590 --> 06:03:00.600 align:start position:0%
one of the library Personnel they don't
 
06:03:03.750 --> 06:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
really agree with that and they say the
 
06:03:06.230 --> 06:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
car like you say somebody or you know
 
06:03:08.110 --> 06:03:08.120 align:start position:0%
kids should let them learn whatever they
 
06:03:10.788 --> 06:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
we want them to read we should not uh
 
06:03:14.590 --> 06:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
hamstring them at all and so I'm kind of
 
06:03:17.708 --> 06:03:17.718 align:start position:0%
going to ignore that and what if they do
 
06:03:20.468 --> 06:03:20.478 align:start position:0%
uh just disregard the uh law so there
 
06:03:22.430 --> 06:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
should be a penalty it doesn't have to
 
06:03:25.628 --> 06:03:25.638 align:start position:0%
be a huge one but bills that don't have
 
06:03:30.030 --> 06:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
penalties on government officials and
 
06:03:33.070 --> 06:03:33.080 align:start position:0%
employees uh they're often ignored so I
 
06:03:34.590 --> 06:03:34.600 align:start position:0%
think there should be a little penalty
 
06:03:37.230 --> 06:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
in here if they disregard the law and
 
06:03:39.270 --> 06:03:39.280 align:start position:0%
that would be my only uh suggestion for
 
06:03:41.590 --> 06:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
an an amendment otherwise I agree with
 
06:03:43.070 --> 06:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
it all right thank you thank you sir
 
06:03:44.390 --> 06:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
questions for this
 
06:03:47.270 --> 06:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you thank you
 
06:04:02.468 --> 06:04:02.478 align:start position:0%

Hampshire licensed attorney but I work
 
06:04:17.788 --> 06:04:17.798 align:start position:0%
at a Boston um I'm going to focus in on
 
06:04:20.548 --> 06:04:20.558 align:start position:0%
an narrow issue which is the reasonable
 
06:04:24.150 --> 06:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy that even young
 
06:04:26.510 --> 06:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
people have when it comes to sexual
 
06:04:28.310 --> 06:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
orientation and gender
 
06:04:32.788 --> 06:04:32.798 align:start position:0%
identity um young people look to books
 
06:04:36.350 --> 06:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
to uh to help with the process of
 
06:04:37.990 --> 06:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
self-discovery looking to see
 
06:04:39.750 --> 06:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
representations of people who have gone
 
06:04:42.590 --> 06:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
through similar experiences as them who
 
06:04:44.708 --> 06:04:44.718 align:start position:0%
who uh move through the world in similar
 
06:04:47.390 --> 06:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
ways as them and for lgbtq young people
 
06:04:50.070 --> 06:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
it can be incredibly important to have
 
06:04:53.670 --> 06:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
access to novels non-fiction books that
 
06:04:56.150 --> 06:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh reflect who they are as they're ident
 
06:04:57.708 --> 06:04:57.718 align:start position:0%
as they're um coming to understand how
 
06:05:01.150 --> 06:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
they identify um it can be extremely
 
06:05:03.910 --> 06:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
harmful to take away from a young person
 
06:05:07.230 --> 06:05:07.240 align:start position:0%
the right to decide when and how they
 
06:05:09.190 --> 06:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
tell their parents about their sexual
 
06:05:12.070 --> 06:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
orientation or their gender identity um
 
06:05:14.830 --> 06:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
young people can be subject to Great
 
06:05:17.750 --> 06:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
harm if they are not in control of that
 
06:05:20.190 --> 06:05:20.200 align:start position:0%
process um and there are plenty of
 
06:05:22.548 --> 06:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
examples of horrible things befalling
 
06:05:25.270 --> 06:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
young people who's who had that um
 
06:05:28.350 --> 06:05:28.360 align:start position:0%
Choice taken away from them um I want to
 
06:05:30.510 --> 06:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
call attention to a story from the late
 
06:05:33.990 --> 06:05:34.000 align:start position:0%
1990s in Pennsylvania in a small town
 
06:05:36.310 --> 06:05:36.320 align:start position:0%
where uh two young men were were caught
 
06:05:38.670 --> 06:05:38.680 align:start position:0%
by a police officer in a car at
 
06:05:42.230 --> 06:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
night um the two young men were you know
 
06:05:43.868 --> 06:05:43.878 align:start position:0%
out at night in a way that they
 
06:05:45.548 --> 06:05:45.558 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have been or um and the police
 
06:05:47.468 --> 06:05:47.478 align:start position:0%
officer had every right to stop them
 
06:05:49.868 --> 06:05:49.878 align:start position:0%
tell them to go home and he did but
 
06:05:51.590 --> 06:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
before he did he took them to the police
 
06:05:53.390 --> 06:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
station and he threatened them and he
 
06:05:55.030 --> 06:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
told them I'm going to talk to your
 
06:05:57.670 --> 06:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
families uh that night one of the young
 
06:06:00.708 --> 06:06:00.718 align:start position:0%
men Marcus Wayman took his life Mr chair
 
06:06:02.948 --> 06:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm confused at how that story is
 
06:06:02.958 --> 06:06:03.990 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm confused at how that story is
relevant

06:06:03.990 --> 06:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
06:06:07.350 --> 06:06:07.360 align:start position:0%
to the test testimony on Library
 
06:06:09.548 --> 06:06:09.558 align:start position:0%
information so I I just point of
 
06:06:11.350 --> 06:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
clarification I I hope that the witness
 
06:06:13.910 --> 06:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
will stay to the the matter the matter
 
06:06:15.910 --> 06:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:06:18.990 --> 06:06:19.000 align:start position:0%
bill go you may continue but I just say
 
06:06:20.548 --> 06:06:20.558 align:start position:0%
I I had indicated three minutes and
 
06:06:21.868 --> 06:06:21.878 align:start position:0%
you're getting you're you've got about
 
06:06:26.670 --> 06:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
45 seconds left so okay so um to answer
 
06:06:29.070 --> 06:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
the question the government disclosure
 
06:06:32.190 --> 06:06:32.200 align:start position:0%
of private information uh is at issue in
 
06:06:34.230 --> 06:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
the um in the events I was just
 
06:06:35.910 --> 06:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
describing and it's at issue we talk
 
06:06:38.270 --> 06:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
about uh public or School libraries
 
06:06:40.110 --> 06:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
disclosing information to parents about
 
06:06:42.350 --> 06:06:42.360 align:start position:0%
what books have been read by students uh
 
06:06:44.628 --> 06:06:44.638 align:start position:0%
in both examples we're talking about
 
06:06:46.670 --> 06:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
information that might be very personal
 
06:06:48.948 --> 06:06:48.958 align:start position:0%
very private to a young person you know
 
06:06:52.110 --> 06:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
say a 16-year-old and that information
 
06:06:53.750 --> 06:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh when it's disclosed can result in
 
06:06:56.390 --> 06:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
great harm and courts have found that
 
06:06:58.350 --> 06:06:58.360 align:start position:0%
there's a reasonable expectation of
 
06:07:01.190 --> 06:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
privacy even for um for minors when it
 
06:07:02.468 --> 06:07:02.478 align:start position:0%
comes to information about sexual
 
06:07:04.830 --> 06:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
orientation and gender identity right
 
06:07:07.110 --> 06:07:07.120 align:start position:0%
any questions for this witness seeing
 
06:07:09.430 --> 06:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
none thank you very much sir thank you
 
06:07:19.310 --> 06:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:21.628 --> 06:07:21.638 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon I'll try to make
 
06:07:23.310 --> 06:07:23.320 align:start position:0%
this quick too I'm going to cut out some
 
06:07:25.270 --> 06:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
of what I was going to say so I'm a
 
06:07:27.150 --> 06:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
parental rights Advocate focused on
 
06:07:29.110 --> 06:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
excellence and education in New
 
06:07:31.708 --> 06:07:31.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um anytime a parent can stand
 
06:07:33.468 --> 06:07:33.478 align:start position:0%
in the way of exploiting children that's
 
06:07:36.910 --> 06:07:36.920 align:start position:0%
a good thing I'm so I do support this
 
06:07:39.150 --> 06:07:39.160 align:start position:0%
uh I can access a book called explosives
 
06:07:41.070 --> 06:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
and homemade bombs written by Joseph
 
06:07:44.070 --> 06:07:44.080 align:start position:0%
staffle the book offers this the student
 
06:07:46.270 --> 06:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
of police and fire science a guide to
 
06:07:49.548 --> 06:07:49.558 align:start position:0%
such devices a book like this for
 
06:07:52.430 --> 06:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
professionals may be necessary a book
 
06:07:54.030 --> 06:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
like this in the hands of a deranged
 
06:07:57.070 --> 06:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
student could be harmful or even deadly
 
06:07:59.548 --> 06:07:59.558 align:start position:0%
these books are on how to there are
 
06:08:01.708 --> 06:08:01.718 align:start position:0%
books on how to make fentanyl or other
 
06:08:04.190 --> 06:08:04.200 align:start position:0%
harmful content I'm going to assume you
 
06:08:05.910 --> 06:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
would want a parent to access their
 
06:08:08.270 --> 06:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
child's Library records if they suspect
 
06:08:11.150 --> 06:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
their child is reading these books if a
 
06:08:12.590 --> 06:08:12.600 align:start position:0%
book like this is in the hands of a
 
06:08:15.590 --> 06:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
deranged child this could be deadly what
 
06:08:18.070 --> 06:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
if a child is suicidal wouldn't you want
 
06:08:19.948 --> 06:08:19.958 align:start position:0%
to know if your child is accessing books
 
06:08:22.788 --> 06:08:22.798 align:start position:0%
that show them how to kill themselves
 
06:08:24.468 --> 06:08:24.478 align:start position:0%
this could be an indicator that their
 
06:08:27.350 --> 06:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
child is in need of help uh in the in
 
06:08:29.270 --> 06:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
the furpa law which is a which is a
 
06:08:32.390 --> 06:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
student Privacy Law that had govern
 
06:08:34.868 --> 06:08:34.878 align:start position:0%
schools uh there is a parents right to
 
06:08:37.390 --> 06:08:37.400 align:start position:0%
review their child's records I I had no
 
06:08:39.390 --> 06:08:39.400 align:start position:0%
idea that you couldn't even access this
 
06:08:41.468 --> 06:08:41.478 align:start position:0%
I mean I didn't even know about this and
 
06:08:43.390 --> 06:08:43.400 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking you got to be kidding me
 
06:08:47.270 --> 06:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
what is going on why is there such a
 
06:08:50.788 --> 06:08:50.798 align:start position:0%
drive to to come between a child and a
 
06:08:54.310 --> 06:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
parent this is going to impact very few
 
06:08:57.190 --> 06:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
people I never checked my child's
 
06:09:00.270 --> 06:09:00.280 align:start position:0%
records most people don't but you know
 
06:09:02.310 --> 06:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
what if I found out my kids looking at
 
06:09:04.990 --> 06:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
bomb making stuff I might want to go
 
06:09:05.000 --> 06:09:06.468 align:start position:0%
bomb making stuff I might want to go
look

06:09:06.468 --> 06:09:06.478 align:start position:0%
look
 
06:09:08.868 --> 06:09:08.878 align:start position:0%
I mean it just makes sense and you know
 
06:09:10.868 --> 06:09:10.878 align:start position:0%
what it could be it could be
 
06:09:10.878 --> 06:09:14.830 align:start position:0%
what it could be it could be
helpful

06:09:14.830 --> 06:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:18.070 --> 06:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
um parents also don't have to do this
 
06:09:20.110 --> 06:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
they don't have to do this most parents
 
06:09:22.948 --> 06:09:22.958 align:start position:0%
are not going to do it so the relatively
 
06:09:25.510 --> 06:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
few people that do that I'm going to
 
06:09:27.150 --> 06:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
guess that there's probably a really
 
06:09:30.910 --> 06:09:30.920 align:start position:0%
good reason my son could read Harry
 
06:09:33.548 --> 06:09:33.558 align:start position:0%
Potter books his best friend couldn't
 
06:09:36.270 --> 06:09:36.280 align:start position:0%
when he came to my house I didn't hand
 
06:09:38.948 --> 06:09:38.958 align:start position:0%
them a Harry Potter book I respected
 
06:09:42.070 --> 06:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
that parent I respected them let's show
 
06:09:45.628 --> 06:09:45.638 align:start position:0%
some respect to parents and stop trying
 
06:09:47.708 --> 06:09:47.718 align:start position:0%
to undermine them by trying to keep them
 
06:09:49.628 --> 06:09:49.638 align:start position:0%
hidden from everything that's going on
 
06:09:52.150 --> 06:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
in their child's life thank you for
 
06:09:54.830 --> 06:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
listening questions for this witness
 
06:09:57.868 --> 06:09:57.878 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much Nancy uh
 
06:09:59.548 --> 06:09:59.558 align:start position:0%

06:10:06.510 --> 06:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
Perfect all right
 
06:10:09.150 --> 06:10:09.160 align:start position:0%
I am just going to do bullet points um
 
06:10:11.910 --> 06:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
first of all um we won't talk about how
 
06:10:13.910 --> 06:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
old I am but it was the days when we
 
06:10:15.708 --> 06:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
didn't have computers at the library and
 
06:10:17.670 --> 06:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
the Librarians had no trouble keeping
 
06:10:19.310 --> 06:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
track of what books I had taken out what
 
06:10:20.910 --> 06:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
books I didn't take out and they knew
 
06:10:23.070 --> 06:10:23.080 align:start position:0%
exactly how much money to charge me if I
 
06:10:25.070 --> 06:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
didn't bring a book on time so
 
06:10:26.628 --> 06:10:26.638 align:start position:0%
recordkeeping they could do it back in
 
06:10:28.590 --> 06:10:28.600 align:start position:0%
the 80s and the 70s and we're not going
 
06:10:31.750 --> 06:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
to go any further than that so did we
 
06:10:34.070 --> 06:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
lose that skill in libraries I don't
 
06:10:35.670 --> 06:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
know why so you don't need to have a
 
06:10:37.030 --> 06:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
computer to do it because they could do
 
06:10:38.830 --> 06:10:38.840 align:start position:0%
it back then and believe me they charged
 
06:10:41.750 --> 06:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
fines back then um as far as your
 
06:10:43.750 --> 06:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
address and not being on your license
 
06:10:46.310 --> 06:10:46.320 align:start position:0%
you should have your uh physical address
 
06:10:47.910 --> 06:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
on your license because you need that
 
06:10:49.910 --> 06:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
when you go to vote uh because when you
 
06:10:52.350 --> 06:10:52.360 align:start position:0%
register to vote you need to have your
 
06:10:55.110 --> 06:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
uh your address matching otherwise you
 
06:10:56.590 --> 06:10:56.600 align:start position:0%
are going to have difficulty voting
 
06:10:58.628 --> 06:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be stopping stopped
 
06:10:59.788 --> 06:10:59.798 align:start position:0%
from voting but you're going to have
 
06:11:03.830 --> 06:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
some difficulty when you go to vote um
 
06:11:05.830 --> 06:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
schools do not allow parents
 
06:11:08.030 --> 06:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
um access to their child's library books
 
06:11:10.110 --> 06:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
so I would I ask that schools be
 
06:11:12.430 --> 06:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
included on this and not to assume that
 
06:11:14.110 --> 06:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
people will generalize that sometimes
 
06:11:15.350 --> 06:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
you need to put
 
06:11:18.590 --> 06:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
specifics and um the expectation of
 
06:11:21.270 --> 06:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
privacy on school property books are
 
06:11:24.590 --> 06:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
school property and um and government
 
06:11:26.510 --> 06:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
property are the books in the public
 
06:11:28.788 --> 06:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
libraries and we already know that
 
06:11:30.590 --> 06:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
student lockers are no there's no
 
06:11:32.390 --> 06:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy so the
 
06:11:34.788 --> 06:11:34.798 align:start position:0%
expectation of privacy argument doesn't
 
06:11:36.788 --> 06:11:36.798 align:start position:0%
work all right that's it thank you
 
06:11:38.390 --> 06:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
question hang on questions for this
 
06:11:40.510 --> 06:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
witness any question seeing none thank
 
06:11:53.708 --> 06:11:53.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:56.230 --> 06:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon chairman Lynn and
 
06:11:57.990 --> 06:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
06:12:00.670 --> 06:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
Rebecca leak and I live in Andover uh I
 
06:12:03.868 --> 06:12:03.878 align:start position:0%
am testifying in favor of HB
 
06:12:06.750 --> 06:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
273 I believe this bill is common sense
 
06:12:08.030 --> 06:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
a parent has the right and
 
06:12:10.150 --> 06:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility to oversee what media
 
06:12:12.190 --> 06:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
their child is consuming this is
 
06:12:13.830 --> 06:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
especially important so that parents can
 
06:12:15.990 --> 06:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
determine the appropriateness of that M
 
06:12:18.230 --> 06:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
material for their minor child
 
06:12:20.510 --> 06:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
furthermore this B bill is very narrow
 
06:12:22.430 --> 06:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
only applying to the current records
 
06:12:25.430 --> 06:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
kept of what media the child checks out
 
06:12:27.430 --> 06:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
as someone who looks forward to someday
 
06:12:29.468 --> 06:12:29.478 align:start position:0%
taking my future children to the library
 
06:12:31.670 --> 06:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
I would expect to have access to the
 
06:12:34.270 --> 06:12:34.280 align:start position:0%
records kept of what my child has kept
 
06:12:36.390 --> 06:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
has checked out whether this is simply
 
06:12:38.628 --> 06:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
so that I can find an overdue book or so
 
06:12:40.390 --> 06:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
that I can ensure what my child is
 
06:12:42.548 --> 06:12:42.558 align:start position:0%
reading or watching is appropriate for
 
06:12:44.788 --> 06:12:44.798 align:start position:0%
their age moreover as someone who was a
 
06:12:47.390 --> 06:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
minor not too long ago I fully expected
 
06:12:49.190 --> 06:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
that my parents had access to the
 
06:12:51.628 --> 06:12:51.638 align:start position:0%
records kept of what I had checked out
 
06:12:53.270 --> 06:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
therefore I urge you to recommend that
 
06:12:56.190 --> 06:12:56.200 align:start position:0%
HB 273 ought to pass thank you for
 
06:12:57.868 --> 06:12:57.878 align:start position:0%
considering my testimony I welcome any
 
06:13:00.310 --> 06:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
questions questions for this witness
 
06:13:02.830 --> 06:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much man' um
 
06:13:02.840 --> 06:13:07.548 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much man' um
arene

06:13:07.548 --> 06:13:07.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:15.590 --> 06:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:19.430 --> 06:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:22.548 --> 06:13:22.558 align:start position:0%
Q thank you chairman Lynn and members of
 
06:13:24.948 --> 06:13:24.958 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary Committee is nice to see
 
06:13:28.590 --> 06:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
familiar faces and be back here um for
 
06:13:31.390 --> 06:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Arlene corello and
 
06:13:34.030 --> 06:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
I represented ainson in the legislature
 
06:13:35.510 --> 06:13:35.520 align:start position:0%
last term and I was actually the one who
 
06:13:37.788 --> 06:13:37.798 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill originally um we
 
06:13:39.430 --> 06:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
made some changes to address the
 
06:13:41.390 --> 06:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
counterarguments that were have been
 
06:13:44.110 --> 06:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
brought up about the money and about um
 
06:13:47.910 --> 06:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
the the um address um most parents I
 
06:13:50.350 --> 06:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
have spoken to are shocked that's the
 
06:13:52.548 --> 06:13:52.558 align:start position:0%
general reaction to learn of the state
 
06:13:54.628 --> 06:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
law that prohibits them from knowing
 
06:13:56.830 --> 06:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
what books their kids have checked out
 
06:13:58.270 --> 06:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
they weren't aware that when they took
 
06:13:59.750 --> 06:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
their children to the library for that
 
06:14:01.708 --> 06:14:01.718 align:start position:0%
great American right of a passage
 
06:14:03.708 --> 06:14:03.718 align:start position:0%
signing up for a library card that they
 
06:14:05.548 --> 06:14:05.558 align:start position:0%
were also signing away with a
 
06:14:06.830 --> 06:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
that what they should consider a
 
06:14:09.868 --> 06:14:09.878 align:start position:0%
parental right they didn't know that
 
06:14:11.350 --> 06:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
they might someday go to the library and
 
06:14:13.190 --> 06:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
be asked to pay an overdue fine on a
 
06:14:15.270 --> 06:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
book but illogically that they were not
 
06:14:18.868 --> 06:14:18.878 align:start position:0%
allowed to know the title of the book
 
06:14:22.190 --> 06:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
who not only pays overdue fins but his
 
06:14:24.708 --> 06:14:24.718 align:start position:0%
taxpayers actually pays for Library
 
06:14:27.510 --> 06:14:27.520 align:start position:0%
material and provides the funds to run
 
06:14:30.910 --> 06:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
school and public libraries parents in
 
06:14:33.510 --> 06:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
numerous Library policies I checked I
 
06:14:35.468 --> 06:14:35.478 align:start position:0%
got at numerous I just stopped looking
 
06:14:37.190 --> 06:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
they were so numerous who is held
 
06:14:38.868 --> 06:14:38.878 align:start position:0%
financially responsible for any loss or
 
06:14:40.910 --> 06:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
damaged materials checked out by minors
 
06:14:43.070 --> 06:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
their parents Library policies not state
 
06:14:45.270 --> 06:14:45.280 align:start position:0%
law but most Library policies say that
 
06:14:46.788 --> 06:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
according to the American Library
 
06:14:49.468 --> 06:14:49.478 align:start position:0%
Association whose role this is a quote
 
06:14:53.070 --> 06:14:53.080 align:start position:0%
role is to monitor his or her child's
 
06:14:57.310 --> 06:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
individual reading life parents how can
 
06:15:00.230 --> 06:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
parents possibly fulfill this role if
 
06:15:02.190 --> 06:15:02.200 align:start position:0%
they can't find out what books their
 
06:15:05.070 --> 06:15:05.080 align:start position:0%
children have checked out now to address
 
06:15:08.628 --> 06:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
two counterarguments one is the money um
 
06:15:10.390 --> 06:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
this is not an unfunded mandate this
 
06:15:14.390 --> 06:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
will cost nothing um the
 
06:15:17.150 --> 06:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh there is no historical component to
 
06:15:18.910 --> 06:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
this it is currently checked out every
 
06:15:20.430 --> 06:15:20.440 align:start position:0%
library has these records even if
 
06:15:23.150 --> 06:15:23.160 align:start position:0%
they're not automated um I believe that
 
06:15:26.070 --> 06:15:26.080 align:start position:0%
with all due respect that a previous uh
 
06:15:29.230 --> 06:15:29.240 align:start position:0%
witness really made a very complicated
 
06:15:31.270 --> 06:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
uh description of how this might work
 
06:15:36.110 --> 06:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
out um uh so as another said in the' 70s
 
06:15:37.910 --> 06:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
in the you know or whatever when I was a
 
06:15:40.708 --> 06:15:40.718 align:start position:0%
kid you know they did just fine without
 
06:15:43.390 --> 06:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
the computers um the other issue was the
 
06:15:46.190 --> 06:15:46.200 align:start position:0%
driver's license um and this was to
 
06:15:47.750 --> 06:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
address the safety concern involving
 
06:15:47.760 --> 06:15:49.150 align:start position:0%
address the safety concern involving
non-custodial

06:15:49.150 --> 06:15:49.160 align:start position:0%
non-custodial
 
06:15:52.270 --> 06:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
parents uh a driver's license would be
 
06:15:55.628 --> 06:15:55.638 align:start position:0%
the best proof of the address um there
 
06:15:57.910 --> 06:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
must be some proof of that address um a
 
06:16:00.270 --> 06:16:00.280 align:start position:0%
child their account should have the
 
06:16:02.628 --> 06:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
address of that they're currently at if
 
06:16:04.708 --> 06:16:04.718 align:start position:0%
it's changed they should change it uh
 
06:16:06.150 --> 06:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't have an library account
 
06:16:08.948 --> 06:16:08.958 align:start position:0%
has a wrong address on it and um a a
 
06:16:10.708 --> 06:16:10.718 align:start position:0%
parent usually accompanies a minor to
 
06:16:12.628 --> 06:16:12.638 align:start position:0%
get a library card and at that time they
 
06:16:15.310 --> 06:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
have to show a driver's license um I was
 
06:16:17.468 --> 06:16:17.478 align:start position:0%
a librarian I've seen the nuts and bolts
 
06:16:20.628 --> 06:16:20.638 align:start position:0%
of how this works one other counter AR
 
06:16:22.830 --> 06:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
you're you're at your three minute limit
 
06:16:24.628 --> 06:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
just ask okay I was I was hoping on five
 
06:16:27.190 --> 06:16:27.200 align:start position:0%
but um if I can't say it in three then
 
06:16:28.788 --> 06:16:28.798 align:start position:0%
then it probably doesn't need to be said
 
06:16:32.548 --> 06:16:32.558 align:start position:0%
so um yes please vote OTP on HB 273 and
 
06:16:35.110 --> 06:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for this opportunity thank
 
06:16:37.468 --> 06:16:37.478 align:start position:0%
thank you question representative man
 
06:16:40.030 --> 06:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair quick question so and
 
06:16:42.990 --> 06:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
this is your opinion if more parents
 
06:16:45.548 --> 06:16:45.558 align:start position:0%
knew that they were not entitled to this
 
06:16:47.670 --> 06:16:47.680 align:start position:0%
information do you think more parents
 
06:16:49.190 --> 06:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
would not bring their children in for
 
06:16:50.910 --> 06:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
library cards I think that what they
 
06:16:52.230 --> 06:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
would do is they would just check all
 
06:16:53.868 --> 06:16:53.878 align:start position:0%
the books out on their own cards and
 
06:16:55.390 --> 06:16:55.400 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't let their children get
 
06:16:57.510 --> 06:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
library cards and that would be a shame
 
06:16:59.590 --> 06:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
because getting a library card is really
 
06:17:01.390 --> 06:17:01.400 align:start position:0%
it I I said it in here it's a right of
 
06:17:03.948 --> 06:17:03.958 align:start position:0%
passage you know if you ever saw Arthur
 
06:17:06.190 --> 06:17:06.200 align:start position:0%
and the arvar and he's saying having fun
 
06:17:08.350 --> 06:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
isn't hard if you have a library card
 
06:17:10.830 --> 06:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
you know and to deprive a child of that
 
06:17:12.190 --> 06:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
but what a lot of parents will do and
 
06:17:13.670 --> 06:17:13.680 align:start position:0%
I've spoken to some of them is they'll
 
06:17:15.390 --> 06:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
just put the the books on their own card
 
06:17:17.110 --> 06:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
and not have the child get a card not
 
06:17:18.750 --> 06:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
expose them to that you know taking
 
06:17:21.390 --> 06:17:21.400 align:start position:0%
their right away other questions for
 
06:17:23.190 --> 06:17:23.200 align:start position:0%
this witness seeing none thank you very
 
06:17:26.548 --> 06:17:26.558 align:start position:0%
much man appreciate it um JS
 
06:17:30.590 --> 06:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
biset uh I know Mr Binet was here
 
06:17:35.390 --> 06:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:39.788 --> 06:17:39.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:42.190 --> 06:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh We've written testimony I think was
 
06:17:45.430 --> 06:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
jointly written by Mr V and Mr 's here
 
06:17:47.910 --> 06:17:47.920 align:start position:0%
but but he did hand in a pink card so he
 
06:17:56.948 --> 06:17:56.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:59.190 --> 06:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
responded well he if he's provided
 
06:18:01.150 --> 06:18:01.160 align:start position:0%
written testimony I'm going to uh I'm
 
06:18:02.910 --> 06:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
going to given the hour I'm going to
 
06:18:04.548 --> 06:18:04.558 align:start position:0%
close the uh he said he he said he's on
 
06:18:04.558 --> 06:18:06.708 align:start position:0%
close the uh he said he he said he's on
his

06:18:06.708 --> 06:18:06.718 align:start position:0%
his
 
06:18:06.718 --> 06:18:07.628 align:start position:0%
his
all

06:18:07.628 --> 06:18:07.638 align:start position:0%
all
 
06:18:14.750 --> 06:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:19.670 --> 06:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah no no don't worry thank thank you
 
06:18:25.910 --> 06:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:29.468 --> 06:18:29.478 align:start position:0%
back I did no I I mean no I don't I mean
 
06:18:31.310 --> 06:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
I don't have a physical copy of I have
 
06:18:33.510 --> 06:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
the one online but I I think I think
 
06:18:33.520 --> 06:18:42.310 align:start position:0%
the one online but I I think I think
it's

06:18:42.310 --> 06:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:44.430 --> 06:18:44.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman how are you good I'm so
 
06:18:46.190 --> 06:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
sorry for the no no no no no problem but
 
06:18:48.230 --> 06:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
just I'd ask you to please keep your
 
06:18:49.990 --> 06:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
remarks to three minutes I'll keep it
 
06:18:52.190 --> 06:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
less than that if that's okay and I
 
06:18:54.430 --> 06:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
apologize for being late I'm um trying
 
06:18:58.910 --> 06:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
to be in two places at once today um I
 
06:19:01.230 --> 06:19:01.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to uh repeat the testimony of
 
06:19:02.868 --> 06:19:02.878 align:start position:0%
attorney urell but just to reiterate I'm
 
06:19:06.030 --> 06:19:06.040 align:start position:0%
JB I'm the legal director of the AC seu
 
06:19:08.190 --> 06:19:08.200 align:start position:0%
uh of New Hampshire and we are here in
 
06:19:12.390 --> 06:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
opposition as well along with glad to HB
 
06:19:15.310 --> 06:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
273 with respect to the unfunded mandate
 
06:19:17.150 --> 06:19:17.160 align:start position:0%
concerns that I I have heard those
 
06:19:19.270 --> 06:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
certainly came up last year as well and
 
06:19:23.150 --> 06:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
I also think formed the basis for then
 
06:19:25.070 --> 06:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
the children and family law committee to
 
06:19:27.628 --> 06:19:27.638 align:start position:0%
reject this legislation um so I I want
 
06:19:29.548 --> 06:19:29.558 align:start position:0%
to just kind of uplift to those concerns
 
06:19:31.910 --> 06:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
because they certainly I thought were uh
 
06:19:34.110 --> 06:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
persuasive last year and continue to be
 
06:19:34.120 --> 06:19:35.350 align:start position:0%
persuasive last year and continue to be
persuasive

06:19:35.350 --> 06:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
persuasive
 
06:19:37.990 --> 06:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
one obvious correction to that if uh
 
06:19:39.910 --> 06:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
this committee as well has those
 
06:19:43.510 --> 06:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
concerns would be to limit this bill's
 
06:19:46.590 --> 06:19:46.600 align:start position:0%
application to only information that is
 
06:19:49.430 --> 06:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
accessible to the library at the time a
 
06:19:51.270 --> 06:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
parental request is made that
 
06:19:53.750 --> 06:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
potentially could alleviate the concerns
 
06:19:57.110 --> 06:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
but I do agree that as written the um
 
06:19:59.590 --> 06:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
shall be available language I think
 
06:20:02.310 --> 06:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
could very plausibly be read to mean
 
06:20:04.110 --> 06:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
libraries have to keep and retain all
 
06:20:05.990 --> 06:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
that information even if it's not
 
06:20:09.150 --> 06:20:09.160 align:start position:0%
information that they routinely keep
 
06:20:12.150 --> 06:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
under their um document and electronic
 
06:20:14.190 --> 06:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
management policy so I just just wanted
 
06:20:17.110 --> 06:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
to uplift that um if if that continues
 
06:20:19.430 --> 06:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
to be if that is a concern of this
 
06:20:21.350 --> 06:20:21.360 align:start position:0%
committee and lastly I I just did want
 
06:20:23.670 --> 06:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
to highlight
 
06:20:27.190 --> 06:20:27.200 align:start position:0%
that um certainly understands the
 
06:20:28.990 --> 06:20:29.000 align:start position:0%
concern that that maybe a parent would
 
06:20:31.628 --> 06:20:31.638 align:start position:0%
have that they would want to have access
 
06:20:33.628 --> 06:20:33.638 align:start position:0%
to this information and they can't get
 
06:20:36.350 --> 06:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
access to this information one I think
 
06:20:39.070 --> 06:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
solution to that right is for a parent
 
06:20:42.310 --> 06:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
to not um is is for a parent to make
 
06:20:44.030 --> 06:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
sure that their child when they get
 
06:20:45.948 --> 06:20:45.958 align:start position:0%
books are using the parent's library
 
06:20:47.430 --> 06:20:47.440 align:start position:0%
card right and that parent would then
 
06:20:49.750 --> 06:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
have access to all of that information
 
06:20:51.548 --> 06:20:51.558 align:start position:0%
so I think that is a much more narrowly
 
06:20:53.910 --> 06:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
tailored approach that parents can take
 
06:20:57.030 --> 06:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
in the home rather than um enacting a
 
06:20:58.948 --> 06:20:58.958 align:start position:0%
bill like this which I do think has
 
06:21:00.830 --> 06:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
privacy implications for the reasons
 
06:21:03.270 --> 06:21:03.280 align:start position:0%
that attorney urel mentioned uh earlier
 
06:21:05.390 --> 06:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
today question for this wit
 
06:21:08.430 --> 06:21:08.440 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you um is
 
06:21:08.440 --> 06:21:09.390 align:start position:0%
representative Smith thank you um is
there

06:21:09.390 --> 06:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
06:21:14.628 --> 06:21:14.638 align:start position:0%
a a definition of the a of age what is
 
06:21:17.468 --> 06:21:17.478 align:start position:0%
meant when you use the word Child
 
06:21:19.830 --> 06:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
In N Hampshire
 
06:21:24.030 --> 06:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
law well it's um here this would apply
 
06:21:27.070 --> 06:21:27.080 align:start position:0%
to a Minor's record so my interpretation
 
06:21:29.590 --> 06:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
would be that would apply to anyone
 
06:21:31.788 --> 06:21:31.798 align:start position:0%
that's under the age of 18 that's my
 
06:21:34.230 --> 06:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
interpretation of it but it's because of
 
06:21:36.070 --> 06:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
the use of the word Min or not the use
 
06:21:37.948 --> 06:21:37.958 align:start position:0%
of the word child guest representative
 
06:21:39.910 --> 06:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yeah the questions
 
06:21:39.920 --> 06:21:40.990 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yeah the questions
representative

06:21:40.990 --> 06:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:21:43.150 --> 06:21:43.160 align:start position:0%
pno thank you chairman lynen thank you
 
06:21:45.590 --> 06:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I believe you um
 
06:21:47.468 --> 06:21:47.478 align:start position:0%
suggested that a child be allowed to use
 
06:21:50.590 --> 06:21:50.600 align:start position:0%
a parents library card if they wanted if
 
06:21:52.190 --> 06:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
the parent wanted to make sure that they
 
06:21:55.110 --> 06:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
knew what the child was checking out um
 
06:21:57.830 --> 06:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
would that not be burdensome to the
 
06:22:00.510 --> 06:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
library also in that they probably would
 
06:22:03.590 --> 06:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
need to receive um permission from the
 
06:22:05.468 --> 06:22:05.478 align:start position:0%
parent that this child was allowed to
 
06:22:07.270 --> 06:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
check out the check out books on their
 
06:22:09.030 --> 06:22:09.040 align:start position:0%
card I mean what if they just walked in
 
06:22:11.390 --> 06:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
and said yeah my mom says it's okay then
 
06:22:13.190 --> 06:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they have to follow up with the
 
06:22:15.708 --> 06:22:15.718 align:start position:0%
parent and determine whether or not they
 
06:22:17.788 --> 06:22:17.798 align:start position:0%
were permitted to do that I I don't
 
06:22:21.230 --> 06:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
think so I I think if a child has their
 
06:22:22.868 --> 06:22:22.878 align:start position:0%
parents library card I think it's a
 
06:22:24.750 --> 06:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
pretty safe inference to believe that
 
06:22:27.270 --> 06:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
that child has permission to access
 
06:22:28.510 --> 06:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
those books and of course in that
 
06:22:30.868 --> 06:22:30.878 align:start position:0%
scenario when the books are given if
 
06:22:32.310 --> 06:22:32.320 align:start position:0%
they are given and I hope hope they
 
06:22:33.708 --> 06:22:33.718 align:start position:0%
would if they're given to that minor
 
06:22:35.590 --> 06:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
that parent would then have the ability
 
06:22:38.868 --> 06:22:38.878 align:start position:0%
through that account to be tracking um
 
06:22:41.910 --> 06:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
the information that that minor is
 
06:22:44.390 --> 06:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
obtaining representative
 
06:22:47.670 --> 06:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
bur thank you Mr chair thank you like
 
06:22:49.030 --> 06:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
like I was saying when my kids went to
 
06:22:51.150 --> 06:22:51.160 align:start position:0%
the library they had to be able to
 
06:22:53.230 --> 06:22:53.240 align:start position:0%
cursively write their name to get the
 
06:22:56.628 --> 06:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
card so if you have kids going there
 
06:22:58.750 --> 06:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
they'll you know that's the Manchester
 
06:23:01.310 --> 06:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
one but at this point in time they were
 
06:23:03.150 --> 06:23:03.160 align:start position:0%
so proud of seeing their signature every
 
06:23:05.868 --> 06:23:05.878 align:start position:0%
single time so I don't see Tak my card
 
06:23:07.230 --> 06:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
so I guess at this point I'm just
 
06:23:09.830 --> 06:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
explaining to you that not everybody you
 
06:23:13.670 --> 06:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
know as far as as the kids I don't know
 
06:23:17.548 --> 06:23:17.558 align:start position:0%
if I see that parents doing that
 
06:23:19.910 --> 06:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
so I I don't I'm not sure there's a
 
06:23:21.910 --> 06:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
question there maybe maybe there is I
 
06:23:24.110 --> 06:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
think it's a more ter ter approach but I
 
06:23:26.628 --> 06:23:26.638 align:start position:0%
I mean I understand the making the kids
 
06:23:28.190 --> 06:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
are like when the kids go into the
 
06:23:29.788 --> 06:23:29.798 align:start position:0%
library and they don't have a card yet
 
06:23:31.150 --> 06:23:31.160 align:start position:0%
but they can write their name they're
 
06:23:32.510 --> 06:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
going to give them a card and they're
 
06:23:34.468 --> 06:23:34.478 align:start position:0%
the kids are going to be happy about it
 
06:23:35.750 --> 06:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's the way it works in Manchester
 
06:23:37.150 --> 06:23:37.160 align:start position:0%
sure well I think you know part of my I
 
06:23:38.830 --> 06:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
guess my response would be Again part of
 
06:23:41.230 --> 06:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
I think the way to address this is right
 
06:23:43.310 --> 06:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
continued parental involvement right and
 
06:23:44.868 --> 06:23:44.878 align:start position:0%
with respect to what the child is doing
 
06:23:46.868 --> 06:23:46.878 align:start position:0%
be aware and having constant and
 
06:23:48.430 --> 06:23:48.440 align:start position:0%
effective Communications with one
 
06:23:50.510 --> 06:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
children I mean I think it is not
 
06:23:52.628 --> 06:23:52.638 align:start position:0%
unreasonable in these situations I think
 
06:23:54.390 --> 06:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
when a parent does not want their
 
06:23:56.030 --> 06:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
children to have access to information
 
06:23:58.670 --> 06:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
without them knowing to say you were not
 
06:24:00.190 --> 06:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to allow you to get a card
 
06:24:01.390 --> 06:24:01.400 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't get a card I'm going to
 
06:24:02.750 --> 06:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
tell the library you shouldn't get a
 
06:24:04.868 --> 06:24:04.878 align:start position:0%
card but here's my library card which
 
06:24:07.230 --> 06:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
gives the parent all degree of access
 
06:24:09.030 --> 06:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
then with respect to the borrowing uh
 
06:24:10.430 --> 06:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
history that would be I think my
 
06:24:11.910 --> 06:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
preference rather than what I think is a
 
06:24:15.150 --> 06:24:15.160 align:start position:0%
sweeping law here um that that has
 
06:24:16.990 --> 06:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
privacy implications from my vantage
 
06:24:19.030 --> 06:24:19.040 align:start position:0%
point all right thank you very much
 
06:24:21.670 --> 06:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair sorry representative
 
06:24:24.948 --> 06:24:24.958 align:start position:0%
trip uh you made you raised a
 
06:24:30.310 --> 06:24:30.320 align:start position:0%
interesting point uh our minor children
 
06:24:32.830 --> 06:24:32.840 align:start position:0%
allowed to get their own card without
 
06:24:35.390 --> 06:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
the parents' permission
 
06:24:36.628 --> 06:24:36.638 align:start position:0%
it's a great I actually don't know I
 
06:24:39.110 --> 06:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
would defer to uh the librarian
 
06:24:42.750 --> 06:24:42.760 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh here today um I
 
06:24:44.788 --> 06:24:44.798 align:start position:0%
whether they can get a card for
 
06:24:47.628 --> 06:24:47.638 align:start position:0%
themselves without parental permission
 
06:24:49.868 --> 06:24:49.878 align:start position:0%
yeah I I would defer to the Librarians
 
06:24:53.190 --> 06:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:57.030 --> 06:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
question the gentleman says no all right
 
06:24:58.230 --> 06:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much thank you Mr
 
06:24:59.670 --> 06:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
chair thank you all right anyone else
 
06:25:02.948 --> 06:25:02.958 align:start position:0%
who wishes to testify on HB
 
06:25:05.310 --> 06:25:05.320 align:start position:0%
273 right seeing none I'm going to close
 
06:25:08.310 --> 06:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
the hearing on HB 273 before I let
 
06:25:11.948 --> 06:25:11.958 align:start position:0%
everyone go I want to raise this issue
 
06:25:14.830 --> 06:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
and I I know we're late but I I also
 
06:25:18.590 --> 06:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
know we have a lot of bills and um I
 
06:25:21.070 --> 06:25:21.080 align:start position:0%
think executing them all is going to be
 
06:25:23.548 --> 06:25:23.558 align:start position:0%
is going to be a challenge so if we can
 
06:25:26.628 --> 06:25:26.638 align:start position:0%
get rid of the executive on on two which
 
06:25:30.390 --> 06:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
I hope are we would all be agreeable on
 
06:25:32.708 --> 06:25:32.718 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to do that so what i s what
 
06:25:34.948 --> 06:25:34.958 align:start position:0%
I would suggest is and I'm going to ask
 
06:25:37.708 --> 06:25:37.718 align:start position:0%
just for a show of hands initially I
 
06:25:41.230 --> 06:25:41.240 align:start position:0%
would propose that we exec now House
 
06:25:44.430 --> 06:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 98 that's representative tur's bill
 
06:25:47.830 --> 06:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
on the assistant manager uh which is the
 
06:25:50.110 --> 06:25:50.120 align:start position:0%
bill we passed last year and I would
 
06:25:53.110 --> 06:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
also propose that we exact House Bill
 
06:25:55.510 --> 06:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
164 FN which is representative
 
06:25:57.430 --> 06:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
Alexander's bill on local records
 
06:26:01.708 --> 06:26:01.718 align:start position:0%
retention which we passed last year um
 
06:26:03.270 --> 06:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
which and I when I say we I mean the
 
06:26:05.270 --> 06:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
house passed but both of these bills
 
06:26:11.110 --> 06:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
last year um and so um you know I I I
 
06:26:13.390 --> 06:26:13.400 align:start position:0%
think and I this is what I'm really
 
06:26:17.310 --> 06:26:17.320 align:start position:0%
asking are I think that these should not
 
06:26:19.750 --> 06:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
be controversial and that we would have
 
06:26:22.150 --> 06:26:22.160 align:start position:0%
strong bipartisan support for both of
 
06:26:24.868 --> 06:26:24.878 align:start position:0%
them Mr chair I I completely agree with
 
06:26:27.190 --> 06:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
you I would like to actually see if the
 
06:26:29.430 --> 06:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
committee would be willing to do 376 as
 
06:26:32.750 --> 06:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
well um that was the library right to
 
06:26:34.868 --> 06:26:34.878 align:start position:0%
know um
 
06:26:36.310 --> 06:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
I it seemed to me with the public
 
06:26:38.350 --> 06:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
hearing there was broad agreement on it
 
06:26:39.788 --> 06:26:39.798 align:start position:0%
um but I just want to leave that for the
 
06:26:42.670 --> 06:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
committee as well I'm I'm I am willing
 
06:26:44.190 --> 06:26:44.200 align:start position:0%
you know what why don't we let's let's
 
06:26:46.350 --> 06:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
let's sort of just let's just take let's
 
06:26:48.548 --> 06:26:48.558 align:start position:0%
just take these in order can I just ask
 
06:26:50.468 --> 06:26:50.478 align:start position:0%
informally this is in no way a formal
 
06:26:53.548 --> 06:26:53.558 align:start position:0%
vote informally how many would be
 
06:26:55.830 --> 06:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
06:27:00.708 --> 06:27:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh uh to exec and pass HB 98 that's
 
06:27:07.788 --> 06:27:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:09.910 --> 06:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative burgon or where are you
 
06:27:16.628 --> 06:27:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:28.948 --> 06:27:28.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:32.910 --> 06:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
yeah oh so I don't have 98 right here
 
06:27:34.628 --> 06:27:34.638 align:start position:0%

06:27:41.548 --> 06:27:41.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:44.190 --> 06:27:44.200 align:start position:0%
all all right so let me just let me let
 
06:27:47.190 --> 06:27:47.200 align:start position:0%
me just ask is there anyone here who is
 
06:27:50.628 --> 06:27:50.638 align:start position:0%
opposed to executing House Bill 98 that
 
06:27:53.030 --> 06:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
is representative tur bill from last
 
06:27:55.390 --> 06:27:55.400 align:start position:0%
year which we
 
06:27:58.390 --> 06:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
passed all right seeing none then I'm
 
06:28:02.190 --> 06:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
going to then um I would uh recognize
 
06:28:12.948 --> 06:28:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:15.628 --> 06:28:15.638 align:start position:0%
thank thank you I would like to move or
 
06:28:19.270 --> 06:28:19.280 align:start position:0%
to pass on House Bill 98 relative to
 
06:28:22.590 --> 06:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
professional limited liability company
 
06:28:25.788 --> 06:28:25.798 align:start position:0%
assistant manager status right do we
 
06:28:27.390 --> 06:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
have a second in
 
06:28:30.430 --> 06:28:30.440 align:start position:0%
that seconded by representative Burch
 
06:28:32.270 --> 06:28:32.280 align:start position:0%
but uh representative Smith would you
 
06:28:34.910 --> 06:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
like to speak your briefly it we had
 
06:28:38.910 --> 06:28:38.920 align:start position:0%
extensive testimony last year um
 
06:28:41.390 --> 06:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
and for reasons that had nothing to do
 
06:28:43.070 --> 06:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
with the merits of the bill the bill
 
06:28:45.628 --> 06:28:45.638 align:start position:0%
didn't make it to
 
06:28:50.390 --> 06:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
um uh the final line and um I would
 
06:28:52.510 --> 06:28:52.520 align:start position:0%
suggest that it is appropriate for us
 
06:28:56.070 --> 06:28:56.080 align:start position:0%
now to pass this bill and one would hope
 
06:29:00.230 --> 06:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
unanimously and send it to the floor um
 
06:29:05.350 --> 06:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh absent uh fiscal note um
 
06:29:08.430 --> 06:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
to uh to send it to the floor without
 
06:29:10.190 --> 06:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
having any to even debate it on the
 
06:29:14.110 --> 06:29:14.120 align:start position:0%
floor because it does address a problem
 
06:29:16.590 --> 06:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
that could be easily solved by this bill
 
06:29:19.030 --> 06:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
and should be solved In fairness all
 
06:29:21.750 --> 06:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
right anyone else wish to be heard on um
 
06:29:21.760 --> 06:29:22.948 align:start position:0%
right anyone else wish to be heard on um

passed uh by the house last year it's I
 
06:31:23.270 --> 06:31:23.280 align:start position:0%
it seems to me it's a very sensible and
 
06:31:25.548 --> 06:31:25.558 align:start position:0%
also very important bill that that calls
 
06:31:28.190 --> 06:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
for um
 
06:31:31.190 --> 06:31:31.200 align:start position:0%

just as for a show of hands is maybe the
 
06:31:36.750 --> 06:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
best way to do that is there anybody
 
06:31:37.830 --> 06:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
that would
 
06:31:44.030 --> 06:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
oppose um exing HB 164 FN right
 
06:31:47.628 --> 06:31:47.638 align:start position:0%

06:33:02.110 --> 06:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
a we can't we can't do this on consent
 
06:33:03.510 --> 06:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
right we can't do it on consent all
 
06:33:06.030 --> 06:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
right um oh wait a minute is
 
06:33:09.150 --> 06:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
there there's it has a fiscal note
 
06:33:12.670 --> 06:33:12.680 align:start position:0%
there's $150,000 cost to be it's this is
 
06:33:14.350 --> 06:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
going to go to for finance it's going to
 
06:33:17.150 --> 06:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
go to finance next but um um I think we
 
06:33:18.910 --> 06:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
can't even put it on consent because
 
06:33:20.788 --> 06:33:20.798 align:start position:0%
yeah we can't because spend money so
 
06:33:22.030 --> 06:33:22.040 align:start position:0%
it'll go on it'll go on the regular
 
06:33:23.230 --> 06:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
calendar I bet it might end up in the
 
06:33:25.468 --> 06:33:25.478 align:start position:0%
budget too uh representative Alexander
 
06:33:27.590 --> 06:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
can you write the report on this okay
 
06:33:28.708 --> 06:33:28.718 align:start position:0%

06:33:30.030 --> 06:33:30.040 align:start position:0%
representative Smith and representative
 
06:33:32.548 --> 06:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
Alexander could I ask you please if you
 
06:33:35.468 --> 06:33:35.478 align:start position:0%
could get the report to me by say
 
06:33:37.948 --> 06:33:37.958 align:start position:0%
tomorrow evening by tomorrow at the end
 
06:33:39.750 --> 06:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
of the day and I think probably you can
 
06:33:41.948 --> 06:33:41.958 align:start position:0%
both write you can both just copy the
 
06:33:43.510 --> 06:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
reports that you wrote last year
 
06:33:45.388 --> 06:33:45.398 align:start position:0%
changing the
 
06:33:52.110 --> 06:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:52.120 --> 06:33:55.270 align:start position:0%
 
Beil

06:33:55.270 --> 06:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:59.190 --> 06:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
cic all right um all right so let me
 
06:34:01.468 --> 06:34:01.478 align:start position:0%
turn to the last one we arguably could
 
06:34:05.910 --> 06:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
could EXA exact and that is H B
 
06:34:08.628 --> 06:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
376 is I don't know representative
 
06:34:09.750 --> 06:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
Alexander believes that there's a
 
06:34:12.910 --> 06:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
consensus on this uh um if if if there
 
06:34:16.190 --> 06:34:16.200 align:start position:0%
is can I ask is anybody would anybody be
 
06:34:19.350 --> 06:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
opposed to executing HB
 
06:34:19.360 --> 06:34:22.948 align:start position:0%
opposed to executing HB
376

06:34:22.948 --> 06:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:25.270 --> 06:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
now and I
 
06:34:28.590 --> 06:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
assume I missed the hearing and so I'm a
 
06:34:28.600 --> 06:34:30.750 align:start position:0%
assume I missed the hearing and so I'm a
little

06:34:30.750 --> 06:34:30.760 align:start position:0%
little
 
06:34:34.590 --> 06:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
behind the AIL on this one I'm apologize
 
06:34:38.310 --> 06:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:40.350 --> 06:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
understand this is the one that would
 
06:34:43.110 --> 06:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
have the that that would it would
 
06:34:44.948 --> 06:34:44.958 align:start position:0%
basically say you know the current law
 
06:34:49.310 --> 06:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
says you Library user and this would say
 
06:34:53.510 --> 06:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
that that includes the library card and
 
06:34:56.230 --> 06:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
the uh Library membership Library
 
06:34:56.240 --> 06:34:58.468 align:start position:0%
the uh Library membership Library
membership

06:34:58.468 --> 06:34:58.478 align:start position:0%
membership
 
06:35:01.670 --> 06:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
status representative Manos I I
 
06:35:04.468 --> 06:35:04.478 align:start position:0%
personally would rather refrain and
 
06:35:08.230 --> 06:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
think about it particularly given that
 
06:35:11.310 --> 06:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
uh representative Smith wasn't
 
06:35:13.510 --> 06:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
here all right
 
06:35:15.788 --> 06:35:15.798 align:start position:0%
um and representative Smith you I take
 
06:35:19.110 --> 06:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
it you have you well I don't know yeah
 
06:35:22.830 --> 06:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
no no no I think I yeah no listen I I
 
06:35:24.590 --> 06:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
hear you and
 
06:35:27.270 --> 06:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I should I should say just so
 
06:35:30.230 --> 06:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
there's no misunderstanding despite the
 
06:35:32.990 --> 06:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
questions that I had for the the prime
 
06:35:35.310 --> 06:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
sponsor I also will support this bill
 
06:35:36.430 --> 06:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
because I think it makes I think it
 
06:35:39.310 --> 06:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of sense um but nonetheless
 
06:35:41.388 --> 06:35:41.398 align:start position:0%
I think given given representative Manos
 
06:35:44.350 --> 06:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
is concerned and also given the hour um
 
06:35:46.388 --> 06:35:46.398 align:start position:0%
I think I'm gonna I'm going to pass on
 
06:35:48.350 --> 06:35:48.360 align:start position:0%
executing that representative I I would
 
06:35:50.070 --> 06:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
just agree not I think it's entirely
 
06:35:51.190 --> 06:35:51.200 align:start position:0%
possible that there will be a broad
 
06:35:52.590 --> 06:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
support I just think there were a lot of
 
06:35:54.310 --> 06:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
questions and it might be worthwhile for
 
06:35:55.948 --> 06:35:55.958 align:start position:0%
us to have some I don't want to I don't
 
06:35:58.350 --> 06:35:58.360 align:start position:0%
want to I don't want to take do this if
 
06:36:00.590 --> 06:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
anybody has any concerns so we'll uh
 
06:36:03.868 --> 06:36:03.878 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone for a long day I very
 
06:36:09.788 --> 06:36:09.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:14.868 --> 06:36:14.878 align:start position:0%
we'll I'm I'm done yes AB um as I think
 
06:36:18.830 --> 06:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
every excuse me hang on let's listen to
 
06:36:23.590 --> 06:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
representative it it is my understanding
 
06:36:25.510 --> 06:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
that on
 
06:36:28.030 --> 06:36:28.040 align:start position:0%
Monday well now let me reword this could
 
06:36:32.990 --> 06:36:33.000 align:start position:0%
you please Mr chair explain to us what
 
06:36:36.190 --> 06:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
we should anticipate on Monday yes I I
 
06:36:38.070 --> 06:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
will do that now that's a very so first
 
06:36:41.350 --> 06:36:41.360 align:start position:0%
of all the the the
 
06:36:47.150 --> 06:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
amendment is is I believe is now public
 
06:36:49.670 --> 06:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
I mean it under the rules it has to be
 
06:36:52.788 --> 06:36:52.798 align:start position:0%
it has to be public uh for at least 24
 
06:36:54.868 --> 06:36:54.878 align:start position:0%
or 40 I don't remember which but anyway
 
06:36:56.830 --> 06:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
it the the amendment should be public so
 
06:36:59.910 --> 06:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
what will what I anticipate will happen
 
06:37:02.910 --> 06:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
on Monday is that we will have a hearing
 
06:37:06.548 --> 06:37:06.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:09.510 --> 06:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
476 at some point when that hearing is
 
06:37:11.628 --> 06:37:11.638 align:start position:0%
over we will have a hearing on the non
 
06:37:13.628 --> 06:37:13.638 align:start position:0%
gerain amendment to HB
 
06:37:17.430 --> 06:37:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:21.388 --> 06:37:21.398 align:start position:0%
then everyone should be prepared for
 
06:37:23.990 --> 06:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
executing the bill and the non gerain
 
06:37:27.230 --> 06:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment at the end of that hearing
 
06:37:30.190 --> 06:37:30.200 align:start position:0%
um can I absolutely guarantee that we
 
06:37:32.030 --> 06:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
will do that no but everybody should be
 
06:37:36.150 --> 06:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
on on board that you know that is that
 
06:37:38.510 --> 06:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
is a very definite possibility that we
 
06:37:41.590 --> 06:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
will do that and so you should you know
 
06:37:43.750 --> 06:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
both caucuses should have all their
 
06:37:48.830 --> 06:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
people present or substitutes okay
 
06:37:51.830 --> 06:37:51.840 align:start position:0%

or we would have to do
 
06:39:00.708 --> 06:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
