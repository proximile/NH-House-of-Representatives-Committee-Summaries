it being 10 o'clock we'll start the work
 
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
so do I have anybody out there that
 
00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
would like to uh comment uh Mike or
 
00:03:48.360 --> 00:04:05.149 align:start position:0%
would like to uh comment uh Mike or
foreign

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 align:start position:0%
if you want to take a seat and use your
 
00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 align:start position:0%
mic I was reminded by former chair
 
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:12.420 align:start position:0%
umberger that none of us used our mics
 
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
at the last uh discussion we had nobody
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
could hear us so please use your mics
 
00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
will be great thanks uh thank you Mr
 
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
chairman uh for the record Marty Carlin
 
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.590 align:start position:0%
retirement system
um

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 align:start position:0%
hb50 is um fairly straightforward and
 
00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 align:start position:0%
something this Committee in both members
 
00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 align:start position:0%
of the House incentive seen in Prior
 
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
years uh the spillwood
 
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
um as written uh have the state pay
 
00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 align:start position:0%
seven and a half percent of the local
 
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 align:start position:0%
employer contribution
 
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
costs for uh its employ for their
 
00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
teachers police and fire members to nhrs
 
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
so From nhrs's perspective this this
 
00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
bill has no impact on either the
 
00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability or the amount of
 
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 align:start position:0%
funds we receive in a given year out of
 
00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
employer contributions it just simply
 
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
comes out of a different pocket
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
um one question that um one of the
 
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 align:start position:0%
members on finance asked is
 
00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 align:start position:0%
is there any way actually to project if
 
00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:19.979 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass you know what
 
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
salaries would salaries increase for
 
00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 align:start position:0%
um different employers and that that's
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
there are too many variables in that
 
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
question to for the naturitis accurately
 
00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 align:start position:0%
perform we do have what's called a
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
payroll growth assumption and we would
 
00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 align:start position:0%
assume in a vacuum that you know
 
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 align:start position:0%
um you know the payroll would grow at a
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
steady Pace every year we know that's
 
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
not the case but for police and fire
 
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
it's 2.75
 
00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
2.25 for teachers so whatever the amount
 
00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal note
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
um you know for for next year
 
00:05:59.270 --> 00:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
um that was put in that's basically
 
00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 align:start position:0%
previously contributed amounts from
 
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
fiscal 21 rolled forward at that
 
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
Inc that those rates have increased and
 
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
that that's how we would see the bill
 
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
playing out obviously
 
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
um salaries are going to differ between
 
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
communities raises are going to be
 
00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.310 align:start position:0%
communities raises are going to be
different

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
um that's a percent of covered payroll
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
so if um employers were to add staff
 
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
that's going to increase payroll uh
 
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
things like that so there's too many
 
00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 align:start position:0%
variables to predict what impact on
 
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
local spending this subsidy would have
 
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 align:start position:0%
this is something that had been in
 
00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 align:start position:0%
effect since 1977 through fiscal uh
 
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.409 align:start position:0%
effect since 1977 through fiscal uh
2011.

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 align:start position:0%
2011.
 
00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:40.990 align:start position:0%
2011.
uh

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
and uh I think that's basically you know
 
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 align:start position:0%
my questions that I wanted to address
 
00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
that my colleagues last week didn't have
 
00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
at their fingertips
 
00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:54.180 align:start position:0%
Marty could you spell your last name for
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
the clerk oh sure k-a-r
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 align:start position:0%
just a little heads up for those of you
 
00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
that have never been on a Division
 
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.730 align:start position:0%
that have never been on a Division
before

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:06.740 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
what we'll do is we'll take we can take
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
testimony or if you have questions of
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
someone that may be sitting here you're
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
free to ask them what we'll do at the
 
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
end we can hold on to the bill
 
00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 align:start position:0%
we can pass the bill we can itl the bill
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
what we'll do is be making a
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation to the full committee
 
00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:29.580 align:start position:0%
whoever makes that motion has to write
 
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 align:start position:0%
the committee report for the committee
 
00:07:34.129 --> 00:07:34.139 align:start position:0%
so if you're making a motion be prepared
 
00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:37.099 align:start position:0%
to write the committee report
 
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I know you have
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
questions on this bill
 
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:44.120 align:start position:0%
you know me too well
 
00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Carlin for coming
 
00:07:46.979 --> 00:07:47.570 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Carlin for coming
um

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:47.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.029 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
this is maybe not so much on the bills
 
00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
per se but on what you just said all
 
00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
right so you just said that your
 
00:07:58.129 --> 00:07:58.139 align:start position:0%
assumptions are that salaries are going
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
to go up by two point something percent
 
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.730 align:start position:0%
to go up by two point something percent
right

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:01.740 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
um but I believe that this committee is
 
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:05.940 align:start position:0%
as a whole is contemplating state
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
salaries going up more like five percent
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
per year for the next two years uh for
 
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:14.340 align:start position:0%
this biennium and so
 
00:08:16.189 --> 00:08:16.199 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me you're really
 
00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:18.529 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me you're really
underestimating

00:08:18.529 --> 00:08:18.539 align:start position:0%
underestimating
 
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:20.220 align:start position:0%
um are those things are those things
 
00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:22.220 align:start position:0%
that you just said likely to change soon
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
we we
 
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:26.340 align:start position:0%
um when we talk about our assumptions
 
00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:29.340 align:start position:0%
including salary growth those those are
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
reviewed uh and updated as needed in any
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
actual experience studies which are
 
00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
conducted every four years uh the next
 
00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:40.740 align:start position:0%
one that we have is in um
 
00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240 align:start position:0%
it's it closer fiscal 23 so
 
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
um spring of uh 24 is when the board
 
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:49.380 align:start position:0%
will be looking at recommendations from
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
the actuaries and it's not so it's not
 
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
nothing we're looking at you know
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
today's rate of inflation and adjusting
 
00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
on the Fly uh you know there are
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
assumptions that um we hope are
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable over a longer period
 
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.190 align:start position:0%
reasonable over a longer period
historically

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:04.200 align:start position:0%
historically
 
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:05.820 align:start position:0%
um our payroll growth assumption has
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
lagged wages over the last decade we
 
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
last adjusted I think we kept it at 275
 
00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:14.220 align:start position:0%
and 225.
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
no I think it was three percent and two
 
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
two and a half uh the uh in the 2019 and
 
00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:21.480 align:start position:0%
before the 2019 experience study so it's
 
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.730 align:start position:0%
before the 2019 experience study so it's
something

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
um we we look at but
 
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
um you know it we don't expect it every
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
year that to be a straight line it's you
 
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
know over you know 10 or 20 or 30 year
 
00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:33.899 align:start position:0%
period that it's going to average out to
 
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
something in that range
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I'd like to make a ask a
 
00:09:41.389 --> 00:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
related question so if salaries are
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
accelerating faster than you currently
 
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:46.740 align:start position:0%
expect does that is that have sort of an
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
outsized effect on the unfunded
 
00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
liability because
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
it because we pay the benefits are
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
related to the top average of the top
 
00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.019 align:start position:0%
five years right so if we if somebody
 
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:03.660 align:start position:0%
gets all of a sudden a big raise that
 
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
that affects their top five years so so
 
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:09.480 align:start position:0%
it directly affects benefits but on the
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
other hand it doesn't change what we
 
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:14.700 align:start position:0%
have saved at all right we have a
 
00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
certain amount saved to pay those
 
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:19.380 align:start position:0%
benefits right so so it must
 
00:10:22.310 --> 00:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
have a big effect on unfunded liability
 
00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
is that correct it's it's sort of a
 
00:10:26.449 --> 00:10:26.459 align:start position:0%
double-edged sword uh in the sense that
 
00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
a salaries outpace expectations and
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
projected benefits are based on average
 
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:34.260 align:start position:0%
final salary on a five-year average for
 
00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:37.200 align:start position:0%
most people who are working right now so
 
00:10:40.009 --> 00:10:40.019 align:start position:0%
you know that has upward pressure on the
 
00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:42.839 align:start position:0%
liability however we're also receiving
 
00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:45.060 align:start position:0%
more in contributions than we expected
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
in a given year because the payroll is
 
00:10:49.009 --> 00:10:49.019 align:start position:0%
higher than we expected so that's money
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
in Money that we're investing now money
 
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
that we're paying you putting towards
 
00:10:54.949 --> 00:10:54.959 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability so there's a
 
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
there's a positive and a negative effect
 
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it is depends on
 
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.889 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it is depends on
foreign

00:11:02.889 --> 00:11:02.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:05.820 align:start position:0%
increases are these rewarding people
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
closer to retirement are these starting
 
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
wages that are increasing there's a
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of variables to tease out
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
to see ultimately what the impact is but
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
there's there's sort of a double-edged
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
sword with that you know a positive and
 
00:11:23.509 --> 00:11:23.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:31.140 align:start position:0%
um this is similar to the bill that we
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
had last year and I think that the
 
00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
amount of money involved with something
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
like 50 million dollars
 
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh that there was a one-time payment uh
 
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
and I believe it was House Bill 1221
 
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
last year and that that was an after the
 
00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
fact reimbursement of a percentage of
 
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
fiscal 22 contributions uh I I thought
 
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
that ended up being in the 26 27 million
 
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:55.620 align:start position:0%
range and
 
00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:58.019 align:start position:0%
um I think this this fiscal note is a
 
00:11:59.389 --> 00:11:59.399 align:start position:0%
little bit higher but it gets rolling
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
forward projecting a larger covered
 
00:12:04.610 --> 00:12:04.620 align:start position:0%
payroll and if I if I may too I realize
 
00:12:06.769 --> 00:12:06.779 align:start position:0%
there are probably some newer members
 
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
either on finance or new to retirement
 
00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:10.380 align:start position:0%
issues so I just wanted to double back
 
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
and when we talk about employer
 
00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:13.500 align:start position:0%
contribution rates I just want to make
 
00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899 align:start position:0%
sure everyone understands our employer
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
rates are set by the actuary and they're
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
a percentage of of covered payroll so
 
00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:22.740 align:start position:0%
for all the pensionable wages that the
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
employees and other members are earning
 
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
the employers are paying a percentage of
 
00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
that to nhrs the rates are different for
 
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
the four member groups employees
 
00:12:34.069 --> 00:12:34.079 align:start position:0%
teachers police and fire
 
00:12:37.009 --> 00:12:37.019 align:start position:0%
um so you know there are so it's a
 
00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:40.100 align:start position:0%
percentage of the total payroll
 
00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:44.820 align:start position:0%
so that that leads me to a question
 
00:12:49.129 --> 00:12:49.139 align:start position:0%
um we know now based on uh the last bill
 
00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
how much money was involved has anyone
 
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
analyzed that money to see
 
00:12:58.850 --> 00:12:58.860 align:start position:0%
if uh if
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh what what the distribution would be
 
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
by town
 
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
if the state in place of a bill like
 
00:13:09.710 --> 00:13:09.720 align:start position:0%
this just were to take that 27 million
 
00:13:12.889 --> 00:13:12.899 align:start position:0%
dollars and give it to the towns across
 
00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
the board based on population
 
00:13:18.350 --> 00:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
and I'd I'd like to see the figures that
 
00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
would would result because I suspect
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
What's Happening Here
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
is that the small towns are subsidizing
 
00:13:27.050 --> 00:13:27.060 align:start position:0%
the large cities
 
00:13:29.150 --> 00:13:29.160 align:start position:0%
I may be wrong I haven't seen the
 
00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:33.060 align:start position:0%
figures but that's my my gut feel is
 
00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
that uh I live in a town that has very
 
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
few full-time employees
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
so the retirement pay what they pay into
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
the retirement is is probably less per
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
capita than a big city does
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
so I'm kind of interested to see those
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
figures of those available we can we can
 
00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:56.220 align:start position:0%
pull together and share the um the town
 
00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
by town and school school districts what
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
they received under uh HB 1221 last year
 
00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
again it was a percentage of the total
 
00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
contribution so certainly mon Vernon got
 
00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
a lot less the Dash rule but as a
 
00:14:11.449 --> 00:14:11.459 align:start position:0%
percentage of what you put in it's the
 
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
same amount but we can get that we
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
um because of the way uh wages and
 
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
contributions are reported to us and and
 
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:20.810 align:start position:0%
contributions are reported to us and and
some

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:22.740 align:start position:0%
um you know when we begin to close the
 
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:25.200 align:start position:0%
books after the fiscal year
 
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
um you know there's some reconciliation
 
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
issues with numbers so we I think we
 
00:14:30.949 --> 00:14:30.959 align:start position:0%
have in town by Town information on all
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
but for employers that were still
 
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:35.519 align:start position:0%
working with them to to True up exactly
 
00:14:38.269 --> 00:14:38.279 align:start position:0%
what they gave us and to for them to get
 
00:14:39.889 --> 00:14:39.899 align:start position:0%
their reimbursement from the state we
 
00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:42.660 align:start position:0%
the money and that to help us build 1221
 
00:14:44.569 --> 00:14:44.579 align:start position:0%
last year wasn't from nhrs I was a
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation and it went
 
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
through the treasury uh you know with
 
00:14:51.170 --> 00:14:51.180 align:start position:0%
the assistance of dra but I can I can
 
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
get you that list of what people got
 
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
I'll send it to the
 
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
full committee or
 
00:14:59.569 --> 00:14:59.579 align:start position:0%
if there's an email for such a group
 
00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you I would appreciate that
 
00:15:07.009 --> 00:15:07.019 align:start position:0%
further questions representative evil
 
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:15:11.569 --> 00:15:11.579 align:start position:0%
um I am new to the committee meeting so
 
00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:15.060 align:start position:0%
this is rather a basic question so um
 
00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for this for other people but
 
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
I I really would like to just go back to
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
the um the origination story of the
 
00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
relationship between the towns and the
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
state and and how this came to pass and
 
00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:34.500 align:start position:0%
part of my interest is whether the towns
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
would have entered into this agreement
 
00:15:40.129 --> 00:15:40.139 align:start position:0%
if the if they'd known that the state
 
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:43.260 align:start position:0%
might later renege on it so any you
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
anything you can help me with I I do
 
00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
have a a
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
document that talks about employer
 
00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
contributions that I can send over to
 
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
the committee I'll summarize now but
 
00:15:58.069 --> 00:15:58.079 align:start position:0%
just just to have because because there
 
00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
are um you know there's some I've seen
 
00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
that commentary for many years in many
 
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
places and I've never been able to in my
 
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
research to to completely prove or
 
00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
disprove that contention
 
00:16:14.210 --> 00:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
um you know I I can tell you that when
 
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
nhrs was Consolidated from four separate
 
00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:20.279 align:start position:0%
plans back in the 60s uh originally
 
00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:23.339 align:start position:0%
there was a 40 reimbursement for Teacher
 
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
contributions by local school districts
 
00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
and that was a carryover from the the
 
00:16:30.530 --> 00:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
teachers retirement system which was the
 
00:16:32.689 --> 00:16:32.699 align:start position:0%
predecessor plan and that the state had
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
been doing that 40 percent as far as I
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
can see back at least until the early
 
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
1950s possibly all along
 
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
um we um the discussion and deliberation
 
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:46.320 align:start position:0%
of the college consolidation back in 67
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
aren't available online they may be in
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
the state archives and I've never had
 
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
the 48 hours or so for you to go over
 
00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:55.860 align:start position:0%
there and bury myself in it because I'm
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
quite interested in seeing what that
 
00:16:59.530 --> 00:16:59.540 align:start position:0%
what that was but I've never found a
 
00:17:02.449 --> 00:17:02.459 align:start position:0%
letter from a retirement system or the
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
municipal Association or the state or
 
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
news clipping or anything that
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
specifically said this was a promise or
 
00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:11.459 align:start position:0%
this wasn't so I can't give you a
 
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
definitive answer on that I I do know
 
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
that in 1977 that 40 percent change uh
 
00:17:21.770 --> 00:17:21.780 align:start position:0%
the 40 State contribution was extended
 
00:17:24.409 --> 00:17:24.419 align:start position:0%
was reduced to 35 percent for schools
 
00:17:26.449 --> 00:17:26.459 align:start position:0%
but extended to group two police and
 
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
fire and that those amounts were paid
 
00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:31.370 align:start position:0%
fire and that those amounts were paid
through

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
um 2009 so 32 years in the legislature
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
at that time reduced it on a provisional
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
basis for two years to go up to 30
 
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:45.660 align:start position:0%
percent and 10 25 and 11 and back when
 
00:17:47.630 --> 00:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
it was changed in 09 it was going to
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
snap back to 35
 
00:17:51.049 --> 00:17:51.059 align:start position:0%
obviously the state's Financial picture
 
00:17:53.210 --> 00:17:53.220 align:start position:0%
change considerably was already under
 
00:17:56.870 --> 00:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
the Great Recession in 09 but it
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
continued so uh the at 11 the
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
legislature repealed that as a
 
00:18:04.310 --> 00:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
combination of the changes to the
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
pension benefits that reduce costs for
 
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
employers plus a a three and a half uh
 
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
percent approach three and a half
 
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
million appropriation from the state
 
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal 1213 employer rates it
 
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
they were paying what they would have
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
been paying you know had the 35 percent
 
00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:25.980 align:start position:0%
gone in and the plan not changed so
 
00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
those two years but then sort of the
 
00:18:30.529 --> 00:18:30.539 align:start position:0%
sticker shock hit the towns uh in the
 
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:33.240 align:start position:0%
1415 rates so they then they're out of
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
pocket dollars went a lot higher at that
 
00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
point so you know there's a lot of
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
pieces but that sort of origin story
 
00:18:42.169 --> 00:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
I've never been able to get
 
00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
further question
 
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
representative cambrell should I say say
 
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:05.100 align:start position:0%
I representative McGuire then yeah I
 
00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:06.419 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow up or ask
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative Evil's question in a
 
00:19:09.770 --> 00:19:09.780 align:start position:0%
slightly different way
 
00:19:12.529 --> 00:19:12.539 align:start position:0%
aren't municipalities and school
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
districts political subdivisions of the
 
00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:17.880 align:start position:0%
state and therefore to what extent do
 
00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:20.700 align:start position:0%
they have choice in in being part of the
 
00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
um for for and this this again dates
 
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
back to the predecessor plans as well
 
00:19:29.510 --> 00:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
but uh if you if you employ full-time
 
00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
teachers police or fire fighters those
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
positions of mandatory enrollment in the
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
retirement system so a town has no say
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know if you're gonna you're a small
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
town you want to hire a couple
 
00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
full-timers on the fire department
 
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:43.740 align:start position:0%
whatever those people are active
 
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
contributing members you know in group
 
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:46.789 align:start position:0%
contributing members you know in group
two

00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:19:50.289 --> 00:19:50.299 align:start position:0%
um you know the their some statutory
 
00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:52.740 align:start position:0%
exceptions to mandatory membership for
 
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
things like you know fixed term
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
appointments but generally speaking uh
 
00:19:59.450 --> 00:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
you know those positions are all in
 
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:01.380 align:start position:0%
um and for
 
00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:01.970 align:start position:0%
um and for
um

00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:04.610 --> 00:20:04.620 align:start position:0%
the state uh participation in the
 
00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:06.299 align:start position:0%
retirement system is mandatory for State
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire employees communities
 
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:11.580 align:start position:0%
May opt to enter the retirement system
 
00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
for their full-time employees capital E
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
you know your town hall folks your DPW
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
folks things like that that was also a
 
00:20:21.049 --> 00:20:21.059 align:start position:0%
component of what was then called the
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
state employees retirement system back
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
you know towns could do that back in the
 
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
40s and 50s as well so
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
um you know over the course of time you
 
00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
know we still see employers joining even
 
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
you know now in our our we always say we
 
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
have about 460 employers because that
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
number could change sometimes school
 
00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
districts bifurcate into two districts
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
or we pick up a small town up north that
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
never had anybody before things like
 
00:20:48.470 --> 00:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
that so so they have to have an
 
00:20:50.810 --> 00:20:50.820 align:start position:0%
affirmative vote of their governing body
 
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
to animation into the retirement system
 
00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:54.419 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
so that that's how they how they do it
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
for their ease Manchester never did for
 
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
its employees they had their own plan
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
um I don't know when that started Nashua
 
00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:05.460 align:start position:0%
DPW is another
 
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
separate retirement system you know
 
00:21:09.230 --> 00:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
completely outside of us for those
 
00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:11.820 align:start position:0%
employees in Nashua and some towns may
 
00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:12.710 align:start position:0%
employees in Nashua and some towns may
do

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:14.940 align:start position:0%
um Define contributions or you know Ira
 
00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:17.820 align:start position:0%
type setups you know for their plans you
 
00:21:19.310 --> 00:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
know we don't we don't know who's what
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
people who aren't in the system do if
 
00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:25.140 align:start position:0%
anything but that's how it works thank
 
00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.590 align:start position:0%
anything but that's how it works thank
you

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
so just following along so if I
 
00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
understand what you are saying there are
 
00:21:41.450 --> 00:21:41.460 align:start position:0%
certain employees of the political
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
subdivisions that have to be part of the
 
00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:46.980 align:start position:0%
retirement system and then
 
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
you folks set the amount that has to be
 
00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
paid into the retirement system for
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
those employees regardless of who's
 
00:21:59.330 --> 00:21:59.340 align:start position:0%
making the payment correct
 
00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:05.960 align:start position:0%
it's clear that you can't retire
 
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
apparently I can't get sick either but
 
00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:10.860 align:start position:0%
um we are coming back in tomorrow
 
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because I was Ill last
 
00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
week we couldn't do it to do a sort of
 
00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:17.220 align:start position:0%
an orientation bigger picture on the
 
00:22:18.830 --> 00:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
retirement system how it works for this
 
00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
committee tomorrow afternoon at three so
 
00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
it would have been better to have that
 
00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:25.980 align:start position:0%
before you guys got your hands in the
 
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.070 align:start position:0%
before you guys got your hands in the
Hamburg

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
Hamburg
 
00:22:30.169 --> 00:22:30.179 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler who's sitting in
 
00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
to keep an eye on representative Maguire
 
00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:35.390 align:start position:0%
to keep an eye on representative Maguire
okay

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:35.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr Carlin
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
looking at history of the system when we
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
when it first went everybody together
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
bringing in the towns as well as the
 
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
state employees my impression is
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
those outside the state employees were a
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
much smaller group than they are now and
 
00:22:56.649 --> 00:22:56.659 align:start position:0%
now I believe they're like 70 percent
 
00:23:00.110 --> 00:23:00.120 align:start position:0%
can you remember any of those figures
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
I I would have to look and see I I you
 
00:23:05.450 --> 00:23:05.460 align:start position:0%
know in general terms I believe you're
 
00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
correct I don't have any specific
 
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
numbers to to look back and confirm that
 
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.700 align:start position:0%
on I could I could try to research and I
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
know the the plan was much smaller you
 
00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:15.780 align:start position:0%
know obviously when we started in the
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
state was a larger employer or full-time
 
00:23:19.730 --> 00:23:19.740 align:start position:0%
employees I think a lot of towns have
 
00:23:22.850 --> 00:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
added well both you know things thinking
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
about you know the 70s I mean even you
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
know the 70s to the 90s the state's
 
00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
population grew so much certainly the
 
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:30.419 align:start position:0%
teacher population grew considerably and
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
probably Public Safety followed suit so
 
00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
you know I I think there's you know I
 
00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
see your point my point is that you know
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
that we never imagined there would be
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
this much growth which we've witnessed
 
00:23:44.029 --> 00:23:44.039 align:start position:0%
and I've seen a lot of our small towns
 
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
they start out with no one no employees
 
00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
except teachers they don't have they
 
00:23:51.890 --> 00:23:51.900 align:start position:0%
have on-call fire and on-call police and
 
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
then all of a sudden why don't we have
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
full time and so in my town I'm in 50
 
00:23:58.490 --> 00:23:58.500 align:start position:0%
some years there in the town I've seen
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
them go from zero to are now probably 40
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
or 50 and I think it's a pattern that's
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
that's repeated all across the state
 
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
which I mean we have to be aware of that
 
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
when we bring these things in that now
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
this is the major
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
part of the retirement system where it
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
at the Inception it was just a small
 
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
piece so I think that's that's
 
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.130 align:start position:0%
piece so I think that's that's
significant

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:22.140 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
we we do have a slide that we're
 
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
bringing along tomorrow but our head
 
00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:27.299 align:start position:0%
count of active members has been
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
relatively flat over the last 10 or 15
 
00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.029 align:start position:0%
relatively flat over the last 10 or 15
years

00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
um the the distribution is a little
 
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
different we did lose a number of state
 
00:24:37.970 --> 00:24:37.980 align:start position:0%
employees back in the nine two thousand
 
00:24:39.409 --> 00:24:39.419 align:start position:0%
nine eleven
 
00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:42.299 align:start position:0%
um layoffs that that that head counts a
 
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
little bit lower and we've also seen a
 
00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
decrease in the number of active
 
00:24:48.169 --> 00:24:48.179 align:start position:0%
teachers over time and that that seems
 
00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
to have rebounded a little in the past
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
couple years but netover net
 
00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:53.940 align:start position:0%
um and that that's a sort of an aging of
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire school aid population
 
00:24:57.649 --> 00:24:57.659 align:start position:0%
issued more than anything else but we've
 
00:24:59.390 --> 00:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
seen growth in the numbers on the police
 
00:25:01.789 --> 00:25:01.799 align:start position:0%
of fire and to some extent local
 
00:25:01.799 --> 00:25:04.789 align:start position:0%
of fire and to some extent local
employees

00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
all right um well you have one more
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
question yeah I'll well related to what
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
you just said so I'm 65 and I I'm at the
 
00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:18.840 align:start position:0%
peak of the baby boom so I'm guessing
 
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
that a lot of people are retiring right
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
now or have in recent years
 
00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:27.900 align:start position:0%
um is the overall number of current
 
00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
employees so so what I'm saying is is
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
hiring in general for all employees in
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
the system bigger than retirements or at
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
the moment retirement's bigger than
 
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:44.340 align:start position:0%
hiring uh you know the way and if
 
00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:46.140 align:start position:0%
there's somebody behind me by now from
 
00:25:48.110 --> 00:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
nhma maybe they could speak to that with
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
more Authority than I can I when we are
 
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
doing our head counts and things like
 
00:25:54.230 --> 00:25:54.240 align:start position:0%
that they're always point in time as of
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
June 30th so that's active members as of
 
00:25:59.450 --> 00:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
and retired members you know as of
 
00:26:02.149 --> 00:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
things like that and and as I said the
 
00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:04.440 align:start position:0%
active head count has been staying
 
00:26:06.169 --> 00:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
relatively flat I think it went up a
 
00:26:07.850 --> 00:26:07.860 align:start position:0%
couple hundred but you know that that
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about
 
00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:12.500 align:start position:0%
close to 49 000 members that's a small
 
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
uh variation year over year in the past
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
two years we have seen a higher number
 
00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
of retirements than we've had in the
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
prior you know three to four years
 
00:26:24.409 --> 00:26:24.419 align:start position:0%
behind that I think you know there was a
 
00:26:25.610 --> 00:26:25.620 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
um you know with covid you know there's
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of speculation on what teacher is
 
00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to bail and this and that and
 
00:26:31.909 --> 00:26:31.919 align:start position:0%
actually what we've seen is more a
 
00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:33.659 align:start position:0%
higher percentage on the public safety
 
00:26:36.169 --> 00:26:36.179 align:start position:0%
side particular police moving out there
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
may be a host of factors involved in
 
00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
that you know beyond demographics
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
um but we wouldn't speculate because
 
00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
because we don't know that you know
 
00:26:45.890 --> 00:26:45.900 align:start position:0%
exactly what what's driving an
 
00:26:48.409 --> 00:26:48.419 align:start position:0%
individual's choice
 
00:26:48.419 --> 00:26:49.490 align:start position:0%
individual's choice
foreign

00:26:49.490 --> 00:26:49.500 align:start position:0%

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.669 align:start position:0%
foreign
ER

00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
well we are we have to put together a
 
00:26:58.190 --> 00:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
balanced budget we rely on the ways and
 
00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
means to give us a projection for
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
roughly 27 months from the time we
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
finish this
 
00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
and they've been pretty accurate
 
00:27:09.529 --> 00:27:09.539 align:start position:0%
sometimes two percent or less
 
00:27:09.539 --> 00:27:10.909 align:start position:0%
sometimes two percent or less
and

00:27:10.909 --> 00:27:10.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
all the other things that are we doing
 
00:27:14.810 --> 00:27:14.820 align:start position:0%
the budget we say this is all you can
 
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:15.890 align:start position:0%
the budget we say this is all you can
spend

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
spend
 
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
this is an uncontrollable figure
 
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:21.360 align:start position:0%
as we've pointed out the small towns
 
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:23.100 align:start position:0%
keep adding people
 
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:26.700 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of pressure to give huge
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
increases in pay because of all the
 
00:27:28.919 --> 00:27:29.870 align:start position:0%
increases in pay because of all the
inflation

00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:29.880 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
those are things we have totally no
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
control over so for 27 months we have no
 
00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
idea what's 27 percent of what
 
00:27:41.570 --> 00:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
we have no clue
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
it could double
 
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299 align:start position:0%
and that all of a sudden would unbalance
 
00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:46.820 align:start position:0%
this budget and we'd have no control
 
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:49.020 align:start position:0%
they'd come back to us and say you
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
screwed up I don't want to hear that I
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
want to be able to say we presented a
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
budget it came out within a couple of
 
00:27:57.769 --> 00:27:57.779 align:start position:0%
percent of what we thought it would be
 
00:28:00.529 --> 00:28:00.539 align:start position:0%
we couldn't do that if we if we pass
 
00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
so Marty we'll be seeing you tomorrow at
 
00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
three o'clock maybe you can answer some
 
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:10.500 align:start position:0%
of the questions that representative
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
Ebel had put forward as far as the
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
history sounds like that would be a good
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
time to get that in there
 
00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
um Miss heck uh those questions that
 
00:28:23.029 --> 00:28:23.039 align:start position:0%
um representative Griffin had as far as
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
if we gave the 26 million dollars to the
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
towns versus this annual contribution
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
towards the retirement system maybe you
 
00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:32.580 align:start position:0%
could put those numbers together for us
 
00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:35.220 align:start position:0%
and oh you already have those
 
00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:49.020 align:start position:0%
my name is Catherine heck I'm with the
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association we
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
represent the 234 cities and towns or
 
00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions in New Hampshire
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to answer some of your
 
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
questions I do have a document to your
 
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.140 align:start position:0%
question representative Griffin that
 
00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
contains the amounts certified as of
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
September 30th I know there's an updated
 
00:29:12.049 --> 00:29:12.059 align:start position:0%
record but this is what I was able to
 
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
bring so you can have a look and see how
 
00:29:16.909 --> 00:29:16.919 align:start position:0%
this was distributed town by Town School
 
00:29:18.730 --> 00:29:18.740 align:start position:0%
District by school district
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
anecdotally for example the city of
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
Rochester received 163 thousand dollars
 
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
and the Rochester school district has
 
00:29:30.649 --> 00:29:30.659 align:start position:0%
received 395 thousand dollars that's for
 
00:29:33.230 --> 00:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
example the town of Allenstown received
 
00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
nineteen thousand dollars for an example
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
and the town of Epsom fifteen thousand
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
so you're correct that there's it really
 
00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:41.810 align:start position:0%
so you're correct that there's it really
is

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:29:43.549 --> 00:29:43.559 align:start position:0%
um dependent on the number of full-time
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
employees and to representative Weiler's
 
00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
point and it will vary significantly
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
town by Town School by school but then
 
00:29:54.889 --> 00:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
you can get a sense of what the impact
 
00:29:59.210 --> 00:29:59.220 align:start position:0%
was this this bill in particular when
 
00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
we're comparing House Bill 1221 last
 
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:03.419 align:start position:0%
year's bill which was a one-time payment
 
00:30:05.330 --> 00:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
that was structured a little bit
 
00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
differently it was 26.7 million dollars
 
00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
was the estimate and that was a
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
reimbursement so towns paid 100 percent
 
00:30:16.549 --> 00:30:16.559 align:start position:0%
and received a reimbursement based on
 
00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:19.460 align:start position:0%
this formula they reported it on the
 
00:30:21.769 --> 00:30:21.779 align:start position:0%
ms-434 the majority there were a few
 
00:30:24.230 --> 00:30:24.240 align:start position:0%
towns that it wasn't quite reconciled so
 
00:30:26.350 --> 00:30:26.360 align:start position:0%
therefore reporting it as Revenue
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
reduced the tax rate
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
because they didn't get their check till
 
00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
December so it's not as if they spent
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
the money the bill that we're looking at
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
today house bill 50 would reinstate 7.5
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
percent so it would reduce the cost so
 
00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:45.320 align:start position:0%
towns would only have to budget 92.5
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
therefore reducing their budget line
 
00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
when they're asking for the
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
appropriation on the front side so they
 
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
are a little bit different and the
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
one-time payment but I do think last
 
00:30:59.450 --> 00:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
year's one-time payment was very well
 
00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
received it made a tremendous difference
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
and I think you can kind of get a sense
 
00:31:06.529 --> 00:31:06.539 align:start position:0%
of the impact that it had on cities and
 
00:31:09.769 --> 00:31:09.779 align:start position:0%
towns so I also appreciate some of the
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
comments about being a little bit of a
 
00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
moving Target right as we can't predict
 
00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
salaries or raises that might need to be
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
put in place to retain employees we
 
00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:23.700 align:start position:0%
towns are like the state unable to
 
00:31:26.630 --> 00:31:26.640 align:start position:0%
employ they are still looking and having
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
the same retention issues and the same
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
replacement issues that we're seeing in
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
all Industries all over the state the
 
00:31:36.049 --> 00:31:36.059 align:start position:0%
country so while we do try one for one
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily the case if we
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
can't find a qualified candidate or no
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
one's applying for the jobs and of
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
course in theory
 
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
some senior people might leave and a
 
00:31:48.529 --> 00:31:48.539 align:start position:0%
newer person might a junior person may
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
take over at what we might assume to be
 
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
a lower rate but we can't guarantee that
 
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
in today's market so all things to
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
certainly consider and I can also
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate as a finance person you know
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
again that moving Target that you talk
 
00:32:05.690 --> 00:32:05.700 align:start position:0%
about so of course if the state capped
 
00:32:07.549 --> 00:32:07.559 align:start position:0%
the reimbursement of seven and a half
 
00:32:09.649 --> 00:32:09.659 align:start position:0%
percent or up to a certain dollar amount
 
00:32:11.389 --> 00:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
that could certainly assist in the
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
budgeting process because I can
 
00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:14.100 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you have to bring
 
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
forward a balanced budget as a resident
 
00:32:18.049 --> 00:32:18.059 align:start position:0%
myself of the State of New Hampshire
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's important work as well so I'm
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
happy to answer other questions that you
 
00:32:24.769 --> 00:32:24.779 align:start position:0%
might have if I didn't cover things
 
00:32:27.649 --> 00:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
so to representative Griffin's question
 
00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
earlier he was I think looking and he
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
can correct me if I'm wrong but if we
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
were to distribute say that nearly 27
 
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars to the towns not through
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
the retirement system but based on say
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
their population how would that compare
 
00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
to what they would get under the 7.5
 
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
versus a contribution it's like Revenue
 
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
sharing that type of thing so so if we
 
00:32:50.810 --> 00:32:50.820 align:start position:0%
look at meals and rooms that was
 
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
distributed at 121 million that would be
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
maybe really roughly a fifth of that and
 
00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
that's just strictly population based so
 
00:33:00.049 --> 00:33:00.059 align:start position:0%
we can certainly I can certainly get a
 
00:33:02.210 --> 00:33:02.220 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and do that math for you to
 
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
see what that would look like in a
 
00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
different way solely based on population
 
00:33:08.210 --> 00:33:08.220 align:start position:0%
using meals and rooms formula if that's
 
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
acceptable to you
 
00:33:15.049 --> 00:33:15.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Weiler
 
00:33:21.710 --> 00:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Miss heck we in
 
00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:23.580 align:start position:0%
this current budget and for the year
 
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
2023 are giving back 100 million from
 
00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:27.409 align:start position:0%
2023 are giving back 100 million from
swept

00:33:27.409 --> 00:33:27.419 align:start position:0%
swept
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
directly to the property taxpayers have
 
00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:33.240 align:start position:0%
you done an analysis of how much that's
 
00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:35.220 align:start position:0%
going to each town
 
00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
so swept is
 
00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:39.419 align:start position:0%
um so the hundred thousand unswept is
 
00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:41.039 align:start position:0%
very interesting and they're having 100
 
00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:43.500 align:start position:0%
million 100 million I'm sorry that's a
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
very different number yes but who's
 
00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:47.220 align:start position:0%
counting there's just a few zeros there
 
00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
I apologize I made the same mistake
 
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
myself I'm sorry
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
um that's very interesting in that
 
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
analysis as swept is collected and
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
retained locally it does not go back up
 
00:33:59.810 --> 00:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
to the state and then be redistributed
 
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
back to the cities and towns so what
 
00:34:05.450 --> 00:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
some other policy analysts have noticed
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
so I don't do education funding
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
particularly although it all interplays
 
00:34:11.629 --> 00:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
and all interacts so I do follow the
 
00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:14.580 align:start position:0%
conversation the reduction of swept has
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
led property poor towns to having to
 
00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:19.619 align:start position:0%
raise funds locally because the
 
00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
reduction isn't covering their portion
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
of the school Bill property wealthy
 
00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:27.419 align:start position:0%
towns I believe you've seen there was an
 
00:34:29.089 --> 00:34:29.099 align:start position:0%
injunction because they were retaining
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
more than what they needed so well
 
00:34:35.149 --> 00:34:35.159 align:start position:0%
um it's certainly on paper a red
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
reduction to the taxpayer and I'm sure
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
all the taxpayers appreciate it if it
 
00:34:40.849 --> 00:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
has to be flip-flopped and raised on the
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
local school tax there really was no net
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
reduction so I don't have the data on
 
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
that I do know that there have been some
 
00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
analysis on how that swept worked now
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
that we've done it for two years to
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
further understand the property
 
00:34:56.990 --> 00:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
valuation and how it impacts the swept
 
00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.550 align:start position:0%
valuation and how it impacts the swept
tax

00:34:58.550 --> 00:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:04.020 align:start position:0%
thank you so what we'll do now since I
 
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
try to keep right on schedule
 
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
we'll reschedule this work session for a
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
later date when the questions that
 
00:35:14.089 --> 00:35:14.099 align:start position:0%
representative Ebel had McGuire and
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
Griffin our address was hearing from the
 
00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
retirement system tomorrow again at
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
three you're welcome to join us miss
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
heck and uh we'll schedule another work
 
00:35:25.910 --> 00:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
session after we get those answers
 
00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:30.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:34.329 --> 00:36:34.339 align:start position:0%
so next we have House Bill 555
 
00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
appropriating state general fund Surplus
 
00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
towards the retirement system unfunded
 
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:40.670 align:start position:0%
towards the retirement system unfunded
liability

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
anyone like to come forward ah yes the
 
00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
yes I'm uh representative Tony luckis
 
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsboro 38 the towns of
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
Hudson and Litchfield thanks thank you
 
00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:03.300 align:start position:0%
to the uh
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um
 
00:37:07.609 --> 00:37:07.619 align:start position:0%
so the uh
 
00:37:10.130 --> 00:37:10.140 align:start position:0%
the pension fund has something on the
 
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
order of 5 billion in unfunded liability
 
00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:14.700 align:start position:0%
uh there's someone here from the
 
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
retirement system that can probably
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
provide a more detailed
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
data on that and there was a
 
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
you know there's a history of it being
 
00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:28.440 align:start position:0%
unfunded there was a some legislative
 
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
action that took place around 2010 to
 
00:37:33.530 --> 00:37:33.540 align:start position:0%
put it on the past to be fully funded
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
and under statute it's supposed to be by
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
about 2039
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
so the way that's the unfunded liability
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
is currently being paid is all the
 
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:45.540 align:start position:0%
employers and in that context it's all
 
00:37:47.630 --> 00:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
the government entities that have
 
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
employees in the pension fund so that's
 
00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:51.050 align:start position:0%
employees in the pension fund so that's
uh

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:51.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
the state the counties uh cities towns
 
00:37:56.150 --> 00:37:56.160 align:start position:0%
school districts Etc
 
00:37:59.089 --> 00:37:59.099 align:start position:0%
they're paying a percentage
 
00:38:01.849 --> 00:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
of their total payroll the payroll of
 
00:38:03.170 --> 00:38:03.180 align:start position:0%
their employees that are in the pension
 
00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:03.950 align:start position:0%
their employees that are in the pension
system

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
towards the unfunded liability so
 
00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
they're paying two parts the cost to
 
00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
actually soundly pay for the pensions
 
00:38:12.650 --> 00:38:12.660 align:start position:0%
for their current employees and then a
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
portion for paying off the unfunded
 
00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:18.020 align:start position:0%
liability and to get it done by 2039
 
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
again person retirement system can
 
00:38:22.849 --> 00:38:22.859 align:start position:0%
provide more details but I believe it's
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
something on average more than 80
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
percent of what all those government
 
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
employers are paying is to pay the
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability not the current
 
00:38:35.089 --> 00:38:35.099 align:start position:0%
pension it may be less than that but
 
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
um we can get that number and that comes
 
00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
in most cases directly out of
 
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
everybody's property tax
 
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
so the idea is that if we have a surplus
 
00:38:47.630 --> 00:38:47.640 align:start position:0%
and if the uh what's colloquial known as
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund is is maxed out
 
00:38:53.870 --> 00:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
that um a portion of any remaining money
 
00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
go towards the unfunded liability 75
 
00:38:59.270 --> 00:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
percent is is what I pick but if the
 
00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:00.540 align:start position:0%
committee wants a different percentage
 
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
I'd be fine with 100 or whatever
 
00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.490 align:start position:0%
I'd be fine with 100 or whatever
um

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:06.900 align:start position:0%
and you know putting money into that
 
00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
early is like paying your mortgage off
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
early because that invested money gets a
 
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
return and it will more quickly
 
00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:15.170 align:start position:0%
return and it will more quickly
um

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
pay that off and every two years the
 
00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:19.380 align:start position:0%
pension system calculates the percentage
 
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:21.960 align:start position:0%
of the total payroll that goes towards
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
paying off the unfunded liability and if
 
00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
the amount oh you know that is not
 
00:39:30.410 --> 00:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
funded uh goes down then that is going
 
00:39:32.990 --> 00:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
to go down and as there's return gained
 
00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:34.740 align:start position:0%
on that money that's invested it'll go
 
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
down further as you go
 
00:39:39.589 --> 00:39:39.599 align:start position:0%
and eventually at the end not only are
 
00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:42.180 align:start position:0%
the employers can be paying less because
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
they won't be paying off the unfunded
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
liability but the way the system is set
 
00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.430 align:start position:0%
liability but the way the system is set
up

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:39:49.730 --> 00:39:49.740 align:start position:0%
the employee contribution will actually
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
go down as well
 
00:39:55.069 --> 00:39:55.079 align:start position:0%
as that's paid off because right now the
 
00:39:56.810 --> 00:39:56.820 align:start position:0%
employees are paying over half of the
 
00:39:58.910 --> 00:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
cost of their pension their employer is
 
00:40:00.589 --> 00:40:00.599 align:start position:0%
paying a smaller amount and I believe in
 
00:40:00.599 --> 00:40:01.550 align:start position:0%
paying a smaller amount and I believe in
statute

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:40:04.069 --> 00:40:04.079 align:start position:0%
the employees can't be higher than the
 
00:40:06.589 --> 00:40:06.599 align:start position:0%
employer so as the employee part goes
 
00:40:06.599 --> 00:40:07.569 align:start position:0%
employer so as the employee part goes
down

00:40:07.569 --> 00:40:07.579 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
the employers would have to I mean the
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
employee as the employer's particles on
 
00:40:14.510 --> 00:40:14.520 align:start position:0%
the employees would have to as well so I
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
mean it's one way to get a at least the
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a property tax reduction
 
00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:20.220 align:start position:0%
for everybody assuming the money isn't
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
just spent by the employer
 
00:40:25.849 --> 00:40:25.859 align:start position:0%
so that's that's all I have
 
00:40:34.790 --> 00:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:44.940 align:start position:0%
anyone else
 
00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.490 align:start position:0%
anyone else
representative

00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:40:58.609 --> 00:40:58.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for the record Representative
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
Steve Pearson him Rockingham District 13
 
00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
now which is the town of Derry I'm a
 
00:41:09.290 --> 00:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this legislation
 
00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
um just to just to add a little bit to
 
00:41:13.510 --> 00:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
what the representative from Hudson said
 
00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:16.980 align:start position:0%
when the when all 50 states took a deep
 
00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
dive when when the alarm was sounded
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
back in around 07.
 
00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:25.619 align:start position:0%
there were 50 different concepts 50
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
different ideas right every state looked
 
00:41:30.349 --> 00:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
at their situation and said okay we all
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
got to do something so
 
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
and they all came up with different
 
00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.849 align:start position:0%
and they all came up with different
ideas

00:41:34.849 --> 00:41:34.859 align:start position:0%
ideas
 
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:37.980 align:start position:0%
and you know as we look forward 15 years
 
00:41:37.980 --> 00:41:38.930 align:start position:0%
and you know as we look forward 15 years
later

00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
later
 
00:41:40.730 --> 00:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
we see that there were states that were
 
00:41:43.370 --> 00:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
serious and then there were states that
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
were maybe serious for a year
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:48.950 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
after

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
the decennial commission and and the
 
00:41:52.609 --> 00:41:52.619 align:start position:0%
real hard look at what was going on
 
00:41:52.619 --> 00:41:53.870 align:start position:0%
real hard look at what was going on
there

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:41:58.849 --> 00:41:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
but in the grand scheme of things
 
00:42:02.930 --> 00:42:02.940 align:start position:0%
looking at some other states not
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily as quick we decided to do
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
over a 30-year run some states were much
 
00:42:08.569 --> 00:42:08.579 align:start position:0%
more aggressive
 
00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
and I think that you know when you have
 
00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to pay your bills
 
00:42:17.089 --> 00:42:17.099 align:start position:0%
you put you should do so that that's a
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
that's something that people in their
 
00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:20.099 align:start position:0%
personal finances do it's something
 
00:42:21.349 --> 00:42:21.359 align:start position:0%
certainly that the state should be doing
 
00:42:23.150 --> 00:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
as well so
 
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
I think this this kind of shifts the
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
gear a little bit it moves us up into a
 
00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:29.700 align:start position:0%
little bit more of an aggressive stance
 
00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
to do this and especially now in a down
 
00:42:33.900 --> 00:42:35.530 align:start position:0%
to do this and especially now in a down
Market

00:42:35.530 --> 00:42:35.540 align:start position:0%
Market
 
00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
infusing that system with any sort of
 
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
money certainly has a multiplier effect
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
as the market Rises so
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know I fully support this concept I
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
think that it's something maybe we
 
00:42:49.849 --> 00:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
should have been you know really brought
 
00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:53.099 align:start position:0%
into play years ago uh but here we are
 
00:42:53.099 --> 00:42:54.230 align:start position:0%
into play years ago uh but here we are
and

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know I think that if we're going to
 
00:42:57.290 --> 00:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
be serious about
 
00:42:59.809 --> 00:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
getting this taken care of
 
00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:01.740 align:start position:0%
uh the Now's the Time
 
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:03.540 align:start position:0%
the the only thing with the bill that I
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
would ask is that the bill does not
 
00:43:10.609 --> 00:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
differentiate as to where that goes and
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
I and I think that because you can't
 
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:14.099 align:start position:0%
just blanketly say well we're just going
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
to put it into pension debt because the
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
pension system's broken down into
 
00:43:20.809 --> 00:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
categories so I would like to see the
 
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
bill amended to just have an earmark of
 
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
50 50 to group one fifty percent to
 
00:43:26.089 --> 00:43:26.099 align:start position:0%
group two
 
00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
I just think that that would just direct
 
00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:29.510 align:start position:0%
I just think that that would just direct
funding

00:43:29.510 --> 00:43:29.520 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
um a little bit rather than just be a
 
00:43:31.319 --> 00:43:32.690 align:start position:0%
um a little bit rather than just be a
blanket

00:43:32.690 --> 00:43:32.700 align:start position:0%
blanket
 
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
because you have to you have to
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
categorize it somewhere
 
00:43:38.329 --> 00:43:38.339 align:start position:0%
it we we think of things as a giant pot
 
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
of money
 
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
but and I'm sure Mr Carlin from
 
00:43:43.970 --> 00:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
retirement can explain that it's not
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
just exactly a giant pot so
 
00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:48.900 align:start position:0%
um so that's the only ask I would have
 
00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
with that but but I do support the
 
00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
concept any anything to any venture to
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
pay debt that the state has in any in
 
00:43:57.770 --> 00:43:57.780 align:start position:0%
any idea I think is good so
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time with this and uh
 
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
and I'll certainly entertain any
 
00:44:05.569 --> 00:44:05.579 align:start position:0%
questions you may or may not have
 
00:44:05.579 --> 00:44:07.609 align:start position:0%
questions you may or may not have
questions

00:44:07.609 --> 00:44:07.619 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:08.940 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you very
 
00:44:10.730 --> 00:44:10.740 align:start position:0%
much and we'll get together with Marty
 
00:44:12.470 --> 00:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
and see if we can't figure out a
 
00:44:18.470 --> 00:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:28.250 align:start position:0%
 
alrighty

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair again for the record
 
00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
Marty Carlin from the New Hampshire
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
retirement system
 
00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:37.740 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to to build on what the
 
00:44:41.150 --> 00:44:41.160 align:start position:0%
sponsors just said and also it was a
 
00:44:43.309 --> 00:44:43.319 align:start position:0%
question that came up last week that I
 
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
have a partial answer on that I can
 
00:44:46.849 --> 00:44:46.859 align:start position:0%
share with this group
 
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
um you know last week when when uh
 
00:44:51.589 --> 00:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative of the retirement system
 
00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
was testifying he you know correctly
 
00:44:56.089 --> 00:44:56.099 align:start position:0%
said that you know there's no you know
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
if people want to give us money you know
 
00:44:59.890 --> 00:44:59.900 align:start position:0%
we don't have any philosophical
 
00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:02.940 align:start position:0%
objections or statutory uh problems
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
accepting payments over and above but I
 
00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:07.740 align:start position:0%
do want to clarify that our our board
 
00:45:09.770 --> 00:45:09.780 align:start position:0%
hasn't taken a position on this bill we
 
00:45:12.170 --> 00:45:12.180 align:start position:0%
do see it as policy which is completely
 
00:45:14.329 --> 00:45:14.339 align:start position:0%
on this side of the river and we
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily a pine on it one
 
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
way or the other just but in general
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
terms again you know we're not going to
 
00:45:24.170 --> 00:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
say no uh to additional funding towards
 
00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
the end liability
 
00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
question that came up is well you know
 
00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
how how might that work you know if we
 
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
gave you X what's how's that going to
 
00:45:34.730 --> 00:45:34.740 align:start position:0%
help and and
 
00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:36.740 align:start position:0%
um you know essentially any any
 
00:45:40.190 --> 00:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
appropriation under this bill would be
 
00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:42.839 align:start position:0%
you know would just be exed off an
 
00:45:44.510 --> 00:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
amount of the unfunded liability which
 
00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
is currently at the end of the last
 
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 5.69 billion uh it's a large
 
00:45:52.849 --> 00:45:52.859 align:start position:0%
number most of that 5 billion five plus
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
billion is scheduled to be paid off by
 
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.690 align:start position:0%
billion is scheduled to be paid off by
2039

00:45:56.690 --> 00:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
2039
 
00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
um as part of the initial legislative
 
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
changes to amortize it over 30 years
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
um I I did reach out to the actuary
 
00:46:06.370 --> 00:46:06.380 align:start position:0%
because you know
 
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
Appropriations are so time dependent I
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
couldn't say oh if we had a 100 million
 
00:46:13.490 --> 00:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
120 million dollars for a plus in 2028
 
00:46:15.170 --> 00:46:15.180 align:start position:0%
what is it going to do it you know we
 
00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell you with any degree of
 
00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
certainty but as a hypothetical I asked
 
00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
um if if nhrs last if this was in effect
 
00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
you know with the current State Surplus
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
so we got a an approach 50 million
 
00:46:29.809 --> 00:46:29.819 align:start position:0%
towards the unfunded liability that
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
would increase employer contribution
 
00:46:35.750 --> 00:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
rates uh by between 0.1 and 0.2 percent
 
00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:37.740 align:start position:0%
of payroll depending on the member group
 
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
if it was distributed sort of evenly if
 
00:46:41.990 --> 00:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
if we have a different distribution
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
method that may change it a little but
 
00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
essentially that would be a 4.1 million
 
00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
less in contributions we'd be asking
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
employers for in 24. so you know okay
 
00:46:55.849 --> 00:46:55.859 align:start position:0%
you're putting 50 million up front but
 
00:46:59.089 --> 00:46:59.099 align:start position:0%
but that's you know that the rates would
 
00:47:01.309 --> 00:47:01.319 align:start position:0%
be that would be a permanent increase
 
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
um because we have that money you know
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
in the bank and being invested so it's
 
00:47:06.650 --> 00:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
not a one-year savings you're you're
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
accruing that over time
 
00:47:11.569 --> 00:47:11.579 align:start position:0%
um you know you'll you'll get more than
 
00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
you put in uh
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
you know um based on the investment
 
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.730 align:start position:0%
you know um based on the investment
income

00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
I think you got representative McGuire's
 
00:47:24.829 --> 00:47:24.839 align:start position:0%
attention representative McGuire
 
00:47:28.069 --> 00:47:28.079 align:start position:0%
not specifically but was representative
 
00:47:31.069 --> 00:47:31.079 align:start position:0%
Pearson correct that you think of the
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability as there's so much
 
00:47:36.170 --> 00:47:36.180 align:start position:0%
group one unfunded liability there's so
 
00:47:38.089 --> 00:47:38.099 align:start position:0%
much group two unfunded liability or
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
maybe there's other categories be you
 
00:47:42.849 --> 00:47:42.859 align:start position:0%
know for
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
financial accounting and Actuarial
 
00:47:47.450 --> 00:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
purposes all four plans employee
 
00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
teaching police teachers police and
 
00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
fired liabilities are calculated uh
 
00:47:54.290 --> 00:47:54.300 align:start position:0%
separately there are different
 
00:47:55.849 --> 00:47:55.859 align:start position:0%
assumptions for the you know group one
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
and group two and things like that so
 
00:47:59.450 --> 00:47:59.460 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons you know when
 
00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
because the employer rates are developed
 
00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
separately for those four groups as well
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
so you know there are in our annual
 
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.650 align:start position:0%
so you know there are in our annual
reports

00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:06.660 align:start position:0%
reports
 
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
um you know a funded ratio for the fire
 
00:48:11.569 --> 00:48:11.579 align:start position:0%
plan and for the teacher's plan so you
 
00:48:13.609 --> 00:48:13.619 align:start position:0%
know and then the numbers that we tend
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
to speak to with the committee is the
 
00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:16.740 align:start position:0%
aggregate number for the whole plan
 
00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
65.6 funded actually brought uh copies
 
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
of all of our annual reports and our
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
current statute book I was going to drop
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
a copy off with uh this claim and for a
 
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:30.300 align:start position:0%
reference for the finance office at a
 
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
copy for LBA as well
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
um to go in and I think those numbers
 
00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:36.540 align:start position:0%
that I'm speaking to are actually in our
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
valuation which is posted on our website
 
00:48:41.809 --> 00:48:41.819 align:start position:0%
but so there are different liabilities
 
00:48:44.030 --> 00:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
um you know for different funding ratios
 
00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
for the respective groups I think most
 
00:48:49.550 --> 00:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
recently the group two plans are have a
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
better funded ratio even though the
 
00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460 align:start position:0%
rates are are that much you know higher
 
00:48:56.089 --> 00:48:56.099 align:start position:0%
and and percent of pay uh and part of
 
00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
that with some
 
00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:00.440 align:start position:0%
legislation back in the 2000s and early
 
00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
2010s moving money from the special
 
00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:05.339 align:start position:0%
account and from medical subsidy
 
00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:07.140 align:start position:0%
accounts and things like that and that
 
00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
money was credited to the group two
 
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:12.180 align:start position:0%
plans uh because it was taken out
 
00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:15.300 align:start position:0%
um for the insurance uh piece for the
 
00:49:17.089 --> 00:49:17.099 align:start position:0%
special account for them so you know and
 
00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:19.020 align:start position:0%
you know there's some you know in the
 
00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
teacher plan is as I definitely the the
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
lowest funded of the four and that's
 
00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
sort of a function of that lowering head
 
00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
count that we've seen so so there are
 
00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
variations you know on the plan level
 
00:49:34.430 --> 00:49:34.440 align:start position:0%
um I think you know without specific
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
guidance we would probably look at if
 
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
you know yeah I don't want to speak for
 
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140 align:start position:0%
the actuary but I think they'd look as
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
you know the employee population is
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
about 50 percent of the total membership
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
teachers are about 35 you know that we
 
00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
any of these funding infusions could
 
00:49:53.089 --> 00:49:53.099 align:start position:0%
theoretically be you know would probably
 
00:49:55.609 --> 00:49:55.619 align:start position:0%
most logically without other direction
 
00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
just apply them as a percentage are the
 
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
size of the total group if if the bill
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
was amended with rapid as Senator
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
Pearson you know it would you know more
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
money going towards group two is than
 
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
their proportion of the membership would
 
00:50:11.329 --> 00:50:11.339 align:start position:0%
lower those rates more those are the
 
00:50:12.770 --> 00:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
highest rates those are the ones we hear
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
most about from employers so you know
 
00:50:17.329 --> 00:50:17.339 align:start position:0%
there's some policy considerations uh
 
00:50:19.630 --> 00:50:19.640 align:start position:0%
for you all and how you would want to
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
distribute any of these Appropriations
 
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
um that would be up to you guys we
 
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have have a position on what
 
00:50:30.589 --> 00:50:30.599 align:start position:0%
you'd tell you to do that
 
00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:34.980 align:start position:0%
yeah follow up so do you think that the
 
00:50:38.630 --> 00:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
bill as written is unimplementable
 
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:41.220 align:start position:0%
because of this question or would you
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
have to adopt rules or something that
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
decide that make that decision you know
 
00:50:47.450 --> 00:50:47.460 align:start position:0%
I mean when we looked at it we we
 
00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
haven't done a you know a 360 on that
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
specific question I I think you know the
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
the working assumption was you know that
 
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
you know administratively what what's
 
00:50:59.329 --> 00:50:59.339 align:start position:0%
the what's the most reasonable
 
00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:02.579 align:start position:0%
perspective and you know again if we you
 
00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
know applying it to the
 
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:06.540 align:start position:0%
to each group as a percentage of their
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
size of the total
 
00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:10.380 align:start position:0%
seems logical but you know there are
 
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
other reasonable arguments and can be
 
00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
made for another one
 
00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:16.800 align:start position:0%
um you know if the legislature or an
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
employer group wanted to challenge that
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
then we'd have to kind of figure out
 
00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:23.220 align:start position:0%
where to go from there but um you know
 
00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:24.349 align:start position:0%
where to go from there but um you know
that

00:51:24.349 --> 00:51:24.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:26.329 --> 00:51:26.339 align:start position:0%
um you know we haven't drilled down that
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
far it was a question that we didn't
 
00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:30.290 align:start position:0%
far it was a question that we didn't
contemplate

00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
contemplate
 
00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative Wilder thank you Mr chair
 
00:51:35.809 --> 00:51:35.819 align:start position:0%
I have a question on the five-year
 
00:51:39.010 --> 00:51:39.020 align:start position:0%
smoothing that was used to uh
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
adopt an a rate of return that was that
 
00:51:47.089 --> 00:51:47.099 align:start position:0%
was used to assess the rates that people
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
paid for the thing I remember that the
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
90s we were running at better than nine
 
00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:53.930 align:start position:0%
90s we were running at better than nine
percent

00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
Returns on this and then we got to 2000
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
we had a big drop in 2001 and for the
 
00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:03.349 align:start position:0%
we had a big drop in 2001 and for the
whole

00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
whole
 
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:07.740 align:start position:0%
10 years of of the 2000s first 10 years
 
00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:08.930 align:start position:0%
10 years of of the 2000s first 10 years
um

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:12.349 --> 00:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
it barely made five percent and yet
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
the retirement system kept assuming
 
00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
eight and a half most of the time
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
through there and the Delta kept growing
 
00:52:21.470 --> 00:52:21.480 align:start position:0%
and I kept criticizing the system over
 
00:52:23.329 --> 00:52:23.339 align:start position:0%
why are you doing this because you're
 
00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
making the Delta grow bigger and they
 
00:52:27.049 --> 00:52:27.059 align:start position:0%
say oh we have five year smoothie is
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
that a law or a rule uh it's it's a it's
 
00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:33.059 align:start position:0%
an Actuarial practice it's it's within
 
00:52:34.790 --> 00:52:34.800 align:start position:0%
you know the Actuarial standards to do
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
that I mean you know
 
00:52:39.109 --> 00:52:39.119 align:start position:0%
you know the board could adopt a policy
 
00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
to smooth over four years or six years
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
but there's a range in most plans do the
 
00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:47.640 align:start position:0%
five-year smoothing I you know I can't
 
00:52:49.849 --> 00:52:49.859 align:start position:0%
speak for why the board kept the assumed
 
00:52:51.049 --> 00:52:51.059 align:start position:0%
rate of return at eight and a half
 
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:54.660 align:start position:0%
percent until I think it was um 2011 uh
 
00:52:57.650 --> 00:52:57.660 align:start position:0%
after that of 2005 to 10 experience then
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
when they lowered it for seven and three
 
00:53:01.609 --> 00:53:01.619 align:start position:0%
quarters now it's it's currently six and
 
00:53:03.650 --> 00:53:03.660 align:start position:0%
uh three quarters
 
00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:06.020 align:start position:0%
um you know partially though
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
on in the night of the no folks the new
 
00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
folks aren't going to be
 
00:53:13.370 --> 00:53:13.380 align:start position:0%
get the the reference but the special
 
00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
account was something that had been in
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
saturated for a number of years and it
 
00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:19.380 align:start position:0%
took any percentage over the assumed
 
00:53:21.049 --> 00:53:21.059 align:start position:0%
rate of return and segregated it for
 
00:53:23.930 --> 00:53:23.940 align:start position:0%
colas and medical benefits and and there
 
00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
was almost a perverse incentive to have
 
00:53:28.609 --> 00:53:28.619 align:start position:0%
a higher assumed rate of return so
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
you're catching some of the stuff that
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
would have flowed into the special
 
00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
account and that was repealed 911. and
 
00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
so that that may be some of the history
 
00:53:38.329 --> 00:53:38.339 align:start position:0%
there for the board's thinking but again
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
I wasn't here to watch
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
and we discovered another significant
 
00:53:47.089 --> 00:53:47.099 align:start position:0%
difference in in the 90s when we were
 
00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
assessing uh cost of living increases
 
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
from the excess that went into the
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
special fund and that was that and one
 
00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:56.579 align:start position:0%
of my friends was a fireman said oh
 
00:53:58.790 --> 00:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
they're prejudice against the firemen
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
but this was the truth
 
00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
um a lot of people get into teaching
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
they pay so much into the system and so
 
00:54:09.170 --> 00:54:09.180 align:start position:0%
does the employer if you leave before
 
00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
you're vested you take all the money
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
that you contributed but the money that
 
00:54:16.790 --> 00:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
the employer contributed stays in the
 
00:54:19.609 --> 00:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
fund so there was much more Surplus in
 
00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
the teacher fund than there was in
 
00:54:24.530 --> 00:54:24.540 align:start position:0%
either police or fire fire had the least
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
Surplus because most firemen stayed for
 
00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
a whole career police a little less so
 
00:54:32.089 --> 00:54:32.099 align:start position:0%
but teachers did not stay as long
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
especially since they'd have to do like
 
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
a 30-year career and go to age 65 so it
 
00:54:38.809 --> 00:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
was interesting how those things varied
 
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
as well and that's another thing that
 
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:43.280 align:start position:0%
has to be taken into account thank you
 
00:54:45.650 --> 00:54:45.660 align:start position:0%
that's very interesting and it's
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
teachers I'm teachers uh firefighters
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
are still the group that retires with
 
00:54:52.549 --> 00:54:52.559 align:start position:0%
the most years of service on average
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
when they go out
 
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
um you know and you know a little bit
 
00:54:57.470 --> 00:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
higher age than police and that so that
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's held and even when I talk about
 
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
the retirement rates in recent years
 
00:55:03.049 --> 00:55:03.059 align:start position:0%
it's been more on the police and the
 
00:55:03.059 --> 00:55:04.309 align:start position:0%
it's been more on the police and the
Fireside

00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
Fireside
 
00:55:04.319 --> 00:55:05.049 align:start position:0%
Fireside
um

00:55:05.049 --> 00:55:05.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:05.059 --> 00:55:07.510 align:start position:0%
um
that's

00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:11.339 align:start position:0%
so Marty maybe uh tomorrow or the next
 
00:55:12.730 --> 00:55:12.740 align:start position:0%
day you could give us some more
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
hypotheticals you gave a really good one
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
with the 50 million in the savings but
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
giving some more hypotheticals might be
 
00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:22.740 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to look at we like looking at
 
00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:25.740 align:start position:0%
numbers and yeah I can see what they can
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
turn around for us you know but again if
 
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
we're if it's an infusion that's coming
 
00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:32.700 align:start position:0%
you know years down the road it's like I
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
don't think they're even going to be
 
00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
comfortable calculating it just because
 
00:55:36.650 --> 00:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
I mean I asked them for 50 and 100 and
 
00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:39.540 align:start position:0%
you know 50 was 4.1 Million last 100
 
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
million was 8.1 million less so you know
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
they they it's just fairly linear you
 
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:46.740 align:start position:0%
know you can just pick the number and
 
00:55:50.089 --> 00:55:50.099 align:start position:0%
apply that percentage to it but um I can
 
00:55:51.230 --> 00:55:51.240 align:start position:0%
see what
 
00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:52.190 align:start position:0%
see what
um

00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
what if anything may be comfortable
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
doing with this but again in so much
 
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.290 align:start position:0%
doing with this but again in so much
it's

00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:55:59.390 --> 00:55:59.400 align:start position:0%
timing you know and even even Market
 
00:56:01.609 --> 00:56:01.619 align:start position:0%
timing you know oh we got 50 million and
 
00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
the markets took off and we have much
 
00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:05.579 align:start position:0%
better off than if it went the other way
 
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:07.260 align:start position:0%
in that year but
 
00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:08.270 align:start position:0%
in that year but
um

00:56:08.270 --> 00:56:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:10.130 --> 00:56:10.140 align:start position:0%
you know so so we'll see what I can do
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
but I don't think I can promise much
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
more than sort of the real broad brush
 
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.049 align:start position:0%
more than sort of the real broad brush
here

00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:15.059 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:56:18.349 --> 00:56:18.359 align:start position:0%
not even a broad brush is good uh so you
 
00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
were you said that the retirement system
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
is not supportive I had notes now I know
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
you weren't here at the last week when
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
they some an attorney I believe came in
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
represent and he stated that the
 
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:33.540 align:start position:0%
retirement system supported that so you
 
00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
taken that back I guess yes spiritually
 
00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
supported it but not officially and we
 
00:56:40.250 --> 00:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
haven't brought it to the board okay
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
just yeah
 
00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
you know we we try to try to stay out of
 
00:56:47.569 --> 00:56:47.579 align:start position:0%
policy issues and other than giving
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
numbers and things like that um
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes we Veer over that you know
 
00:56:53.930 --> 00:56:53.940 align:start position:0%
line occasionally by accident we want to
 
00:56:56.270 --> 00:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
try to walk it back if we do
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
no I thought it was great as I'm one of
 
00:57:00.049 --> 00:57:00.059 align:start position:0%
the sponsors of the bill that I thought
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
was a great statement to thank Tony I
 
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
think it's a very good bill personally
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
and maybe needs a couple little tweaks
 
00:57:11.210 --> 00:57:11.220 align:start position:0%
but any other further questions uh
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler
 
00:57:15.829 --> 00:57:15.839 align:start position:0%
I I see these two bills as as being
 
00:57:18.109 --> 00:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
comparable they both have an attempt to
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
reduce property taxes I think this bill
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
does more to reduce property taxes long
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
term than 50. 50 is likely to be a
 
00:57:29.870 --> 00:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
one-time thing and it's it's such a
 
00:57:34.370 --> 00:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
small piece of the 1.3 billion that we
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
do for property tax relief that I don't
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
think I think it would get swallowed up
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
and rounding virtually but this this uh
 
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
hopefully will have a big amount plus I
 
00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:47.640 align:start position:0%
like the fact that we can control it
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
it's not a loose end if we see this
 
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
Surplus then we have a good place to put
 
00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
it rather than saying okay we're going
 
00:57:54.890 --> 00:57:54.900 align:start position:0%
to put more money there but we don't
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
know how much it will be
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
I liked from the standpoint of doing
 
00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:00.900 align:start position:0%
budgets I like this bill much better
 
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:07.380 align:start position:0%
thanks any further questions
 
00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:10.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none will close the work session
 
00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
just briefly unless I misheard I believe
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
previous speakers said that putting this
 
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
extra money would increase the employee
 
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
payment I assume he misspoke but that's
 
00:58:28.730 --> 00:58:28.740 align:start position:0%
how I took I think it was a mistake
 
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:31.680 align:start position:0%
right right and and the other thing as
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
far as the idea of deciding which uh
 
00:58:36.289 --> 00:58:36.299 align:start position:0%
product goes into I have no objection to
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
that I would just suggest that it be
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
worded such that if one of them is paid
 
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
off that the money would go to the
 
00:58:45.829 --> 00:58:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you uh seeing no further questions
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative before you
 
00:58:59.630 --> 00:58:59.640 align:start position:0%
close a hearing I did want to take the
 
00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:01.200 align:start position:0%
opportunity to say that we strongly
 
00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
support this legislation on behalf of
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
the cities and towns that we represent
 
00:59:07.970 --> 00:59:07.980 align:start position:0%
this is a long-term strategy it will
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
have long-term positive implications it
 
00:59:13.190 --> 00:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
will reduce property taxes and while we
 
00:59:15.530 --> 00:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
won't see immediate benefits maybe in 24
 
00:59:18.890 --> 00:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
or 25 until the actuaries start to redo
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
the calculations we will see long-term
 
00:59:23.690 --> 00:59:23.700 align:start position:0%
benefits over time with 75 to 80 percent
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
of our costs being on the unfunded
 
00:59:28.430 --> 00:59:28.440 align:start position:0%
liability so I just wanted to say we
 
00:59:30.530 --> 00:59:30.540 align:start position:0%
very much support this legislation thank
 
00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:32.030 align:start position:0%
very much support this legislation thank
you

00:59:32.030 --> 00:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and somebody just
 
00:59:36.109 --> 00:59:36.119 align:start position:0%
whispered in my ear they might like to
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
make a motion so I'd recognize uh
 
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
emotions been made and seconded seconded
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
by representative Weiler will give the
 
00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:51.900 align:start position:0%
clerk just a minute to get his paperwork
 
00:59:51.900 --> 01:00:08.930 align:start position:0%
clerk just a minute to get his paperwork
together

01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:08.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead yes the motion is ought to
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
pass was there a consideration to amend
 
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
it uh or is it going to be just like
 
01:00:22.030 --> 01:00:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire's likes to take a
 
01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:26.500 align:start position:0%
jump every once in a while
 
01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:30.230 align:start position:0%
jump every once in a while
[Laughter]

01:00:30.230 --> 01:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
and certainly why the clerk is getting
 
01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:34.740 align:start position:0%
ready uh is there any discussion on the
 
01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:36.530 align:start position:0%
ready uh is there any discussion on the
motion

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:00:41.150 --> 01:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll explain why so I think I don't
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
this to me seems like good policy but
 
01:00:46.069 --> 01:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
it's somewhat aspirational in the sense
 
01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
that I don't think the rainy day fund
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
has ever been big enough to cause this
 
01:00:52.609 --> 01:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
to trigger
 
01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:55.020 align:start position:0%
right and so this is something that's
 
01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
maybe if we're lucky is going to happen
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
way down the road
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
um but it's good policy and we ought to
 
01:01:06.770 --> 01:01:06.780 align:start position:0%
imply it um also what often happens in
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
the budget is things like this get
 
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
overridden right and so so it's it's
 
01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.670 align:start position:0%
overridden right and so so it's it's
it's

01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.470 align:start position:0%
it's
yeah

01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
so it's good policy but but it may or
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
may not actually happen I guess is my
 
01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:24.049 align:start position:0%
may not actually happen I guess is my
point

01:01:24.049 --> 01:01:24.059 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:01:26.089 --> 01:01:26.099 align:start position:0%
good question thank you Mr chair yeah
 
01:01:29.329 --> 01:01:29.339 align:start position:0%
yeah I agree I think I I like it uh my
 
01:01:30.890 --> 01:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
question was more what we discussed
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
earlier in that we needed to Define what
 
01:01:35.569 --> 01:01:35.579 align:start position:0%
portions would go to the different
 
01:01:38.510 --> 01:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
groups so would an amendment be required
 
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
or would that be something we would do
 
01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:41.930 align:start position:0%
or would that be something we would do
later

01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
later
 
01:01:44.569 --> 01:01:44.579 align:start position:0%
uh as it's been presented would pass as
 
01:01:46.730 --> 01:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
is now anyone's free to offer an
 
01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
Mr Clark
 
01:02:10.670 --> 01:02:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:19.190 align:start position:0%

we've been we've been submitting so this
 
01:04:40.069 --> 01:04:40.079 align:start position:0%
let me just go over this quickly if this
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
is there's a state aid grant program
 
01:04:41.579 --> 01:04:43.609 align:start position:0%
is there's a state aid grant program
that

01:04:43.609 --> 01:04:43.619 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:43.619 --> 01:04:44.630 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:47.569 align:start position:0%
um
supplements

01:04:47.569 --> 01:04:47.579 align:start position:0%
supplements
 
01:04:47.579 --> 01:04:52.970 align:start position:0%
supplements
or

01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
it's waste water projects
 
01:04:59.569 --> 01:04:59.579 align:start position:0%
and and many of you will recognize that
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
I've been in this I've been submitting
 
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
these bills for about 13 years now
 
01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:06.299 align:start position:0%
there used to be level funded program
 
01:05:06.299 --> 01:05:08.150 align:start position:0%
there used to be level funded program
however

01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:10.980 align:start position:0%
at in um
 
01:05:15.410 --> 01:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
when the governor ex by executive order
 
01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:18.059 align:start position:0%
swept out the account it's taken us 13
 
01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
years to catch up to catch up
 
01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:24.420 align:start position:0%
so the intent of this bill is to is not
 
01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:28.140 align:start position:0%
to fund a particular list of projects as
 
01:05:30.410 --> 01:05:30.420 align:start position:0%
the others were but to level fund this
 
01:05:33.049 --> 01:05:33.059 align:start position:0%
program so that it
 
01:05:35.690 --> 01:05:35.700 align:start position:0%
so that the funding is there
 
01:05:37.609 --> 01:05:37.619 align:start position:0%
and and we don't have to submit these
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
lists every every actually every two
 
01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:43.549 align:start position:0%
lists every every actually every two
years

01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:43.559 --> 01:05:44.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:48.470 --> 01:05:48.480 align:start position:0%
the uh the fiscal note explains
 
01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:54.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
and shows uh and shows you that
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
where the where the funding where the
 
01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:02.940 align:start position:0%
funding requests
 
01:06:05.690 --> 01:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
are this year
 
01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.660 --> 01:06:11.750 align:start position:0%
 
also

01:06:11.750 --> 01:06:11.760 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:06:14.150 --> 01:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman I would like to introduce
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
an amendment and I don't know what your
 
01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
process is in this committee for doing
 
01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:21.530 align:start position:0%
process is in this committee for doing
that

01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
have you given a copy to uh
 
01:06:27.289 --> 01:06:27.299 align:start position:0%
the LBA or
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh no I just had it drafted I just had
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
an unapproved copy unapproved Amendment
 
01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
drafted at OLS now you can certainly
 
01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
speak to your
 
01:06:39.650 --> 01:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
Amendment it's a simple it's simple it's
 
01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:41.900 align:start position:0%
just what I just said about
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
submitting this particular list of
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
projects every two years instead of
 
01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
doing that this funding will go into
 
01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:52.200 align:start position:0%
maintenance or efficiency what's called
 
01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
efficiency the efficiency account now
 
01:06:57.650 --> 01:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
and and instead of instead of having to
 
01:07:01.609 --> 01:07:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
instead of having to submit the list
 
01:07:06.289 --> 01:07:06.299 align:start position:0%
every every two years this will be a
 
01:07:09.589 --> 01:07:09.599 align:start position:0%
level funded program and the so the the
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment all the amendment says
 
01:07:16.569 --> 01:07:16.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:18.730 --> 01:07:18.740 align:start position:0%
and that'll that'll keep the program
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
going so that so so
 
01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
what happens with these projects is that
 
01:07:27.289 --> 01:07:27.299 align:start position:0%
you know you first have to get local uh
 
01:07:30.829 --> 01:07:30.839 align:start position:0%
um approvals to issue the bonds then you
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
have to have all the engineering then
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
you have the construction and then it's
 
01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:37.140 align:start position:0%
about 10 years by the time it it gets to
 
01:07:39.529 --> 01:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
the point where it's got one year of
 
01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
um substantial completion and that's the
 
01:07:43.609 --> 01:07:43.619 align:start position:0%
only time that that's when the funding
 
01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:45.480 align:start position:0%
comes in after the after all of that is
 
01:07:48.049 --> 01:07:48.059 align:start position:0%
done after the project is complete so
 
01:07:51.650 --> 01:07:51.660 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of hard to to
 
01:07:54.109 --> 01:07:54.119 align:start position:0%
there are the these lists are just
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
estimates and the costs are estimates
 
01:07:57.539 --> 01:07:59.630 align:start position:0%
estimates and the costs are estimates
so

01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
by level funding the program and by
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
keeping it non-lapsing they'll be
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
they'll be the funds will be in the
 
01:08:08.829 --> 01:08:08.839 align:start position:0%
program every year and the
 
01:08:11.990 --> 01:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities will have confidence in
 
01:08:14.510 --> 01:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
in applying for the for the for the
 
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
program and the department will have
 
01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:19.140 align:start position:0%
funding to be able to put towards these
 
01:08:19.140 --> 01:08:21.110 align:start position:0%
funding to be able to put towards these
projects

01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I I think I'll just stop there and
 
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:28.020 align:start position:0%
take questions if if I can
 
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:31.980 align:start position:0%
questions for representative buco
 
01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:33.050 align:start position:0%
questions for representative buco
yep

01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:33.060 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
just just for clarity
 
01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:35.930 align:start position:0%
just just for clarity
um

01:08:35.930 --> 01:08:35.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is before
 
01:08:42.110 --> 01:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
doing what you're proposing here towns
 
01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:42.950 align:start position:0%
doing what you're proposing here towns
are

01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
uh would be in the position to have to
 
01:08:48.709 --> 01:08:48.719 align:start position:0%
commit to a project without knowing full
 
01:08:50.749 --> 01:08:50.759 align:start position:0%
well that those funds are going to be
 
01:08:52.610 --> 01:08:52.620 align:start position:0%
available for them and this this would
 
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
alleviate that question mark is that
 
01:08:57.289 --> 01:08:57.299 align:start position:0%
another way of putting it yes yes that
 
01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:01.739 align:start position:0%
that's correct uh representative in fact
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
what used to be called the delayed and
 
01:09:06.169 --> 01:09:06.179 align:start position:0%
deferred list were projects that went
 
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
ahead got completed and then then the
 
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
state reneged on the funding and that's
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's what started the uh the uh the
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
delayed and deferred list and and as I
 
01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
said it's taken us 14 15 years to catch
 
01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.130 align:start position:0%
said it's taken us 14 15 years to catch
up

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:22.140 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:09:24.229 --> 01:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
and that last year we finally caught up
 
01:09:24.239 --> 01:09:25.910 align:start position:0%
and that last year we finally caught up
actually

01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:27.289 align:start position:0%
actually
um

01:09:27.289 --> 01:09:27.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
so that municipalities don't have to go
 
01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
ahead and issue bonds and go through all
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
the construction and then find out that
 
01:09:38.809 --> 01:09:38.819 align:start position:0%
they're not going to get the money that
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
the state it's in law it's RSA 486 it's
 
01:09:44.030 --> 01:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
in law and they should they should be
 
01:09:45.289 --> 01:09:45.299 align:start position:0%
able to have confidence that they're
 
01:09:46.729 --> 01:09:46.739 align:start position:0%
going to be that they're going to get
 
01:09:50.749 --> 01:09:50.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
further questions represent McGuire
 
01:09:55.610 --> 01:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:57.110 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
representative

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:10:00.470 --> 01:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
so I represent the town of Epsom I don't
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
believe that anyone
 
01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
ever I believe that everyone in our town
 
01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
has their own septic system
 
01:10:10.610 --> 01:10:10.620 align:start position:0%
so why should my constituents be paying
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:17.930 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:17.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
the purpose of these
 
01:10:21.530 --> 01:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
the purpose of these
 
01:10:23.290 --> 01:10:23.300 align:start position:0%
um grants was to incentivize
 
01:10:26.450 --> 01:10:26.460 align:start position:0%
municipalities to
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
to to um come up to standards what what
 
01:10:31.199 --> 01:10:32.090 align:start position:0%
to to um come up to standards what what
um

01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:35.030 --> 01:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
on with with their with their wastewater
 
01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
treatment and collection
 
01:10:37.739 --> 01:10:38.510 align:start position:0%
treatment and collection
um

01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:42.590 --> 01:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
in order to keep the groundwater clean
 
01:10:46.010 --> 01:10:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:47.570 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:10:47.570 --> 01:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:52.970 --> 01:10:52.980 align:start position:0%
it's it's there's if there's no
 
01:10:56.930 --> 01:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no uh Community
 
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:01.380 align:start position:0%
um Wastewater collection in Epsom at all
 
01:11:02.689 --> 01:11:02.699 align:start position:0%
and nothing
 
01:11:05.390 --> 01:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
I don't believe so we do have a small
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
water district with a with a community
 
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
well for part of our town There's this
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
kind of like an older part of town that
 
01:11:15.290 --> 01:11:15.300 align:start position:0%
had smaller Lots they have a community
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
well but but I don't there's no
 
01:11:20.630 --> 01:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant or anything
 
01:11:21.890 --> 01:11:21.900 align:start position:0%
like that
 
01:11:24.649 --> 01:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
so this this program started many years
 
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
ago and as I said the incentive was to
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
keep the groundwater cleaned
 
01:11:32.930 --> 01:11:32.940 align:start position:0%
and so it um
 
01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
it was based on municipalities
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
if I could for representative bucco one
 
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
of the things that you need in a state
 
01:11:44.290 --> 01:11:44.300 align:start position:0%
or wastewater treatment plants to treat
 
01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
septids from septic tanks so that's one
 
01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
of the other features of this
 
01:11:51.169 --> 01:11:51.179 align:start position:0%
legislation that you have a place to
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
take your accepted so in his town for
 
01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:54.900 align:start position:0%
instance those folks have a place to
 
01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
take their percentage thank you that's
 
01:12:03.709 --> 01:12:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.810 --> 01:12:05.820 align:start position:0%
representative Hewitt followed by
 
01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
no I I think we've all received this
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
this piece that you mailed it to all the
 
01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
members right municipal
 
01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:21.900 align:start position:0%
state aid and revenue sharing it has a
 
01:12:23.890 --> 01:12:23.900 align:start position:0%
piece on page 14
 
01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
pointing out
 
01:12:28.970 --> 01:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
276 million dollars came to the state
 
01:12:32.930 --> 01:12:32.940 align:start position:0%
from the Exxon Mobil mtbe lawsuit which
 
01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:36.780 align:start position:0%
went to a trust fund in 18 member
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
commission uh comprised of state and
 
01:12:42.110 --> 01:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
local officials is giving out loans and
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
they've given out so far 125 million
 
01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
that may have affected why other parts
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
of the state budget didn't put as much
 
01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:51.960 align:start position:0%
money into this as they had previously
 
01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
because there was another source of
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:59.209 --> 01:12:59.219 align:start position:0%
thanks I representative Weiler anything
 
01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:01.620 align:start position:0%
else represent a buco
 
01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:03.050 align:start position:0%
else represent a buco
uh

01:13:03.050 --> 01:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:13:03.060 --> 01:13:05.149 align:start position:0%
uh
no

01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
one of the things in the past for those
 
01:13:08.149 --> 01:13:08.159 align:start position:0%
of you that haven't been on this
 
01:13:10.669 --> 01:13:10.679 align:start position:0%
division we often retain this and have
 
01:13:12.890 --> 01:13:12.900 align:start position:0%
put it in the budget that's not to say
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't do that again we could act
 
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
on it one way or the other today or hold
 
01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:20.580 align:start position:0%
on to it and see what the governor's
 
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
budget has included because I noted uh
 
01:13:28.790 --> 01:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal node it says the these
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
amounts have been included in the
 
01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
Department's operating budget requests
 
01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:36.380 align:start position:0%
for 20 24 and 2025 as additional
 
01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
prioritized need requests so it would
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
appear maybe Des has got them in their
 
01:13:45.169 --> 01:13:45.179 align:start position:0%
budget but we'll find out shortly
 
01:13:45.179 --> 01:13:47.330 align:start position:0%
budget but we'll find out shortly
what

01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:13:54.410 --> 01:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
this is the this is the Department's
 
01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.470 align:start position:0%
this is the this is the Department's
request

01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:01.020 align:start position:0%
and for this particular account
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
and they under efficiency there's
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
there's zero so they're not they're not
 
01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
um the the projects that are already
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
have already been started getting
 
01:14:17.090 --> 01:14:17.100 align:start position:0%
payments that's what that would be in
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
the efficiency budget what they have
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
here is is um
 
01:14:24.169 --> 01:14:24.179 align:start position:0%
additional prioritized needs
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
and those are
 
01:14:28.729 --> 01:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
generally considered the the new the new
 
01:14:30.410 --> 01:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
projects that they expect to come online
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.689 --> 01:14:38.699 align:start position:0%
we have the Department of Environmental
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
Services coming in tomorrow at 1 pm so
 
01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:44.100 align:start position:0%
we'll try to get that cleared up thank
 
01:14:46.669 --> 01:14:46.679 align:start position:0%
you yes thank you ma'am
 
01:14:46.679 --> 01:14:49.550 align:start position:0%
you yes thank you ma'am
oh

01:14:49.550 --> 01:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:52.199 align:start position:0%
yeah if once representative Buco is
 
01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
finished if you'd like to come forward
 
01:14:55.010 --> 01:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
and state your name for the record
 
01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:58.370 align:start position:0%
and state your name for the record
please

01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:16.430 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
thanks

01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:19.910 --> 01:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
oh there we go thank you so much hi
 
01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:22.860 align:start position:0%
Tracy wood I'm the administrator of the
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
Wastewater engineering Bureau at New
 
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Des which resides in the Water
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.209 --> 01:15:35.219 align:start position:0%
so maybe you can clear up any confusion
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
as far as the Department's support or
 
01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:39.300 align:start position:0%
not support or including these figures
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
in the budget coming forward
 
01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:43.860 align:start position:0%
yes happy to do so
 
01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:47.120 align:start position:0%
so when we prepared our budget for the
 
01:15:52.130 --> 01:15:52.140 align:start position:0%
24-25 biennium we were held at uh three
 
01:15:56.270 --> 01:15:56.280 align:start position:0%
percent increase from our 23 budget for
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
this particular line item state aid
 
01:15:58.679 --> 01:15:59.570 align:start position:0%
this particular line item state aid
grant

01:15:59.570 --> 01:15:59.580 align:start position:0%
grant
 
01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
for the 20 fiscal year 23 budget it was
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
actually funded from a 21 Surplus monies
 
01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:09.060 align:start position:0%
and so when you look at our budget the
 
01:16:12.430 --> 01:16:12.440 align:start position:0%
line item says zero for fiscal year 23
 
01:16:16.250 --> 01:16:16.260 align:start position:0%
and 3 percent of zero dollars is zero
 
01:16:20.689 --> 01:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
dollars so we could not carry it in our
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
operating budget so what we did is we
 
01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
carry we carried it as I prioritized
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
need and so that is in our request
 
01:16:33.830 --> 01:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
for segment users in our request as a
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.930 --> 01:16:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.209 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:02.350 --> 01:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:06.850 --> 01:17:06.860 align:start position:0%
right it's an addition to their budget
 
01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:09.960 align:start position:0%
exactly exactly in a normal year we
 
01:17:12.410 --> 01:17:12.420 align:start position:0%
would have an allotment like fiscal year
 
01:17:14.209 --> 01:17:14.219 align:start position:0%
23 like we would have carried in our
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
normal budget
 
01:17:18.110 --> 01:17:18.120 align:start position:0%
a line item amount but we didn't because
 
01:17:20.450 --> 01:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
it came from Surplus for 21 which got
 
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
carried over it's all semantics but yes
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
we normally carry monies in our budget
 
01:17:28.729 --> 01:17:28.739 align:start position:0%
every fiscal year for maintenance
 
01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:35.390 --> 01:17:35.400 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:42.709 align:start position:0%
 
evil

01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.790 --> 01:17:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
have you seen the
 
01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:52.750 align:start position:0%
have you seen the
um

01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
amounts that are needed to upgrade these
 
01:17:58.430 --> 01:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plants greatly
 
01:18:01.090 --> 01:18:01.100 align:start position:0%
increasing because of increasing
 
01:18:04.370 --> 01:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
pollutants that are coming in like pfas
 
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
new standards that sort of thing
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
what we're dealing with right now is
 
01:18:12.890 --> 01:18:12.900 align:start position:0%
last year was the celebration of 50
 
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
years of the Clean Water Act and that's
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
when the majority of our wastewater
 
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities were built and some
 
01:18:22.669 --> 01:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
communities over time put monies into
 
01:18:25.729 --> 01:18:25.739 align:start position:0%
their infrastructure others did not so
 
01:18:27.530 --> 01:18:27.540 align:start position:0%
much so we're dealing with aging
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is the biggest piece and
 
01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:33.420 align:start position:0%
then yes New Hampshire is not a
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
delegated State EPA region one is our
 
01:18:39.290 --> 01:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
permitting Authority and yes every
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
permit that comes out is always more
 
01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
stringent than the previous permit they
 
01:18:46.370 --> 01:18:46.380 align:start position:0%
never get less stringent they they get
 
01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
more stringent so what we're dealing
 
01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:49.490 align:start position:0%
more stringent so what we're dealing
with

01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:49.500 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
mainly right now is nutrient issues
 
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
metal issues yes we are seeing uh EPA
 
01:18:59.450 --> 01:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
has putting pfas monitoring in nifty's
 
01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
permits but it's just monitoring and it
 
01:19:04.550 --> 01:19:04.560 align:start position:0%
actually hasn't even started yet because
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
we're waiting for EPA to come out with a
 
01:19:10.430 --> 01:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
validated method before they give the go
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
ahead for communities to start
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
monitoring for pfas in their systems
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't know in the long run with
 
01:19:21.530 --> 01:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment you know pfas is
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
is a huge issue and it's just not going
 
01:19:26.990 --> 01:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
to be economical to to treat at the
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment facilities on a
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
large scale and that's why you'll see in
 
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
the permit that EPA is targeting
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
industrial facilities and looking at
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
those sources within the collection
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
system to try to address it at the
 
01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:43.380 align:start position:0%
source instead of at the end pipe right
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
because wastewater treatment facilities
 
01:19:47.090 --> 01:19:47.100 align:start position:0%
they're not generating pfas they're the
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
receivers of pfas and so trying to stop
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.679 --> 01:19:58.310 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:20:00.530 --> 01:20:00.540 align:start position:0%
I would just say I've introduced a bill
 
01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
to help with some of that already and I
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
think the focusing on the front end is
 
01:20:08.689 --> 01:20:08.699 align:start position:0%
uh is really important Mr chair can I
 
01:20:10.610 --> 01:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
just I'm sorry to ask this these
 
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
historical things but the state aid
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
grant program
 
01:20:16.610 --> 01:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
folks basically come up with their
 
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
construction and maintenance ideas and
 
01:20:22.910 --> 01:20:22.920 align:start position:0%
they presented at a fairly basic level
 
01:20:25.370 --> 01:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
to Des and it's kind of guaranteed you
 
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
get 20 or how
 
01:20:31.729 --> 01:20:31.739 align:start position:0%
much of a lift is it to get the 20 if
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's what I read here about 486
 
01:20:38.090 --> 01:20:38.100 align:start position:0%
I may be wrong so what happens is uh the
 
01:20:40.010 --> 01:20:40.020 align:start position:0%
state a grant program is an after the
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
fact grant program so it's once a
 
01:20:44.870 --> 01:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
project is complete then they come in
 
01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:47.940 align:start position:0%
with an application and we review that
 
01:20:50.450 --> 01:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
application and then they'll get between
 
01:20:53.030 --> 01:20:53.040 align:start position:0%
20 and 30 percent it depends on
 
01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:55.560 align:start position:0%
different criteria that we have and
 
01:20:58.010 --> 01:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
they'll get an award based on their
 
01:21:00.410 --> 01:21:00.420 align:start position:0%
principal and interest payments over the
 
01:21:03.410 --> 01:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
life of their loan and I will say
 
01:21:06.649 --> 01:21:06.659 align:start position:0%
um you know representative Buco made a
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
an excellent comment I'm having a lot of
 
01:21:11.390 --> 01:21:11.400 align:start position:0%
conversations with communities right now
 
01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:13.500 align:start position:0%
and you know they want to know about
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
state aid grant they want to know is
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
this active is it up because this may be
 
01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:20.400 align:start position:0%
the one piece that gets them to the
 
01:21:22.430 --> 01:21:22.440 align:start position:0%
finish line so we're working with
 
01:21:23.750 --> 01:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
communities to leverage different
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
funding sources and then like say they
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
came in for clean water srf loan and it
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
was a million dollar project and then
 
01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:32.940 align:start position:0%
we'll offer them maybe a certain amount
 
01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:35.400 align:start position:0%
of subsidy say maybe we can give them 20
 
01:21:37.790 --> 01:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
to 30 percent and so you'll take that
 
01:21:39.709 --> 01:21:39.719 align:start position:0%
off the top so say you had a million
 
01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:41.940 align:start position:0%
dollar loan we're giving you 30 subsidy
 
01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
you're down to 700 000. then they get to
 
01:21:46.070 --> 01:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
that point they may look at other
 
01:21:48.229 --> 01:21:48.239 align:start position:0%
sources too like Northern borders rural
 
01:21:49.610 --> 01:21:49.620 align:start position:0%
development there's lots of funding
 
01:21:51.530 --> 01:21:51.540 align:start position:0%
sources but then when they get that
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
final amount then they'll say okay if
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
state aid grant is active I'm going to
 
01:21:58.970 --> 01:21:58.980 align:start position:0%
get 20 to 30 percent on that remaining
 
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
seven hundred thousand that's going to
 
01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:04.260 align:start position:0%
help me with my payments over time and
 
01:22:07.850 --> 01:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
it'll attenuate the impacts to the users
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
on the system and the rate increases
 
01:22:14.450 --> 01:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.669 --> 01:22:16.679 align:start position:0%
representative evil is never a bad
 
01:22:16.679 --> 01:22:21.530 align:start position:0%
representative evil is never a bad
question

01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:24.530 --> 01:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
well I was going to say just getting to
 
01:22:27.169 --> 01:22:27.179 align:start position:0%
uh representative Maguire's point and
 
01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:30.300 align:start position:0%
then uh about you know there are towns
 
01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
that don't have uh right
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
um and then representative or chair
 
01:22:38.390 --> 01:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
liegeman pointed out we all need some
 
01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
place to put our own individual septage
 
01:22:43.490 --> 01:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
but that's true also for land landfill
 
01:22:46.669 --> 01:22:46.679 align:start position:0%
leachate right correct there's the waste
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
the landfill leeche comes from the
 
01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:51.420 align:start position:0%
landfills where a lot of our stuff goes
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
to the wastewater treatment plants so
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
they really provide sort of a global
 
01:23:00.050 --> 01:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
service they do
 
01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
um part of the bill monies that we're
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
receiving so clean water srf is
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
receiving emerging contaminants monies
 
01:23:09.470 --> 01:23:09.480 align:start position:0%
not as much as they're receiving on the
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
drinking water side and we're utilizing
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
those monies for projects to address
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
landfill leachate again stopping it at
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
the source breaking that cycle before it
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
gets to the wastewater treatment plant
 
01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
so any community that has a municipal
 
01:23:27.050 --> 01:23:27.060 align:start position:0%
landfill that discharges to their
 
01:23:29.030 --> 01:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
Municipal wastewater treatment facility
 
01:23:31.910 --> 01:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
can come in for a project and get a
 
01:23:34.310 --> 01:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
grant North Conway is coming in they're
 
01:23:36.050 --> 01:23:36.060 align:start position:0%
our first project and they're going to
 
01:23:37.550 --> 01:23:37.560 align:start position:0%
be looking at the treatment different
 
01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
piloting different technology to see how
 
01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
they can treat the landfill leachate so
 
01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
cleaner before it gets sent to the
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment plant there's
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
limited funds in that but it's still
 
01:23:51.290 --> 01:23:51.300 align:start position:0%
some funds and that's a hundred percent
 
01:23:53.870 --> 01:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
Grant so those projects won't be coming
 
01:23:56.510 --> 01:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
in for sag
 
01:23:58.370 --> 01:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
represent Weiler
 
01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:00.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:24:03.890 --> 01:24:03.900 align:start position:0%
uh reading in the calf or that uh
 
01:24:08.209 --> 01:24:08.219 align:start position:0%
Des has chosen 12 parts per trillion for
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
pfas which no one else has chosen and I
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's any scientific
 
01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:16.020 align:start position:0%
evidence for such choice and now it's in
 
01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
court can you give us any update on
 
01:24:20.450 --> 01:24:20.460 align:start position:0%
where it stands
 
01:24:25.729 --> 01:24:25.739 align:start position:0%
that I cannot I I follow pfas up here
 
01:24:28.729 --> 01:24:28.739 align:start position:0%
but I look at it as you know what's in
 
01:24:30.410 --> 01:24:30.420 align:start position:0%
how it's impacting my Wastewater
 
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
Treatment Facility so on the setting of
 
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
any levels
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
and the science of that I I stay back
 
01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
perhaps you when the folks come in
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow you can let them know that
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
question may be asked sure happy to do
 
01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.450 align:start position:0%
question may be asked sure happy to do
that

01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:47.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.410 --> 01:24:54.420 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to add a couple of points
 
01:24:58.370 --> 01:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
that I think are important one is
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
funding for these projects was included
 
01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 which you could argue as
 
01:25:06.050 --> 01:25:06.060 align:start position:0%
part of the budget and therefore should
 
01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:07.320 align:start position:0%
be part of the budget going forward
 
01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
because it's a 20-year commitment
 
01:25:12.470 --> 01:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
these are for Approved project project
 
01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.430 align:start position:0%
these are for Approved project project
projects

01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
they've already been awarded and gone to
 
01:25:16.490 --> 01:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
government Council
 
01:25:18.890 --> 01:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
the department has Specific Instructions
 
01:25:21.169 --> 01:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
for preparing their budget but I think
 
01:25:23.630 --> 01:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
you could argue very strongly that this
 
01:25:25.310 --> 01:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
should be should have been part of the
 
01:25:31.010 --> 01:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
thanks Michael any further Miss wood or
 
01:25:38.930 --> 01:25:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:48.530 align:start position:0%
 
bill

01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
you state your name for the record
 
01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:55.189 align:start position:0%
you state your name for the record
please

01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:57.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Bill Hansel
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
um I've worked on this bill in 1989.
 
01:26:07.250 --> 01:26:07.260 align:start position:0%
so I've been involved in it for a bit of
 
01:26:10.129 --> 01:26:10.139 align:start position:0%
time I was formerly in the house from 84
 
01:26:12.290 --> 01:26:12.300 align:start position:0%
to 87 I was vice chairman of House
 
01:26:13.910 --> 01:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
Education committee
 
01:26:16.490 --> 01:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
uh but I've been following water since I
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
was a Precinct commissioner in 77 in
 
01:26:20.450 --> 01:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
Conway Village
 
01:26:23.629 --> 01:26:23.639 align:start position:0%
and then a selectment in Conway and then
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
to the House of Representatives I've
 
01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
been involved in water from most of my
 
01:26:29.810 --> 01:26:29.820 align:start position:0%
life my father was a master of plumber
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
so I grew up in the plumbing family
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
excuse me I know the value of water bill
 
01:26:36.410 --> 01:26:36.420 align:start position:0%
I think our clerk has a question because
 
01:26:38.209 --> 01:26:38.219 align:start position:0%
I just need to know who you're speaking
 
01:26:40.370 --> 01:26:40.380 align:start position:0%
on behalf I'm speaking on behalf of
 
01:26:42.890 --> 01:26:42.900 align:start position:0%
Granite State Rural Water Association as
 
01:26:47.570 --> 01:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
a policy analyst for that entity and I'm
 
01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:49.260 align:start position:0%
representing what's Conway water
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
Precinct in lower Bartlett water
 
01:26:51.120 --> 01:26:52.550 align:start position:0%
Precinct in lower Bartlett water
Precinct

01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
Precinct
 
01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:53.930 align:start position:0%
Precinct
two

01:26:53.930 --> 01:26:53.940 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
North and South areas of Mount
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
Washington Valley
 
01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.149 align:start position:0%
Washington Valley
um

01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
North Conway actually filed the uh the
 
01:27:03.890 --> 01:27:03.900 align:start position:0%
bill in 89.
 
01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
and created the state aid grant back in
 
01:27:11.090 --> 01:27:11.100 align:start position:0%
the 70s you realized the feds had
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
I think it was a
 
01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:14.030 align:start position:0%
I think it was a
70

01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
70
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
the state had 20 and the local was five
 
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
and that's how most of these Wastewater
 
01:27:22.189 --> 01:27:22.199 align:start position:0%
plants were built back in those days
 
01:27:24.169 --> 01:27:24.179 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are aging of course and
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
there's a great need to upgrade them but
 
01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
there's a greater need to expand them uh
 
01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:30.900 align:start position:0%
to to get to areas that
 
01:27:33.290 --> 01:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to have on-site
 
01:27:36.649 --> 01:27:36.659 align:start position:0%
soar for affordable housing so it Blends
 
01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:39.480 align:start position:0%
in with the state need to address that
 
01:27:41.570 --> 01:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
as well as protecting its rivers and
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
it's uh and it's water sources
 
01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:47.580 align:start position:0%
the the state aid grant I think
 
01:27:50.450 --> 01:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
representative Emrick said it very well
 
01:27:53.390 --> 01:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
I taught representative Buco in his long
 
01:27:56.209 --> 01:27:56.219 align:start position:0%
enduring Relentless efforts with his
 
01:27:59.570 --> 01:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
bills every year since 2008 in
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
particular has been the suspenders to
 
01:28:04.810 --> 01:28:04.820 align:start position:0%
the line item belt
 
01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
and I thought that was a good analogy
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
that that represent americh laid forward
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
the pants fell down in 2008 they almost
 
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
looked at the knees
 
01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:19.020 align:start position:0%
when Tom is billed every year has until
 
01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:21.420 align:start position:0%
last session has been pulling him up
 
01:28:24.050 --> 01:28:24.060 align:start position:0%
last session thanks to a bipartisan
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
effort and all you folks we got the belt
 
01:28:28.430 --> 01:28:28.440 align:start position:0%
at the waist level
 
01:28:30.770 --> 01:28:30.780 align:start position:0%
the problem is it's it's about to sink
 
01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:31.850 align:start position:0%
the problem is it's it's about to sink
again

01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:28:33.890 --> 01:28:33.900 align:start position:0%
at a time when there's an awful lot of
 
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
federal money coming in that would help
 
01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:36.229 align:start position:0%
federal money coming in that would help
us

01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:28:38.810 --> 01:28:38.820 align:start position:0%
this this is a three-legged stool a
 
01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
federal state and local funding
 
01:28:44.689 --> 01:28:44.699 align:start position:0%
and I'm I'm always representing the
 
01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
local effort as is representative Buco
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
because we came from that history and
 
01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:50.940 align:start position:0%
that knowledge
 
01:28:53.390 --> 01:28:53.400 align:start position:0%
the bonds wouldn't pass at the local
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
level to do the amazing amount of work
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's being done without that state and
 
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
Grant partnership
 
01:29:02.570 --> 01:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
and the people pass those bonds within
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
with the understanding of the law says
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
the state shall pay so it's uh it's more
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
a moral battle the law is there it's
 
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
just uh it's it's in the legislature
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
it's an educational battle uh it's quite
 
01:29:19.070 --> 01:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
complex unless you've lived at the local
 
01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
level and followed it all the way
 
01:29:23.090 --> 01:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
through but what happens what this bill
 
01:29:25.790 --> 01:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
does in essence especially the
 
01:29:27.770 --> 01:29:27.780 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing which we're trying to get in
 
01:29:29.270 --> 01:29:29.280 align:start position:0%
this session
 
01:29:31.729 --> 01:29:31.739 align:start position:0%
if if that's successful we might be able
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
to do away with the suspenders going
 
01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:34.850 align:start position:0%
to do away with the suspenders going
forward

01:29:34.850 --> 01:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:36.900 align:start position:0%
the non-lapsing
 
01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:39.780 align:start position:0%
would allow the the money that you put
 
01:29:42.290 --> 01:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
in the House Bill too because all this
 
01:29:45.169 --> 01:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
bill is really doing is allowing us to
 
01:29:46.910 --> 01:29:46.920 align:start position:0%
get in at the beginning ground level we
 
01:29:49.189 --> 01:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
had a presentation of the Finance on the
 
01:29:51.530 --> 01:29:51.540 align:start position:0%
on a bill and have a dissertation all
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
the way through to try to get the
 
01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
language in the house bill to the
 
01:29:57.290 --> 01:29:57.300 align:start position:0%
trailer bill that describes how those
 
01:30:00.290 --> 01:30:00.300 align:start position:0%
funds will go to the municipalities
 
01:30:02.090 --> 01:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
a couple of sessions ago it was
 
01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:04.560 align:start position:0%
clarified for the first time that this
 
01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
money in the state aid grant isn't the
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
Des budget it's money that passes from
 
01:30:12.410 --> 01:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
the general fund of the people back to
 
01:30:15.229 --> 01:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
the people in this Partnership of a
 
01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
partnership of long-term debt so uh
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
payments and principal interest on their
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
on a local debt
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
and the local debts could be I think
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's probably 250 million anyway of
 
01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:31.380 align:start position:0%
construction yes and we're only asking
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
to support it at a flat line level of
 
01:30:36.229 --> 01:30:36.239 align:start position:0%
about 15 million a year
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
and non-lapse it so that the agency the
 
01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
engineering Bureau can can have that
 
01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:44.699 align:start position:0%
money when those projects are done are
 
01:30:46.550 --> 01:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
what we say done they have to be
 
01:30:49.129 --> 01:30:49.139 align:start position:0%
certified as completed and then this has
 
01:30:50.990 --> 01:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
to be a one-year warranty
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
and those community and then usually the
 
01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
bonds for the federal government whether
 
01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
it's rural development or state
 
01:30:59.209 --> 01:30:59.219 align:start position:0%
revolving long fund come due a year
 
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
after so they have the money non-lapsing
 
01:31:04.129 --> 01:31:04.139 align:start position:0%
means that money is there when that
 
01:31:05.689 --> 01:31:05.699 align:start position:0%
certification is ready to go to
 
01:31:07.250 --> 01:31:07.260 align:start position:0%
government Council
 
01:31:09.890 --> 01:31:09.900 align:start position:0%
this also takes the
 
01:31:13.250 --> 01:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
really clarifies that any direction from
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
the governor to put a percentage
 
01:31:18.470 --> 01:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
reduction on all bureaucracies like they
 
01:31:21.050 --> 01:31:21.060 align:start position:0%
did in 2008 would not affect this
 
01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
funding it from the bureaucracy's point
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
of view and if it's long-lapsing and
 
01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's there
 
01:31:28.610 --> 01:31:28.620 align:start position:0%
it still isn't spent because it has to
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
go to government Council for approval
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
they still then at that point would have
 
01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
the latitude to decide what the state
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
can do on the economic conditions
 
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
but the fact that we're closing the Gap
 
01:31:42.290 --> 01:31:42.300 align:start position:0%
and not waiting for a next session of
 
01:31:44.750 --> 01:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
legislations was possible new changes of
 
01:31:46.610 --> 01:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
legislation not understanding the
 
01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:47.570 align:start position:0%
legislation not understanding the
program

01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:47.580 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh not not putting the money forward you
 
01:31:53.870 --> 01:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
have that time frame and in that time
 
01:31:56.930 --> 01:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
frame municipalities abound in health to
 
01:31:58.850 --> 01:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
make those payments whether the state's
 
01:32:00.770 --> 01:32:00.780 align:start position:0%
money is there or not and that's what
 
01:32:03.169 --> 01:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
we've been facing for a long time it's
 
01:32:05.090 --> 01:32:05.100 align:start position:0%
been a magnificent unanimous support
 
01:32:08.450 --> 01:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
last session Bolton House Finance in the
 
01:32:11.090 --> 01:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
house and in the full Senate to support
 
01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
this but I'm I'm hoping we can clarify
 
01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
the non-lapsing as representative Google
 
01:32:18.470 --> 01:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
understands it and brought forward in
 
01:32:21.830 --> 01:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
this amendment and then in conclusion uh
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
Senate rashadi I've been working with
 
01:32:27.290 --> 01:32:27.300 align:start position:0%
has filed Senate Bill 230 which
 
01:32:29.510 --> 01:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
was filed after this bill in the
 
01:32:32.090 --> 01:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing part is in there if you look
 
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
at the language of SB 230
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's also describes that the
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing means that any money that
 
01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:41.699 align:start position:0%
doesn't go to the efficiency budget
 
01:32:44.570 --> 01:32:44.580 align:start position:0%
which the Des calls a maintenance budget
 
01:32:47.209 --> 01:32:47.219 align:start position:0%
can be brought forward and then can be
 
01:32:51.050 --> 01:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
used to reward new projects according to
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
the approval of government Council it
 
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
takes a des out of the politics of the
 
01:32:58.490 --> 01:32:58.500 align:start position:0%
money it puts it in the hands of the
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
governor Council whether they want to
 
01:33:02.390 --> 01:33:02.400 align:start position:0%
cut the money or because they don't have
 
01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:03.129 align:start position:0%
cut the money or because they don't have
it

01:33:03.129 --> 01:33:03.139 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:33:06.590 --> 01:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
but the people bypassing those bonds can
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
start to have a reliable feeling that
 
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
the state is a is a solid partner and
 
01:33:15.649 --> 01:33:15.659 align:start position:0%
then I should point out too that as far
 
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
as a 20 or 30 percent
 
01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:19.010 align:start position:0%
as a 20 or 30 percent
uh

01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
all the projects we've that we did in
 
01:33:24.709 --> 01:33:24.719 align:start position:0%
North Conway uh we we already had
 
01:33:28.070 --> 01:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
our debt our rate payment three times
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
the state average I think it is it's a
 
01:33:32.810 --> 01:33:32.820 align:start position:0%
certain average of your rate set once it
 
01:33:34.669 --> 01:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
hits that level you're eligible for the
 
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
30 percent
 
01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
I've stood in front of people voting on
 
01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
the bonds and said raise your rates to
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
the level of unaffordability
 
01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:46.620 align:start position:0%
and then you get an extra 10 percent
 
01:33:48.530 --> 01:33:48.540 align:start position:0%
and then you've got skin in the game
 
01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
because in New Hampshire trust fund they
 
01:33:52.790 --> 01:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
all say we want skin in the game so now
 
01:33:54.530 --> 01:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
the locals raise their rates because
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to anyway to to
 
01:33:58.490 --> 01:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
pay the construction but why not raise
 
01:34:00.770 --> 01:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
it and pay as much as you can on rates
 
01:34:04.010 --> 01:34:04.020 align:start position:0%
and get 10 more on the long-term uh
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
Partnership of the state so that's a
 
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
strategy whether they do it locally or
 
01:34:10.850 --> 01:34:10.860 align:start position:0%
not it's up to them but but the local
 
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:13.500 align:start position:0%
government the local municipalities are
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
more than willing to do what the
 
01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
regulatory drivers are ordering some to
 
01:34:19.490 --> 01:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
they only ask that it's affordable
 
01:34:21.649 --> 01:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
and what makes it affordable the
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
formulas of the state and federal
 
01:34:25.610 --> 01:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
government municipalities at the local
 
01:34:27.290 --> 01:34:27.300 align:start position:0%
level are willing to accept those
 
01:34:29.209 --> 01:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
affordable formulas
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
so we're not trying to dictate anything
 
01:34:33.830 --> 01:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to by their by the state
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
and federal formulas make it affordable
 
01:34:38.750 --> 01:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
with a state a grant program
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
it's solid program it's a solid
 
01:34:44.570 --> 01:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
partnership and we can do much that has
 
01:34:47.209 --> 01:34:47.219 align:start position:0%
to be done within the state Rivers water
 
01:34:50.629 --> 01:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
protection Lakes Protections in
 
01:34:53.450 --> 01:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
conjunction with forests it's just all
 
01:34:55.729 --> 01:34:55.739 align:start position:0%
one thing but the essence of water
 
01:34:58.729 --> 01:34:58.739 align:start position:0%
depends on this state aid grant if you
 
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:00.900 align:start position:0%
want a lot of construction to occur
 
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to have to
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:16.330 --> 01:35:16.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.310 --> 01:35:19.320 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions uh the
 
01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:31.860 align:start position:0%
we'll uh hold on to it and see what the
 
01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:34.739 align:start position:0%
budget looks like Tom
 
01:35:34.739 --> 01:35:40.810 align:start position:0%
budget looks like Tom
foreign

01:35:40.810 --> 01:35:40.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.149 --> 01:35:43.159 align:start position:0%
having this
 
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
just give that to Mr Hoffman if you
 
01:35:45.960 --> 01:35:47.030 align:start position:0%
just give that to Mr Hoffman if you
would

01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
you know and we can take that up at a
 
01:35:50.930 --> 01:35:50.940 align:start position:0%
later date
 
01:35:50.940 --> 01:35:54.830 align:start position:0%
later date
thanks

we'll be back here at one o'clock so

01:36:27.530 --> 01:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:49.970 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:49.980 --> 01:37:06.110 align:start position:0%
 
organization

01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:26.930 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.940 --> 01:37:30.729 align:start position:0%
 
everybody

01:37:30.729 --> 01:37:30.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.169 --> 01:37:41.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.110 --> 01:38:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.010 --> 01:38:24.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.669 --> 01:38:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.679 --> 01:38:54.169 align:start position:0%
 
like

01:38:54.169 --> 01:38:54.179 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:38:56.750 --> 01:38:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's unfortunately I was in the building
 
01:38:59.149 --> 01:38:59.159 align:start position:0%
all day and it was my own bill and I
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
didn't come down because I bought it so
 
01:39:02.280 --> 03:01:56.990 align:start position:0%
didn't come down because I bought it so
so

03:01:56.990 --> 03:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:59.450 --> 03:01:59.460 align:start position:0%
let this take a few minutes a lot of
 
03:02:01.130 --> 03:02:01.140 align:start position:0%
handouts that have come up we're just
 
03:02:08.990 --> 03:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:18.190 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:02:18.190 --> 03:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:21.050 --> 03:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
's already made sure that they've given
 
03:02:23.269 --> 03:02:23.279 align:start position:0%
us quite a few but you can certainly
 
03:02:31.309 --> 03:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:31.319 --> 03:02:44.630 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:02:44.630 --> 03:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:47.809 --> 03:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
but it's like an existing bridge in this
 
03:02:47.819 --> 03:02:48.830 align:start position:0%
but it's like an existing bridge in this
picture

03:02:48.830 --> 03:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
picture
 
03:02:52.510 --> 03:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
all right representative Pearson uh
 
03:02:56.530 --> 03:02:56.540 align:start position:0%
this is House Bill 506
 
03:02:59.570 --> 03:02:59.580 align:start position:0%
relative to the construction of a rail
 
03:03:04.370 --> 03:03:04.380 align:start position:0%
trail box tunnel on exit 4A and Dairy
 
03:03:10.370 --> 03:03:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:14.690 --> 03:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:16.670 --> 03:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman
 
03:03:19.130 --> 03:03:19.140 align:start position:0%
members of finance division one for the
 
03:03:20.990 --> 03:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
record Representative Steve Pearson
 
03:03:23.450 --> 03:03:23.460 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 13. which
 
03:03:28.969 --> 03:03:28.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:35.389 --> 03:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
years old they started talking about the
 
03:03:39.110 --> 03:03:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:41.050 --> 03:03:41.060 align:start position:0%
a lot has happened since I was six
 
03:03:41.060 --> 03:03:42.410 align:start position:0%
a lot has happened since I was six
[Music]

03:03:42.410 --> 03:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:03:43.969 --> 03:03:43.979 align:start position:0%
and for the most part what hadn't
 
03:03:46.070 --> 03:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
happened was anything to do with exit 4A
 
03:03:48.110 --> 03:03:48.120 align:start position:0%
delay delay delay the Department of
 
03:03:50.030 --> 03:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation has delayed this project
 
03:03:53.990 --> 03:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
in some form or another since 1982.
 
03:03:56.450 --> 03:03:56.460 align:start position:0%
so fast forward to
 
03:03:59.269 --> 03:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
a couple years ago
 
03:04:01.730 --> 03:04:01.740 align:start position:0%
and things really start kind of jumping
 
03:04:04.910 --> 03:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:06.469 --> 03:04:06.479 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to touch on the test
 
03:04:08.150 --> 03:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
technical aspects of it I have people
 
03:04:10.550 --> 03:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
behind me that are here to do that what
 
03:04:12.530 --> 03:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk about is is my town
 
03:04:12.540 --> 03:04:14.990 align:start position:0%
I'm going to talk about is is my town
Dairy

03:04:14.990 --> 03:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
Dairy
 
03:04:18.170 --> 03:04:18.180 align:start position:0%
in the last two years I've had 34
 
03:04:21.710 --> 03:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
meetings 34 meetings with stakeholder
 
03:04:25.210 --> 03:04:25.220 align:start position:0%
groups the Department of Transportation
 
03:04:27.950 --> 03:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
handicapped folks
 
03:04:30.710 --> 03:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
and the like on this
 
03:04:30.720 --> 03:04:34.130 align:start position:0%
and the like on this
issue

03:04:34.130 --> 03:04:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:35.809 --> 03:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
03:04:38.630 --> 03:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
up until recently
 
03:04:40.790 --> 03:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
the plans that were presented to the
 
03:04:43.210 --> 03:04:43.220 align:start position:0%
folks in my town
 
03:04:46.010 --> 03:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
involved in tunnel that just went under
 
03:04:48.230 --> 03:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
six Lanes of traffic it's a logical
 
03:04:49.849 --> 03:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
thing to do it
 
03:04:53.389 --> 03:04:53.399 align:start position:0%
it's done in many many locations
 
03:04:56.630 --> 03:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:58.309 --> 03:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:05:01.849 --> 03:05:01.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:04.849 --> 03:05:04.859 align:start position:0%
and a concept came out
 
03:05:06.410 --> 03:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
with this
 
03:05:07.910 --> 03:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
spaghetti thing that you guys are
 
03:05:09.769 --> 03:05:09.779 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:05:11.570 --> 03:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
we never actually had an official public
 
03:05:13.730 --> 03:05:13.740 align:start position:0%
hearing until September
 
03:05:18.110 --> 03:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
of 2022 to discuss this at this point
 
03:05:21.230 --> 03:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
it was really just a dictation to the my
 
03:05:22.790 --> 03:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
constituents and it wasn't really a
 
03:05:24.889 --> 03:05:24.899 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
03:05:24.899 --> 03:05:26.389 align:start position:0%
public hearing
so

03:05:26.389 --> 03:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:05:28.690 --> 03:05:28.700 align:start position:0%
you can imagine the shock and surprise
 
03:05:32.330 --> 03:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
of the leaders of at the Town level and
 
03:05:34.490 --> 03:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
the state level when you have something
 
03:05:37.070 --> 03:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
that's gone forward for a long time
 
03:05:39.830 --> 03:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
with pretty much the same way
 
03:05:42.410 --> 03:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden
 
03:05:51.349 --> 03:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:53.030 --> 03:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
one of the other things that I'd like to
 
03:05:56.030 --> 03:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
address before we start getting heavy
 
03:05:58.429 --> 03:05:58.439 align:start position:0%
into this is an apology to this
 
03:06:01.250 --> 03:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
committee during
 
03:06:03.769 --> 03:06:03.779 align:start position:0%
last week when the speaker's office sent
 
03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
out a series of emails in reference to
 
03:06:08.570 --> 03:06:08.580 align:start position:0%
the rescheduling of hearings due to
 
03:06:10.190 --> 03:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
inclement weather
 
03:06:13.790 --> 03:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
the work session notification for this
 
03:06:17.389 --> 03:06:17.399 align:start position:0%
day was included in a in a series of
 
03:06:18.889 --> 03:06:18.899 align:start position:0%
emails that went out
 
03:06:20.990 --> 03:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
myself and several others were under the
 
03:06:22.429 --> 03:06:22.439 align:start position:0%
impression that the public hearing had
 
03:06:24.710 --> 03:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
been rescheduled to today
 
03:06:26.750 --> 03:06:26.760 align:start position:0%
that is why you did not see very many
 
03:06:28.969 --> 03:06:28.979 align:start position:0%
folks at the public hearing despite
 
03:06:32.570 --> 03:06:32.580 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people that had signed in on
 
03:06:34.370 --> 03:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet
 
03:06:36.170 --> 03:06:36.180 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of the situation we're in
 
03:06:38.690 --> 03:06:38.700 align:start position:0%
today and I again would apologize to the
 
03:06:41.809 --> 03:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:44.870 --> 03:06:44.880 align:start position:0%
but during that testimony
 
03:06:47.990 --> 03:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
the Department of Transportation decided
 
03:06:50.090 --> 03:06:50.100 align:start position:0%
to represent the opinion of the town of
 
03:06:55.250 --> 03:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:57.290 --> 03:06:57.300 align:start position:0%
so much so that the chairman of the Town
 
03:07:01.190 --> 03:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
Council has sent me something to read
 
03:07:04.969 --> 03:07:04.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:06.950 --> 03:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
so I will if it's okay with you I will
 
03:07:08.570 --> 03:07:08.580 align:start position:0%
read what what the chairman of the Town
 
03:07:09.950 --> 03:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
Council said is I think this is
 
03:07:11.269 --> 03:07:11.279 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily relevant to our
 
03:07:13.429 --> 03:07:13.439 align:start position:0%
circumstances and I will get you with
 
03:07:15.769 --> 03:07:15.779 align:start position:0%
this in in writing form hi my name is
 
03:07:17.809 --> 03:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
Josh Borden I'm the dairy Town councilor
 
03:07:20.330 --> 03:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
at large and chairman finishing my ninth
 
03:07:22.130 --> 03:07:22.140 align:start position:0%
year first I'd like to thank you all for
 
03:07:23.870 --> 03:07:23.880 align:start position:0%
your service and recognizing my
 
03:07:26.210 --> 03:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
testimony I would be there in person but
 
03:07:27.710 --> 03:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
I am teaching political science at
 
03:07:29.809 --> 03:07:29.819 align:start position:0%
Windham High School
 
03:07:32.570 --> 03:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
second in the in the words in this
 
03:07:34.849 --> 03:07:34.859 align:start position:0%
letter are mine and not reflective of my
 
03:07:36.710 --> 03:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the council
 
03:07:38.690 --> 03:07:38.700 align:start position:0%
I was disappointed to hear some of the
 
03:07:40.490 --> 03:07:40.500 align:start position:0%
testimony being given by the D.O.T
 
03:07:41.929 --> 03:07:41.939 align:start position:0%
during representative Pearson's Bill
 
03:07:44.750 --> 03:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on the rail trail tunnel
 
03:07:47.090 --> 03:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
the fact is I never voted in favor of
 
03:07:49.309 --> 03:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
the alternative scenic route plan
 
03:07:51.410 --> 03:07:51.420 align:start position:0%
approximately one month prior to our
 
03:07:53.090 --> 03:07:53.100 align:start position:0%
vote I called for a meeting with
 
03:07:54.950 --> 03:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson Town manager Dave
 
03:07:57.650 --> 03:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
Karen members of The Dot and vice chair
 
03:07:59.870 --> 03:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
Aaron Spencer Town Council Vice chair
 
03:08:02.389 --> 03:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
Aaron Spencer to ask questions about
 
03:08:04.849 --> 03:08:04.859 align:start position:0%
each of the plans tunnel versus
 
03:08:07.490 --> 03:08:07.500 align:start position:0%
the alternative the cost to Dairy
 
03:08:09.830 --> 03:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and potential delays I heard
 
03:08:11.630 --> 03:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
from hundreds of constituents regarding
 
03:08:13.969 --> 03:08:13.979 align:start position:0%
their desire for the tunnel the only
 
03:08:16.010 --> 03:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
time that I have seen the community this
 
03:08:18.349 --> 03:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
fired up was when a radical counselor
 
03:08:20.809 --> 03:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
closed a fire station
 
03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
during the meeting with the D.O.T I was
 
03:08:24.710 --> 03:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
assured of three things one they wanted
 
03:08:27.070 --> 03:08:27.080 align:start position:0%
the town to be happy with the end result
 
03:08:30.170 --> 03:08:30.180 align:start position:0%
two the dairy taxpayer would not have to
 
03:08:31.969 --> 03:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
pay for the tunnel if we chose to go
 
03:08:34.250 --> 03:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
that route and three there would be
 
03:08:36.650 --> 03:08:36.660 align:start position:0%
delays to the project likely lasting six
 
03:08:38.030 --> 03:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
months to a year
 
03:08:40.250 --> 03:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
after hearing this I felt it was my
 
03:08:41.990 --> 03:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
obligation to my colleagues as well as
 
03:08:44.809 --> 03:08:44.819 align:start position:0%
the constituents to agendize this item
 
03:08:47.630 --> 03:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
and bring forward a vote on whether the
 
03:08:49.309 --> 03:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
Town Council supported the scene the
 
03:08:50.809 --> 03:08:50.819 align:start position:0%
tunnel or scenic route
 
03:08:53.090 --> 03:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
to my dismay the town received a letter
 
03:08:55.670 --> 03:08:55.680 align:start position:0%
a few days prior to the vote in a
 
03:08:57.950 --> 03:08:57.960 align:start position:0%
nutshell the letter stated that the town
 
03:09:00.410 --> 03:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
would likely have to pay the cost of the
 
03:09:05.889 --> 03:09:05.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:08.630 --> 03:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
as chairman I was infuriated with the
 
03:09:10.969 --> 03:09:10.979 align:start position:0%
confusion in reversal the council had
 
03:09:12.290 --> 03:09:12.300 align:start position:0%
always said that they were not willing
 
03:09:14.570 --> 03:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
or able to spend more money on the exit
 
03:09:16.969 --> 03:09:16.979 align:start position:0%
4A project beyond our five million
 
03:09:18.889 --> 03:09:18.899 align:start position:0%
dollar obligation
 
03:09:21.769 --> 03:09:21.779 align:start position:0%
I we per public testimony were
 
03:09:23.929 --> 03:09:23.939 align:start position:0%
indifferent on the rail trail plans if
 
03:09:26.510 --> 03:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
we were to pay however if we were given
 
03:09:28.849 --> 03:09:28.859 align:start position:0%
the choice to upshift the cost then the
 
03:09:30.410 --> 03:09:30.420 align:start position:0%
tunnel may have passed
 
03:09:32.150 --> 03:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
in my opinion the vote that we
 
03:09:33.590 --> 03:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
eventually took said that we were
 
03:09:36.469 --> 03:09:36.479 align:start position:0%
indifferent with the current terms and
 
03:09:38.030 --> 03:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
would not take the risk of having to pay
 
03:09:39.349 --> 03:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
for a tunnel
 
03:09:40.910 --> 03:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
it would have been interesting to see
 
03:09:42.710 --> 03:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
what would have happened had the dot not
 
03:09:45.050 --> 03:09:45.060 align:start position:0%
reversed their stance I am personally
 
03:09:46.969 --> 03:09:46.979 align:start position:0%
asking you to Value the safety of the
 
03:09:49.670 --> 03:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
residents tourists from all over the
 
03:09:52.190 --> 03:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
world who will be using this Trail value
 
03:09:54.290 --> 03:09:54.300 align:start position:0%
the economics of a vibrant well-built
 
03:09:55.370 --> 03:09:55.380 align:start position:0%
Rail Trail
 
03:09:57.769 --> 03:09:57.779 align:start position:0%
and to support funding the tunnel I am
 
03:09:59.150 --> 03:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
always willing to wait for something
 
03:10:01.670 --> 03:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
that will better Mike will be better for
 
03:10:03.830 --> 03:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
my community and the state we share
 
03:10:07.250 --> 03:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
thank you Josh Borden chairman
 
03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:14.090 --> 03:10:14.100 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
03:10:16.250 --> 03:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
happened in the history of this was that
 
03:10:18.590 --> 03:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
the the towns of Darien Londonderry
 
03:10:20.929 --> 03:10:20.939 align:start position:0%
signed a contract with the state it's a
 
03:10:23.269 --> 03:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
single document signed by both towns
 
03:10:26.690 --> 03:10:26.700 align:start position:0%
indicating their financial obligation
 
03:10:29.389 --> 03:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
the town of dairy FL floated a bond to
 
03:10:30.889 --> 03:10:30.899 align:start position:0%
pay for that five million dollars that
 
03:10:33.590 --> 03:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
was that was conducted years ago
 
03:10:34.790 --> 03:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
so to have the Department of
 
03:10:36.710 --> 03:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
Transportation send a threatening letter
 
03:10:39.050 --> 03:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
and that's what it was it was a threat
 
03:10:41.990 --> 03:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
to the Derry Town Council
 
03:10:43.969 --> 03:10:43.979 align:start position:0%
for them not to interfere with what the
 
03:10:46.250 --> 03:10:46.260 align:start position:0%
D.O.T was doing otherwise there would be
 
03:10:49.550 --> 03:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
Financial penalties involved I think was
 
03:10:49.560 --> 03:10:50.929 align:start position:0%
Financial penalties involved I think was
unethical

03:10:50.929 --> 03:10:50.939 align:start position:0%
unethical
 
03:10:53.150 --> 03:10:53.160 align:start position:0%
it violated the conditions of the
 
03:10:55.429 --> 03:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
contract and it's certainly nothing I
 
03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
had ever seen before from state
 
03:11:01.309 --> 03:11:01.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:04.190 --> 03:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
we're in a peculiar situation here if
 
03:11:06.110 --> 03:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
you go up and down 93 and you get off an
 
03:11:08.690 --> 03:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
exit you exit onto a state road right
 
03:11:13.429 --> 03:11:13.439 align:start position:0%
Exit 4 is 102. Exit 3 is 111. but in
 
03:11:16.250 --> 03:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
this particular case exit 4A exits onto
 
03:11:19.070 --> 03:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
town roads
 
03:11:22.370 --> 03:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
so the circumstances of
 
03:11:24.349 --> 03:11:24.359 align:start position:0%
what you would I would consider a normal
 
03:11:25.730 --> 03:11:25.740 align:start position:0%
type of exit where the Department of
 
03:11:28.070 --> 03:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
Transportation controls both the highway
 
03:11:30.410 --> 03:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
and the road that it exits onto is not
 
03:11:32.510 --> 03:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
the case here
 
03:11:34.670 --> 03:11:34.680 align:start position:0%
so it's
 
03:11:37.070 --> 03:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
it's a it's an Avenue that I think was
 
03:11:39.290 --> 03:11:39.300 align:start position:0%
confusing for folks it's been confusing
 
03:11:40.670 --> 03:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
for me
 
03:11:43.429 --> 03:11:43.439 align:start position:0%
as to how where that separation is and
 
03:11:44.870 --> 03:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
who was allowed to do what and who
 
03:11:46.130 --> 03:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
controls what
 
03:11:48.830 --> 03:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
but we're well into the town of Derry
 
03:11:53.450 --> 03:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:55.490 --> 03:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
the rail trail and dairy has been
 
03:11:57.110 --> 03:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
through the efforts of a lot of
 
03:11:57.120 --> 03:11:58.550 align:start position:0%
through the efforts of a lot of
volunteers

03:11:58.550 --> 03:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
volunteers
 
03:12:00.290 --> 03:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
become a
 
03:12:02.150 --> 03:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
very popular
 
03:12:05.690 --> 03:12:05.700 align:start position:0%
part of a State trail system
 
03:12:08.809 --> 03:12:08.819 align:start position:0%
it's paved for the most part
 
03:12:11.450 --> 03:12:11.460 align:start position:0%
it's in the University of New Hampshire
 
03:12:14.330 --> 03:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
has done usage studies it is heavily
 
03:12:14.340 --> 03:12:15.950 align:start position:0%
has done usage studies it is heavily
used

03:12:15.950 --> 03:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
used
 
03:12:18.290 --> 03:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
then rightly so you have a great walking
 
03:12:20.870 --> 03:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
path it's safe you very little
 
03:12:23.870 --> 03:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
interactions with automobiles it's a
 
03:12:26.030 --> 03:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
place where you can bring pets kids in
 
03:12:28.969 --> 03:12:28.979 align:start position:0%
strollers bikes that sort of thing
 
03:12:30.830 --> 03:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
we actually have two businesses in Dairy
 
03:12:33.170 --> 03:12:33.180 align:start position:0%
that have popped up because of the trail
 
03:12:36.550 --> 03:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
that's how popular it is
 
03:12:40.070 --> 03:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
so when this came about
 
03:12:41.990 --> 03:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
when we looked at this
 
03:12:46.190 --> 03:12:46.200 align:start position:0%
immediate concerns came up because the
 
03:12:49.490 --> 03:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
design requires a crosswalk across six
 
03:12:52.130 --> 03:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
Lanes of traffic now folks have a
 
03:12:54.950 --> 03:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
tendency to kind of just
 
03:12:57.050 --> 03:12:57.060 align:start position:0%
go the straight path
 
03:12:58.969 --> 03:12:58.979 align:start position:0%
and this alternative plan that you see
 
03:12:58.979 --> 03:13:00.469 align:start position:0%
and this alternative plan that you see
here

03:13:00.469 --> 03:13:00.479 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:13:02.690 --> 03:13:02.700 align:start position:0%
it goes so far out of the way that The
 
03:13:04.309 --> 03:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
Logical move is I'm just going to hit a
 
03:13:06.050 --> 03:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
button and I'm going to do the Frogger
 
03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
thing and I'm going to go across six
 
03:13:09.349 --> 03:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
Lanes of traffic to continue on to the
 
03:13:10.309 --> 03:13:10.319 align:start position:0%
other side
 
03:13:12.349 --> 03:13:12.359 align:start position:0%
the Town Council doesn't want it the
 
03:13:14.570 --> 03:13:14.580 align:start position:0%
town manager doesn't want it
 
03:13:17.210 --> 03:13:17.220 align:start position:0%
I as a 27-year safety professional don't
 
03:13:18.469 --> 03:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
like it
 
03:13:21.830 --> 03:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
and I look at this and I say okay
 
03:13:23.929 --> 03:13:23.939 align:start position:0%
what's the logical move here what's been
 
03:13:25.790 --> 03:13:25.800 align:start position:0%
done in other places
 
03:13:27.469 --> 03:13:27.479 align:start position:0%
and it's simply been a concrete box
 
03:13:30.110 --> 03:13:30.120 align:start position:0%
tunnel the concrete box tunnel is so
 
03:13:32.750 --> 03:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
small it's not even big enough to fit in
 
03:13:34.429 --> 03:13:34.439 align:start position:0%
the finance room
 
03:13:36.469 --> 03:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
that's how that's how small this tunnel
 
03:13:38.570 --> 03:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
is it's not big at all
 
03:13:41.630 --> 03:13:41.640 align:start position:0%
but the idea here is to replace it with
 
03:13:44.210 --> 03:13:44.220 align:start position:0%
almost a quarter mile of pavement that
 
03:13:47.570 --> 03:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
runs at us that it angles that are on
 
03:13:50.090 --> 03:13:50.100 align:start position:0%
the cusp of ADA compliance
 
03:13:53.389 --> 03:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
that are in one side almost two football
 
03:13:55.550 --> 03:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
fields in length
 
03:13:58.610 --> 03:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
and that goes runs along a brook that's
 
03:13:58.620 --> 03:13:59.889 align:start position:0%
and that goes runs along a brook that's
flooded

03:13:59.889 --> 03:13:59.899 align:start position:0%
flooded
 
03:14:02.630 --> 03:14:02.640 align:start position:0%
massively flooded three times in my
 
03:14:06.170 --> 03:14:06.180 align:start position:0%
lifetime I grew up in Dairy
 
03:14:07.730 --> 03:14:07.740 align:start position:0%
so this whole thing doesn't even pass
 
03:14:10.849 --> 03:14:10.859 align:start position:0%
the sniff test it's illogical
 
03:14:13.190 --> 03:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
it's not good for the the rail trail
 
03:14:15.830 --> 03:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
system itself it's gonna I don't even
 
03:14:16.969 --> 03:14:16.979 align:start position:0%
know what it's going to do to the race
 
03:14:19.429 --> 03:14:19.439 align:start position:0%
that we hold we hold a a running race a
 
03:14:21.230 --> 03:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
charity race on the rail trail
 
03:14:22.670 --> 03:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know how that's going to work
 
03:14:25.250 --> 03:14:25.260 align:start position:0%
I'm very concerned about the
 
03:14:27.050 --> 03:14:27.060 align:start position:0%
interactions between bicyclists and
 
03:14:29.450 --> 03:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
pedestrians I mean I'm very concerned
 
03:14:32.269 --> 03:14:32.279 align:start position:0%
about blind corners
 
03:14:35.210 --> 03:14:35.220 align:start position:0%
in in an amazing bit of
 
03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
I won't call it hypocrisy because I
 
03:14:39.110 --> 03:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
don't know that it's that but in by
 
03:14:41.150 --> 03:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
comparison the Department of
 
03:14:42.769 --> 03:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
Transportation had concerns about the
 
03:14:46.429 --> 03:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
slope of the road over the Box tunnel
 
03:14:48.469 --> 03:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
and they were concerned at the six six
 
03:14:51.469 --> 03:14:51.479 align:start position:0%
and seven degree Mark in an automobile
 
03:14:52.790 --> 03:14:52.800 align:start position:0%
but they don't seem to be concerned
 
03:14:55.790 --> 03:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
about a pedestrian at five degrees
 
03:14:59.450 --> 03:14:59.460 align:start position:0%
so we worked with them shaved a foot off
 
03:15:01.849 --> 03:15:01.859 align:start position:0%
the top of it and got those numbers into
 
03:15:03.889 --> 03:15:03.899 align:start position:0%
a satisfactory
 
03:15:07.849 --> 03:15:07.859 align:start position:0%
range for the road travel
 
03:15:09.830 --> 03:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
but the reality here is when the last
 
03:15:12.290 --> 03:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
tail light from a DOT dump truck drives
 
03:15:14.570 --> 03:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
away from this project this is on the
 
03:15:16.130 --> 03:15:16.140 align:start position:0%
town of dairy we're going to have to
 
03:15:18.769 --> 03:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
maintain it we're going to have to fix
 
03:15:20.990 --> 03:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
it when it has damage
 
03:15:22.250 --> 03:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
and we're going to have to deal with the
 
03:15:24.710 --> 03:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
repercussions of a design
 
03:15:29.389 --> 03:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:32.570 --> 03:15:32.580 align:start position:0%
so the simple answer was just hey the
 
03:15:34.910 --> 03:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
federal government was given this plan
 
03:15:38.389 --> 03:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
years ago and they approved it the
 
03:15:39.650 --> 03:15:39.660 align:start position:0%
federal government approved the Box
 
03:15:41.630 --> 03:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
tunnel it met the criteria it met their
 
03:15:43.490 --> 03:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
safety concerns they gave it the green
 
03:15:43.500 --> 03:15:44.450 align:start position:0%
safety concerns they gave it the green
light

03:15:44.450 --> 03:15:44.460 align:start position:0%
light
 
03:15:47.090 --> 03:15:47.100 align:start position:0%
the plan before you is not approved by
 
03:15:49.550 --> 03:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
the feds and as of last discussion with
 
03:15:55.010 --> 03:15:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:56.870 --> 03:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
when the August 23rd meeting with the
 
03:15:58.370 --> 03:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation that I
 
03:16:01.730 --> 03:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
attended I was told well if we have the
 
03:16:03.710 --> 03:16:03.720 align:start position:0%
money it's all about money if we have
 
03:16:06.530 --> 03:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
the money we'll build the tunnel
 
03:16:09.290 --> 03:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
well that's why we're here
 
03:16:12.469 --> 03:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
because we're asking the state as part
 
03:16:14.450 --> 03:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
of this highway project to appropriate
 
03:16:18.170 --> 03:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
the money to make this happen
 
03:16:19.610 --> 03:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
this is something the town of dairy is
 
03:16:22.550 --> 03:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
going to have to live with for decades
 
03:16:24.889 --> 03:16:24.899 align:start position:0%
if not a hundred years these box tunnels
 
03:16:27.110 --> 03:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
have huge lifespans
 
03:16:30.050 --> 03:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
to undo this later
 
03:16:32.690 --> 03:16:32.700 align:start position:0%
would be millions of dollars
 
03:16:34.429 --> 03:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
as you were all aware the time to make
 
03:16:35.990 --> 03:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
the proper
 
03:16:37.969 --> 03:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
modifications to things is during the
 
03:16:41.389 --> 03:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:43.370 --> 03:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
so when I get a letter from the
 
03:16:44.630 --> 03:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
University a division in the University
 
03:16:46.969 --> 03:16:46.979 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that deals with outdoor
 
03:16:49.610 --> 03:16:49.620 align:start position:0%
recreation for handicapped folks that's
 
03:16:52.670 --> 03:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
telling me that this isn't workable
 
03:16:54.950 --> 03:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
when I have concerns from Runners that I
 
03:16:56.510 --> 03:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
went to high school with that have
 
03:16:59.269 --> 03:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
safety concerns about going under a
 
03:16:59.279 --> 03:17:00.230 align:start position:0%
safety concerns about going under a
bridge

03:17:00.230 --> 03:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
bridge
 
03:17:02.150 --> 03:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
into a blind corner
 
03:17:04.370 --> 03:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
and when I have folks
 
03:17:07.610 --> 03:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
in my town that use this
 
03:17:09.769 --> 03:17:09.779 align:start position:0%
to go out with their kids and they're
 
03:17:11.929 --> 03:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
telling me what's going on with this I I
 
03:17:15.670 --> 03:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:18.889 --> 03:17:18.899 align:start position:0%
so I am I'm not going to get into any
 
03:17:20.630 --> 03:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
technical aspects there's folks here
 
03:17:22.010 --> 03:17:22.020 align:start position:0%
that will that will do that and give you
 
03:17:23.150 --> 03:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit different you know a little
 
03:17:25.190 --> 03:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
bit timeline as far as the the state
 
03:17:27.050 --> 03:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
groups and whatnot but that's that's the
 
03:17:31.490 --> 03:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:34.309 --> 03:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Pearson
 
03:17:36.410 --> 03:17:36.420 align:start position:0%
representative Wilde
 
03:17:39.170 --> 03:17:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr Mr chair and thank you
 
03:17:40.610 --> 03:17:40.620 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson do you know how
 
03:17:43.389 --> 03:17:43.399 align:start position:0%
how many years this five million dollar
 
03:17:46.550 --> 03:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
bond has been paid off and and how many
 
03:17:48.769 --> 03:17:48.779 align:start position:0%
more years to go and my understanding is
 
03:17:50.750 --> 03:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
Darius already paid it it's done we've
 
03:17:52.370 --> 03:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
paid we paid the Department of
 
03:17:54.410 --> 03:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
Transportation and then bonded it in the
 
03:17:56.750 --> 03:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
town as far as the the town itself
 
03:17:58.309 --> 03:17:58.319 align:start position:0%
paying back the bond they took out to
 
03:18:00.230 --> 03:18:00.240 align:start position:0%
pay the dot I'm not aware of when that
 
03:18:02.030 --> 03:18:02.040 align:start position:0%
but the dot has been paid that's that's
 
03:18:04.790 --> 03:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
what I've been told thank you
 
03:18:06.349 --> 03:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
you know it's a good representative
 
03:18:09.830 --> 03:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
Mount Vernon thank you Mr chair
 
03:18:13.190 --> 03:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative what is the current
 
03:18:16.969 --> 03:18:16.979 align:start position:0%
situation with the rail trail is it is
 
03:18:19.309 --> 03:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
there no length there currently or what
 
03:18:21.349 --> 03:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
well the currently the railroad bit is
 
03:18:24.170 --> 03:18:24.180 align:start position:0%
there it's so that piece of railroad bed
 
03:18:27.590 --> 03:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
and dairy was used up until 1984.
 
03:18:30.830 --> 03:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
it's when I you know the uh
 
03:18:33.950 --> 03:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
it was used for Freight uh the last time
 
03:18:35.450 --> 03:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
passenger service was sometime in the
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
1950s but it was used for for Freight
 
03:18:40.429 --> 03:18:40.439 align:start position:0%
um so the bed is all there there's a
 
03:18:41.750 --> 03:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
couple of spots where they've had some
 
03:18:43.429 --> 03:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
little washouts and things like that but
 
03:18:47.210 --> 03:18:47.220 align:start position:0%
nothing of nothing a consequence but the
 
03:18:49.370 --> 03:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
the dairy rail trail folks the town of
 
03:18:51.530 --> 03:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
dairy have done improvements to this up
 
03:18:54.050 --> 03:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
until the point of 4A because there was
 
03:18:56.809 --> 03:18:56.819 align:start position:0%
no sense in doing any work in that area
 
03:18:58.969 --> 03:18:58.979 align:start position:0%
because we knew the highway project was
 
03:19:01.429 --> 03:19:01.439 align:start position:0%
coming through so it is paved it is it
 
03:19:03.889 --> 03:19:03.899 align:start position:0%
is done right up until the point of this
 
03:19:05.990 --> 03:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
construction project it's all ready to
 
03:19:06.000 --> 03:19:08.830 align:start position:0%
construction project it's all ready to
go

03:19:08.830 --> 03:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:12.769 --> 03:19:12.779 align:start position:0%
follow-up um my question is what did the
 
03:19:16.250 --> 03:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
red did the railroad cross the street
 
03:19:18.650 --> 03:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
currently uh when it was in
 
03:19:21.250 --> 03:19:21.260 align:start position:0%
it it was at street level
 
03:19:24.469 --> 03:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
it was at street level and there was a
 
03:19:26.870 --> 03:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
bridge a wooden bridge that on Madden
 
03:19:28.429 --> 03:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
road that went over the railroad bridge
 
03:19:31.790 --> 03:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
that bridge was torn down in 86 yes and
 
03:19:34.490 --> 03:19:34.500 align:start position:0%
just filled in with dirt but yes it went
 
03:19:34.500 --> 03:19:35.990 align:start position:0%
just filled in with dirt but yes it went
across

03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
across
 
03:19:41.030 --> 03:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:42.769 --> 03:19:42.779 align:start position:0%
any questions over here uh
 
03:19:44.389 --> 03:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
03:19:45.889 --> 03:19:45.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:19:49.550 --> 03:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative so do you have this um a
 
03:19:51.290 --> 03:19:51.300 align:start position:0%
handout from D.O.T I wanted to ask you
 
03:19:53.030 --> 03:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
some questions related I've seen it so
 
03:19:54.769 --> 03:19:54.779 align:start position:0%
many times I can probably do it without
 
03:19:56.929 --> 03:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
it but we can so you said these are town
 
03:20:00.110 --> 03:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
roads so Folsom Road North High Street
 
03:20:03.170 --> 03:20:03.180 align:start position:0%
and ferlander these are all town roads
 
03:20:05.929 --> 03:20:05.939 align:start position:0%
correct correct but they're being re
 
03:20:09.110 --> 03:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
worked as part of this project correct
 
03:20:10.969 --> 03:20:10.979 align:start position:0%
they are being reworked as part of the
 
03:20:12.950 --> 03:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
foray project this actually extends
 
03:20:16.610 --> 03:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
another even more easterly down Folsom
 
03:20:19.429 --> 03:20:19.439 align:start position:0%
it crosses not only Route 28 but it goes
 
03:20:21.370 --> 03:20:21.380 align:start position:0%
all the way down to route 102.
 
03:20:23.690 --> 03:20:23.700 align:start position:0%
substantial this is a huge swath through
 
03:20:25.730 --> 03:20:25.740 align:start position:0%
the middle of my town
 
03:20:27.590 --> 03:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay so we don't really have a picture
 
03:20:30.050 --> 03:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
of what it looks like today well you
 
03:20:31.490 --> 03:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
have a picture in front of you of the
 
03:20:34.849 --> 03:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
area of concern here where this where
 
03:20:36.590 --> 03:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
the tunnel would the Box tunnel would go
 
03:20:38.690 --> 03:20:38.700 align:start position:0%
through I did hear you over here you
 
03:20:39.950 --> 03:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
asked representative leishman about
 
03:20:41.990 --> 03:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
what's the box with the slashes those
 
03:20:44.690 --> 03:20:44.700 align:start position:0%
are businesses that have been eliminated
 
03:20:47.210 --> 03:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
due to this project we've lost 13
 
03:20:50.990 --> 03:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
businesses in Dairy because of this exit
 
03:20:53.150 --> 03:20:53.160 align:start position:0%
construction so that's those are
 
03:20:56.030 --> 03:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
structures that are being torn down
 
03:20:58.010 --> 03:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
um one of which was only is only like
 
03:20:59.630 --> 03:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
nine years old
 
03:21:01.849 --> 03:21:01.859 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
03:21:04.670 --> 03:21:04.680 align:start position:0%
now you made the statement that people
 
03:21:08.269 --> 03:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
will be Crossing five Lanes of traffic I
 
03:21:10.250 --> 03:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
don't see that on this map so on the
 
03:21:11.570 --> 03:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
left hand side where you see the
 
03:21:13.550 --> 03:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
building that's being removed
 
03:21:15.170 --> 03:21:15.180 align:start position:0%
that gray
 
03:21:17.870 --> 03:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
area is the railroad bed
 
03:21:21.290 --> 03:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
okay so as a result there's going to be
 
03:21:22.969 --> 03:21:22.979 align:start position:0%
a crosswalk
 
03:21:25.070 --> 03:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
on Folsom Road where it comes to that
 
03:21:25.080 --> 03:21:27.230 align:start position:0%
on Folsom Road where it comes to that
intersection

03:21:27.230 --> 03:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
intersection
 
03:21:29.090 --> 03:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
and that's the unfortunately the
 
03:21:31.190 --> 03:21:31.200 align:start position:0%
sidewalks and the rail bed are both gray
 
03:21:33.590 --> 03:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
so it's hard to
 
03:21:35.510 --> 03:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
you're not necessarily Zoom I guess on
 
03:21:37.969 --> 03:21:37.979 align:start position:0%
the maybe on the right hand side that
 
03:21:39.889 --> 03:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
would probably be better you can that
 
03:21:42.290 --> 03:21:42.300 align:start position:0%
where it jet where you come north on
 
03:21:44.510 --> 03:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
High Street and you have what looks like
 
03:21:46.190 --> 03:21:46.200 align:start position:0%
a bit of a triangle where it slopes to
 
03:21:48.230 --> 03:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
the right that little jot to the left
 
03:21:50.330 --> 03:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
that goes across there
 
03:21:52.070 --> 03:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
that's where there will be a they're
 
03:21:53.809 --> 03:21:53.819 align:start position:0%
gonna have to put a crosswalk
 
03:21:56.450 --> 03:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
across that six Lanes of traffic
 
03:21:59.510 --> 03:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
so that's where you want the rail trail
 
03:22:01.250 --> 03:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
yes well that's where the rail that's
 
03:22:02.630 --> 03:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
where the railroad bed pretty much is
 
03:22:04.370 --> 03:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
and the tunnel would would go underneath
 
03:22:08.929 --> 03:22:08.939 align:start position:0%
that okay so but I understand that that
 
03:22:11.809 --> 03:22:11.819 align:start position:0%
if you go to the right with the loop
 
03:22:14.690 --> 03:22:14.700 align:start position:0%
around and so on that loop around goes
 
03:22:16.790 --> 03:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
under the full subroad it goes
 
03:22:18.950 --> 03:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
underneath a bridge that would have to
 
03:22:20.750 --> 03:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
be lengthened in order to accommodate it
 
03:22:20.760 --> 03:22:22.190 align:start position:0%
be lengthened in order to accommodate it
yes

03:22:22.190 --> 03:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:22:24.849 --> 03:22:24.859 align:start position:0%
okay but that bridge work is being done
 
03:22:27.410 --> 03:22:27.420 align:start position:0%
as part of the thing all of this is in a
 
03:22:29.450 --> 03:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
design phase that none of this even goes
 
03:22:32.330 --> 03:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
out to bid at earliest October so this
 
03:22:34.849 --> 03:22:34.859 align:start position:0%
we're not they're not bidding any of
 
03:22:37.070 --> 03:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
this out yet
 
03:22:38.870 --> 03:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
I guess my point is people are not
 
03:22:41.750 --> 03:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
required to cross Folsom Road no on top
 
03:22:43.910 --> 03:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
they can go underneath they could but
 
03:22:45.530 --> 03:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
you're right keep in mind you're looking
 
03:22:48.830 --> 03:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
at a flat map with no gradient
 
03:22:54.170 --> 03:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:57.410 --> 03:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
that's that's the underneath yeah that
 
03:22:58.550 --> 03:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
you don't really get a sense of grade
 
03:23:00.050 --> 03:23:00.060 align:start position:0%
from this either all you're getting
 
03:23:01.610 --> 03:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
there is just the very loop at the end
 
03:23:05.389 --> 03:23:05.399 align:start position:0%
how you get to that is 530 feet of 5
 
03:23:08.389 --> 03:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
degrees on one side and 430 feet back up
 
03:23:09.469 --> 03:23:09.479 align:start position:0%
on the other
 
03:23:11.090 --> 03:23:11.100 align:start position:0%
which that photo really does not show
 
03:23:11.100 --> 03:23:12.830 align:start position:0%
which that photo really does not show
you

03:23:12.830 --> 03:23:12.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:23:14.929 --> 03:23:14.939 align:start position:0%
yeah you're just seeing the loop that
 
03:23:16.309 --> 03:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
goes under the bridge
 
03:23:19.490 --> 03:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
sure but but I guess my point is if
 
03:23:21.710 --> 03:23:21.720 align:start position:0%
people didn't want to cross Folsom Road
 
03:23:25.429 --> 03:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
they could turn right take the loop go
 
03:23:27.650 --> 03:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
underneath and come back yeah they could
 
03:23:30.710 --> 03:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
but you and I both know that the natural
 
03:23:32.809 --> 03:23:32.819 align:start position:0%
tendency of people
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
when they're staring across six lanes
 
03:23:36.170 --> 03:23:36.180 align:start position:0%
and they see their destination on the
 
03:23:37.429 --> 03:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
other side is it just they hit the
 
03:23:39.110 --> 03:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
button we know we're gonna have to deal
 
03:23:40.670 --> 03:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
with that the town's already trying to
 
03:23:42.889 --> 03:23:42.899 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to
 
03:23:46.010 --> 03:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:47.929 --> 03:23:47.939 align:start position:0%
I I would personally I would rather not
 
03:23:51.889 --> 03:23:51.899 align:start position:0%
see a crosswalk there period okay but
 
03:23:53.929 --> 03:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
we're being told that it has to it has
 
03:23:56.150 --> 03:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
to be put there
 
03:23:58.070 --> 03:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
right and could I have one more thank
 
03:24:03.590 --> 03:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
you so you read something from Mr burden
 
03:24:06.769 --> 03:24:06.779 align:start position:0%
so I have an article here and he's
 
03:24:09.410 --> 03:24:09.420 align:start position:0%
quoted as saying
 
03:24:09.420 --> 03:24:11.750 align:start position:0%
quoted as saying
um

03:24:11.750 --> 03:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:13.729 --> 03:24:13.739 align:start position:0%
so where is it here
 
03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
uh Council chairman Joshua burden says
 
03:24:18.710 --> 03:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
he supports the trail systems across the
 
03:24:22.809 --> 03:24:22.819 align:start position:0%
state but his decision which is not to
 
03:24:25.389 --> 03:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
request this tunnel
 
03:24:28.490 --> 03:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
was based on the taxpayers on protecting
 
03:24:32.210 --> 03:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers wallets the best he can it
 
03:24:34.190 --> 03:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
is unfortunate unfortunate to having to
 
03:24:35.809 --> 03:24:35.819 align:start position:0%
choose between spending money and not
 
03:24:37.849 --> 03:24:37.859 align:start position:0%
spending money
 
03:24:37.859 --> 03:24:38.570 align:start position:0%
spending money
um

03:24:38.570 --> 03:24:38.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:40.790 --> 03:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
and I wanted the tunnel I thought it
 
03:24:43.010 --> 03:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
made sense we just can't
 
03:24:45.349 --> 03:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
we can't just add a tunnel with the
 
03:24:48.469 --> 03:24:48.479 align:start position:0%
delays and without the potential costs
 
03:24:51.410 --> 03:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
to our voters uh that was a no-go for me
 
03:24:52.910 --> 03:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
from day one
 
03:24:56.150 --> 03:24:56.160 align:start position:0%
so he's referring to the town of derry's
 
03:25:00.110 --> 03:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
hook on this yes so so apparently he
 
03:25:03.229 --> 03:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
wants the tunnel but not enough for
 
03:25:05.570 --> 03:25:05.580 align:start position:0%
dairy to spend its own money for it
 
03:25:08.290 --> 03:25:08.300 align:start position:0%
because the town of Jerry bend my
 
03:25:11.030 --> 03:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
constituents money he's happy for that
 
03:25:13.490 --> 03:25:13.500 align:start position:0%
because the town of dairy entered into a
 
03:25:15.530 --> 03:25:15.540 align:start position:0%
contract with the state that outlined
 
03:25:18.290 --> 03:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
what they would be required to pay and
 
03:25:20.110 --> 03:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
it when that contract was entered into
 
03:25:22.150 --> 03:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
the design
 
03:25:25.309 --> 03:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
elements included that tunnel this is a
 
03:25:29.150 --> 03:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
change post contract
 
03:25:31.370 --> 03:25:31.380 align:start position:0%
do you have documentation on that of the
 
03:25:33.110 --> 03:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
contract yeah I can send it to you sure
 
03:25:35.150 --> 03:25:35.160 align:start position:0%
okay no problem
 
03:25:38.030 --> 03:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
yep that's a five million dollar Bond
 
03:25:39.830 --> 03:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
that's the five million that Dairy and
 
03:25:41.450 --> 03:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
Londonderry were both required to pay
 
03:25:41.460 --> 03:25:44.809 align:start position:0%
Londonderry were both required to pay
yeah

03:25:44.809 --> 03:25:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:46.250 --> 03:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
it's a single document that both
 
03:25:51.110 --> 03:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:53.690 --> 03:25:53.700 align:start position:0%
for other questions
 
03:25:57.530 --> 03:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:00.830 --> 03:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
so I'm looking on the cover sheet here
 
03:26:03.170 --> 03:26:03.180 align:start position:0%
that we've been looking at into the plan
 
03:26:05.650 --> 03:26:05.660 align:start position:0%
to the right
 
03:26:07.849 --> 03:26:07.859 align:start position:0%
and I see
 
03:26:09.769 --> 03:26:09.779 align:start position:0%
uh what looks to be kind of
 
03:26:12.110 --> 03:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
spaghetti-ish that goes
 
03:26:14.809 --> 03:26:14.819 align:start position:0%
around and it says rail trail and that
 
03:26:16.969 --> 03:26:16.979 align:start position:0%
tiny little you can just barely make it
 
03:26:16.979 --> 03:26:18.830 align:start position:0%
tiny little you can just barely make it
out

03:26:18.830 --> 03:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:26:18.840 --> 03:26:20.150 align:start position:0%
out
um

03:26:20.150 --> 03:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:22.429 --> 03:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
oh boy and that really yeah it's it's on
 
03:26:25.309 --> 03:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
the upper right hand side it's under
 
03:26:28.269 --> 03:26:28.279 align:start position:0%
your Shield sure yep that's and it says
 
03:26:31.370 --> 03:26:31.380 align:start position:0%
rail trail that's the proposed that's
 
03:26:34.309 --> 03:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
really not that's not rail trail correct
 
03:26:37.429 --> 03:26:37.439 align:start position:0%
that's a proposed
 
03:26:37.439 --> 03:26:38.349 align:start position:0%
that's a proposed
um

03:26:38.349 --> 03:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:41.929 --> 03:26:41.939 align:start position:0%
how the distance of that new proposal
 
03:26:44.090 --> 03:26:44.100 align:start position:0%
versus just putting the tunnel in how
 
03:26:46.849 --> 03:26:46.859 align:start position:0%
many feet is a thousand feet two you
 
03:26:49.010 --> 03:26:49.020 align:start position:0%
know so the alternative is around just
 
03:26:52.250 --> 03:26:52.260 align:start position:0%
shy I guess of a quarter mile
 
03:26:55.309 --> 03:26:55.319 align:start position:0%
um the tunnel itself like I said is
 
03:26:57.349 --> 03:26:57.359 align:start position:0%
smaller than the finance room
 
03:27:00.950 --> 03:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's it would fit inside it so it's
 
03:27:02.570 --> 03:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
it's not uh
 
03:27:05.690 --> 03:27:05.700 align:start position:0%
not it just goes under six Lanes the
 
03:27:07.429 --> 03:27:07.439 align:start position:0%
width of six Lanes
 
03:27:10.670 --> 03:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
so further to that the town of dairy
 
03:27:12.710 --> 03:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for maintaining it
 
03:27:15.170 --> 03:27:15.180 align:start position:0%
plowing it absolutely the town like I
 
03:27:16.610 --> 03:27:16.620 align:start position:0%
said when the final dot dump truck
 
03:27:18.050 --> 03:27:18.060 align:start position:0%
drives away the town of dairy is
 
03:27:19.670 --> 03:27:19.680 align:start position:0%
responsible not only for the rail trail
 
03:27:23.750 --> 03:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
for aldermen these are town roads
 
03:27:25.849 --> 03:27:25.859 align:start position:0%
so now what about the existing rail
 
03:27:28.010 --> 03:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
trail is that maintained by the trails
 
03:27:30.889 --> 03:27:30.899 align:start position:0%
Bureau the town of dairy who made so the
 
03:27:34.130 --> 03:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
the town of dairy has a rail trail
 
03:27:34.140 --> 03:27:34.969 align:start position:0%
the town of dairy has a rail trail
um

03:27:34.969 --> 03:27:34.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:37.370 --> 03:27:37.380 align:start position:0%
committee the chair the president which
 
03:27:39.590 --> 03:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
is here today will speak to you on on
 
03:27:41.450 --> 03:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
their specifics but that's a group of
 
03:27:44.150 --> 03:27:44.160 align:start position:0%
volunteers that maintain it in you know
 
03:27:47.150 --> 03:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
weeds and garbage and and all that stuff
 
03:27:47.160 --> 03:27:48.530 align:start position:0%
weeds and garbage and and all that stuff
so

03:27:48.530 --> 03:27:48.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:27:48.540 --> 03:27:50.090 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:27:50.090 --> 03:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:52.490 --> 03:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
I've I've done work with them certainly
 
03:27:55.190 --> 03:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
over the years and
 
03:27:56.750 --> 03:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
um they're they're the ones that kind of
 
03:27:58.910 --> 03:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
just just do that they've raised they've
 
03:28:00.590 --> 03:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
raised all kinds of money for things
 
03:28:02.690 --> 03:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
03:28:05.150 --> 03:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
um to the state still owns that Corridor
 
03:28:07.190 --> 03:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
is that correct the state owns most of
 
03:28:08.570 --> 03:28:08.580 align:start position:0%
the corridor
 
03:28:11.990 --> 03:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
yes yep because they know when all these
 
03:28:13.849 --> 03:28:13.859 align:start position:0%
lines were abandoned under the law the
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
state had the first right to acquire the
 
03:28:18.830 --> 03:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
lines and then subsequently has turned
 
03:28:20.510 --> 03:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
some of them over to the trails Bureau
 
03:28:22.210 --> 03:28:22.220 align:start position:0%
but the state of New Hampshire still
 
03:28:25.070 --> 03:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
owns the underlying property the Dots
 
03:28:26.389 --> 03:28:26.399 align:start position:0%
here they could they could give you a
 
03:28:28.910 --> 03:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
better a tighter explanations to the
 
03:28:30.349 --> 03:28:30.359 align:start position:0%
ownership of
 
03:28:32.269 --> 03:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
better than I can but yeah that's the
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
generalized understanding is yes
 
03:28:36.170 --> 03:28:36.180 align:start position:0%
yeah the state the state owns them their
 
03:28:38.510 --> 03:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
state property
 
03:28:38.520 --> 03:28:39.650 align:start position:0%
state property
now

03:28:39.650 --> 03:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:28:41.530 --> 03:28:41.540 align:start position:0%
it's interesting that you mentioned that
 
03:28:44.450 --> 03:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
because New Hampshire is a state law RSA
 
03:28:47.090 --> 03:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
288 that protects railroad beds that
 
03:28:50.210 --> 03:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
were in use after 1969. it predicts the
 
03:28:53.510 --> 03:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
corridors of those for future Commerce
 
03:28:55.849 --> 03:28:55.859 align:start position:0%
in the event that we ever have to put
 
03:28:57.469 --> 03:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
freight trains back and if you've ever
 
03:28:59.090 --> 03:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
been out west oh my God they're
 
03:29:01.510 --> 03:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
everywhere right so
 
03:29:04.910 --> 03:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
this railroad bed since it was last used
 
03:29:07.490 --> 03:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
in 1984 It is Well documented there were
 
03:29:09.410 --> 03:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
newspaper photos and articles when the
 
03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
last train came through Dairy it's
 
03:29:13.429 --> 03:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
certainly not up for dispute here this
 
03:29:15.469 --> 03:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
particular railroad is a protected
 
03:29:17.870 --> 03:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
historic corridor
 
03:29:19.729 --> 03:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
and I would argue that this entire
 
03:29:23.150 --> 03:29:23.160 align:start position:0%
design violates current state law as it
 
03:29:25.910 --> 03:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
is a protected historic corridor
 
03:29:29.090 --> 03:29:29.100 align:start position:0%
in all efforts should be made to fit
 
03:29:32.570 --> 03:29:32.580 align:start position:0%
within RSA 288 and going way out of the
 
03:29:34.910 --> 03:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
way to which they're doing here does not
 
03:29:37.550 --> 03:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:41.630 --> 03:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:44.150 --> 03:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:29:46.190 --> 03:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
I still have a few just want to make
 
03:29:47.870 --> 03:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
sure everyone oh I'm representative
 
03:29:53.630 --> 03:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:55.490 --> 03:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
I don't particularly have any problem
 
03:29:58.309 --> 03:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
with with what the town of dairy would
 
03:30:00.229 --> 03:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
like to do as far as the rail trail is
 
03:30:02.210 --> 03:30:02.220 align:start position:0%
concerned I think that's entirely your
 
03:30:04.309 --> 03:30:04.319 align:start position:0%
business and and frankly I don't think
 
03:30:05.809 --> 03:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
it's any of the business of the finance
 
03:30:07.550 --> 03:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
committee however
 
03:30:09.769 --> 03:30:09.779 align:start position:0%
uh there's another there's another issue
 
03:30:12.050 --> 03:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to get into now if
 
03:30:13.550 --> 03:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
people are here to talk about the rail
 
03:30:14.809 --> 03:30:14.819 align:start position:0%
trail and that's what I want them to
 
03:30:17.389 --> 03:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
talk about but I think everybody needs
 
03:30:19.010 --> 03:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
to understand that there is also another
 
03:30:21.830 --> 03:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
issue in here that implicates uh the
 
03:30:23.510 --> 03:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
criminal law
 
03:30:28.630 --> 03:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
and this bill uh establishes a the crime
 
03:30:31.610 --> 03:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
of interfering with the construction of
 
03:30:33.950 --> 03:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
the rail trail
 
03:30:33.960 --> 03:30:34.969 align:start position:0%
the rail trail
um

03:30:34.969 --> 03:30:34.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:37.550 --> 03:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
the and it creates a particular type of
 
03:30:40.490 --> 03:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
crime class A misdemeanor that I think
 
03:30:43.429 --> 03:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
is entirely within the the jurisdiction
 
03:30:45.050 --> 03:30:45.060 align:start position:0%
of the Judiciary
 
03:30:47.030 --> 03:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
sure and I don't think that the finance
 
03:30:50.210 --> 03:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
committee has any business uh engaging
 
03:30:55.010 --> 03:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
in a dis decision to uh to to support
 
03:30:58.429 --> 03:30:58.439 align:start position:0%
and I had an idea a good idea
 
03:31:01.010 --> 03:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
um but to make it a crime to oppose it
 
03:31:03.170 --> 03:31:03.180 align:start position:0%
so representative Stapleton filed an
 
03:31:05.570 --> 03:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
amendment that removes that out in its
 
03:31:07.670 --> 03:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
entirety ah well I haven't seen that
 
03:31:09.830 --> 03:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment so it was it was requested by
 
03:31:12.469 --> 03:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
OLS to be present here for this work
 
03:31:12.479 --> 03:31:13.910 align:start position:0%
OLS to be present here for this work
session

03:31:13.910 --> 03:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:31:18.469 --> 03:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:20.630 --> 03:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
I believe representative
 
03:31:23.750 --> 03:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
um Stapleton did send a copy to all of
 
03:31:26.030 --> 03:31:26.040 align:start position:0%
us but it's technically not to us until
 
03:31:30.410 --> 03:31:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:34.010 --> 03:31:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:37.670 --> 03:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
and that's fine that's fine
 
03:31:38.990 --> 03:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure that
 
03:31:40.670 --> 03:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
everybody understood that wasn't that
 
03:31:42.229 --> 03:31:42.239 align:start position:0%
was an issue and has nothing to do with
 
03:31:44.570 --> 03:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
what they're talking about
 
03:31:44.580 --> 03:31:53.269 align:start position:0%
what they're talking about
foreign

03:31:53.269 --> 03:31:53.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:55.150 --> 03:31:55.160 align:start position:0%
thanks Michael
 
03:31:56.990 --> 03:31:57.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing that up
 
03:31:58.910 --> 03:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
representative I
 
03:32:01.849 --> 03:32:01.859 align:start position:0%
I presume that I should know by prison
 
03:32:05.870 --> 03:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:22.250 --> 03:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:22.260 --> 03:32:27.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:32:27.010 --> 03:32:27.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:29.330 --> 03:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
Pearson while they're looking at that I
 
03:32:31.190 --> 03:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
have a few more questions as I continue
 
03:32:31.200 --> 03:32:32.090 align:start position:0%
have a few more questions as I continue
to

03:32:32.090 --> 03:32:32.100 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:32:39.889 --> 03:32:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:42.110 --> 03:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
so you said the hashed out areas where
 
03:32:43.429 --> 03:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
buildings that
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
have been
 
03:32:50.450 --> 03:32:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:53.450 --> 03:32:53.460 align:start position:0%
and who came up with the design to put
 
03:32:54.889 --> 03:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:32:58.070 --> 03:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
Trail is proposed on the far right side
 
03:33:00.889 --> 03:33:00.899 align:start position:0%
the alternative rail trail was that so
 
03:33:03.349 --> 03:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
interestingly enough
 
03:33:05.450 --> 03:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
a bitter
 
03:33:08.269 --> 03:33:08.279 align:start position:0%
a competitive bidder during the original
 
03:33:10.729 --> 03:33:10.739 align:start position:0%
bid build process I believe they call it
 
03:33:13.309 --> 03:33:13.319 align:start position:0%
that has been abandoned by the DOT
 
03:33:14.990 --> 03:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
in an attempt
 
03:33:17.150 --> 03:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
to get an unfair advantage on the other
 
03:33:20.750 --> 03:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
bidders came up with another design they
 
03:33:23.330 --> 03:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
invented this thing
 
03:33:24.950 --> 03:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
so the other two groups that were
 
03:33:26.750 --> 03:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
bidding on this
 
03:33:28.910 --> 03:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
it wasn't an apples to Apple's bid
 
03:33:32.870 --> 03:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
they've submitted an alternative plan
 
03:33:36.650 --> 03:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
and how that plan came about
 
03:33:38.450 --> 03:33:38.460 align:start position:0%
the president of the rail trail can tell
 
03:33:41.150 --> 03:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
you I think frankly
 
03:33:41.160 --> 03:33:42.889 align:start position:0%
you I think frankly
to

03:33:42.889 --> 03:33:42.899 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:33:45.769 --> 03:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
load a theory and then issue a gag order
 
03:33:48.469 --> 03:33:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:50.330 --> 03:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
and then use it as part of a bidding
 
03:33:52.370 --> 03:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
process is unethical
 
03:33:58.309 --> 03:33:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:01.910 --> 03:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
and it and as a as a member which I did
 
03:34:03.769 --> 03:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
not disclose as a member of the board of
 
03:34:06.590 --> 03:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
directors of dairy's rail trail
 
03:34:09.110 --> 03:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
I wasn't I never saw this I never
 
03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
approved this I never agreed to this
 
03:34:14.030 --> 03:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
because a
 
03:34:18.229 --> 03:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
an engineering firm issued a gag order
 
03:34:24.830 --> 03:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:28.190 --> 03:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
well you've certainly raised a lot of
 
03:34:30.290 --> 03:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
sensitive issues I guess so put it
 
03:34:30.300 --> 03:34:31.849 align:start position:0%
sensitive issues I guess so put it
mildly

03:34:31.849 --> 03:34:31.859 align:start position:0%
mildly
 
03:34:34.370 --> 03:34:34.380 align:start position:0%
so I unless anyone has any further
 
03:34:36.110 --> 03:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
questions I'd oh I'm sorry
 
03:34:37.429 --> 03:34:37.439 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
03:34:40.330 --> 03:34:40.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair one more question
 
03:34:43.969 --> 03:34:43.979 align:start position:0%
uh party of justification is that we
 
03:34:46.610 --> 03:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
need to keep that right away open in
 
03:34:48.710 --> 03:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
case we ever decide to put a railroad
 
03:34:50.510 --> 03:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
there again
 
03:34:53.450 --> 03:34:53.460 align:start position:0%
how high is the Box tunnel and would the
 
03:34:55.610 --> 03:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
Box tunnel handle a freight car or
 
03:34:58.250 --> 03:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
locomotive going through it so the Box
 
03:35:01.510 --> 03:35:01.520 align:start position:0%
tunnels original design was at 12 feet
 
03:35:04.670 --> 03:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
the the compromise if you will to lower
 
03:35:06.650 --> 03:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
the pitch of the Madden Road over the
 
03:35:09.889 --> 03:35:09.899 align:start position:0%
top of it is at 11 feet if the railroad
 
03:35:11.630 --> 03:35:11.640 align:start position:0%
decides to go through there will be
 
03:35:14.210 --> 03:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
substantial modifications to this
 
03:35:16.210 --> 03:35:16.220 align:start position:0%
railroad bed anyway
 
03:35:19.910 --> 03:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
in which time they the railroad can
 
03:35:22.729 --> 03:35:22.739 align:start position:0%
lower the grade the bottom of this thing
 
03:35:24.170 --> 03:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have to they wouldn't have
 
03:35:26.090 --> 03:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
to take it out they could just lower the
 
03:35:26.100 --> 03:35:27.710 align:start position:0%
to take it out they could just lower the
floor

03:35:27.710 --> 03:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
floor
 
03:35:30.710 --> 03:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
um the subsequent tunnels north of there
 
03:35:33.530 --> 03:35:33.540 align:start position:0%
in Londonderry were all constructed to
 
03:35:36.229 --> 03:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
Railroad standard
 
03:35:38.690 --> 03:35:38.700 align:start position:0%
so Londonderry has tunnels on this on
 
03:35:42.410 --> 03:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
this railroad bed two railroad standard
 
03:35:45.229 --> 03:35:45.239 align:start position:0%
but some in Windham has railroad
 
03:35:46.790 --> 03:35:46.800 align:start position:0%
standard tunnels
 
03:35:49.190 --> 03:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
under a road that does not necessarily
 
03:35:50.929 --> 03:35:50.939 align:start position:0%
connect to this rail trail but to a
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
different one
 
03:35:54.650 --> 03:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
but somehow that's okay for every other
 
03:35:59.630 --> 03:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:02.269 --> 03:36:02.279 align:start position:0%
into it to and I feel as though
 
03:36:03.650 --> 03:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire didn't totally
 
03:36:05.090 --> 03:36:05.100 align:start position:0%
answer one of your questions and I'll
 
03:36:06.530 --> 03:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
and I'll do it this way in the sense
 
03:36:08.990 --> 03:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
that this is a Federal Highway project
 
03:36:11.269 --> 03:36:11.279 align:start position:0%
so as far as your constituents there's a
 
03:36:12.830 --> 03:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
lot of constituents I suppose that pay
 
03:36:14.510 --> 03:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
for a Federal Highway project because
 
03:36:16.969 --> 03:36:16.979 align:start position:0%
it's it comes out of the federal there's
 
03:36:18.349 --> 03:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
federal dollars involved and there's
 
03:36:20.510 --> 03:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
State dollars involved as well so this
 
03:36:22.370 --> 03:36:22.380 align:start position:0%
is not something that's unique in
 
03:36:24.530 --> 03:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
Standalone in the sense of the town of
 
03:36:25.790 --> 03:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
dairy asking for this this is
 
03:36:27.889 --> 03:36:27.899 align:start position:0%
encompassing a Federal Highway 125
 
03:36:30.530 --> 03:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
million dollar Federal Highway project
 
03:36:33.710 --> 03:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
so it's you know when when you're going
 
03:36:35.150 --> 03:36:35.160 align:start position:0%
to cut a swath through the middle of my
 
03:36:35.160 --> 03:36:36.349 align:start position:0%
to cut a swath through the middle of my
town

03:36:36.349 --> 03:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
town
 
03:36:40.070 --> 03:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
I expect that it's done in a way that
 
03:36:40.080 --> 03:36:41.150 align:start position:0%
I expect that it's done in a way that
doesn't

03:36:41.150 --> 03:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
03:36:44.330 --> 03:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
hurt my constituents is part of the way
 
03:36:47.450 --> 03:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
they designed this project so
 
03:36:49.370 --> 03:36:49.380 align:start position:0%
depending on how you want to look at the
 
03:36:51.889 --> 03:36:51.899 align:start position:0%
dollars it's that's where this
 
03:36:54.170 --> 03:36:54.180 align:start position:0%
that's how this thing is framed here as
 
03:36:59.090 --> 03:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:59.100 --> 03:37:00.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:37:00.849 --> 03:37:00.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:05.389 --> 03:37:05.399 align:start position:0%
so you're making it sound as though
 
03:37:08.090 --> 03:37:08.100 align:start position:0%
the federal government is imposing this
 
03:37:10.670 --> 03:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
project on your town but your town paid
 
03:37:12.469 --> 03:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
five million dollars as did the
 
03:37:15.290 --> 03:37:15.300 align:start position:0%
neighboring town because they want this
 
03:37:15.300 --> 03:37:16.670 align:start position:0%
neighboring town because they want this
project

03:37:16.670 --> 03:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
project
 
03:37:19.190 --> 03:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
correct they were and again they were
 
03:37:21.769 --> 03:37:21.779 align:start position:0%
after they signed that contract changes
 
03:37:23.030 --> 03:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
have been made
 
03:37:23.040 --> 03:37:24.530 align:start position:0%
have been made
so

03:37:24.530 --> 03:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:37:28.070 --> 03:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
as right
 
03:37:29.990 --> 03:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's not shocking or new or
 
03:37:31.190 --> 03:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
anything I mean it's you know Federal
 
03:37:33.050 --> 03:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
Highway projects all kinds of projects
 
03:37:36.590 --> 03:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:39.110 --> 03:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's not the same
 
03:37:41.510 --> 03:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's interesting uh following up on
 
03:37:43.190 --> 03:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin's question
 
03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
because the widening of 93 to the north
 
03:37:49.370 --> 03:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
through Londonderry they built a highway
 
03:37:54.349 --> 03:37:54.359 align:start position:0%
bridge over the rail trail a significant
 
03:37:57.889 --> 03:37:57.899 align:start position:0%
Crossing with a bridge
 
03:38:00.950 --> 03:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
so anyway well we'll get you off the
 
03:38:02.210 --> 03:38:02.220 align:start position:0%
hook for a little while and maybe
 
03:38:04.550 --> 03:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
someone else would like to come oh I'm
 
03:38:07.910 --> 03:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
sorry representative Ebel has a question
 
03:38:09.530 --> 03:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
not a problem
 
03:38:11.750 --> 03:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
um well I have the article also when
 
03:38:14.330 --> 03:38:14.340 align:start position:0%
they talked about the decision by the
 
03:38:18.349 --> 03:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
council I guess not to recommend I'm
 
03:38:20.389 --> 03:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
looking at and so they were concerned
 
03:38:23.570 --> 03:38:23.580 align:start position:0%
about the expenses but I'm referring
 
03:38:25.309 --> 03:38:25.319 align:start position:0%
back to the quote that representative
 
03:38:28.429 --> 03:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
McGuire read and if you continue through
 
03:38:31.370 --> 03:38:31.380 align:start position:0%
not only were they the council members
 
03:38:33.170 --> 03:38:33.180 align:start position:0%
concerned about the expenses they were
 
03:38:36.410 --> 03:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
also concerned about the delay aspect so
 
03:38:38.570 --> 03:38:38.580 align:start position:0%
I wondered if you could comment on that
 
03:38:40.490 --> 03:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
because obviously to make this change
 
03:38:42.889 --> 03:38:42.899 align:start position:0%
would also cause a delay so the delay
 
03:38:45.050 --> 03:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
the the parameters of that delay are up
 
03:38:46.910 --> 03:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
for significant debate here the
 
03:38:48.590 --> 03:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation has been
 
03:38:52.010 --> 03:38:52.020 align:start position:0%
well aware of the objections of
 
03:38:53.870 --> 03:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
stakeholder groups for this going almost
 
03:38:57.349 --> 03:38:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:01.490 --> 03:39:01.500 align:start position:0%
the VHB whose symbol is on the bottom of
 
03:39:04.969 --> 03:39:04.979 align:start position:0%
this page provided a design for that
 
03:39:07.849 --> 03:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
tunnel several years ago
 
03:39:09.710 --> 03:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
so what I was told by the project
 
03:39:11.690 --> 03:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
manager was it's about slope and
 
03:39:13.490 --> 03:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
drainage issues
 
03:39:15.469 --> 03:39:15.479 align:start position:0%
this doesn't go out to bid until October
 
03:39:17.150 --> 03:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
at the earliest
 
03:39:19.849 --> 03:39:19.859 align:start position:0%
we have engineers at the D.O.T
 
03:39:21.729 --> 03:39:21.739 align:start position:0%
that can do what needs to be done here
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
this this shouldn't take till October to
 
03:39:24.960 --> 03:39:26.210 align:start position:0%
this this shouldn't take till October to
do

03:39:26.210 --> 03:39:26.220 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:39:29.090 --> 03:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
for to design slope and drain issues
 
03:39:32.030 --> 03:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
around a an element that was in the
 
03:39:35.210 --> 03:39:35.220 align:start position:0%
original design to start with so I I I
 
03:39:37.490 --> 03:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
question that I questioned the the
 
03:39:39.950 --> 03:39:39.960 align:start position:0%
length to which they claim a delay would
 
03:39:41.450 --> 03:39:41.460 align:start position:0%
occur here
 
03:39:44.510 --> 03:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
for when they still have a hundred
 
03:39:46.849 --> 03:39:46.859 align:start position:0%
properties to acquire
 
03:39:49.010 --> 03:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
that still have not been acquired to do
 
03:39:51.950 --> 03:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
this this phase of the project
 
03:39:54.170 --> 03:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
when the dot itself has delayed this
 
03:39:58.429 --> 03:39:58.439 align:start position:0%
project dozens of times since 1982.
 
03:40:01.190 --> 03:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
and they've been aware of the objections
 
03:40:03.469 --> 03:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
to this for two years who's really where
 
03:40:04.790 --> 03:40:04.800 align:start position:0%
are the delays really coming from here
 
03:40:10.670 --> 03:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:12.349 --> 03:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
further question
 
03:40:15.050 --> 03:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
I just want to be clear uh you're
 
03:40:17.269 --> 03:40:17.279 align:start position:0%
basically asserting that the design
 
03:40:20.510 --> 03:40:20.520 align:start position:0%
that's being proposed by dot at this
 
03:40:23.510 --> 03:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
point is not safe as a safety
 
03:40:25.309 --> 03:40:25.319 align:start position:0%
professional for 27 years and someone
 
03:40:26.809 --> 03:40:26.819 align:start position:0%
with an engineering degree in the
 
03:40:28.849 --> 03:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
practice I will tell you there are two
 
03:40:30.650 --> 03:40:30.660 align:start position:0%
elements that are definitely not safe
 
03:40:31.910 --> 03:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
about this
 
03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
and that predominantly has to do with
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
the way that the rail trail
 
03:40:40.130 --> 03:40:40.140 align:start position:0%
has line of sight coming down from the
 
03:40:42.590 --> 03:40:42.600 align:start position:0%
Londonderry end under that bridge and as
 
03:40:44.150 --> 03:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
someone who predominantly rides a
 
03:40:46.429 --> 03:40:46.439 align:start position:0%
bicycle on those with a five degree
 
03:40:49.969 --> 03:40:49.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:53.090 --> 03:40:53.100 align:start position:0%
we're going to have collisions
 
03:40:54.889 --> 03:40:54.899 align:start position:0%
at that point where that where that
 
03:40:56.990 --> 03:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
makes the turn under the bridge it's you
 
03:40:58.370 --> 03:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
just can't see you don't know who's
 
03:40:59.570 --> 03:40:59.580 align:start position:0%
under the bridge when you're coming down
 
03:40:59.580 --> 03:41:00.469 align:start position:0%
under the bridge when you're coming down
that

03:41:00.469 --> 03:41:00.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:41:04.309 --> 03:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
down that hill and
 
03:41:06.170 --> 03:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
that that's not a matter of if it's
 
03:41:09.050 --> 03:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
going to happen so I I don't want to see
 
03:41:10.309 --> 03:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
that ever happen I don't want to see
 
03:41:12.650 --> 03:41:12.660 align:start position:0%
anybody ever get wiped out here and the
 
03:41:14.750 --> 03:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
design of this by itself lends to that
 
03:41:17.450 --> 03:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
not only does it is that my opinion but
 
03:41:19.490 --> 03:41:19.500 align:start position:0%
we have through a 91a request internal
 
03:41:21.830 --> 03:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
documents that I would hope one of the
 
03:41:23.750 --> 03:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
people behind me has from internally
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
within the dot they have questioned the
 
03:41:28.550 --> 03:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:31.729 --> 03:41:31.739 align:start position:0%
so safety is a huge Factor safety is
 
03:41:33.469 --> 03:41:33.479 align:start position:0%
also a huge factor in federal approval
 
03:41:37.490 --> 03:41:37.500 align:start position:0%
which this doesn't have so
 
03:41:41.330 --> 03:41:41.340 align:start position:0%
you know I this really needs I'm hoping
 
03:41:43.130 --> 03:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
the federal the federal folks that are
 
03:41:44.630 --> 03:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for approving this take a
 
03:41:46.190 --> 03:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
real hard look at the safety aspect of
 
03:41:48.830 --> 03:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
this because I have real concerns on the
 
03:41:53.210 --> 03:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:55.910 --> 03:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you Mr chair
 
03:41:59.090 --> 03:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
representative of your town for sure
 
03:41:59.100 --> 03:41:59.870 align:start position:0%
representative of your town for sure
um

03:41:59.870 --> 03:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:03.170 --> 03:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
now sir I I assume that you would like
 
03:42:05.030 --> 03:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
to speak
 
03:42:07.550 --> 03:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
and if you could state your name and
 
03:42:09.290 --> 03:42:09.300 align:start position:0%
spell your last name if it's difficult
 
03:42:09.300 --> 03:42:10.969 align:start position:0%
spell your last name if it's difficult
please

03:42:10.969 --> 03:42:10.979 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:42:13.070 --> 03:42:13.080 align:start position:0%
it's Connors it's an Irish name I think
 
03:42:14.630 --> 03:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
as long as you get the O in the end
 
03:42:16.250 --> 03:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
instead of the E you're good
 
03:42:17.450 --> 03:42:17.460 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to pass around some
 
03:42:20.210 --> 03:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
handouts as well unfortunately my color
 
03:42:21.889 --> 03:42:21.899 align:start position:0%
printer ran out of ink because I did
 
03:42:23.510 --> 03:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
these at home last night so some of you
 
03:42:24.650 --> 03:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
are getting colors I mean you're getting
 
03:42:26.510 --> 03:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
black and white and you can look at each
 
03:42:28.309 --> 03:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
other as if we get to a color point so
 
03:42:28.319 --> 03:42:31.370 align:start position:0%
other as if we get to a color point so
uh

03:42:31.370 --> 03:42:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
I don't have the resources of the dot to
 
03:42:35.990 --> 03:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
do the Big Color Prints and all that I
 
03:42:37.429 --> 03:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
was prepared to show you guys a
 
03:42:38.750 --> 03:42:38.760 align:start position:0%
PowerPoint though because I work in
 
03:42:40.370 --> 03:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
sales and I thought you might have some
 
03:42:41.990 --> 03:42:42.000 align:start position:0%
projection equipment so this is done on
 
03:42:43.849 --> 03:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
a PowerPoint I apologize also for the
 
03:42:45.410 --> 03:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
size thought we might be looking at this
 
03:42:47.690 --> 03:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
on a projector
 
03:42:50.450 --> 03:42:50.460 align:start position:0%
um so uh first of all uh thank you uh
 
03:42:52.250 --> 03:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
chairman and members of this committee
 
03:42:54.469 --> 03:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
for uh having us and allowing us to
 
03:42:57.050 --> 03:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
testify especially given the uh the the
 
03:42:59.210 --> 03:42:59.220 align:start position:0%
uh that we uh some of us missed last
 
03:43:01.010 --> 03:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
week we thought this was the reschedule
 
03:43:02.630 --> 03:43:02.640 align:start position:0%
not not a committee meeting so it would
 
03:43:03.889 --> 03:43:03.899 align:start position:0%
have been nice to speak to the larger
 
03:43:05.450 --> 03:43:05.460 align:start position:0%
group as well
 
03:43:07.309 --> 03:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
um my name is Mark Connors I am the
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
President of the Derry rail trail
 
03:43:11.870 --> 03:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
Alliance I'm also a member of the
 
03:43:14.809 --> 03:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
Granite State uh rail trail those are
 
03:43:17.570 --> 03:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
two volunteer positions uh that take a
 
03:43:19.790 --> 03:43:19.800 align:start position:0%
lot of my time in addition to my job in
 
03:43:22.070 --> 03:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
selling software to large universities
 
03:43:25.729 --> 03:43:25.739 align:start position:0%
non-profits and hospitals I've been a
 
03:43:27.229 --> 03:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
member of the board of the dairy realtor
 
03:43:30.729 --> 03:43:30.739 align:start position:0%
Alliance since 2007 I moved to Derry in
 
03:43:33.349 --> 03:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
2004. uh the reason I got involved in
 
03:43:36.110 --> 03:43:36.120 align:start position:0%
this at all was I had small children at
 
03:43:38.450 --> 03:43:38.460 align:start position:0%
that time and took them for a ride on
 
03:43:39.889 --> 03:43:39.899 align:start position:0%
the Windham rail trail and you'll hear
 
03:43:41.450 --> 03:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
from the president of the Windham rail
 
03:43:43.370 --> 03:43:43.380 align:start position:0%
trail in a little bit they had a
 
03:43:45.670 --> 03:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
beautifully new paved rail trail
 
03:43:48.769 --> 03:43:48.779 align:start position:0%
including a wonderful bridge over the
 
03:43:50.929 --> 03:43:50.939 align:start position:0%
new Route 111 that had been blasted
 
03:43:52.849 --> 03:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
through at that time which you'll see
 
03:43:57.590 --> 03:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
some photos of that in my deck so the
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
whole idea of a rail trail coming into
 
03:44:02.269 --> 03:44:02.279 align:start position:0%
dairy uh jumped up there was a gentleman
 
03:44:04.429 --> 03:44:04.439 align:start position:0%
named Eric Whitney who started the dairy
 
03:44:05.990 --> 03:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
rail trail Alliance I joined with him
 
03:44:07.610 --> 03:44:07.620 align:start position:0%
and we quickly formed a non-profit
 
03:44:09.229 --> 03:44:09.239 align:start position:0%
organization and said we have to do what
 
03:44:11.090 --> 03:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
Windham has done and extend this up to
 
03:44:14.030 --> 03:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
Derry and through Derry on to
 
03:44:14.040 --> 03:44:15.830 align:start position:0%
Derry and through Derry on to
Londonderry

03:44:15.830 --> 03:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
Londonderry
 
03:44:17.630 --> 03:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
so that's how I got involved in this and
 
03:44:19.190 --> 03:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
I've been there ever since now the first
 
03:44:20.870 --> 03:44:20.880 align:start position:0%
trip I ever took on the rail trail my
 
03:44:22.790 --> 03:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
kids were on single speed bikes they
 
03:44:25.849 --> 03:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
were five six they are now graduated and
 
03:44:28.070 --> 03:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
out of college and I'm still trying to
 
03:44:30.670 --> 03:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
get this rail trail done in Derry
 
03:44:33.349 --> 03:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
we had the first sections going from
 
03:44:35.269 --> 03:44:35.279 align:start position:0%
downtown Dairy all the way down to
 
03:44:37.370 --> 03:44:37.380 align:start position:0%
Windham Dunn in a matter of a couple of
 
03:44:39.170 --> 03:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
years because we were able to raise the
 
03:44:41.090 --> 03:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
money work with the town of Derry we had
 
03:44:43.849 --> 03:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
a great partnership the the citizens
 
03:44:47.030 --> 03:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
stood up and we got those those uh that
 
03:44:49.969 --> 03:44:49.979 align:start position:0%
version done since then we have been at
 
03:44:52.370 --> 03:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
loggerheads and getting to Londonderry
 
03:44:54.889 --> 03:44:54.899 align:start position:0%
because of the exit 4A project in the
 
03:44:58.250 --> 03:44:58.260 align:start position:0%
continuous delays so we have been
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
patient we have been working with the
 
03:45:03.070 --> 03:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
DIA with the dot with our town DPW
 
03:45:05.510 --> 03:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
trying to get everything aligned for the
 
03:45:07.190 --> 03:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
rail trail to go north and connect to
 
03:45:09.229 --> 03:45:09.239 align:start position:0%
Londonderry Londonderry also has four
 
03:45:11.750 --> 03:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
miles of paved trail now leading to the
 
03:45:13.969 --> 03:45:13.979 align:start position:0%
airport and it is now connecting into
 
03:45:16.490 --> 03:45:16.500 align:start position:0%
Manchester and very soon the entire
 
03:45:18.170 --> 03:45:18.180 align:start position:0%
Granite State rail trail hopefully in
 
03:45:20.210 --> 03:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
the next few years will span from the
 
03:45:22.790 --> 03:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Border in Salem all the
 
03:45:24.889 --> 03:45:24.899 align:start position:0%
way to Lebanon in the Vermont border
 
03:45:26.929 --> 03:45:26.939 align:start position:0%
there are over 50 miles of the rail
 
03:45:28.670 --> 03:45:28.680 align:start position:0%
trail already complete from Lebanon
 
03:45:31.490 --> 03:45:31.500 align:start position:0%
South to just north of Concord the state
 
03:45:33.590 --> 03:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
you guys have just appropriated some new
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
purchases and things within Concord to
 
03:45:37.370 --> 03:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
get your rail trail here in Concord and
 
03:45:39.070 --> 03:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
that is going to connect
 
03:45:41.929 --> 03:45:41.939 align:start position:0%
so anyway iob signed up for the rail
 
03:45:43.429 --> 03:45:43.439 align:start position:0%
trail is just a volunteer thinking yeah
 
03:45:45.130 --> 03:45:45.140 align:start position:0%
we'll get this thing done
 
03:45:48.170 --> 03:45:48.180 align:start position:0%
when exit 4A started to become an issue
 
03:45:49.550 --> 03:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
with how we were going to get the rail
 
03:45:50.990 --> 03:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
trail through there when we realized the
 
03:45:52.670 --> 03:45:52.680 align:start position:0%
exit 4A Connector Road was going to
 
03:45:54.590 --> 03:45:54.600 align:start position:0%
bisect the rail trail and basically cut
 
03:45:57.170 --> 03:45:57.180 align:start position:0%
it off we started to get a little bit
 
03:45:58.670 --> 03:45:58.680 align:start position:0%
involved in politics and working with
 
03:46:01.910 --> 03:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
the dhdot I signed up as a Consulting
 
03:46:04.370 --> 03:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
partner on the exit 4A project in order
 
03:46:06.229 --> 03:46:06.239 align:start position:0%
to be informed of everything that the
 
03:46:08.269 --> 03:46:08.279 align:start position:0%
dot designed by their own rules I'm
 
03:46:09.830 --> 03:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
supposed to get all their documents I'm
 
03:46:11.690 --> 03:46:11.700 align:start position:0%
supposed to get all their information in
 
03:46:12.950 --> 03:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
order to make sure that we were
 
03:46:12.960 --> 03:46:14.450 align:start position:0%
order to make sure that we were
represented

03:46:14.450 --> 03:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
represented
 
03:46:16.790 --> 03:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
that's been a little bit touch and go
 
03:46:19.190 --> 03:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
um as to how that actually has taken so
 
03:46:20.990 --> 03:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
anyway this has been a long and winding
 
03:46:24.170 --> 03:46:24.180 align:start position:0%
road to this point and it's looks like
 
03:46:25.969 --> 03:46:25.979 align:start position:0%
you know the map in front of you at this
 
03:46:27.530 --> 03:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
point with as many curves as the new
 
03:46:29.450 --> 03:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
drta plan
 
03:46:31.790 --> 03:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
simply stated if you you put that map
 
03:46:33.410 --> 03:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
you take all the stuff off of the maps
 
03:46:34.910 --> 03:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
that they're in front of you and you put
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
this in front of a third grader and say
 
03:46:38.269 --> 03:46:38.279 align:start position:0%
you got to go from point A to point B
 
03:46:40.370 --> 03:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
which way are you going to go
 
03:46:42.229 --> 03:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
100 percent of the people are going to
 
03:46:45.530 --> 03:46:45.540 align:start position:0%
go across the rail trail straight a rail
 
03:46:47.690 --> 03:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
trail by Design if you look up a you
 
03:46:49.250 --> 03:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
know a rail trail is supposed to follow
 
03:46:51.889 --> 03:46:51.899 align:start position:0%
an old rail Corridor it's supposed to be
 
03:46:54.650 --> 03:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
flat there's this is not a rail trail
 
03:46:57.410 --> 03:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
one anymore once D.O.T puts this in this
 
03:46:59.809 --> 03:46:59.819 align:start position:0%
is no longer a rail trail by Design and
 
03:47:01.370 --> 03:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
they've even referred to it as a nice
 
03:47:03.830 --> 03:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
local recreational path and so on and so
 
03:47:06.889 --> 03:47:06.899 align:start position:0%
forth no this is part of the alternative
 
03:47:09.650 --> 03:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
transportation Corridor which has
 
03:47:12.290 --> 03:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
actually been required of the dot since
 
03:47:14.690 --> 03:47:14.700 align:start position:0%
the beginning of I-93 in the first
 
03:47:16.849 --> 03:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
several pages that I've included in the
 
03:47:18.710 --> 03:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
document come from the Rizzo study from
 
03:47:21.530 --> 03:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
back in 2003 and again I apologize for
 
03:47:24.050 --> 03:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
the smaller type that you see there but
 
03:47:25.610 --> 03:47:25.620 align:start position:0%
these documents are still available out
 
03:47:27.590 --> 03:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
on dot Zone page and I encourage you to
 
03:47:29.269 --> 03:47:29.279 align:start position:0%
go out and actually read the documents
 
03:47:31.849 --> 03:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
there so in order to get the approval
 
03:47:35.210 --> 03:47:35.220 align:start position:0%
for I-93 widening the dot had to include
 
03:47:37.670 --> 03:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
an alternative transportation plan and
 
03:47:39.290 --> 03:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
Corridor and so they spent a lot of
 
03:47:41.269 --> 03:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
money on this study which which is you
 
03:47:43.370 --> 03:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
know very detailed and they hired groups
 
03:47:45.290 --> 03:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth and their own
 
03:47:46.790 --> 03:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
plan calls for this alternative
 
03:47:48.110 --> 03:47:48.120 align:start position:0%
transportation Corridor if you read
 
03:47:50.330 --> 03:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
through the documents it identifies the
 
03:47:52.370 --> 03:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
m l Branch the Manchester to Lawrence
 
03:47:53.990 --> 03:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
branch of the rail trail as the most
 
03:47:56.809 --> 03:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
inexpensive the right alternative they
 
03:47:58.010 --> 03:47:58.020 align:start position:0%
were also thinking of running a rail
 
03:47:59.690 --> 03:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
trail up the middle of 93 or something
 
03:48:02.510 --> 03:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
as well so they actually designed and
 
03:48:04.250 --> 03:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
came up with the idea of this rail trail
 
03:48:06.229 --> 03:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
the problem was they never funded it
 
03:48:08.210 --> 03:48:08.220 align:start position:0%
unfortunately dot in New Hampshire is
 
03:48:09.469 --> 03:48:09.479 align:start position:0%
really focused on automobile
 
03:48:11.389 --> 03:48:11.399 align:start position:0%
Transportation versus alternative
 
03:48:13.309 --> 03:48:13.319 align:start position:0%
transportation that really is at the
 
03:48:14.750 --> 03:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
root of some of this problem we need
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
transportation of all types so if you
 
03:48:19.910 --> 03:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
read the own report that went back to
 
03:48:22.070 --> 03:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
2003 that the dot spent a lot of money
 
03:48:23.990 --> 03:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
on UNH and everybody else was involved
 
03:48:25.729 --> 03:48:25.739 align:start position:0%
and have highlighted a few names on the
 
03:48:27.650 --> 03:48:27.660 align:start position:0%
people who are involved in that you'll
 
03:48:29.809 --> 03:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
notice one of the names is William Cass
 
03:48:31.729 --> 03:48:31.739 align:start position:0%
our current commissioner of the D.O.T
 
03:48:34.250 --> 03:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
was on this original study plan as was
 
03:48:35.990 --> 03:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
Mr Mark samsel who's sitting in the back
 
03:48:37.130 --> 03:48:37.140 align:start position:0%
of the room who'll talk to you from
 
03:48:38.929 --> 03:48:38.939 align:start position:0%
Windham rail trail in a little while and
 
03:48:40.729 --> 03:48:40.739 align:start position:0%
several other folks were involved from
 
03:48:42.950 --> 03:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
the community related to bicycling and
 
03:48:44.389 --> 03:48:44.399 align:start position:0%
alternative transportation and rail
 
03:48:46.550 --> 03:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
trails and they came up with this whole
 
03:48:48.590 --> 03:48:48.600 align:start position:0%
plan and one of the things that call
 
03:48:50.389 --> 03:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
that I call out on this page is that the
 
03:48:51.889 --> 03:48:51.899 align:start position:0%
reason they called it out is because it
 
03:48:53.870 --> 03:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
has a flat less than two percent grade
 
03:48:55.910 --> 03:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
if you read some of the other details
 
03:48:58.550 --> 03:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
that is accessible to all people
 
03:49:00.469 --> 03:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
including disability disabled people
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
people in wheelchairs Walkers elderly
 
03:49:04.610 --> 03:49:04.620 align:start position:0%
which is a huge part of the people that
 
03:49:05.990 --> 03:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
you will see on our Dairy rail trail
 
03:49:08.690 --> 03:49:08.700 align:start position:0%
every day people rehabilitating injuries
 
03:49:11.690 --> 03:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
heart attacks Walkers it it's a
 
03:49:13.670 --> 03:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
wonderful mix of people parents with
 
03:49:15.469 --> 03:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
strollers so on and so forth and that's
 
03:49:17.030 --> 03:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
the idea behind a rail trail is to
 
03:49:19.070 --> 03:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
create Community it also is the lowest
 
03:49:20.929 --> 03:49:20.939 align:start position:0%
cost alternative that was come up by the
 
03:49:23.809 --> 03:49:23.819 align:start position:0%
dot now again this was 2003 the entire
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
4A project at that point was supposed to
 
03:49:27.889 --> 03:49:27.899 align:start position:0%
cost 50 million dollars as I hope you
 
03:49:30.050 --> 03:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
all know we're over 130 million dollars
 
03:49:32.269 --> 03:49:32.279 align:start position:0%
now to get that same project done
 
03:49:34.370 --> 03:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
because of the delays
 
03:49:36.950 --> 03:49:36.960 align:start position:0%
so just looking at that it was ranked
 
03:49:38.990 --> 03:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
highest because of accessibility natural
 
03:49:40.969 --> 03:49:40.979 align:start position:0%
resources compatibility with the
 
03:49:42.889 --> 03:49:42.899 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods connectivity to the cities
 
03:49:46.910 --> 03:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
and links to our commuter centers so you
 
03:49:48.530 --> 03:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
all know about the exit 5 Transportation
 
03:49:50.750 --> 03:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
Center the dot and the state has spent a
 
03:49:52.429 --> 03:49:52.439 align:start position:0%
huge amount of money on one at exit two
 
03:49:53.929 --> 03:49:53.939 align:start position:0%
one at exit three
 
03:49:55.670 --> 03:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
well let me tell you something a few
 
03:49:57.290 --> 03:49:57.300 align:start position:0%
years ago to prove that alternative
 
03:50:01.070 --> 03:50:01.080 align:start position:0%
transportation is real I rode my bike
 
03:50:02.450 --> 03:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
to work
 
03:50:04.790 --> 03:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
I live in Derry New Hampshire I worked
 
03:50:07.309 --> 03:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
in Peabody Massachusetts at the time I
 
03:50:08.870 --> 03:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
rode my bike on the rail trail up to
 
03:50:10.550 --> 03:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
londonderry's Transportation Center I
 
03:50:12.229 --> 03:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
got on the bus with my bike I went down
 
03:50:14.330 --> 03:50:14.340 align:start position:0%
to sell station got off my bike got off
 
03:50:16.610 --> 03:50:16.620 align:start position:0%
the you know bus at South Station rode
 
03:50:18.170 --> 03:50:18.180 align:start position:0%
my bike across Boston to North Station
 
03:50:20.150 --> 03:50:20.160 align:start position:0%
got on a train to Lynn get off the train
 
03:50:22.070 --> 03:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
and land and rode my bike to Peabody it
 
03:50:23.750 --> 03:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
can be done I'm probably foolish for
 
03:50:24.889 --> 03:50:24.899 align:start position:0%
doing it but I was trying to prove a
 
03:50:28.370 --> 03:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
point so yeah too long about three hours
 
03:50:30.830 --> 03:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
it was a long commute won't do it again
 
03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
um but just to point out it is this is
 
03:50:33.710 --> 03:50:33.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to be an alternate
 
03:50:35.750 --> 03:50:35.760 align:start position:0%
Transportation you'll also see on the
 
03:50:37.670 --> 03:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
document for the Rizzo study that this
 
03:50:39.410 --> 03:50:39.420 align:start position:0%
talks about the fact that there will be
 
03:50:43.250 --> 03:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
public hearings input involvement of the
 
03:50:46.130 --> 03:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
community as dot designs this
 
03:50:48.110 --> 03:50:48.120 align:start position:0%
alternative and that is where a major
 
03:50:50.389 --> 03:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
failure has happened unfortunately in
 
03:50:53.210 --> 03:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
what is in front of you today
 
03:50:54.830 --> 03:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
this is one of my first times getting
 
03:50:56.570 --> 03:50:56.580 align:start position:0%
involved in Dot and all that and like I
 
03:50:57.950 --> 03:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
said we had a pretty good partnership I
 
03:50:57.960 --> 03:50:58.969 align:start position:0%
said we had a pretty good partnership I
thought

03:50:58.969 --> 03:50:58.979 align:start position:0%
thought
 
03:51:00.530 --> 03:51:00.540 align:start position:0%
um but D.O.T kind of just went off the
 
03:51:02.030 --> 03:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
rails and decided to go do their own
 
03:51:03.590 --> 03:51:03.600 align:start position:0%
thing without involving us and I used
 
03:51:05.990 --> 03:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
that you know term on purpose
 
03:51:07.550 --> 03:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
um they just kind of came up with this
 
03:51:10.190 --> 03:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
alternative and and and I will I will
 
03:51:12.110 --> 03:51:12.120 align:start position:0%
touch on that and then without enough
 
03:51:13.849 --> 03:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
public input they decided that was the
 
03:51:15.410 --> 03:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
way they were going and it all of a
 
03:51:16.969 --> 03:51:16.979 align:start position:0%
sudden showed up at a here at a public
 
03:51:19.250 --> 03:51:19.260 align:start position:0%
meeting as the only option
 
03:51:21.769 --> 03:51:21.779 align:start position:0%
so the other slides that I've included
 
03:51:23.990 --> 03:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
someone mentioned those bridges at Exit
 
03:51:26.570 --> 03:51:26.580 align:start position:0%
five in Londonderry this is the ml
 
03:51:28.910 --> 03:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
Corridor so when dot says well we're not
 
03:51:30.830 --> 03:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
really planning on trains coming back on
 
03:51:32.150 --> 03:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
this Corridor therefore we don't need to
 
03:51:33.530 --> 03:51:33.540 align:start position:0%
worry about keeping the corridor open
 
03:51:37.190 --> 03:51:37.200 align:start position:0%
well why the heck excuse me did we spend
 
03:51:40.910 --> 03:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
tens of millions of dollars on four
 
03:51:43.969 --> 03:51:43.979 align:start position:0%
train size overpasses for this little
 
03:51:46.010 --> 03:51:46.020 align:start position:0%
paved path to go under there then
 
03:51:48.110 --> 03:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we did tens of millions of
 
03:51:49.790 --> 03:51:49.800 align:start position:0%
dollars for those four bridges in
 
03:51:53.389 --> 03:51:53.399 align:start position:0%
Londonderry in Windham when they blasted
 
03:51:55.190 --> 03:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
the new 111 the pictures you have there
 
03:51:56.990 --> 03:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
are showing when we put in that new 111
 
03:51:59.090 --> 03:51:59.100 align:start position:0%
that didn't even exist that road just
 
03:52:01.849 --> 03:52:01.859 align:start position:0%
became you know a brand new road they
 
03:52:03.229 --> 03:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
had to keep the rail corridor open
 
03:52:05.570 --> 03:52:05.580 align:start position:0%
because our laws say you have to keep
 
03:52:07.849 --> 03:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
these quarters open for future rail
 
03:52:10.130 --> 03:52:10.140 align:start position:0%
potential the likelihood of rail coming
 
03:52:12.229 --> 03:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
back does not matter on this particular
 
03:52:14.929 --> 03:52:14.939 align:start position:0%
line may not happen but we are supposed
 
03:52:16.670 --> 03:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
to be doing that especially when
 
03:52:19.010 --> 03:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson mentions a line
 
03:52:22.849 --> 03:52:22.859 align:start position:0%
was used after I believe 1964 as live
 
03:52:25.849 --> 03:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
rail it has to be maintained by our own
 
03:52:28.610 --> 03:52:28.620 align:start position:0%
laws putting this highway in and and
 
03:52:31.190 --> 03:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
they knew this in Derry too because when
 
03:52:33.170 --> 03:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
they um when they did take out the
 
03:52:35.570 --> 03:52:35.580 align:start position:0%
bridges that Mr uh Pearson mentioned
 
03:52:37.370 --> 03:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
there was a bridge at Folsom Road an old
 
03:52:38.990 --> 03:52:39.000 align:start position:0%
one old rickety wooden bridge like you
 
03:52:40.330 --> 03:52:40.340 align:start position:0%
see in different places
 
03:52:43.250 --> 03:52:43.260 align:start position:0%
they actually put in a six foot metal
 
03:52:45.590 --> 03:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
tunnel Culvert you can barely walk
 
03:52:47.150 --> 03:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
through it without whacking your head on
 
03:52:48.769 --> 03:52:48.779 align:start position:0%
it or anything but they did that because
 
03:52:50.929 --> 03:52:50.939 align:start position:0%
they were required to keep the
 
03:52:53.269 --> 03:52:53.279 align:start position:0%
connectivity of that rail Corridor they
 
03:52:55.309 --> 03:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
could not just fill it in and put a road
 
03:52:56.630 --> 03:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
across it we have the same thing at
 
03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
Bowers Road where another Bridge was
 
03:53:00.349 --> 03:53:00.359 align:start position:0%
replaced they had to put a culvert in
 
03:53:02.330 --> 03:53:02.340 align:start position:0%
there in the 80s in order to comply with
 
03:53:04.969 --> 03:53:04.979 align:start position:0%
the law so for them to just blast this
 
03:53:07.130 --> 03:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
and cover up the rail bed now is not
 
03:53:09.650 --> 03:53:09.660 align:start position:0%
Kosher you have laws against it and you
 
03:53:11.030 --> 03:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
guys can go and find them we can point
 
03:53:13.190 --> 03:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
them out to you I'll also say that you
 
03:53:14.809 --> 03:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
know the dot keeps pointing to this
 
03:53:16.790 --> 03:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
being a financial question
 
03:53:18.830 --> 03:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
well I just showed you how much money we
 
03:53:20.570 --> 03:53:20.580 align:start position:0%
spent in Windham how much money we spent
 
03:53:22.670 --> 03:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
in Londonderry on the same Trail well
 
03:53:25.490 --> 03:53:25.500 align:start position:0%
here's another Butte 93 if you go to
 
03:53:27.830 --> 03:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
mile marker 8.6 get out of your car and
 
03:53:30.229 --> 03:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
walk off the side of the road the dot
 
03:53:33.590 --> 03:53:33.600 align:start position:0%
spent Millions to put a box Culvert
 
03:53:36.050 --> 03:53:36.060 align:start position:0%
under both sides of 93 just about three
 
03:53:37.130 --> 03:53:37.140 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
03:53:39.530 --> 03:53:39.540 align:start position:0%
you know for what a rail trail that
 
03:53:42.229 --> 03:53:42.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist a future rail trail that
 
03:53:44.210 --> 03:53:44.220 align:start position:0%
because there's a rail bed there they
 
03:53:46.190 --> 03:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
had to keep it open they had to put the
 
03:53:48.349 --> 03:53:48.359 align:start position:0%
turret tunnel in and they did so this
 
03:53:50.389 --> 03:53:50.399 align:start position:0%
tunnel exists and probably two or three
 
03:53:51.830 --> 03:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
people a week use it to walk through
 
03:53:53.750 --> 03:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
because they live on one side of the 93
 
03:53:56.570 --> 03:53:56.580 align:start position:0%
or the other Millions for that tunnel
 
03:54:00.290 --> 03:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
but now we are here because of a 750 000
 
03:54:02.210 --> 03:54:02.220 align:start position:0%
difference between building this crazy
 
03:54:04.130 --> 03:54:04.140 align:start position:0%
alternative that sends people down a
 
03:54:06.229 --> 03:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
five percent grade under a bridge 90
 
03:54:08.750 --> 03:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
degree turn cross two driveways across
 
03:54:12.889 --> 03:54:12.899 align:start position:0%
the street and on a downhill slope so I
 
03:54:14.210 --> 03:54:14.220 align:start position:0%
hearken back to when I took my little
 
03:54:15.710 --> 03:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
kids for the first ride on their rail
 
03:54:17.570 --> 03:54:17.580 align:start position:0%
trail why did I love it
 
03:54:19.130 --> 03:54:19.140 align:start position:0%
they could just ride and I didn't have
 
03:54:20.150 --> 03:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
to worry about them they could get up
 
03:54:21.650 --> 03:54:21.660 align:start position:0%
100 feet ahead of me there was no
 
03:54:24.110 --> 03:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
Crossings there was nothing you got a
 
03:54:25.969 --> 03:54:25.979 align:start position:0%
kid on a little bike with a mom pushing
 
03:54:27.650 --> 03:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
a stroller with the other kid and the
 
03:54:28.910 --> 03:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
little kid starts getting going down
 
03:54:30.769 --> 03:54:30.779 align:start position:0%
that Hill he's going across two people's
 
03:54:33.290 --> 03:54:33.300 align:start position:0%
driveway who are backing out and he's
 
03:54:35.269 --> 03:54:35.279 align:start position:0%
got to come to that furlin street go
 
03:54:37.490 --> 03:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
across the street take a 90 degree turn
 
03:54:39.469 --> 03:54:39.479 align:start position:0%
go down another slope that's just under
 
03:54:42.650 --> 03:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
Ada at just under five percent do 180
 
03:54:45.410 --> 03:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
degree buttonhook Loop come back down a
 
03:54:47.450 --> 03:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
slope to the stream level and then shoot
 
03:54:49.309 --> 03:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
under a bridge as Mr Pearson said where
 
03:54:50.929 --> 03:54:50.939 align:start position:0%
there's people coming at 18 to 20 miles
 
03:54:53.990 --> 03:54:54.000 align:start position:0%
an hour the other way in darkness or
 
03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
under a bridge maybe it's not dark but
 
03:54:58.969 --> 03:54:58.979 align:start position:0%
under a bridge this is accidents waiting
 
03:55:00.290 --> 03:55:00.300 align:start position:0%
to happen the dairy fire department is
 
03:55:01.729 --> 03:55:01.739 align:start position:0%
going to be spending they might as well
 
03:55:03.349 --> 03:55:03.359 align:start position:0%
just post a truck out there if this
 
03:55:04.670 --> 03:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
thing goes through
 
03:55:07.070 --> 03:55:07.080 align:start position:0%
so someone asked I think it was Rhett
 
03:55:09.710 --> 03:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
McGuire finances why is this in front of
 
03:55:11.389 --> 03:55:11.399 align:start position:0%
the finance committee quite honestly I
 
03:55:12.950 --> 03:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
wish this never got in front of our Town
 
03:55:14.389 --> 03:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
Council and they never had to take the
 
03:55:17.330 --> 03:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
vote I personally as a consultant on
 
03:55:20.389 --> 03:55:20.399 align:start position:0%
this project the drta the New Hampshire
 
03:55:22.250 --> 03:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
rails Trails Coalition the granite state
 
03:55:24.170 --> 03:55:24.180 align:start position:0%
rail Trails bike walk Alliance in New
 
03:55:27.050 --> 03:55:27.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been pleading with DOT
 
03:55:29.389 --> 03:55:29.399 align:start position:0%
to work with them to come up with a
 
03:55:32.030 --> 03:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
solution we've been shut out
 
03:55:34.729 --> 03:55:34.739 align:start position:0%
they won't do it we've heard and again
 
03:55:36.410 --> 03:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
anecdotally I hope you guys can look
 
03:55:38.510 --> 03:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
into it that the Dot's own safety
 
03:55:40.429 --> 03:55:40.439 align:start position:0%
department has not been allowed to look
 
03:55:43.490 --> 03:55:43.500 align:start position:0%
at or comment publicly on this plan
 
03:55:45.830 --> 03:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
they hadn't even seen it
 
03:55:47.510 --> 03:55:47.520 align:start position:0%
someone mentioned National resource
 
03:55:49.849 --> 03:55:49.859 align:start position:0%
natural resources the ml Corridor is a
 
03:55:52.610 --> 03:55:52.620 align:start position:0%
historic corridor so forget all the rail
 
03:55:54.110 --> 03:55:54.120 align:start position:0%
trail stuff even if this wasn't an
 
03:55:57.050 --> 03:55:57.060 align:start position:0%
active rail after 1964 it's a historic
 
03:55:59.389 --> 03:55:59.399 align:start position:0%
quarter that also has to be kept intact
 
03:56:03.110 --> 03:56:03.120 align:start position:0%
and in fact the approval for I-93 and
 
03:56:06.530 --> 03:56:06.540 align:start position:0%
the exit 4A got credits from the federal
 
03:56:09.469 --> 03:56:09.479 align:start position:0%
government and positive upticks in order
 
03:56:11.450 --> 03:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
for them to even do this whole 93
 
03:56:14.750 --> 03:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
widening and exit 4A project because
 
03:56:17.330 --> 03:56:17.340 align:start position:0%
of what they put in the plan because
 
03:56:18.469 --> 03:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
they said we're going to build a
 
03:56:20.150 --> 03:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
beautiful rail trail and we're actually
 
03:56:21.590 --> 03:56:21.600 align:start position:0%
going to build these Wing walls that are
 
03:56:22.910 --> 03:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
going to have a historic representation
 
03:56:24.950 --> 03:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
of what the rail used to look like and
 
03:56:27.050 --> 03:56:27.060 align:start position:0%
so they sold this thing to natural
 
03:56:28.610 --> 03:56:28.620 align:start position:0%
resources and the New Hampshire
 
03:56:30.889 --> 03:56:30.899 align:start position:0%
historical preservation Society those
 
03:56:32.389 --> 03:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
folks also haven't said okay to this
 
03:56:34.250 --> 03:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
plan yet that's one of the reasons it
 
03:56:35.570 --> 03:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
hasn't gone to the feds is they still
 
03:56:36.769 --> 03:56:36.779 align:start position:0%
haven't got the approval of those people
 
03:56:38.150 --> 03:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
because they say wait wait a minute you
 
03:56:39.410 --> 03:56:39.420 align:start position:0%
said you were keeping the corridor open
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
so please do your homework on this thing
 
03:56:43.550 --> 03:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
now Finance let's get to the money
 
03:56:44.630 --> 03:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
because I don't want to keep you guys
 
03:56:45.830 --> 03:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
all day I could talk about this for
 
03:56:50.330 --> 03:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
months so dot also uh did a study I
 
03:56:51.889 --> 03:56:51.899 align:start position:0%
think it came out this August or past
 
03:56:54.349 --> 03:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
August August 2022 and again this
 
03:56:55.670 --> 03:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
picture of it but you guys can go online
 
03:56:57.229 --> 03:56:57.239 align:start position:0%
and you can see the whole thing
 
03:56:59.269 --> 03:56:59.279 align:start position:0%
commissioned by the D.O.T again spent a
 
03:57:00.889 --> 03:57:00.899 align:start position:0%
bunch of money on this
 
03:57:03.950 --> 03:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
over 18 million dollars annually is
 
03:57:05.510 --> 03:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
coming to New Hampshire because of the
 
03:57:07.070 --> 03:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
rail trails
 
03:57:11.090 --> 03:57:11.100 align:start position:0%
7.5 million of that is coming from the
 
03:57:13.670 --> 03:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
Derry Windham Londonderry sections of
 
03:57:16.610 --> 03:57:16.620 align:start position:0%
the existing Trail 7.5 million
 
03:57:18.290 --> 03:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
and we're talking we're cobbling over
 
03:57:22.729 --> 03:57:22.739 align:start position:0%
750 000 tunnel on a 130 million dollar
 
03:57:25.490 --> 03:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
project after they've spent Millions on
 
03:57:27.410 --> 03:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
all these other tunnels this makes no
 
03:57:29.090 --> 03:57:29.100 align:start position:0%
sense to me quite honestly for a while I
 
03:57:30.349 --> 03:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
figured there had to be something going
 
03:57:31.849 --> 03:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
on behind the scenes someone wasn't
 
03:57:33.769 --> 03:57:33.779 align:start position:0%
telling us the whole deal someone had
 
03:57:36.110 --> 03:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
their finger in the pie something not
 
03:57:38.809 --> 03:57:38.819 align:start position:0%
Kosher was going on Dot's proven to us
 
03:57:40.429 --> 03:57:40.439 align:start position:0%
that no that's not the case there's no
 
03:57:41.809 --> 03:57:41.819 align:start position:0%
backroom deals there's nothing we just
 
03:57:43.790 --> 03:57:43.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to spend 750 000 for the
 
03:57:46.010 --> 03:57:46.020 align:start position:0%
safest best alternative in Dairy that's
 
03:57:47.210 --> 03:57:47.220 align:start position:0%
what they've said that's their only
 
03:57:47.220 --> 03:57:48.110 align:start position:0%
what they've said that's their only
argument

03:57:48.110 --> 03:57:48.120 align:start position:0%
argument
 
03:57:50.030 --> 03:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
so again just pointing to their own
 
03:57:53.330 --> 03:57:53.340 align:start position:0%
report Senate Bill 185 adopted in 2019
 
03:57:56.210 --> 03:57:56.220 align:start position:0%
is an act to develop New Hampshire State
 
03:57:58.550 --> 03:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
rail trails and in that act it actually
 
03:58:00.830 --> 03:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
talks about the preservation of
 
03:58:03.769 --> 03:58:03.779 align:start position:0%
important investment corridors again so
 
03:58:05.570 --> 03:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
they were thinking about rail Trails
 
03:58:07.309 --> 03:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
we're not anti-rail some people said oh
 
03:58:08.269 --> 03:58:08.279 align:start position:0%
you know what they should be doing is
 
03:58:10.250 --> 03:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
bringing back the trains absolutely if
 
03:58:12.050 --> 03:58:12.060 align:start position:0%
you can bring back a train most people
 
03:58:13.490 --> 03:58:13.500 align:start position:0%
on rail Trails don't have a problem we
 
03:58:15.469 --> 03:58:15.479 align:start position:0%
can do rail with Trail we're not against
 
03:58:17.510 --> 03:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
the trains coming back in fact when
 
03:58:19.370 --> 03:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
Woodmont Commons uh which is the big
 
03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
exit 4A project up there when they did
 
03:58:24.290 --> 03:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
their charrettes 10 years ago I was
 
03:58:25.849 --> 03:58:25.859 align:start position:0%
there I went over to the apple orchard
 
03:58:26.929 --> 03:58:26.939 align:start position:0%
and sat in their building you know what
 
03:58:29.689 --> 03:58:29.699 align:start position:0%
was planned just north of this tunnel a
 
03:58:31.849 --> 03:58:31.859 align:start position:0%
train station because they were doing a
 
03:58:34.010 --> 03:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
multimodal approach and again when they
 
03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
sold their product project there was
 
03:58:37.429 --> 03:58:37.439 align:start position:0%
gonna be a train coming up here so
 
03:58:38.870 --> 03:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
people could commute from Woodmont to
 
03:58:40.189 --> 03:58:40.199 align:start position:0%
Boston and there was a beautiful train
 
03:58:42.410 --> 03:58:42.420 align:start position:0%
station planned we've been working with
 
03:58:44.150 --> 03:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
Woodmont and there folks all along too
 
03:58:46.189 --> 03:58:46.199 align:start position:0%
in fact Woodmont owns some of the rail
 
03:58:47.269 --> 03:58:47.279 align:start position:0%
beds someone asked about the ownership
 
03:58:49.510 --> 03:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
of the rail bed not Woodmont but people
 
03:58:51.830 --> 03:58:51.840 align:start position:0%
involved in the project own part of the
 
03:58:53.809 --> 03:58:53.819 align:start position:0%
rail bed they've already agreed to turn
 
03:58:56.030 --> 03:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
it over to Derry and Londonderry in
 
03:58:57.650 --> 03:58:57.660 align:start position:0%
order for the rail trail to be built
 
03:59:00.050 --> 03:59:00.060 align:start position:0%
once exit 4A is complete everybody is on
 
03:59:03.110 --> 03:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
board this rail trail is gold so the
 
03:59:04.309 --> 03:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
other thing that I'll point to is the
 
03:59:06.050 --> 03:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
economic impact study within that New
 
03:59:08.150 --> 03:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rail Trails Coalition report
 
03:59:11.210 --> 03:59:11.220 align:start position:0%
is again dot numbers they did it so
 
03:59:15.349 --> 03:59:15.359 align:start position:0%
almost 19 million raised 7.5 uh I think
 
03:59:18.290 --> 03:59:18.300 align:start position:0%
eight of it or was it four of it is
 
03:59:20.150 --> 03:59:20.160 align:start position:0%
coming from tourism I will tell you
 
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
personally we this Trail is on the
 
03:59:22.560 --> 03:59:23.809 align:start position:0%
personally we this Trail is on the
international

03:59:23.809 --> 03:59:23.819 align:start position:0%
international
 
03:59:26.630 --> 03:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
bike path uh
 
03:59:30.349 --> 03:59:30.359 align:start position:0%
plan I've had people from Germany Sweden
 
03:59:32.750 --> 03:59:32.760 align:start position:0%
England Canada
 
03:59:35.030 --> 03:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
stay in my house because I've run into
 
03:59:36.530 --> 03:59:36.540 align:start position:0%
them riding on the rail trail with their
 
03:59:37.790 --> 03:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
fully loaded bikes and they're like hey
 
03:59:39.170 --> 03:59:39.180 align:start position:0%
where do we stay where can we camp where
 
03:59:41.090 --> 03:59:41.100 align:start position:0%
are the hostels on this Trail we don't
 
03:59:43.670 --> 03:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
have any yet but come on stay with me so
 
03:59:45.229 --> 03:59:45.239 align:start position:0%
this Trail is bringing people from all
 
03:59:47.510 --> 03:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
around the world other states if you go
 
03:59:49.370 --> 03:59:49.380 align:start position:0%
to Wisconsin look at Wisconsin you look
 
03:59:50.630 --> 03:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
at Maryland there's the Cumberland
 
03:59:52.130 --> 03:59:52.140 align:start position:0%
Maryland trail that goes from Pittsburgh
 
03:59:55.010 --> 03:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
into Maryland 100 million dollars or
 
03:59:57.410 --> 03:59:57.420 align:start position:0%
more in Revenue every year attributed to
 
04:00:00.050 --> 04:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
that 100 Mile Trail that is the vision
 
04:00:02.090 --> 04:00:02.100 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire that is what we are
 
04:00:03.410 --> 04:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
trying to build is this Granite State
 
04:00:05.389 --> 04:00:05.399 align:start position:0%
rail trail we've only got the gap
 
04:00:07.729 --> 04:00:07.739 align:start position:0%
between Concord and Manchester left once
 
04:00:09.830 --> 04:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
we get this debacle with 4A squared away
 
04:00:12.170 --> 04:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
because we have one mile to pave between
 
04:00:14.269 --> 04:00:14.279 align:start position:0%
us and Londonderry we're ready to do
 
04:00:16.189 --> 04:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
that as soon as this tunnel is done and
 
04:00:17.570 --> 04:00:17.580 align:start position:0%
then you've got a trail that runs from
 
04:00:19.130 --> 04:00:19.140 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts all the way to Manchester
 
04:00:21.530 --> 04:00:21.540 align:start position:0%
already paved so we're going to need
 
04:00:22.910 --> 04:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
your help a little bit more than just
 
04:00:24.710 --> 04:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
this I'm I'm hoping that you folks are
 
04:00:26.150 --> 04:00:26.160 align:start position:0%
getting educated on the whole rail trail
 
04:00:27.830 --> 04:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
and Granite State rail trail concept too
 
04:00:27.840 --> 04:00:29.389 align:start position:0%
and Granite State rail trail concept too
because

04:00:29.389 --> 04:00:29.399 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:00:31.130 --> 04:00:31.140 align:start position:0%
I would love for this to move forward
 
04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
get this Tunnel built it's a no-brainer
 
04:00:35.870 --> 04:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
as I say in my final slides this should
 
04:00:38.090 --> 04:00:38.100 align:start position:0%
never have gotten this far it's a waste
 
04:00:40.370 --> 04:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
of people's time 750
 
04:00:43.130 --> 04:00:43.140 align:start position:0%
000 is an investment I would say for one
 
04:00:44.990 --> 04:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
child's life who might get hit by a car
 
04:00:47.269 --> 04:00:47.279 align:start position:0%
on that crazy alternative
 
04:00:49.250 --> 04:00:49.260 align:start position:0%
I would also ask we've been asking the
 
04:00:51.590 --> 04:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
question how much is dot spent for the
 
04:00:53.750 --> 04:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
last two and a half years developing and
 
04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
redeveloping and coming to these
 
04:00:57.349 --> 04:00:57.359 align:start position:0%
meetings and going to the public with
 
04:00:59.870 --> 04:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
this crazy alternative I bet you it
 
04:01:01.429 --> 04:01:01.439 align:start position:0%
already pays for the tunnel if you guys
 
04:01:02.929 --> 04:01:02.939 align:start position:0%
could get those numbers out of D.O.T
 
04:01:04.189 --> 04:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
we'd appreciate it because they won't
 
04:01:05.750 --> 04:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
give them to us
 
04:01:08.450 --> 04:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
so not not to uh I appreciate it I'm
 
04:01:09.950 --> 04:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
gonna I'm gonna wrap up with that I'm
 
04:01:12.410 --> 04:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
gonna ask you guys to build the tunnel
 
04:01:16.010 --> 04:01:16.020 align:start position:0%
excuse me and ask any questions you want
 
04:01:18.830 --> 04:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
are there any questions uh
 
04:01:20.389 --> 04:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
because I'm sure we'll have a few more
 
04:01:23.090 --> 04:01:23.100 align:start position:0%
with I'd like to uh if there are no
 
04:01:24.769 --> 04:01:24.779 align:start position:0%
questions I'd like to have a
 
04:01:27.650 --> 04:01:27.660 align:start position:0%
representative from the dot come up
 
04:01:29.330 --> 04:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
because we've heard some thank you
 
04:01:32.450 --> 04:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
pretty interesting testimony and there's
 
04:01:33.830 --> 04:01:33.840 align:start position:0%
a lot of interesting things that I've
 
04:01:35.450 --> 04:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
been reading up here as well so I'd like
 
04:01:37.130 --> 04:01:37.140 align:start position:0%
to get your comment
 
04:01:43.250 --> 04:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:45.170 --> 04:01:45.180 align:start position:0%

um

04:01:55.670 --> 04:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:58.250 --> 04:01:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:00.349 --> 04:02:00.359 align:start position:0%

development
 
04:02:03.110 --> 04:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
oh we see the highway and Bridge
 
04:02:05.630 --> 04:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
programs across the state
 
04:02:08.809 --> 04:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
projects through the 10-year plan
 
04:02:08.819 --> 04:02:15.769 align:start position:0%
projects through the 10-year plan
foreign

04:02:15.769 --> 04:02:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:17.809 --> 04:02:17.819 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out where where to
 
04:02:17.819 --> 04:02:18.830 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out where where to
start

04:02:18.830 --> 04:02:18.840 align:start position:0%
start
 
04:02:20.689 --> 04:02:20.699 align:start position:0%
um from a from a from a presentation
 
04:02:20.699 --> 04:02:22.790 align:start position:0%
um from a from a from a presentation
standpoint

04:02:22.790 --> 04:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
04:02:22.800 --> 04:02:24.650 align:start position:0%
standpoint
um

04:02:24.650 --> 04:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:27.950 --> 04:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
I think I'd like to start initially
 
04:02:29.510 --> 04:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
um by
 
04:02:31.610 --> 04:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
um clarifying A few
 
04:02:34.429 --> 04:02:34.439 align:start position:0%
um things that were said about the
 
04:02:36.349 --> 04:02:36.359 align:start position:0%
project in general
 
04:02:39.710 --> 04:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
um and then maybe I can go into
 
04:02:41.870 --> 04:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
um I think they explain the the details
 
04:02:45.710 --> 04:02:45.720 align:start position:0%
of the of the uh various options
 
04:02:47.510 --> 04:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
um you know I don't know that we need to
 
04:02:49.610 --> 04:02:49.620 align:start position:0%
go through that but but at least like to
 
04:02:52.490 --> 04:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
to clarify some of the things that I
 
04:02:54.769 --> 04:02:54.779 align:start position:0%
think May
 
04:02:54.779 --> 04:02:56.929 align:start position:0%
think May
um

04:02:56.929 --> 04:02:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:59.990 --> 04:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
may have been misstated in some way so
 
04:03:02.269 --> 04:03:02.279 align:start position:0%
the 4A project
 
04:03:06.650 --> 04:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
this project is a is it was a is a town
 
04:03:10.189 --> 04:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
of Londonderry and dairy project
 
04:03:12.889 --> 04:03:12.899 align:start position:0%
so it had been from the beginning back
 
04:03:15.469 --> 04:03:15.479 align:start position:0%
in 2014 the contract that you heard
 
04:03:19.729 --> 04:03:19.739 align:start position:0%
about that was signed uh because there
 
04:03:22.790 --> 04:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
was difficulty by the municipalities to
 
04:03:24.349 --> 04:03:24.359 align:start position:0%
get this project delivered
 
04:03:28.790 --> 04:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
so the dot said that um we'll we'll
 
04:03:30.469 --> 04:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
deliver this project we're going to
 
04:03:32.570 --> 04:03:32.580 align:start position:0%
finish the design we're going to engage
 
04:03:36.410 --> 04:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
Consultants to complete the work and
 
04:03:39.670 --> 04:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
um we've captured your financial
 
04:03:41.630 --> 04:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
participation in this set the five
 
04:03:44.150 --> 04:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
million dollars that was for each town
 
04:03:47.210 --> 04:03:47.220 align:start position:0%
so it's a town project this is this this
 
04:03:47.220 --> 04:03:48.349 align:start position:0%
so it's a town project this is this this
wasn't

04:03:48.349 --> 04:03:48.359 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
04:03:50.870 --> 04:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
a DOT project it was a town initiated
 
04:03:52.849 --> 04:03:52.859 align:start position:0%
project they had Advanced it through a
 
04:03:54.590 --> 04:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
04:03:58.670 --> 04:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
um you know back in early 2000s and it
 
04:04:01.309 --> 04:04:01.319 align:start position:0%
sat for a while because it because of
 
04:04:03.290 --> 04:04:03.300 align:start position:0%
everything else that was going on at the
 
04:04:03.300 --> 04:04:04.130 align:start position:0%
everything else that was going on at the
time

04:04:04.130 --> 04:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:04:04.140 --> 04:04:05.389 align:start position:0%
time
so

04:04:05.389 --> 04:04:05.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:04:06.950 --> 04:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know if that's helpful for
 
04:04:08.510 --> 04:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
you but
 
04:04:12.530 --> 04:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
um this is this the dot is finishing the
 
04:04:14.510 --> 04:04:14.520 align:start position:0%
project for the municipalities of dairy
 
04:04:19.309 --> 04:04:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:21.410 --> 04:04:21.420 align:start position:0%
representative Hatchet any of you that
 
04:04:23.330 --> 04:04:23.340 align:start position:0%
have a question during his presentation
 
04:04:25.490 --> 04:04:25.500 align:start position:0%
feel free to wave at me and we'll take
 
04:04:27.110 --> 04:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
the question
 
04:04:29.689 --> 04:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
um just for the characterization of what
 
04:04:33.110 --> 04:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
this project is but it's also a uh isn't
 
04:04:35.630 --> 04:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
it an important link to the overall
 
04:04:39.070 --> 04:04:39.080 align:start position:0%
project as to what was spoken to
 
04:04:41.689 --> 04:04:41.699 align:start position:0%
previously in other words I don't think
 
04:04:42.969 --> 04:04:42.979 align:start position:0%
it would be a correct
 
04:04:45.050 --> 04:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
characteristicization to say that this
 
04:04:48.170 --> 04:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
is just a two-ton project in very
 
04:04:50.689 --> 04:04:50.699 align:start position:0%
isolated it's part of a very important
 
04:04:50.699 --> 04:04:51.889 align:start position:0%
isolated it's part of a very important
link

04:04:51.889 --> 04:04:51.899 align:start position:0%
link
 
04:04:54.950 --> 04:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
um throughout or not please clear that
 
04:04:56.929 --> 04:04:56.939 align:start position:0%
up yeah I didn't mean to
 
04:05:00.889 --> 04:05:00.899 align:start position:0%
um intimate that I I I was mainly
 
04:05:04.250 --> 04:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
um you know the the commentary about the
 
04:05:07.250 --> 04:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
the constant delays by the dot
 
04:05:09.650 --> 04:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
um from the beginning it no it's it's an
 
04:05:12.710 --> 04:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
important project it provides a
 
04:05:15.410 --> 04:05:15.420 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a a improves the
 
04:05:18.410 --> 04:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
economic development through the area it
 
04:05:21.650 --> 04:05:21.660 align:start position:0%
also provides some traffic relief for
 
04:05:25.250 --> 04:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
exit four and and connections to 102 to
 
04:05:27.769 --> 04:05:27.779 align:start position:0%
the West so there's there's this value
 
04:05:27.779 --> 04:05:29.090 align:start position:0%
the West so there's there's this value
here

04:05:29.090 --> 04:05:29.100 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:05:31.610 --> 04:05:31.620 align:start position:0%
um and I didn't mean to uh
 
04:05:32.990 --> 04:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
um make a statement that would suggest
 
04:05:33.000 --> 04:05:36.590 align:start position:0%
um make a statement that would suggest
otherwise

04:05:36.590 --> 04:05:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:38.450 --> 04:05:38.460 align:start position:0%
so I have a follow-up to uh
 
04:05:40.189 --> 04:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
representative hatch
 
04:05:43.189 --> 04:05:43.199 align:start position:0%
you just said each Town provided five
 
04:05:44.929 --> 04:05:44.939 align:start position:0%
million dollars is that correct that's
 
04:05:46.429 --> 04:05:46.439 align:start position:0%
the first time I've heard it's like 10
 
04:05:48.650 --> 04:05:48.660 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars now it's not just the
 
04:05:51.830 --> 04:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
5 million that Dairy provided
 
04:05:55.729 --> 04:05:55.739 align:start position:0%
now they contracted with the state DOT
 
04:05:57.950 --> 04:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
because the contract was referenced in
 
04:06:00.650 --> 04:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
the early earlier discussion so
 
04:06:03.290 --> 04:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
both Londonderry and dairy signed a
 
04:06:06.290 --> 04:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
contract with a D.O.T to design and
 
04:06:09.170 --> 04:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
carry this project through it's a
 
04:06:11.870 --> 04:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
municipal agreement that we laid out
 
04:06:13.790 --> 04:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
um conditions
 
04:06:16.309 --> 04:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
um who would pay what who would be you
 
04:06:17.689 --> 04:06:17.699 align:start position:0%
know making decisions how we would
 
04:06:19.990 --> 04:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
coordinate decision making throughout
 
04:06:23.570 --> 04:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
the project and and it laid out the was
 
04:06:25.910 --> 04:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
the groundwork for bringing the project
 
04:06:27.590 --> 04:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
to completion
 
04:06:29.750 --> 04:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
and we can get a copy of that contract
 
04:06:31.849 --> 04:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's available certainly
 
04:06:31.859 --> 04:06:33.290 align:start position:0%
I'm sure it's available certainly
certainly

04:06:33.290 --> 04:06:33.300 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:06:35.450 --> 04:06:35.460 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
04:06:39.050 --> 04:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair so just so that we
 
04:06:41.330 --> 04:06:41.340 align:start position:0%
don't lose track of it I mean I come
 
04:06:43.790 --> 04:06:43.800 align:start position:0%
from a 10 years on public works and
 
04:06:46.610 --> 04:06:46.620 align:start position:0%
highways committee and there we have a
 
04:06:49.370 --> 04:06:49.380 align:start position:0%
10-year plan that we work on every
 
04:06:53.630 --> 04:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
biennium and so I have to assume that
 
04:06:57.530 --> 04:06:57.540 align:start position:0%
this is all part of many many working
 
04:07:01.490 --> 04:07:01.500 align:start position:0%
pieces that are continuing for foray
 
04:07:03.469 --> 04:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
which has been a project that's been
 
04:07:06.590 --> 04:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
going on for a long time so
 
04:07:08.809 --> 04:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
how does this fit into the 10-year plan
 
04:07:08.819 --> 04:07:11.870 align:start position:0%
how does this fit into the 10-year plan
process

04:07:11.870 --> 04:07:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:14.210 --> 04:07:14.220 align:start position:0%
and so from a from a from a from a
 
04:07:15.889 --> 04:07:15.899 align:start position:0%
quarter project standpoint or this box
 
04:07:18.469 --> 04:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
covert uh discussion just from the
 
04:07:20.389 --> 04:07:20.399 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm trying to say is that
 
04:07:22.610 --> 04:07:22.620 align:start position:0%
there's a huge planning process that's
 
04:07:25.610 --> 04:07:25.620 align:start position:0%
been going on with relationship to 93
 
04:07:28.250 --> 04:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
and you've obviously thought about a lot
 
04:07:31.309 --> 04:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
of these working pieces and this is one
 
04:07:34.189 --> 04:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
of many that you've had to fit into
 
04:07:38.510 --> 04:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
a long-range developing puzzle
 
04:07:40.610 --> 04:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
correct statement yes
 
04:07:43.490 --> 04:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
um from a so this comes up
 
04:07:46.490 --> 04:07:46.500 align:start position:0%
um every two years when we update the
 
04:07:48.530 --> 04:07:48.540 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan
 
04:07:48.540 --> 04:07:49.130 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan
um

04:07:49.130 --> 04:07:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:52.250 --> 04:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
this project for a while had not
 
04:07:56.090 --> 04:07:56.100 align:start position:0%
been funded and it it got funded
 
04:07:57.889 --> 04:07:57.899 align:start position:0%
um through the 10-year plan and that's
 
04:08:01.010 --> 04:08:01.020 align:start position:0%
that's our that's our long-range plan uh
 
04:08:03.170 --> 04:08:03.180 align:start position:0%
from a from a transportation it's our
 
04:08:06.170 --> 04:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
work plan it you know we travel around
 
04:08:07.969 --> 04:08:07.979 align:start position:0%
the state
 
04:08:10.010 --> 04:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
um generally
 
04:08:13.189 --> 04:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
um 20 to 25 hearings talking about
 
04:08:16.969 --> 04:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
important projects in in um
 
04:08:16.979 --> 04:08:17.570 align:start position:0%
important projects in in um
um

04:08:17.570 --> 04:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:19.550 --> 04:08:19.560 align:start position:0%
each region
 
04:08:22.429 --> 04:08:22.439 align:start position:0%
um it's overseen by the executive
 
04:08:22.439 --> 04:08:23.590 align:start position:0%
um it's overseen by the executive
Council

04:08:23.590 --> 04:08:23.600 align:start position:0%
Council
 
04:08:26.090 --> 04:08:26.100 align:start position:0%
and it receives significant amount of
 
04:08:28.969 --> 04:08:28.979 align:start position:0%
Public public input overall so this
 
04:08:31.790 --> 04:08:31.800 align:start position:0%
project and all the projects that are
 
04:08:33.290 --> 04:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
within the 10-year plan receive
 
04:08:35.150 --> 04:08:35.160 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of public input
 
04:08:37.969 --> 04:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
typically not down to the the details
 
04:08:40.250 --> 04:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
about box culverts but just in general
 
04:08:42.590 --> 04:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
the value of the project the
 
04:08:44.929 --> 04:08:44.939 align:start position:0%
um the purpose of the project and and
 
04:08:47.030 --> 04:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
and what the outcomes
 
04:08:48.950 --> 04:08:48.960 align:start position:0%
um would be
 
04:08:48.960 --> 04:08:49.969 align:start position:0%
um would be
um

04:08:49.969 --> 04:08:49.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:52.849 --> 04:08:52.859 align:start position:0%
when the project is completed
 
04:08:55.370 --> 04:08:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you so so it's just
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
in some ways it's hard to view it in
 
04:09:00.410 --> 04:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
isolation because it's part of a whole
 
04:09:03.530 --> 04:09:03.540 align:start position:0%
package that you're working on sure
 
04:09:06.410 --> 04:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:10.130 --> 04:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
so I have one question uh kind of a
 
04:09:14.150 --> 04:09:14.160 align:start position:0%
follow-up to the whole funding scenario
 
04:09:16.130 --> 04:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
now each time put the five million
 
04:09:18.170 --> 04:09:18.180 align:start position:0%
dollars and in this Connector Road where
 
04:09:20.150 --> 04:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
there are federal funds put in for that
 
04:09:23.150 --> 04:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
state funds local funds
 
04:09:24.950 --> 04:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
well obviously that this whole project
 
04:09:27.830 --> 04:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
is a lot more than 10 million dollars so
 
04:09:30.290 --> 04:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
what this whole redesigned you know the
 
04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
cost of that redesign and carry through
 
04:09:34.389 --> 04:09:34.399 align:start position:0%
as far as the completion of the project
 
04:09:37.250 --> 04:09:37.260 align:start position:0%
so that it's
 
04:09:39.830 --> 04:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
um the construction cost estimate
 
04:09:42.530 --> 04:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
currently is around 104 million dollars
 
04:09:44.870 --> 04:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
and it's all it's federally funded so
 
04:09:46.969 --> 04:09:46.979 align:start position:0%
this is a this is federally funds there
 
04:09:50.389 --> 04:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
are no uh State funds involved we don't
 
04:09:51.710 --> 04:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
have a lot of State funds for
 
04:09:53.870 --> 04:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
transportation projects in the state of
 
04:09:55.790 --> 04:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so this is a federally
 
04:09:58.550 --> 04:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
funded project and the town's
 
04:10:00.530 --> 04:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
contribution the five million dollar
 
04:10:00.540 --> 04:10:01.969 align:start position:0%
contribution the five million dollar
each

04:10:01.969 --> 04:10:01.979 align:start position:0%
each
 
04:10:03.889 --> 04:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
um was
 
04:10:06.050 --> 04:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
um you know part of part of the deal
 
04:10:08.450 --> 04:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
again it was it was a municipal project
 
04:10:10.790 --> 04:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
to begin with
 
04:10:13.250 --> 04:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sure that there are probably
 
04:10:16.189 --> 04:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
uh hours and hours of information that
 
04:10:18.290 --> 04:10:18.300 align:start position:0%
could be shared with you not by me at
 
04:10:20.450 --> 04:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
how that how that came about the five
 
04:10:21.769 --> 04:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
million dollar
 
04:10:23.210 --> 04:10:23.220 align:start position:0%
um like I can't go there I'm sure
 
04:10:25.010 --> 04:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
there's there's there were lots of
 
04:10:26.990 --> 04:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
discussions about that and probably a
 
04:10:29.570 --> 04:10:29.580 align:start position:0%
few lawyers involved
 
04:10:34.309 --> 04:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:37.010 --> 04:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
is that the deal to put in this
 
04:10:38.929 --> 04:10:38.939 align:start position:0%
underpass tunnel
 
04:10:42.349 --> 04:10:42.359 align:start position:0%
or I'm looking at this plan that we were
 
04:10:44.870 --> 04:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
just given it's a little clear to look
 
04:10:46.969 --> 04:10:46.979 align:start position:0%
at or this I hate to use the word but
 
04:10:48.830 --> 04:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
since it was used already the spaghetti
 
04:10:51.290 --> 04:10:51.300 align:start position:0%
plan who came up with a spaghetti plant
 
04:10:53.450 --> 04:10:53.460 align:start position:0%
was that in the original
 
04:10:56.030 --> 04:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
contract they have a route that was
 
04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
somewhat removed from the existing real
 
04:11:00.530 --> 04:11:00.540 align:start position:0%
Corridor or
 
04:11:03.950 --> 04:11:03.960 align:start position:0%
um so the contract that you speak of the
 
04:11:03.960 --> 04:11:05.330 align:start position:0%
um so the contract that you speak of the
agreement

04:11:05.330 --> 04:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
04:11:07.490 --> 04:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
I don't believe made any mention of of
 
04:11:09.710 --> 04:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
the rail trail it was specific to the
 
04:11:11.450 --> 04:11:11.460 align:start position:0%
delivery of the project and the costs
 
04:11:13.910 --> 04:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
associated with that who was going to
 
04:11:16.429 --> 04:11:16.439 align:start position:0%
prosecute the design who was a decision
 
04:11:18.050 --> 04:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
maker how is that going to be
 
04:11:18.060 --> 04:11:19.670 align:start position:0%
maker how is that going to be
communicated

04:11:19.670 --> 04:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
communicated
 
04:11:22.250 --> 04:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
um and I would
 
04:11:22.260 --> 04:11:23.870 align:start position:0%
um and I would
um

04:11:23.870 --> 04:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:26.990 --> 04:11:27.000 align:start position:0%
I don't believe the the decision to put
 
04:11:32.510 --> 04:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
a to put a a tunnel in was done prior to
 
04:11:35.950 --> 04:11:35.960 align:start position:0%
that contract that that that agreement
 
04:11:39.590 --> 04:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
we knew that the the trail
 
04:11:41.750 --> 04:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
um the the railroad Corridor
 
04:11:44.090 --> 04:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
um that the road that we that that was
 
04:11:45.889 --> 04:11:45.899 align:start position:0%
planned to be constructed was going to
 
04:11:47.570 --> 04:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
bypass was going to was going to
 
04:11:49.130 --> 04:11:49.140 align:start position:0%
intersect that rail quarter and we had
 
04:11:51.050 --> 04:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
to figure out a way
 
04:11:55.550 --> 04:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
um to accommodate that that uh Corridor
 
04:11:55.560 --> 04:11:56.510 align:start position:0%
um to accommodate that that uh Corridor
um

04:11:56.510 --> 04:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:59.809 --> 04:11:59.819 align:start position:0%
so you know was it going to be an at
 
04:12:01.250 --> 04:12:01.260 align:start position:0%
Great Crossing was it going to be a
 
04:12:02.450 --> 04:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
tunnel was it going to be some other
 
04:12:04.309 --> 04:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
grade separated
 
04:12:07.670 --> 04:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
um um Crossing you know that wasn't part
 
04:12:09.889 --> 04:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
that wasn't that wasn't really included
 
04:12:12.889 --> 04:12:12.899 align:start position:0%
in the early in the early designs I I
 
04:12:14.870 --> 04:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
would expect that there was probably
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
some level of discussion about
 
04:12:20.450 --> 04:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
um you know working towards a grade
 
04:12:23.030 --> 04:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
separated solution which both of these
 
04:12:24.530 --> 04:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
alternatives are they're both great
 
04:12:27.050 --> 04:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
separated solutions they both have five
 
04:12:29.150 --> 04:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
percent grades
 
04:12:31.550 --> 04:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
um from the rail from the from from
 
04:12:34.610 --> 04:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
where the trail meets the the uh the uh
 
04:12:37.250 --> 04:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
the railroad Corridor to get it under to
 
04:12:40.550 --> 04:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
get it under Folsom Road both options
 
04:12:43.610 --> 04:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
have five percent down and five percent
 
04:12:45.710 --> 04:12:45.720 align:start position:0%
up one's just a little bit longer than
 
04:12:47.210 --> 04:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
the other one
 
04:12:50.210 --> 04:12:50.220 align:start position:0%
so I'm a little puzzled because
 
04:12:52.429 --> 04:12:52.439 align:start position:0%
I'm actually in the railroad business so
 
04:12:56.150 --> 04:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
maybe I've got a disadvantage but
 
04:12:57.290 --> 04:12:57.300 align:start position:0%
um it's
 
04:13:00.229 --> 04:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
you say there's a five percent grade to
 
04:13:02.570 --> 04:13:02.580 align:start position:0%
take it under the road but somebody
 
04:13:05.150 --> 04:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
testified earlier I believe that there
 
04:13:07.849 --> 04:13:07.859 align:start position:0%
was a bridge there before that went over
 
04:13:11.210 --> 04:13:11.220 align:start position:0%
the rail grade so the real grade would
 
04:13:13.250 --> 04:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
not have a grade of five percent it just
 
04:13:15.710 --> 04:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't work that way that's correct
 
04:13:18.050 --> 04:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
so the so Folsom Road and we're getting
 
04:13:18.060 --> 04:13:19.070 align:start position:0%
so the so Folsom Road and we're getting
into

04:13:19.070 --> 04:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
into
 
04:13:20.750 --> 04:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
um I was told to keep this simple but
 
04:13:23.809 --> 04:13:23.819 align:start position:0%
this is really simple stuff Folsom road
 
04:13:26.590 --> 04:13:26.600 align:start position:0%
is is is probably eight to ten feet
 
04:13:29.389 --> 04:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
higher than the than the than the than
 
04:13:31.910 --> 04:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
the uh Railroad
 
04:13:36.710 --> 04:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
Corridor the the railroad bed
 
04:13:38.150 --> 04:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
okay well
 
04:13:40.070 --> 04:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
um I do have a question representative
 
04:13:42.229 --> 04:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
McGuire had to leave and he said please
 
04:13:45.050 --> 04:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
ask the dot about the contract he States
 
04:13:48.229 --> 04:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
here are we opening ourselves up to a
 
04:13:50.330 --> 04:13:50.340 align:start position:0%
lawsuit by Dairy to enforce the
 
04:13:52.309 --> 04:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
provisions of the contract with the
 
04:13:54.410 --> 04:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
tunnel plan so that's a question from
 
04:13:56.990 --> 04:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
04:13:59.030 --> 04:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
can you repeat the question again I I
 
04:13:59.040 --> 04:14:00.769 align:start position:0%
can you repeat the question again I I
sure

04:14:00.769 --> 04:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:14:04.010 --> 04:14:04.020 align:start position:0%
are we opening up to a lawsuit by the
 
04:14:06.349 --> 04:14:06.359 align:start position:0%
town of dairy to enforce the provisions
 
04:14:10.490 --> 04:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
of the contract with the tunnel plan I I
 
04:14:12.590 --> 04:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
don't think that the tunnel was included
 
04:14:15.410 --> 04:14:15.420 align:start position:0%
in the in the in the agreement that I'm
 
04:14:17.990 --> 04:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
talking about I I could be mistaken but
 
04:14:19.550 --> 04:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it is
 
04:14:21.290 --> 04:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
all right well he had that question so
 
04:14:22.370 --> 04:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
I'll ask but I'll let you continue
 
04:14:23.870 --> 04:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
unless there are any further questions
 
04:14:26.330 --> 04:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to caution everybody we're
 
04:14:26.340 --> 04:14:27.170 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to caution everybody we're
already

04:14:27.170 --> 04:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
already
 
04:14:29.990 --> 04:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
45 minutes behind on our next hearing we
 
04:14:32.389 --> 04:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
didn't anticipate this would become so
 
04:14:36.229 --> 04:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:37.840 --> 04:14:37.850 align:start position:0%
I also have
 
04:14:37.850 --> 04:14:38.210 align:start position:0%
I also have
[Music]

04:14:38.210 --> 04:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:14:38.220 --> 04:14:39.889 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:14:39.889 --> 04:14:39.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:14:42.769 --> 04:14:42.779 align:start position:0%
poppies of the
 
04:14:42.779 --> 04:14:45.610 align:start position:0%
poppies of the
um

04:14:45.610 --> 04:14:45.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
correspondence just to give
 
04:14:50.570 --> 04:14:50.580 align:start position:0%
um for and I'd like to pass out copies
 
04:14:53.450 --> 04:14:53.460 align:start position:0%
of the correspondence between a sample
 
04:14:55.370 --> 04:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
of the correspondence between the dot
 
04:14:55.380 --> 04:14:56.990 align:start position:0%
of the correspondence between the dot
and

04:14:56.990 --> 04:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:57.000 --> 04:14:58.969 align:start position:0%
and
um

04:14:58.969 --> 04:14:58.979 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:15:01.010 --> 04:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
uh the town I'm going to keep one of
 
04:15:01.020 --> 04:15:03.769 align:start position:0%
uh the town I'm going to keep one of
these

04:15:03.769 --> 04:15:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:05.630 --> 04:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
he's about to pass a letter that wasn't
 
04:15:07.490 --> 04:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
sent to the dot it was sent to a private
 
04:15:08.929 --> 04:15:08.939 align:start position:0%
contractor while I was under a
 
04:15:10.610 --> 04:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
non-exclosure agreement that's the
 
04:15:12.349 --> 04:15:12.359 align:start position:0%
letter he's going to pass you out and I
 
04:15:14.030 --> 04:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
have a problem I've never been released
 
04:15:15.889 --> 04:15:15.899 align:start position:0%
from the NBA they aren't even supposed
 
04:15:19.429 --> 04:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
to have it went to a private company
 
04:15:19.439 --> 04:15:24.410 align:start position:0%
to have it went to a private company
we

04:15:24.410 --> 04:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:26.990 --> 04:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
have to be oh it was an objection
 
04:15:34.910 --> 04:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:47.389 --> 04:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:49.189 --> 04:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
the letter I passed out to the normal
 
04:15:52.370 --> 04:15:52.380 align:start position:0%
letter that sent from the brca
 
04:15:52.380 --> 04:16:09.670 align:start position:0%
letter that sent from the brca
um

04:16:09.670 --> 04:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:14.210 --> 04:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:16.729 --> 04:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
um let's see
 
04:16:16.739 --> 04:16:17.750 align:start position:0%
um let's see
um

04:16:17.750 --> 04:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:20.870 --> 04:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
there was mention of of uh the crosswalk
 
04:16:22.969 --> 04:16:22.979 align:start position:0%
and the direct route
 
04:16:25.189 --> 04:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
um between
 
04:16:25.199 --> 04:16:28.250 align:start position:0%
um between
um

04:16:28.250 --> 04:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:32.030 --> 04:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
that that people wouldn't use the
 
04:16:32.040 --> 04:16:34.130 align:start position:0%
that that people wouldn't use the
um

04:16:34.130 --> 04:16:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:37.189 --> 04:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
the trail under the river bridge the the
 
04:16:40.670 --> 04:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
alternative concept uh the crosswalk the
 
04:16:43.910 --> 04:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
surface Crossing at Folsom Road
 
04:16:43.920 --> 04:16:44.750 align:start position:0%
surface Crossing at Folsom Road
um

04:16:44.750 --> 04:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:47.330 --> 04:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
would be there if we didn't have a rail
 
04:16:49.670 --> 04:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
trail Crossing it's it's necessary for
 
04:16:52.729 --> 04:16:52.739 align:start position:0%
the sidewalks at uh to connect the
 
04:16:54.349 --> 04:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
sidewalk from the north side of Folsom
 
04:16:56.330 --> 04:16:56.340 align:start position:0%
road to south side of Folsom road so
 
04:16:58.070 --> 04:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
whatever option
 
04:17:00.769 --> 04:17:00.779 align:start position:0%
um whatever option is chosen whatever
 
04:17:03.050 --> 04:17:03.060 align:start position:0%
option is constructed the crosswalk
 
04:17:06.110 --> 04:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
across Folsom Road will be there it's
 
04:17:09.469 --> 04:17:09.479 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not subject to
 
04:17:13.910 --> 04:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
um uh you know a decision of one one
 
04:17:18.530 --> 04:17:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:18.540 --> 04:17:19.729 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:17:19.729 --> 04:17:19.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:17:21.950 --> 04:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:17:23.929 --> 04:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
the delays
 
04:17:25.550 --> 04:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
um the
 
04:17:28.250 --> 04:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
we put our pencils down
 
04:17:31.130 --> 04:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
um a while back as we got into uh
 
04:17:32.929 --> 04:17:32.939 align:start position:0%
additional discussions
 
04:17:32.939 --> 04:17:34.130 align:start position:0%
additional discussions
um over

04:17:34.130 --> 04:17:34.140 align:start position:0%
um over
 
04:17:35.990 --> 04:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
um the Alternatives
 
04:17:39.410 --> 04:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
um we've we've encountered some delays
 
04:17:42.469 --> 04:17:42.479 align:start position:0%
um if if we
 
04:17:45.110 --> 04:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
um change course again there'll be more
 
04:17:45.120 --> 04:17:46.670 align:start position:0%
um change course again there'll be more
delays

04:17:46.670 --> 04:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
delays
 
04:17:48.830 --> 04:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
um this is not this design is not being
 
04:17:50.990 --> 04:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
completed by
 
04:17:53.929 --> 04:17:53.939 align:start position:0%
um the dot it's being completed by
 
04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
Consultants hired by the dot to
 
04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
prosecute the design it would require
 
04:18:04.070 --> 04:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
change orders and it will require delays
 
04:18:05.809 --> 04:18:05.819 align:start position:0%
and overall delivery of the project
 
04:18:09.769 --> 04:18:09.779 align:start position:0%
that's just the fact so for someone to
 
04:18:13.550 --> 04:18:13.560 align:start position:0%
suggest otherwise is just incorrect
 
04:18:13.560 --> 04:18:18.769 align:start position:0%
suggest otherwise is just incorrect
um

04:18:18.769 --> 04:18:18.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:20.929 --> 04:18:20.939 align:start position:0%
I hate to put you on the spot but I
 
04:18:23.510 --> 04:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
can't resist I guess I'm taking a page
 
04:18:26.150 --> 04:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
out of the uh chairman Weiler Playbook
 
04:18:29.110 --> 04:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
on this because I I'm looking at again
 
04:18:32.210 --> 04:18:32.220 align:start position:0%
the proposed plan
 
04:18:35.809 --> 04:18:35.819 align:start position:0%
that shows a five percent grade the the
 
04:18:35.819 --> 04:18:37.309 align:start position:0%
that shows a five percent grade the the
alternative

04:18:37.309 --> 04:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
04:18:40.070 --> 04:18:40.080 align:start position:0%
route that circles around and again I
 
04:18:42.110 --> 04:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
hate to use it again spaghetti plant as
 
04:18:44.030 --> 04:18:44.040 align:start position:0%
it's been referred to
 
04:18:46.250 --> 04:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
and to me looking at that doesn't make
 
04:18:47.330 --> 04:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
any sense
 
04:18:49.429 --> 04:18:49.439 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't
 
04:18:51.650 --> 04:18:51.660 align:start position:0%
when you have an existing real Corridor
 
04:18:54.530 --> 04:18:54.540 align:start position:0%
that used to connect Manchester with
 
04:18:54.540 --> 04:18:55.910 align:start position:0%
that used to connect Manchester with
Lawrence

04:18:55.910 --> 04:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
Lawrence
 
04:18:58.670 --> 04:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
in putting some kind of whether it's a
 
04:19:01.670 --> 04:19:01.680 align:start position:0%
bridge or a tunnel or something
 
04:19:04.250 --> 04:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
in that existing railroad grade why
 
04:19:06.229 --> 04:19:06.239 align:start position:0%
anyone would propose
 
04:19:09.229 --> 04:19:09.239 align:start position:0%
something that I see to the right this
 
04:19:11.630 --> 04:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
trail that goes around and across
 
04:19:15.050 --> 04:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
private driveways and across a very busy
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
street it just I'm having a hard time
 
04:19:19.849 --> 04:19:19.859 align:start position:0%
getting my head around that
 
04:19:19.859 --> 04:19:22.309 align:start position:0%
getting my head around that
so

04:19:22.309 --> 04:19:22.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:19:22.319 --> 04:19:24.349 align:start position:0%
so
yes

04:19:24.349 --> 04:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:19:26.809 --> 04:19:26.819 align:start position:0%
representative Griffin I'm along with
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
that vein of thinking earlier one of the
 
04:19:30.239 --> 04:19:31.370 align:start position:0%
that vein of thinking earlier one of the
speakers

04:19:31.370 --> 04:19:31.380 align:start position:0%
speakers
 
04:19:33.469 --> 04:19:33.479 align:start position:0%
said that the Department of
 
04:19:36.650 --> 04:19:36.660 align:start position:0%
Transportation had never had the safety
 
04:19:39.830 --> 04:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
people look at the alternative plan I
 
04:19:41.689 --> 04:19:41.699 align:start position:0%
wonder if you'd like to comment on that
 
04:19:45.650 --> 04:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
yeah that the plan as proposed has been
 
04:19:45.660 --> 04:19:47.330 align:start position:0%
yeah that the plan as proposed has been
reviewed

04:19:47.330 --> 04:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
reviewed
 
04:19:50.510 --> 04:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
um it it meets ADA compliance there were
 
04:19:52.790 --> 04:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
some reviews that were done
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
um on the earlier alignments that
 
04:19:58.550 --> 04:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
required modification
 
04:20:00.769 --> 04:20:00.779 align:start position:0%
um and it was was mentioned earlier that
 
04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
you know we did a review and we didn't
 
04:20:05.090 --> 04:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
like what we saw and so we asked them to
 
04:20:06.889 --> 04:20:06.899 align:start position:0%
modify it to provide more sight distance
 
04:20:10.250 --> 04:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
to make improvements to a preliminary
 
04:20:12.469 --> 04:20:12.479 align:start position:0%
concept alignment
 
04:20:16.130 --> 04:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
um basically that could prove that we we
 
04:20:18.790 --> 04:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
could meet the grades necessary
 
04:20:24.790 --> 04:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
to uh have the trail go under the bridge
 
04:20:26.889 --> 04:20:26.899 align:start position:0%
Shields Brook bridge
 
04:20:29.809 --> 04:20:29.819 align:start position:0%
and it could be accommodated as with
 
04:20:32.330 --> 04:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
anything as we advance designs we
 
04:20:34.490 --> 04:20:34.500 align:start position:0%
fine-tune the design to make sure that
 
04:20:38.150 --> 04:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
it meets safety requirements and ADA
 
04:20:40.910 --> 04:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
requirements and there might be other
 
04:20:44.870 --> 04:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
things that will be modified before the
 
04:20:47.870 --> 04:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
project gets bid out that's that's the
 
04:20:50.269 --> 04:20:50.279 align:start position:0%
way this this works
 
04:20:52.130 --> 04:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
um and um
 
04:20:56.030 --> 04:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
so so we believe it's a safe design and
 
04:20:56.040 --> 04:20:57.110 align:start position:0%
so so we believe it's a safe design and
and

04:20:57.110 --> 04:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:20:58.429 --> 04:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
um we wouldn't put it out if we didn't
 
04:21:04.389 --> 04:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:06.290 --> 04:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
04:21:08.389 --> 04:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
um not to cut you short but there were a
 
04:21:09.710 --> 04:21:09.720 align:start position:0%
number of people that I think that have
 
04:21:11.150 --> 04:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
traveled from
 
04:21:13.070 --> 04:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
far away perhaps
 
04:21:13.080 --> 04:21:13.849 align:start position:0%
far away perhaps
um

04:21:13.849 --> 04:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:15.769 --> 04:21:15.779 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to get on to our next year
 
04:21:17.809 --> 04:21:17.819 align:start position:0%
we'll be holding another work session on
 
04:21:19.670 --> 04:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is obviously we've been given
 
04:21:22.010 --> 04:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
a lot of information to digest and look
 
04:21:24.110 --> 04:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
at a lot of questions have been brought
 
04:21:25.070 --> 04:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
up but
 
04:21:27.710 --> 04:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
any of you folks again recognizing that
 
04:21:30.469 --> 04:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
we will be holding another work session
 
04:21:32.630 --> 04:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
on this uh if you have like five minutes
 
04:21:36.170 --> 04:21:36.180 align:start position:0%

done yeah well we'll we'll schedule
 
04:21:44.750 --> 04:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
another work session we're over an hour
 
04:21:48.110 --> 04:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
into the next work session so to be fair
 
04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
to the people that are waiting for that
 
04:21:56.090 --> 04:21:56.100 align:start position:0%

Salem there's a little background of
 
04:22:14.330 --> 04:22:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:16.030 --> 04:22:16.040 align:start position:0%

I'm here today uh representing the
 
04:22:23.929 --> 04:22:23.939 align:start position:0%
organization called New Hampshire rail
 
04:22:25.969 --> 04:22:25.979 align:start position:0%
Trails Coalition but a little
 
04:22:28.189 --> 04:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
professional background on me why I have
 
04:22:30.530 --> 04:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
a real serious interest in this entire
 
04:22:30.540 --> 04:22:31.670 align:start position:0%
a real serious interest in this entire
project

04:22:31.670 --> 04:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
project
 
04:22:35.090 --> 04:22:35.100 align:start position:0%
I'm a certified bicycling instructor
 
04:22:37.250 --> 04:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
I have been working with DOT as
 
04:22:40.429 --> 04:22:40.439 align:start position:0%
volunteer for over 40 years there hasn't
 
04:22:42.410 --> 04:22:42.420 align:start position:0%
been a single project Mike ped related
 
04:22:45.050 --> 04:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
for maps safety brochures plans
 
04:22:47.150 --> 04:22:47.160 align:start position:0%
including the design of the Memorial
 
04:22:49.309 --> 04:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
Bridge connecting Portsmouth to Kittery
 
04:22:51.110 --> 04:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
that I have not been involved in along
 
04:22:53.150 --> 04:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
with others not just me alone
 
04:22:55.010 --> 04:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
and the input from the bicycling
 
04:22:57.349 --> 04:22:57.359 align:start position:0%
Community for DOT design has been a
 
04:22:59.450 --> 04:22:59.460 align:start position:0%
major factor in safety all the way
 
04:23:01.670 --> 04:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
through including on the Memorial Bridge
 
04:23:03.710 --> 04:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
the Belvedere is the bump outs that came
 
04:23:05.090 --> 04:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
from us in the bicycling Community
 
04:23:08.210 --> 04:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
talking with Dot and the design phase
 
04:23:10.729 --> 04:23:10.739 align:start position:0%
early on so again I just want to fast
 
04:23:12.170 --> 04:23:12.180 align:start position:0%
forward that I've been involved with a
 
04:23:14.170 --> 04:23:14.180 align:start position:0%
lot of things the dot for many years
 
04:23:16.910 --> 04:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
including the charter member what's
 
04:23:18.830 --> 04:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
known as the complete streets advisory
 
04:23:22.189 --> 04:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
committee with Sarah's at the pleasure
 
04:23:24.530 --> 04:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
of the commissioner okay this is not
 
04:23:26.030 --> 04:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
federally a state mandated this is
 
04:23:27.650 --> 04:23:27.660 align:start position:0%
within Dot
 
04:23:31.070 --> 04:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
I was appalled when I heard and learned
 
04:23:34.010 --> 04:23:34.020 align:start position:0%
October 28th of 21.
 
04:23:36.110 --> 04:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
that this tolerable plan that we had
 
04:23:39.530 --> 04:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
seen repeatedly throughout 2019 a
 
04:23:42.710 --> 04:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
10-year plan the gasset hearings as Mr
 
04:23:44.689 --> 04:23:44.699 align:start position:0%
Stamos said that goes around the state
 
04:23:46.670 --> 04:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
does some 20 yard meetings the asset
 
04:23:48.290 --> 04:23:48.300 align:start position:0%
plans are put forward look at a 10-year
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
plan we were shown hey guys we're
 
04:23:53.389 --> 04:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
putting a tunnel under the new 4A
 
04:23:55.910 --> 04:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
connector room it's there it's in print
 
04:23:57.790 --> 04:23:57.800 align:start position:0%
we saw that
 
04:24:01.090 --> 04:24:01.100 align:start position:0%
congratulations we didn't know until
 
04:24:03.290 --> 04:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
October 28th
 
04:24:05.830 --> 04:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
of 21.
 
04:24:08.030 --> 04:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
mysteriously the tunnel is going on
 
04:24:10.910 --> 04:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
how'd that happen
 
04:24:14.269 --> 04:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
that was so it's too late now it's out
 
04:24:16.429 --> 04:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
of the planning stage it's in design
 
04:24:19.790 --> 04:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
it's 25 design completed when we first
 
04:24:21.950 --> 04:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
heard about it what happened to public
 
04:24:24.650 --> 04:24:24.660 align:start position:0%
hearing oh there was a meeting between
 
04:24:27.229 --> 04:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
Dot and a few folks in Derry behind a
 
04:24:30.790 --> 04:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
closed door with the muzzle on
 
04:24:32.689 --> 04:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
confidentiality cause they couldn't talk
 
04:24:35.870 --> 04:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
about it and I'm on the same board as my
 
04:24:35.880 --> 04:24:37.189 align:start position:0%
about it and I'm on the same board as my
partners

04:24:37.189 --> 04:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
partners
 
04:24:39.590 --> 04:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
okay what is wrong with the spiritual
 
04:24:42.769 --> 04:24:42.779 align:start position:0%
so I went up wearing my safety hat
 
04:24:45.050 --> 04:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
I went back to complete streets advisory
 
04:24:47.630 --> 04:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
committee basically the chair of it
 
04:24:50.030 --> 04:24:50.040 align:start position:0%
bicycle safety group within the Bureau
 
04:24:52.070 --> 04:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
of Highway design
 
04:24:54.469 --> 04:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
and if I mentioned names right now but
 
04:24:55.910 --> 04:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
believe I know very well you know the
 
04:24:57.710 --> 04:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
building was after 40 years
 
04:25:00.170 --> 04:25:00.180 align:start position:0%
set 30 feet away from project manager
 
04:25:03.229 --> 04:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
same Bureau I said how could this happen
 
04:25:05.450 --> 04:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
this is totally unsafe I mean a
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
three-year-old the kids who showed up in
 
04:25:08.630 --> 04:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
the Derry Town Council meetings they're
 
04:25:09.710 --> 04:25:09.720 align:start position:0%
saying the same thing they're in
 
04:25:11.630 --> 04:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
wheelchairs how can we do all this this
 
04:25:13.610 --> 04:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense so I went to the
 
04:25:15.050 --> 04:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
bike safety group
 
04:25:17.450 --> 04:25:17.460 align:start position:0%
we were not consulted
 
04:25:20.090 --> 04:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
February of 21 I conducted a zoom
 
04:25:22.130 --> 04:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
meeting with DOT including the project
 
04:25:25.070 --> 04:25:25.080 align:start position:0%
manager was there why we don't talk to
 
04:25:26.210 --> 04:25:26.220 align:start position:0%
each other
 
04:25:29.510 --> 04:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
we work in silos we worked at Value
 
04:25:32.510 --> 04:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
engineering we are saving money
 
04:25:34.910 --> 04:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
what happened to the safety
 
04:25:37.370 --> 04:25:37.380 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about it I want to put
 
04:25:39.229 --> 04:25:39.239 align:start position:0%
it on the agenda for d.o.t's own
 
04:25:41.269 --> 04:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
complete streets advisor committee
 
04:25:43.969 --> 04:25:43.979 align:start position:0%
as a child member on that committee
 
04:25:47.090 --> 04:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
it was refused we cannot talk about it
 
04:25:50.030 --> 04:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
you cannot talk about it dot won't allow
 
04:25:52.429 --> 04:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
me to talk about it publicly in a
 
04:25:53.990 --> 04:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
recorded session with a subset
 
04:25:56.929 --> 04:25:56.939 align:start position:0%
Engineering Group D.O.T shut me down you
 
04:25:58.429 --> 04:25:58.439 align:start position:0%
cannot talk about it
 
04:26:00.830 --> 04:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
what is going on
 
04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
so bottom line
 
04:26:05.210 --> 04:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
just a point and again I value your time
 
04:26:07.610 --> 04:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
I don't want to Ramble On I've been too
 
04:26:08.990 --> 04:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
involved with this for so long I could
 
04:26:11.090 --> 04:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
really help on for an hour I won't but
 
04:26:13.670 --> 04:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
just take the basic concept if you have
 
04:26:16.849 --> 04:26:16.859 align:start position:0%
a 10 12 foot wide this is a 10 foot plan
 
04:26:19.729 --> 04:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
here but lady let us 12 feet wide if you
 
04:26:22.969 --> 04:26:22.979 align:start position:0%
have a thousand to 1500 people a day on
 
04:26:25.370 --> 04:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
all modes and we're talking about the
 
04:26:28.130 --> 04:26:28.140 align:start position:0%
overall concept that dot uses contact
 
04:26:30.729 --> 04:26:30.739 align:start position:0%
sensitive Solutions
 
04:26:33.590 --> 04:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
designed for the plant designed for what
 
04:26:35.570 --> 04:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
you built to build it for
 
04:26:38.389 --> 04:26:38.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of emphasis I give Dot credit Pitt
 
04:26:40.849 --> 04:26:40.859 align:start position:0%
standards the widening of I-93 projects
 
04:26:43.189 --> 04:26:43.199 align:start position:0%
well I went all the way back to the I-93
 
04:26:44.750 --> 04:26:44.760 align:start position:0%
trans investment study I was on that
 
04:26:45.769 --> 04:26:45.779 align:start position:0%
committee too
 
04:26:47.090 --> 04:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
it's great
 
04:26:48.530 --> 04:26:48.540 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to the bicycle
 
04:26:51.889 --> 04:26:51.899 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and support for it very
 
04:26:54.889 --> 04:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
very weak and honestly there was no one
 
04:26:58.130 --> 04:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
either Consultants or within dot or the
 
04:26:59.870 --> 04:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
bike pay Community or Federal Highway
 
04:27:02.450 --> 04:27:02.460 align:start position:0%
who have yet to this day had input for
 
04:27:04.130 --> 04:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
the safety aspects of this quote
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
spaghetti crew none
 
04:27:08.510 --> 04:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
and that can be confirmed with multiple
 
04:27:10.910 --> 04:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
people so again I appreciate your
 
04:27:13.370 --> 04:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
consideration the funding aspects allows
 
04:27:14.630 --> 04:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
you to slow in for the funding very
 
04:27:16.729 --> 04:27:16.739 align:start position:0%
quickly it's interesting to notice that
 
04:27:19.030 --> 04:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
project section A that's the major
 
04:27:21.050 --> 04:27:21.060 align:start position:0%
connector to 93 that's under
 
04:27:23.269 --> 04:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
construction now just go by today coming
 
04:27:25.130 --> 04:27:25.140 align:start position:0%
up from Salem
 
04:27:28.010 --> 04:27:28.020 align:start position:0%
that at a four million dollar overrun
 
04:27:30.170 --> 04:27:30.180 align:start position:0%
it was paid for mysteriously four
 
04:27:31.729 --> 04:27:31.739 align:start position:0%
million dollars came about to the
 
04:27:34.429 --> 04:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
overage in the first 48 Hours here we
 
04:27:37.130 --> 04:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
are talking about 750
 
04:27:38.689 --> 04:27:38.699 align:start position:0%
000 for the cost differential between
 
04:27:41.149 --> 04:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
the current plan which is totally unsafe
 
04:27:45.349 --> 04:27:45.359 align:start position:0%
and having the tunnel 750 000 on about
 
04:27:48.469 --> 04:27:48.479 align:start position:0%
104 110 million dollar project
 
04:27:51.729 --> 04:27:51.739 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense against 80 Federal 20
 
04:27:54.170 --> 04:27:54.180 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire toll credits is what's
 
04:27:55.849 --> 04:27:55.859 align:start position:0%
finding it Gary was not asked to do
 
04:27:58.910 --> 04:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
anything in one quick term that ladder
 
04:28:00.530 --> 04:28:00.540 align:start position:0%
that came down which we have a copy of
 
04:28:03.349 --> 04:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
from commissioner Bill cast it was
 
04:28:06.110 --> 04:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
December 14th 16th there were both
 
04:28:07.849 --> 04:28:07.859 align:start position:0%
saying that Dairy is going to be on the
 
04:28:09.950 --> 04:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
hook not only for the cost of the title
 
04:28:12.170 --> 04:28:12.180 align:start position:0%
but to rework the plans and because of
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
the delays that's got to extrapolate
 
04:28:16.130 --> 04:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
into maybe two to six million dollars of
 
04:28:18.590 --> 04:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
Larry taxpayers say no no can't go there
 
04:28:21.950 --> 04:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
I questioned that writing final point on
 
04:28:24.769 --> 04:28:24.779 align:start position:0%
again I have to get off the bandwagon
 
04:28:27.290 --> 04:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
here I know but still very quickly when
 
04:28:29.330 --> 04:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
it comes to the delays we're very
 
04:28:30.590 --> 04:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about delays and I don't know
 
04:28:33.490 --> 04:28:33.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:33.500 --> 04:28:35.050 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:28:35.050 --> 04:28:35.060 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:28:40.689 --> 04:28:40.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:44.330 --> 04:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
fair enough anyway just for the delays
 
04:28:46.849 --> 04:28:46.859 align:start position:0%
we have not only the delays for the
 
04:28:48.670 --> 04:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
reworking of the redesigned plans
 
04:28:50.990 --> 04:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
preliminary design engineering has now
 
04:28:54.110 --> 04:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
done 65 percent estimated to change the
 
04:28:56.269 --> 04:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
plans now as Vanessa May might take six
 
04:28:57.710 --> 04:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
to eight months
 
04:29:00.530 --> 04:29:00.540 align:start position:0%
what hasn't been stated is what is the
 
04:29:03.110 --> 04:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
delay to get the new federal approvals
 
04:29:05.570 --> 04:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
the environmental impact statements
 
04:29:07.490 --> 04:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection groups the
 
04:29:09.410 --> 04:29:09.420 align:start position:0%
flood plain Army Corps of Engineers all
 
04:29:11.330 --> 04:29:11.340 align:start position:0%
these people have to weigh in yet that
 
04:29:14.090 --> 04:29:14.100 align:start position:0%
approval process takes months
 
04:29:16.429 --> 04:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
and that is what mainly that five
 
04:29:17.809 --> 04:29:17.819 align:start position:0%
million dollars from the area of
 
04:29:19.490 --> 04:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
Londonderry if you look at that contract
 
04:29:21.290 --> 04:29:21.300 align:start position:0%
that was for the Environmental Studies
 
04:29:23.149 --> 04:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
primarily it wasn't for the construction
 
04:29:25.790 --> 04:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
it was studying the overall projects
 
04:29:27.710 --> 04:29:27.720 align:start position:0%
so take a look at the numbers see where
 
04:29:29.870 --> 04:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
we are and again
 
04:29:32.330 --> 04:29:32.340 align:start position:0%
I feel honestly D.O.T and the state
 
04:29:34.250 --> 04:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to pick up any part of
 
04:29:37.250 --> 04:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
the funding for this if needed yes if
 
04:29:39.290 --> 04:29:39.300 align:start position:0%
not let's see where that 4 million came
 
04:29:41.389 --> 04:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
from immediately that went into advanced
 
04:29:44.170 --> 04:29:44.180 align:start position:0%
section A of section
 
04:29:47.809 --> 04:29:47.819 align:start position:0%
130565 1365 a
 
04:29:48.950 --> 04:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:29:52.370 --> 04:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
thank you very much any questions
 
04:29:54.769 --> 04:29:54.779 align:start position:0%
seeing none of the representative in the
 
04:29:57.830 --> 04:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:00.530 --> 04:30:00.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you for your time
 
04:30:03.769 --> 04:30:03.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
quickly handles from distributionally
 
04:30:08.870 --> 04:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
yeah if you want to just hand them to Mr
 
04:30:11.090 --> 04:30:11.100 align:start position:0%
Hoffman there he'll make sure we get a
 
04:30:11.100 --> 04:30:21.710 align:start position:0%
Hoffman there he'll make sure we get a
copy

04:30:21.710 --> 04:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:23.689 --> 04:30:23.699 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good afternoon for your
 
04:30:25.370 --> 04:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
patience if you could state your name my
 
04:30:28.429 --> 04:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
name is Catherine prudholm O'Brien I'm a
 
04:30:30.769 --> 04:30:30.779 align:start position:0%
state representative from Derry I have a
 
04:30:32.210 --> 04:30:32.220 align:start position:0%
lot to say on this I have been walking
 
04:30:34.610 --> 04:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
those Trails for 30 years I walked them
 
04:30:37.370 --> 04:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
often my husband is a disabled veteran
 
04:30:39.189 --> 04:30:39.199 align:start position:0%
and when he had spinal fusion surgery
 
04:30:41.510 --> 04:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
walking on the trails was a big part of
 
04:30:43.030 --> 04:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
his recovery
 
04:30:48.469 --> 04:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
when I recently joined my friend with
 
04:30:51.170 --> 04:30:51.180 align:start position:0%
the uh with unrecumbent bikes with the
 
04:30:54.410 --> 04:30:54.420 align:start position:0%
VA uh associate I'm sorry the Veterans
 
04:30:57.050 --> 04:30:57.060 align:start position:0%
Administration uh
 
04:31:00.349 --> 04:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:03.110 --> 04:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
they would not they they would not be
 
04:31:05.510 --> 04:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
able to use the trail
 
04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
with this spaghettified design and
 
04:31:11.149 --> 04:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
they were very concerned about grades of
 
04:31:14.030 --> 04:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
say one or two percent over a mile and
 
04:31:15.649 --> 04:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
they absolutely wouldn't be able to use
 
04:31:17.750 --> 04:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
this this would be dangerous this is
 
04:31:19.670 --> 04:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous for them it's dangerous for
 
04:31:22.490 --> 04:31:22.500 align:start position:0%
bicyclists in general it's dangerous for
 
04:31:24.769 --> 04:31:24.779 align:start position:0%
mothers with strollers
 
04:31:26.929 --> 04:31:26.939 align:start position:0%
I don't like the spaghettified plan and
 
04:31:28.370 --> 04:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
I remember the first time I heard about
 
04:31:30.110 --> 04:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
it it was that same meeting that Mr
 
04:31:35.330 --> 04:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
Topham just spoke of it was the 10 28 21
 
04:31:38.269 --> 04:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
meeting at the town uh the municipal
 
04:31:40.130 --> 04:31:40.140 align:start position:0%
center in Derry and when I first saw
 
04:31:43.969 --> 04:31:43.979 align:start position:0%
that plan I was aghast I was aghast and
 
04:31:46.670 --> 04:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
I felt blindsided and I was very
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
concerned that I had missed something
 
04:31:51.050 --> 04:31:51.060 align:start position:0%
and I saw it and I said what the heck is
 
04:31:52.849 --> 04:31:52.859 align:start position:0%
this and I asked the engineer standing
 
04:31:56.030 --> 04:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
next to the plan what is this
 
04:31:59.630 --> 04:31:59.640 align:start position:0%
and he told me that was a crossing at
 
04:32:01.370 --> 04:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
Shield Brook I am familiar with Shield
 
04:32:03.710 --> 04:32:03.720 align:start position:0%
Brook it's a very small brook and it
 
04:32:06.250 --> 04:32:06.260 align:start position:0%
floods and at one point people had to be
 
04:32:08.570 --> 04:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
evacuated in an industrial park near
 
04:32:11.269 --> 04:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
there because of some flooding issues
 
04:32:13.849 --> 04:32:13.859 align:start position:0%
I was I couldn't wrap my head around how
 
04:32:16.610 --> 04:32:16.620 align:start position:0%
they would be putting a crosswalk down
 
04:32:16.620 --> 04:32:18.349 align:start position:0%
they would be putting a crosswalk down
there

04:32:18.349 --> 04:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:32:21.349 --> 04:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
I was also told over this whole uh
 
04:32:23.450 --> 04:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
process of trying to figure out what in
 
04:32:25.610 --> 04:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
the world happened and how we got here
 
04:32:27.469 --> 04:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
I was told I should be fighting I should
 
04:32:29.809 --> 04:32:29.819 align:start position:0%
have been fighting for the straight
 
04:32:31.969 --> 04:32:31.979 align:start position:0%
passageway a lot sooner and I should
 
04:32:33.710 --> 04:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
have been going to the 10-year plan and
 
04:32:35.570 --> 04:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
all those sorts of things in those
 
04:32:37.849 --> 04:32:37.859 align:start position:0%
meetings I'll tell you something myself
 
04:32:40.550 --> 04:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
and my community could not wrap our
 
04:32:41.750 --> 04:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
minds around
 
04:32:44.330 --> 04:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
having a crossing at Shield Brook that
 
04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
was something we didn't fight against
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
because we didn't know we had to fight
 
04:32:48.410 --> 04:32:48.420 align:start position:0%
against it
 
04:32:52.729 --> 04:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:55.849 --> 04:32:55.859 align:start position:0%
I feel Duty bound to be here and and
 
04:32:58.250 --> 04:32:58.260 align:start position:0%
express the will of my community if we
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
put this in if this is put in the
 
04:33:02.510 --> 04:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
community is going to be furious when
 
04:33:03.530 --> 04:33:03.540 align:start position:0%
it's done
 
04:33:06.349 --> 04:33:06.359 align:start position:0%
okay I've spoken to disabled people who
 
04:33:08.869 --> 04:33:08.879 align:start position:0%
are very busy they work all day they
 
04:33:10.490 --> 04:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
don't have an opportunity like you and
 
04:33:12.051 --> 04:33:12.061 align:start position:0%
me and I know we go to a lot of meetings
 
04:33:14.029 --> 04:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
and we we talk about this stuff at
 
04:33:15.949 --> 04:33:15.959 align:start position:0%
infant item that's kind of a luxury that
 
04:33:17.929 --> 04:33:17.939 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't have
 
04:33:20.631 --> 04:33:20.641 align:start position:0%
and I have a disabled friend who will
 
04:33:23.150 --> 04:33:23.160 align:start position:0%
probably be wheelchair bound soon
 
04:33:25.551 --> 04:33:25.561 align:start position:0%
and she's a guest and she's mad and
 
04:33:27.890 --> 04:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
she's asking me how did we get here
 
04:33:29.449 --> 04:33:29.459 align:start position:0%
and all I can tell her is I was
 
04:33:31.070 --> 04:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
blindsided too and every time I try to
 
04:33:34.429 --> 04:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
ask questions I am getting nowhere I I
 
04:33:35.689 --> 04:33:35.699 align:start position:0%
have called
 
04:33:37.970 --> 04:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
I have lots and lots of notes from every
 
04:33:39.410 --> 04:33:39.420 align:start position:0%
phone call I make but when I've called
 
04:33:41.390 --> 04:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
Safety officials at D.O.T nobody seems
 
04:33:43.609 --> 04:33:43.619 align:start position:0%
to know anything about this they don't
 
04:33:46.010 --> 04:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
know about it nobody knows Des doesn't
 
04:33:48.789 --> 04:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
know about it there is a
 
04:33:54.470 --> 04:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
Beaver damned pond Above This that is
 
04:33:56.689 --> 04:33:56.699 align:start position:0%
not on your on your
 
04:33:56.699 --> 04:33:57.949 align:start position:0%
not on your on your
map

04:33:57.949 --> 04:33:57.959 align:start position:0%
map
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
that feeds Shield Brook and should that
 
04:34:02.209 --> 04:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
break suddenly I don't know what's going
 
04:34:04.070 --> 04:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
to happen nobody has any answers about
 
04:34:04.080 --> 04:34:07.730 align:start position:0%
to happen nobody has any answers about
that

04:34:07.730 --> 04:34:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:10.189 --> 04:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
I am a violent crime Survivor
 
04:34:12.709 --> 04:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you something that bend is
 
04:34:14.330 --> 04:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
kind of scary
 
04:34:15.949 --> 04:34:15.959 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't want to go down there and
 
04:34:17.869 --> 04:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
that is a big that's a hill that's a
 
04:34:19.010 --> 04:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
hill I wouldn't want to go to down to
 
04:34:20.570 --> 04:34:20.580 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the hill and have a Bend
 
04:34:22.730 --> 04:34:22.740 align:start position:0%
to go into a bridge
 
04:34:25.730 --> 04:34:25.740 align:start position:0%
I mean a tunnel that I can't see I can't
 
04:34:27.709 --> 04:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
see from a long distance that would make
 
04:34:30.529 --> 04:34:30.539 align:start position:0%
me very nervous I wouldn't use it I live
 
04:34:32.029 --> 04:34:32.039 align:start position:0%
on the road
 
04:34:34.609 --> 04:34:34.619 align:start position:0%
I live on I live in Derry but the road
 
04:34:37.369 --> 04:34:37.379 align:start position:0%
that I live on goes into Windham
 
04:34:40.189 --> 04:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
and a previous speaker spoke about the
 
04:34:43.609 --> 04:34:43.619 align:start position:0%
tunnel under Route 93 going under North
 
04:34:46.131 --> 04:34:46.141 align:start position:0%
and southbound Lanes of Route 93 that
 
04:34:48.170 --> 04:34:48.180 align:start position:0%
was put in about three years ago and yes
 
04:34:50.150 --> 04:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
that's true there's very few people that
 
04:34:51.709 --> 04:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
use it a couple people in in the
 
04:34:56.330 --> 04:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:58.970 --> 04:34:58.980 align:start position:0%
if that could have been built for the
 
04:35:02.209 --> 04:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
people in the town of Windham why can't
 
04:35:04.551 --> 04:35:04.561 align:start position:0%
this straight pass-through be built in
 
04:35:04.561 --> 04:35:05.449 align:start position:0%
this straight pass-through be built in
Derry

04:35:05.449 --> 04:35:05.459 align:start position:0%
Derry
 
04:35:08.810 --> 04:35:08.820 align:start position:0%
that that tunnel that's in Windham on
 
04:35:11.810 --> 04:35:11.820 align:start position:0%
that old rail trail leads to Nowhere it
 
04:35:13.670 --> 04:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
is invisible unless you live in that
 
04:35:15.289 --> 04:35:15.299 align:start position:0%
neighborhood you don't know where it is
 
04:35:17.869 --> 04:35:17.879 align:start position:0%
on the side in my neighborhood
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
I can see it because I know my my street
 
04:35:22.250 --> 04:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
and I know where it is and I know the
 
04:35:24.170 --> 04:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
old rail trail crossing that's unpaved
 
04:35:26.150 --> 04:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
that's in the town of Windham on the
 
04:35:28.310 --> 04:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
other side of it it goes to a private
 
04:35:30.890 --> 04:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
daycare business there's no signage and
 
04:35:33.230 --> 04:35:33.240 align:start position:0%
when you are in when you go to the other
 
04:35:34.730 --> 04:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
side of it you'd think that this you're
 
04:35:36.289 --> 04:35:36.299 align:start position:0%
not supposed to be there that this is a
 
04:35:38.449 --> 04:35:38.459 align:start position:0%
private business and that you're maybe
 
04:35:40.670 --> 04:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
walking around kids and you're not
 
04:35:42.170 --> 04:35:42.180 align:start position:0%
supposed to be and making people nervous
 
04:35:44.510 --> 04:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't go there you would have no
 
04:35:47.449 --> 04:35:47.459 align:start position:0%
way of knowing that there was a tunnel
 
04:35:49.490 --> 04:35:49.500 align:start position:0%
there if you were on the other side of
 
04:35:52.310 --> 04:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
it so that is why nobody uses it what
 
04:35:53.869 --> 04:35:53.879 align:start position:0%
I'm asking for is a straight Passage
 
04:35:55.429 --> 04:35:55.439 align:start position:0%
through that thousands of people would
 
04:35:58.490 --> 04:35:58.500 align:start position:0%
use every week thousands
 
04:36:00.230 --> 04:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that's too much to ask
 
04:36:02.750 --> 04:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
for and thank you for your time I know
 
04:36:05.330 --> 04:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
that this meeting has gone over
 
04:36:07.010 --> 04:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony you're
 
04:36:08.810 --> 04:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions if there
 
04:36:11.449 --> 04:36:11.459 align:start position:0%
are any yes I hope I can answer them and
 
04:36:13.070 --> 04:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
if not I'm sure we can find someone who
 
04:36:13.080 --> 04:36:13.910 align:start position:0%
if not I'm sure we can find someone who
can

04:36:13.910 --> 04:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:36:17.029 --> 04:36:17.039 align:start position:0%
any questions hopefully
 
04:36:20.869 --> 04:36:20.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:22.910 --> 04:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
04:36:24.830 --> 04:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
if you could try to keep it as brief as
 
04:36:26.929 --> 04:36:26.939 align:start position:0%
possible again remembering that we'll
 
04:36:28.551 --> 04:36:28.561 align:start position:0%
have another work session on this bill
 
04:36:31.369 --> 04:36:31.379 align:start position:0%
next week we haven't pay attention to
 
04:36:35.029 --> 04:36:35.039 align:start position:0%

not sure if I can make it next week so
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
that that's why I'm asking for a little
 
04:37:14.689 --> 04:37:14.699 align:start position:0%
bit of time what I like to do is read in
 
04:37:17.150 --> 04:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
a letter for the record from the Windham
 
04:37:19.670 --> 04:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
rail trail Alliance and I will just talk
 
04:37:21.949 --> 04:37:21.959 align:start position:0%
briefly to the economic points uh that
 
04:37:24.051 --> 04:37:24.061 align:start position:0%
are in the study committee members of
 
04:37:26.750 --> 04:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
the committee founded in 2004 the
 
04:37:28.849 --> 04:37:28.859 align:start position:0%
Windham rail trail Alliance is dedicated
 
04:37:30.650 --> 04:37:30.660 align:start position:0%
to the development and management of
 
04:37:33.709 --> 04:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
this remarkable 4.6 mile section of
 
04:37:36.849 --> 04:37:36.859 align:start position:0%
abandoned rail bed uh as a paved rail
 
04:37:40.490 --> 04:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
trail and this is part of the Granite
 
04:37:42.051 --> 04:37:42.061 align:start position:0%
State rail trail which we're looking
 
04:37:45.289 --> 04:37:45.299 align:start position:0%
forward to completing at some point this
 
04:37:47.769 --> 04:37:47.779 align:start position:0%
section connecting with dairy and Salem
 
04:37:50.990 --> 04:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
offers 12 miles of continuous paved rail
 
04:37:53.869 --> 04:37:53.879 align:start position:0%
trail the longest in the state we also
 
04:37:57.709 --> 04:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
are home to a former b m Caboose the
 
04:38:00.051 --> 04:38:00.061 align:start position:0%
c-16 so we're happy to provide a nice
 
04:38:02.869 --> 04:38:02.879 align:start position:0%
recreational asset
 
04:38:06.170 --> 04:38:06.180 align:start position:0%
2022 is a tremendous year for our rail
 
04:38:06.180 --> 04:38:07.189 align:start position:0%
2022 is a tremendous year for our rail
counts

04:38:07.189 --> 04:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
counts
 
04:38:11.410 --> 04:38:11.420 align:start position:0%
um within a 13-day period we recorded
 
04:38:13.490 --> 04:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
5890 trips
 
04:38:16.970 --> 04:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
and with a daily average of 453
 
04:38:20.330 --> 04:38:20.340 align:start position:0%
and that use continues and continued
 
04:38:21.650 --> 04:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
through that year it was a coveted year
 
04:38:23.269 --> 04:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
so the numbers were high but right now
 
04:38:24.830 --> 04:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
the numbers are tremendously high as
 
04:38:28.310 --> 04:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
well we have a lot of parking issues if
 
04:38:30.170 --> 04:38:30.180 align:start position:0%
you look to the north of dairy there
 
04:38:34.670 --> 04:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
counts are 163 000 and that's in 2020.
 
04:38:36.590 --> 04:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
so if you know logically you can take a
 
04:38:38.029 --> 04:38:38.039 align:start position:0%
peek and say look at if you look North
 
04:38:40.310 --> 04:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
look South these numbers are going to be
 
04:38:42.949 --> 04:38:42.959 align:start position:0%
tremendous in Dairy and there's going to
 
04:38:44.869 --> 04:38:44.879 align:start position:0%
be a tremendous Economic Development
 
04:38:49.010 --> 04:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them via the rail trail
 
04:38:52.429 --> 04:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
we strongly believe that the tunnel is
 
04:38:54.709 --> 04:38:54.719 align:start position:0%
the appropriate method to keep the
 
04:38:56.689 --> 04:38:56.699 align:start position:0%
continuity of the trail and the
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
integrity and the safety I think the
 
04:39:02.750 --> 04:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
folks that have spoken uh behind me uh
 
04:39:06.109 --> 04:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
most uh are in favor of that position as
 
04:39:06.119 --> 04:39:06.949 align:start position:0%
most uh are in favor of that position as
well

04:39:06.949 --> 04:39:06.959 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:39:11.090 --> 04:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
and again in Windham we continue uh like
 
04:39:13.730 --> 04:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
to serve as the benchmark
 
04:39:15.769 --> 04:39:15.779 align:start position:0%
I'll be happy to answer questions for
 
04:39:17.929 --> 04:39:17.939 align:start position:0%
you now real quick I want to go through
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
the 2020 State rail plan and that
 
04:39:22.970 --> 04:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
there'll be a lot of information I know
 
04:39:25.429 --> 04:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
Mark mentioned it in the handout that I
 
04:39:27.470 --> 04:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
have I also have the URL this was
 
04:39:28.929 --> 04:39:28.939 align:start position:0%
completed in August
 
04:39:32.230 --> 04:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
that was sponsored and authored by dot
 
04:39:35.510 --> 04:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
it's 186 Pages
 
04:39:35.520 --> 04:39:36.769 align:start position:0%
it's 186 Pages
um

04:39:36.769 --> 04:39:36.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:38.750 --> 04:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
I wasn't
 
04:39:41.570 --> 04:39:41.580 align:start position:0%
um encouraged to make copies for you but
 
04:39:43.730 --> 04:39:43.740 align:start position:0%
this is the size of the document there's
 
04:39:46.490 --> 04:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of detail there which I believe uh
 
04:39:50.030 --> 04:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
you'll be able to look at it and get a
 
04:39:51.650 --> 04:39:51.660 align:start position:0%
lot of Snippets and information that's
 
04:39:53.270 --> 04:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
going to be helpful to you
 
04:39:56.270 --> 04:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
that rail plan was based on Senate Bill
 
04:40:00.110 --> 04:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
185 and myself and Bob rimall the
 
04:40:01.930 --> 04:40:01.940 align:start position:0%
president of the Londonderry Trail
 
04:40:05.030 --> 04:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
Alliance we worked with Senator Stiles
 
04:40:08.230 --> 04:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
and Carson on putting that bill together
 
04:40:10.850 --> 04:40:10.860 align:start position:0%
the committee was led by D.O.T was
 
04:40:13.730 --> 04:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
authored by Dot and there were five
 
04:40:18.110 --> 04:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
state agencies representing and also six
 
04:40:20.030 --> 04:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
Statewide organizations were part of
 
04:40:22.550 --> 04:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
that committee there were many hearings
 
04:40:25.970 --> 04:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
publicly held for the input
 
04:40:28.368 --> 04:40:28.378 align:start position:0%
the statement of purpose and I want to
 
04:40:30.230 --> 04:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
read this to you and I'll be wrapping
 
04:40:32.330 --> 04:40:32.340 align:start position:0%
this up this the ACT requires the
 
04:40:34.310 --> 04:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
development of a plan for the state rail
 
04:40:38.090 --> 04:40:38.100 align:start position:0%
trail system to ensure preservation and
 
04:40:40.430 --> 04:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
integrity of these assets into provide
 
04:40:43.010 --> 04:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
direction for future development
 
04:40:45.350 --> 04:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
in addition to dividing the role of the
 
04:40:47.030 --> 04:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation in
 
04:40:47.040 --> 04:40:48.530 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation in
preservation

04:40:48.530 --> 04:40:48.540 align:start position:0%
preservation
 
04:40:52.368 --> 04:40:52.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:54.170 --> 04:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
the plan will determine the best way to
 
04:40:56.868 --> 04:40:56.878 align:start position:0%
maximize the return on investment which
 
04:40:58.310 --> 04:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
is why I'm going through this section
 
04:41:01.970 --> 04:41:01.980 align:start position:0%
and leverage future investment in
 
04:41:04.670 --> 04:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
the state rail quarter assets
 
04:41:07.310 --> 04:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
and we'll determine how to engage towns
 
04:41:08.570 --> 04:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
cities and private rail trail
 
04:41:11.448 --> 04:41:11.458 align:start position:0%
organizations in these efforts now I can
 
04:41:13.970 --> 04:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
say there was reference to it to a
 
04:41:16.910 --> 04:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
tunnel that was installed under 93 and
 
04:41:19.430 --> 04:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
that is connected to a town-owned rail
 
04:41:21.350 --> 04:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
Corridor which was abandoned the state
 
04:41:24.170 --> 04:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
part of the Western National Nashua and
 
04:41:27.050 --> 04:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
Portland Trail Town owns it and we're in
 
04:41:29.330 --> 04:41:29.340 align:start position:0%
the process of developing that and I can
 
04:41:31.208 --> 04:41:31.218 align:start position:0%
say to the statement of purpose
 
04:41:33.410 --> 04:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
that that was the you know that was a
 
04:41:35.930 --> 04:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
Future Vision one of these criteria that
 
04:41:39.288 --> 04:41:39.298 align:start position:0%
dot is tasked with and that is to look
 
04:41:40.730 --> 04:41:40.740 align:start position:0%
to the Future
 
04:41:43.610 --> 04:41:43.620 align:start position:0%
when the widening of 93 occurred that
 
04:41:45.350 --> 04:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
was the time to do it it was a
 
04:41:48.550 --> 04:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
cost-effective time to build that tunnel
 
04:41:51.350 --> 04:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
the scope of the study
 
04:41:54.288 --> 04:41:54.298 align:start position:0%
uh and when you read that it'll talk to
 
04:41:56.330 --> 04:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
the inventory economic impact funding
 
04:41:58.868 --> 04:41:58.878 align:start position:0%
economic and prioritization of State
 
04:42:01.910 --> 04:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
Investments improving managing and
 
04:42:01.920 --> 04:42:03.050 align:start position:0%
Investments improving managing and
maintenance

04:42:03.050 --> 04:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
maintenance
 
04:42:06.650 --> 04:42:06.660 align:start position:0%
and I did attach uh to you with with you
 
04:42:08.110 --> 04:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
for you
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
summary of the counts in summary of the
 
04:42:14.050 --> 04:42:14.060 align:start position:0%
economic activity
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
specifically count uh showing you the
 
04:42:19.970 --> 04:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
activity between Londonderry and Windham
 
04:42:22.730 --> 04:42:22.740 align:start position:0%
because Dairy smack dab in the middle
 
04:42:25.310 --> 04:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
derry's numbers are not in here other
 
04:42:27.350 --> 04:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
than the economic they did combine it
 
04:42:29.750 --> 04:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
with Windham
 
04:42:32.410 --> 04:42:32.420 align:start position:0%
that is because the study was only
 
04:42:36.650 --> 04:42:36.660 align:start position:0%
pointed to state-owned corridors Dairy
 
04:42:38.090 --> 04:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
is not state-owned it's privately
 
04:42:41.030 --> 04:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
privately owned
 
04:42:43.788 --> 04:42:43.798 align:start position:0%
and I talk about the criteria and I
 
04:42:45.410 --> 04:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
won't go through them those points the
 
04:42:47.650 --> 04:42:47.660 align:start position:0%
six points you can read them on your own
 
04:42:50.990 --> 04:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
and I did include the last three pages
 
04:42:53.990 --> 04:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
are cut and paste of the actual the
 
04:42:57.830 --> 04:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
economic data that comes from that study
 
04:43:00.050 --> 04:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
and I'd be willing to be back next week
 
04:43:01.788 --> 04:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
if my schedule allows it but I'll
 
04:43:03.830 --> 04:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions that you may
 
04:43:03.840 --> 04:43:04.610 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions that you may
have

04:43:04.610 --> 04:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much for your
 
04:43:09.230 --> 04:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
testimony if you give a copy of that uh
 
04:43:12.230 --> 04:43:12.240 align:start position:0%
to Mr hoppin or you have right
 
04:43:19.430 --> 04:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:22.430 --> 04:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
all right we'll uh pay attention to next
 
04:43:24.708 --> 04:43:24.718 align:start position:0%
week's House calendar we'll reschedule
 
04:43:27.708 --> 04:43:27.718 align:start position:0%
this work session for next week
 
04:43:27.718 --> 04:43:32.090 align:start position:0%
this work session for next week
recess

04:43:32.090 --> 04:43:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:33.830 --> 04:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
that being it
 
04:43:38.150 --> 04:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:38.160 --> 04:43:40.190 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:43:40.190 --> 04:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:43:42.170 --> 04:43:42.180 align:start position:0%
we'll take a short break a five minute
 
04:43:42.180 --> 04:43:59.868 align:start position:0%
we'll take a short break a five minute
break

04:43:59.868 --> 04:43:59.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:59.878 --> 04:44:48.410 align:start position:0%
 
again

04:44:48.410 --> 04:44:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:48.420 --> 04:44:56.868 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:44:56.868 --> 04:44:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:45.770 --> 04:55:45.780 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:49.310 --> 04:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
all right chairman Weiler here we go
 
04:56:03.590 --> 04:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:05.868 --> 04:56:05.878 align:start position:0%
so we're at an extreme disadvantage
 
04:56:08.208 --> 04:56:08.218 align:start position:0%
because I see a number of the sponsors
 
04:56:11.090 --> 04:56:11.100 align:start position:0%
uh sitting at the table
 
04:56:11.100 --> 04:56:13.550 align:start position:0%
uh sitting at the table
yeah

04:56:13.550 --> 04:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:16.930 --> 04:56:16.940 align:start position:0%
Senator Weiler a senator
 
04:56:21.310 --> 04:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
I just did I just he said that last week
 
04:56:25.010 --> 04:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just getting even
 
04:56:27.050 --> 04:56:27.060 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler anything you'd
 
04:56:29.510 --> 04:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
like to add or representative evil I see
 
04:56:34.550 --> 04:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:38.750 --> 04:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
it is badly needed in 1976 they built a
 
04:56:40.128 --> 04:56:40.138 align:start position:0%
parking garage
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
and they said it's a 25-year life so in
 
04:56:45.410 --> 04:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
1992 we bought the building when it was
 
04:56:47.810 --> 04:56:47.820 align:start position:0%
up for sale from the bank
 
04:56:51.770 --> 04:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
and in 2005 we hired a
 
04:56:54.350 --> 04:56:54.360 align:start position:0%
and he's passing out pictures that came
 
04:56:55.448 --> 04:56:55.458 align:start position:0%
from that
 
04:56:58.490 --> 04:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
2005 we had a study to and it also
 
04:57:00.708 --> 04:57:00.718 align:start position:0%
included what was then
 
04:57:02.930 --> 04:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
and up another lot up for sale across
 
04:57:04.730 --> 04:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
the street from the police station which
 
04:57:06.410 --> 04:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
has since been sold and the new
 
04:57:08.628 --> 04:57:08.638 align:start position:0%
building's gone on it so
 
04:57:11.208 --> 04:57:11.218 align:start position:0%
the more we delay the worse it gets at
 
04:57:13.190 --> 04:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
least we're not talking about
 
04:57:15.530 --> 04:57:15.540 align:start position:0%
taking most of the space and I think
 
04:57:17.810 --> 04:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
most of the space for the Department of
 
04:57:20.448 --> 04:57:20.458 align:start position:0%
Justice which the last
 
04:57:20.458 --> 04:57:21.530 align:start position:0%
Justice which the last
um

04:57:21.530 --> 04:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:57:24.708 --> 04:57:24.718 align:start position:0%
session we've moved them moved the
 
04:57:26.930 --> 04:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice to a to another
 
04:57:29.390 --> 04:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
building about a mile away so
 
04:57:32.030 --> 04:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
they at the time the parking garage
 
04:57:34.430 --> 04:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
became an expansion of the Department of
 
04:57:36.050 --> 04:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
Justice which I didn't think was right
 
04:57:36.060 --> 04:57:37.490 align:start position:0%
Justice which I didn't think was right
but

04:57:37.490 --> 04:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:57:39.590 --> 04:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
they everybody got to the architect the
 
04:57:40.970 --> 04:57:40.980 align:start position:0%
city of Concord
 
04:57:43.910 --> 04:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
and the and the bank and everybody
 
04:57:47.208 --> 04:57:47.218 align:start position:0%
and doj and yet they called it the
 
04:57:49.368 --> 04:57:49.378 align:start position:0%
parking garage this legislative parking
 
04:57:50.810 --> 04:57:50.820 align:start position:0%
garage which I was a little bit miffed
 
04:57:52.430 --> 04:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
at but anyway
 
04:57:54.350 --> 04:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
I'm delighted to have this bill moving
 
04:57:58.448 --> 04:57:58.458 align:start position:0%
along and I hope we pass it thank you
 
04:58:01.368 --> 04:58:01.378 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative Weiler
 
04:58:04.670 --> 04:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
this uh document that I just handed out
 
04:58:07.070 --> 04:58:07.080 align:start position:0%
legislative parking garage
 
04:58:09.410 --> 04:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler actually provided
 
04:58:11.330 --> 04:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
this to me yesterday so he's been right
 
04:58:17.948 --> 04:58:17.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:25.330 --> 04:58:25.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:29.090 --> 04:58:29.100 align:start position:0%
that's not that yeah at all no don't
 
04:58:31.550 --> 04:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
forget you have to use your mics guys I
 
04:58:35.208 --> 04:58:35.218 align:start position:0%
representative cameras perfect yes so
 
04:58:37.250 --> 04:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
I'm just I looked at the front page here
 
04:58:39.310 --> 04:58:39.320 align:start position:0%
the um
 
04:58:43.910 --> 04:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
806 to 876 projected spaces who who
 
04:58:46.550 --> 04:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
would be allowed to use those spaces uh
 
04:58:48.830 --> 04:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
aside from the legislature
 
04:58:51.890 --> 04:58:51.900 align:start position:0%
state employees and at the time
 
04:58:54.350 --> 04:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
they were just going to enlarge doj
 
04:58:56.690 --> 04:58:56.700 align:start position:0%
which is in this building presently they
 
04:58:58.010 --> 04:58:58.020 align:start position:0%
were going to Lodge the building 20
 
04:59:00.410 --> 04:59:00.420 align:start position:0%
percent especially for them
 
04:59:02.990 --> 04:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
so the doj would have spaces and there
 
04:59:05.628 --> 04:59:05.638 align:start position:0%
were 15 spaces for the bank which was
 
04:59:08.150 --> 04:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
considered to still exist and then there
 
04:59:10.970 --> 04:59:10.980 align:start position:0%
were so many spaces for legislators and
 
04:59:13.190 --> 04:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
employees of the legislature
 
04:59:16.610 --> 04:59:16.620 align:start position:0%
and it also included a space across the
 
04:59:18.410 --> 04:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
street which we could have bought and
 
04:59:20.208 --> 04:59:20.218 align:start position:0%
didn't someone else has bought it and
 
04:59:22.010 --> 04:59:22.020 align:start position:0%
put a new building on it so that's even
 
04:59:23.810 --> 04:59:23.820 align:start position:0%
though you'll see it in the plan it's
 
04:59:25.368 --> 04:59:25.378 align:start position:0%
not part of the
 
04:59:27.890 --> 04:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
further question sure thank you Mr chair
 
04:59:32.510 --> 04:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh so would uh would the amount of
 
04:59:34.430 --> 04:59:34.440 align:start position:0%
spaces available accommodate all the
 
04:59:37.010 --> 04:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
legislature the Department of Justice
 
04:59:37.020 --> 04:59:38.690 align:start position:0%
legislature the Department of Justice
needs

04:59:38.690 --> 04:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
needs
 
04:59:40.690 --> 04:59:40.700 align:start position:0%
um and any other
 
04:59:44.030 --> 04:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
uh governmental agencies that may maybe
 
04:59:46.070 --> 04:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
nearby that need to use it
 
04:59:49.430 --> 04:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
in that plan yes and it also was
 
04:59:51.470 --> 04:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
expected to be used when we're not here
 
04:59:53.330 --> 04:59:53.340 align:start position:0%
which is almost six months of the year
 
04:59:56.330 --> 04:59:56.340 align:start position:0%
by the city of Concord city of Concord
 
04:59:58.070 --> 04:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to be able to have the free use
 
05:00:04.070 --> 05:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:06.470 --> 05:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative evil
 
05:00:09.170 --> 05:00:09.180 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair yes I am
 
05:00:12.708 --> 05:00:12.718 align:start position:0%
also a co-sponsor of this bill I feel
 
05:00:15.470 --> 05:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
like I've been living the legislative
 
05:00:17.868 --> 05:00:17.878 align:start position:0%
parking garage not quite as long as
 
05:00:20.270 --> 05:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler but for quite a
 
05:00:20.280 --> 05:00:21.590 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler but for quite a
while

05:00:21.590 --> 05:00:21.600 align:start position:0%
while
 
05:00:24.350 --> 05:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
um because I was on public works and we
 
05:00:26.510 --> 05:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
had to keep reassessing the situation
 
05:00:28.730 --> 05:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
with stores how much money to put into
 
05:00:30.890 --> 05:00:30.900 align:start position:0%
it I think we've been throwing good
 
05:00:33.110 --> 05:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
money after bad over there for a really
 
05:00:36.708 --> 05:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
long time and we really need to move
 
05:00:38.868 --> 05:00:38.878 align:start position:0%
ahead with this
 
05:00:42.128 --> 05:00:42.138 align:start position:0%
um so obviously I support it I guess
 
05:00:44.510 --> 05:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
this bill says it's going to be a
 
05:00:47.690 --> 05:00:47.700 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation
 
05:00:50.690 --> 05:00:50.700 align:start position:0%
my from the facilities committee and
 
05:00:53.868 --> 05:00:53.878 align:start position:0%
from looking at uh information in the
 
05:00:55.490 --> 05:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
legislative budget and unfortunately
 
05:00:57.890 --> 05:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
there's nobody here to talk about it I
 
05:00:59.930 --> 05:00:59.940 align:start position:0%
mean there are millions of dollars in
 
05:01:01.670 --> 05:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget
 
05:01:05.390 --> 05:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
and so I'm wondering why there's not
 
05:01:07.368 --> 05:01:07.378 align:start position:0%
some con there couldn't be some
 
05:01:09.890 --> 05:01:09.900 align:start position:0%
contribution where general fund dollars
 
05:01:13.390 --> 05:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
are short from the legislative budget
 
05:01:16.128 --> 05:01:16.138 align:start position:0%
so that was a question actually I was
 
05:01:18.170 --> 05:01:18.180 align:start position:0%
going to ask a little bit more about
 
05:01:21.590 --> 05:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
what we have in the legislative budget I
 
05:01:21.600 --> 05:01:22.310 align:start position:0%
what we have in the legislative budget I
mean

05:01:22.310 --> 05:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
mean
 
05:01:26.150 --> 05:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
I don't want it uh over State the case I
 
05:01:27.830 --> 05:01:27.840 align:start position:0%
thought it was something like 10 million
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
dollars we have probably closer to two
 
05:01:32.510 --> 05:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
or three oh okay well then I overstated
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
but you know you're right we have been
 
05:01:37.368 --> 05:01:37.378 align:start position:0%
carrying surpluses from year to year in
 
05:01:39.170 --> 05:01:39.180 align:start position:0%
the legislative budget not everybody
 
05:01:40.970 --> 05:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
gets to see it the fiscal committee
 
05:01:42.730 --> 05:01:42.740 align:start position:0%
quite often gets it put in front of us
 
05:01:45.590 --> 05:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
at our deliberations on a regular basis
 
05:01:49.730 --> 05:01:49.740 align:start position:0%
but we usually carry a surplus from year
 
05:01:52.250 --> 05:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
to year a lot of it went for these front
 
05:01:54.830 --> 05:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
steps recently but finally there's a
 
05:01:56.930 --> 05:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
little more in it now so yes we could
 
05:01:59.150 --> 05:01:59.160 align:start position:0%
possibly say 2 million is coming from
 
05:02:01.430 --> 05:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
the house side I know the Senate
 
05:02:03.110 --> 05:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't approve it because they already
 
05:02:05.990 --> 05:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
have all the spaces yeah well I mean it
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
maybe we could just
 
05:02:10.190 --> 05:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
um look a little bit more closely at the
 
05:02:13.250 --> 05:02:13.260 align:start position:0%
legislative budget and see what we think
 
05:02:16.610 --> 05:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
is a is a appropriate amount there and
 
05:02:18.890 --> 05:02:18.900 align:start position:0%
then the only other thing I would say is
 
05:02:21.470 --> 05:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
that coming from a public works
 
05:02:24.310 --> 05:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
background again when they're a capital
 
05:02:27.948 --> 05:02:27.958 align:start position:0%
projects of this sort there is some sort
 
05:02:27.958 --> 05:02:29.170 align:start position:0%
projects of this sort there is some sort
of

05:02:29.170 --> 05:02:29.180 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:02:31.310 --> 05:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
oversight from the capital budget
 
05:02:33.590 --> 05:02:33.600 align:start position:0%
overview committee I mean they sort of
 
05:02:35.390 --> 05:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
check in
 
05:02:40.368 --> 05:02:40.378 align:start position:0%
um on the project on its design progress
 
05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
just to see and and I wasn't sure in a
 
05:02:46.010 --> 05:02:46.020 align:start position:0%
bill that's a capital project that's
 
05:02:48.788 --> 05:02:48.798 align:start position:0%
coming through the finance committee
 
05:02:51.770 --> 05:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
what sort of oversight there was going
 
05:02:54.590 --> 05:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
to be for a big project like this so
 
05:02:57.890 --> 05:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
that was another question and honestly I
 
05:03:00.470 --> 05:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
don't I don't know the process here so I
 
05:03:02.750 --> 05:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
don't know when to really discuss these
 
05:03:04.910 --> 05:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
things and then the last thing I would
 
05:03:08.890 --> 05:03:08.900 align:start position:0%
say is I you know Das is in here I'm not
 
05:03:12.050 --> 05:03:12.060 align:start position:0%
exactly clear on the interface between
 
05:03:15.708 --> 05:03:15.718 align:start position:0%
Das and the management of a project of
 
05:03:19.670 --> 05:03:19.680 align:start position:0%
this magnitude and and the and the
 
05:03:21.650 --> 05:03:21.660 align:start position:0%
legislature I know we have the
 
05:03:23.708 --> 05:03:23.718 align:start position:0%
facilities committee
 
05:03:25.490 --> 05:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
as well
 
05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:34.128 --> 05:03:34.138 align:start position:0%
so those are my thoughts and maybe
 
05:03:36.770 --> 05:03:36.780 align:start position:0%
that's the type of thing that if we make
 
05:03:39.410 --> 05:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
a recommendation here that can be talked
 
05:03:42.770 --> 05:03:42.780 align:start position:0%
more about at the finance committee at
 
05:03:44.750 --> 05:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
the full committee level I I just don't
 
05:03:44.760 --> 05:03:46.610 align:start position:0%
the full committee level I I just don't
know

05:03:46.610 --> 05:03:46.620 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:03:48.350 --> 05:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I was hoping to have commissioner
 
05:03:50.030 --> 05:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus here
 
05:03:52.670 --> 05:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
um and Terry path but maybe they were
 
05:03:54.410 --> 05:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
here earlier they could have answered
 
05:03:56.090 --> 05:03:56.100 align:start position:0%
some of your questions but
 
05:03:58.250 --> 05:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
you're certainly
 
05:03:58.260 --> 05:03:59.650 align:start position:0%
you're certainly
um

05:03:59.650 --> 05:03:59.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:04:03.430 --> 05:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
allowed to submit an amendment to us
 
05:04:06.650 --> 05:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
once we find out what's in the
 
05:04:08.990 --> 05:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
legislative account Terry pav could have
 
05:04:10.550 --> 05:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
told us that right off the top of his
 
05:04:14.030 --> 05:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
head we can also include some a
 
05:04:16.368 --> 05:04:16.378 align:start position:0%
recommendation of oversight whether it's
 
05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
whoever you suggest
 
05:04:22.090 --> 05:04:22.100 align:start position:0%
because what we do here
 
05:04:24.708 --> 05:04:24.718 align:start position:0%
is make a recommendation of the full
 
05:04:26.448 --> 05:04:26.458 align:start position:0%
committee through an amendment process
 
05:04:28.788 --> 05:04:28.798 align:start position:0%
so if you wanted to add two million
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
dollars say to
 
05:04:33.650 --> 05:04:33.660 align:start position:0%
this and reduce it down to 23 million
 
05:04:35.150 --> 05:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
dollars of General funds you could do
 
05:04:36.230 --> 05:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
that in an amendment and then we'd
 
05:04:38.570 --> 05:04:38.580 align:start position:0%
present it to the full committee
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
so you're welcome to do that
 
05:04:44.330 --> 05:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I mean I guess if
 
05:04:47.330 --> 05:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
they were here I would ask them
 
05:04:50.510 --> 05:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
where the 25 million dollar amount came
 
05:04:53.750 --> 05:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
from ask about the plan I mean those are
 
05:04:56.448 --> 05:04:56.458 align:start position:0%
all sorts of specifics that we usually
 
05:04:58.550 --> 05:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
inquire about
 
05:05:02.030 --> 05:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
on a capital project of this nature and
 
05:05:04.550 --> 05:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
I guess I would also ask the status of
 
05:05:06.890 --> 05:05:06.900 align:start position:0%
the almost 10 million dollars that we
 
05:05:11.030 --> 05:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
invested previously on on moving doj
 
05:05:15.830 --> 05:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
over to the Granite whatever building so
 
05:05:18.110 --> 05:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
sorry I know I'm a co-sponsor of this
 
05:05:21.050 --> 05:05:21.060 align:start position:0%
bill but I did have a lot of questions
 
05:05:23.090 --> 05:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
now that's all right it's not a problem
 
05:05:24.948 --> 05:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
like you said earlier it's always good
 
05:05:26.330 --> 05:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
to ask questions
 
05:05:29.990 --> 05:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:33.610 --> 05:05:33.620 align:start position:0%
we can recess this to a day next week
 
05:05:37.128 --> 05:05:37.138 align:start position:0%
we'll put this first on our agenda as
 
05:05:39.410 --> 05:05:39.420 align:start position:0%
far as Bill hearings and then deal with
 
05:05:41.750 --> 05:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
the tunnel after that but I'm not sure
 
05:05:44.750 --> 05:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
the date yet without looking but if you
 
05:05:47.270 --> 05:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
want to get together representative Ebel
 
05:05:47.280 --> 05:05:48.110 align:start position:0%
want to get together representative Ebel
with

05:05:48.110 --> 05:05:48.120 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:05:50.990 --> 05:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and Terry path to work
 
05:05:51.000 --> 05:05:51.708 align:start position:0%

05:05:51.708 --> 05:05:51.718 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:05:53.628 --> 05:05:53.638 align:start position:0%
language that
 
05:05:56.750 --> 05:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
you're happy with that would be great
 
05:06:03.590 --> 05:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:05.930 --> 05:06:05.940 align:start position:0%

05:06:08.030 --> 05:06:08.040 align:start position:0%
discussion there all right great thank
 
05:06:08.040 --> 05:06:09.948 align:start position:0%
discussion there all right great thank
you

05:06:09.948 --> 05:06:09.958 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:06:12.708 --> 05:06:12.718 align:start position:0%
actually at 8 30 I think
 
05:06:15.170 --> 05:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
so I don't yeah
 
05:06:18.410 --> 05:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
brother yes representative yes Mr chair
 
05:06:20.030 --> 05:06:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I had one more question for
 
05:06:21.530 --> 05:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
chairman Weiler
 
05:06:24.530 --> 05:06:24.540 align:start position:0%
um you mentioned earlier that in the off
 
05:06:26.690 --> 05:06:26.700 align:start position:0%
sessions at the city of Concord would be
 
05:06:29.750 --> 05:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
using the garage would it ever be just a
 
05:06:31.190 --> 05:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
question for my constituents would it
 
05:06:33.350 --> 05:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
ever be open to the public to be used
 
05:06:35.990 --> 05:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
for its free parking space or does that
 
05:06:38.628 --> 05:06:38.638 align:start position:0%
ever happen yes I think that was part of
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
the if Concord had one of these street
 
05:06:43.910 --> 05:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
fairs like they frequently have they
 
05:06:46.368 --> 05:06:46.378 align:start position:0%
would want to use it for that and so you
 
05:06:47.690 --> 05:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
know that was one of the reasons they
 
05:06:49.250 --> 05:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
they'd say yes we want to be able to
 
05:06:52.610 --> 05:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
have the use of it and you know we
 
05:06:54.708 --> 05:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
leave the gate up or whatever whatever
 
05:06:58.368 --> 05:06:58.378 align:start position:0%
the we had for that so yeah
 
05:07:00.830 --> 05:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
and as a follow-up to your question one
 
05:07:03.110 --> 05:07:03.120 align:start position:0%
of the things that um we heard I think
 
05:07:04.490 --> 05:07:04.500 align:start position:0%
last week
 
05:07:06.650 --> 05:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
was it all the parking spaces that are
 
05:07:08.510 --> 05:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
taken like on Park Street and around the
 
05:07:10.490 --> 05:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
state house and the lob would no longer
 
05:07:12.770 --> 05:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
be occupied by legislators giving the
 
05:07:15.530 --> 05:07:15.540 align:start position:0%
public more access to these buildings so
 
05:07:18.650 --> 05:07:18.660 align:start position:0%
and more revenue for conquer right
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
well before representative McGuire has
 
05:07:24.430 --> 05:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
any questions we'll recap
 
05:07:27.350 --> 05:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
all right
 
05:07:30.708 --> 05:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
so all right we'll uh keep an eye to the
 
05:07:33.170 --> 05:07:33.180 align:start position:0%
calendar and we'll be back next week
 
05:07:33.180 --> 05:07:35.718 align:start position:0%
calendar and we'll be back next week
thanks
