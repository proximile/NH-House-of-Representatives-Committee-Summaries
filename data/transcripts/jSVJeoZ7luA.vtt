and I I would think that we would not
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
endorse it
 
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.350 align:start position:0%
endorse it
um

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:21.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
what I'm going to read well I read
 
00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:25.860 align:start position:0%
quickly so don't worry about the time on
 
00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:26.590 align:start position:0%
quickly so don't worry about the time on
it

00:16:26.590 --> 00:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:16:29.449 --> 00:16:29.459 align:start position:0%
I'm going to read somebody's Dennis
 
00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
Kelleher is co-founder of better markets
 
00:16:38.210 --> 00:16:38.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
and this is a description of somebody
 
00:16:44.509 --> 00:16:44.519 align:start position:0%
who actually knows banking
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure understands cryptocurrency
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
far better than most people in this room
 
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.490 align:start position:0%
far better than most people in this room
um

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:55.069 --> 00:16:55.079 align:start position:0%
let's talk about crypto some have been
 
00:16:57.889 --> 00:16:57.899 align:start position:0%
saying that crypto is dead now
 
00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
we obviously know it's not but as you
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
point out there are lots of people still
 
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:04.860 align:start position:0%
pushing it including politicians
 
00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:06.660 align:start position:0%
can you explain the relationship between
 
00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:08.459 align:start position:0%
crypto and the banking
 
00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:10.130 align:start position:0%
crypto and the banking
crisis

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:10.140 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:12.900 align:start position:0%
the entire crypto industry is by choice
 
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
this is his answer the entire crypto
 
00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:17.339 align:start position:0%
industry is by choice
 
00:17:20.929 --> 00:17:20.939 align:start position:0%
and design a largely Lawless industry
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
it's built on what they want to claim is
 
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
a financial innovation
 
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
but it's not really an innovation it's
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
just a new version of what the financial
 
00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
industry has been doing for decades and
 
00:17:33.059 --> 00:17:34.850 align:start position:0%
industry has been doing for decades and
decades

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
decades
 
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
which is coming up with different ways
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:41.400 align:start position:0%
offer and sell Financial products that
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
are either Securities or commodities
 
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
uh yet the crypto industry is claiming
 
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
oh no we're not a security and commodity
 
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
we're special new and unique and we want
 
00:17:56.390 --> 00:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
special new and unique treatment and
 
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:58.370 align:start position:0%
special new and unique treatment and
laws

00:17:58.370 --> 00:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
what they really want is as few
 
00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
regulations and laws as possible as they
 
00:18:06.529 --> 00:18:06.539 align:start position:0%
can use what is fundamentally a
 
00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
predatory business model
 
00:18:16.490 --> 00:18:16.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons we don't have any uh
 
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:23.700 align:start position:0%
have an even worse
 
00:18:26.029 --> 00:18:26.039 align:start position:0%
this came after the collapse of several
 
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
banks by the way so that's the timing of
 
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:29.510 align:start position:0%
banks by the way so that's the timing of
it

00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.070 align:start position:0%
it
uh

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
let's see I lost my place the reasons we
 
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:38.940 align:start position:0%
don't have even worse financial crash
 
00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:41.039 align:start position:0%
right now is because the banking
 
00:18:41.039 --> 00:18:42.289 align:start position:0%
right now is because the banking
regulators

00:18:42.289 --> 00:18:42.299 align:start position:0%
regulators
 
00:18:45.049 --> 00:18:45.059 align:start position:0%
and other Regulators have done a pretty
 
00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:47.460 align:start position:0%
good job of
 
00:18:50.409 --> 00:18:50.419 align:start position:0%
preventing crypto from getting
 
00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
interconnected with the core of the
 
00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:56.100 align:start position:0%
banks banking system up until now the
 
00:18:57.850 --> 00:18:57.860 align:start position:0%
crypto industry has really been running
 
00:19:00.529 --> 00:19:00.539 align:start position:0%
parallel to the core of the legitimate
 
00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:07.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
and it has not been interconnected
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
certainly not as much as the industry
 
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
has been attempting to do over the last
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
several years the problem is not just a
 
00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
lawless industry but a lawless industry
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's making a lot of money
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
and using hundreds of millions of
 
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:23.460 align:start position:0%
dollars in campaign contributions and
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
lobbying to buy elected officials and
 
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
other allies
 
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:28.860 align:start position:0%
like academics trade groups and the
 
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
media they've engaged in a massive
 
00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
lobbying campaign to get their special
 
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
interest put above the public interest
 
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:37.860 align:start position:0%
nothing illustrates that more than the
 
00:19:40.490 --> 00:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
fact that the crypto lost around 80 to
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
90 percent of its value in less than a
 
00:19:42.419 --> 00:19:43.430 align:start position:0%
90 percent of its value in less than a
year

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:43.440 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
and the mo and the Marquee names in the
 
00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:47.580 align:start position:0%
industry have turned out to be frauds or
 
00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:48.830 align:start position:0%
industry have turned out to be frauds or
criminals

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
criminals
 
00:19:51.169 --> 00:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
given that it should have been consigned
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
to the Dustbin of history but yet you
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:01.500 align:start position:0%
almost entirely but not only Republicans
 
00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
this is him seeking
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
the concur motion by the way that I'm
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
opposing is from the Democrat Party
 
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
just to make that clear
 
00:20:16.070 --> 00:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
just recently criticizing Regulators for
 
00:20:17.930 --> 00:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
protecting investors consumers in the
 
00:20:19.450 --> 00:20:19.460 align:start position:0%
financial system it's hard to understand
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
but for the amount of money they have
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
spent to capture Washington to hijack
 
00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
the agenda and to elevate their special
 
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:29.100 align:start position:0%
interests above the public interest
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
why is crypto so dangerous to the public
 
00:20:34.669 --> 00:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
interest to ordinary investors the
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
crypto industry is engaged in the offer
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
and sale of Securities and commodities
 
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
but they don't want to follow the rules
 
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:41.220 align:start position:0%
and laws that apply to every other
 
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
legitimate business in the United States
 
00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
when they offer to sell Securities and
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
commodities the core investor consumer
 
00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
and financial stability protections
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
so for example if you want to be a
 
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
broker dealer or a Clearinghouse or an
 
00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:56.940 align:start position:0%
exchange that deals in Securities and
 
00:20:58.909 --> 00:20:58.919 align:start position:0%
commodities in the United States you
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
have to register with the cftc I think
 
00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:02.820 align:start position:0%
that's the Commodities Commodities
 
00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.250 align:start position:0%
that's the Commodities Commodities
Financial

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
Financial
 
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
it's a Chicago outfit or the SEC you
 
00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
have to file periodic reports they come
 
00:21:11.090 --> 00:21:11.100 align:start position:0%
into your business to make sure that you
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
are doing things like keeping customers
 
00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:15.299 align:start position:0%
assets segregated that you are not
 
00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
misusing customers assets exactly FTX
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
and Sam bankman Freed's criminal
 
00:21:22.490 --> 00:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
Enterprise show the rot at the core of
 
00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:24.780 align:start position:0%
the end of the crypto industry in one
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
business unit they went they want to
 
00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
have an exchange a broker dealer a
 
00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
Clearinghouse a hedge fund and a
 
00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
property trading shop offering
 
00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
Securities and other services to the
 
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
public but without any of the
 
00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:37.740 align:start position:0%
regulations to eliminate for example
 
00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:39.780 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest or that require
 
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:41.580 align:start position:0%
them to know their customer and prevent
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
things like money laundering which is in
 
00:21:47.570 --> 00:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
the history of crypto where crypto
 
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
actually came from
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
uh every other legitimate Financial
 
00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
business in the United States follows
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
these very basic investor and customer
 
00:21:58.490 --> 00:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
protections and underlying these are
 
00:22:01.549 --> 00:22:01.559 align:start position:0%
very important stability protections but
 
00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
crypto says well
 
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:05.940 align:start position:0%
we don't want to because we're special
 
00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
and we're different and they are quite
 
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:08.990 align:start position:0%
and we're different and they are quite
different

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:09.000 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
the only way they're different is that
 
00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:12.539 align:start position:0%
crypto has been around for 14 years and
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
has no legitimate or socially useful
 
00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.190 align:start position:0%
has no legitimate or socially useful
purpose

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:18.240 align:start position:0%
the only thing it has proof so far is
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
that it's good for is ransomware money
 
00:22:22.810 --> 00:22:22.820 align:start position:0%
laundering tax evasion funding
 
00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
narco-terrorists and Rogue States and
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
other illegal activities
 
00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:32.460 align:start position:0%
which is why all the trading is offshore
 
00:22:34.730 --> 00:22:34.740 align:start position:0%
and yet it was billed as the promise of
 
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
democrat democratizing Finance it was
 
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:39.780 align:start position:0%
supposed to help regular people Achieve
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
Financial equality to allow people of
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
color to climb the economic ladder
 
00:22:48.289 --> 00:22:48.299 align:start position:0%
the exact opposite has happened as we
 
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
have seen over and over again for
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
decades when somebody is claiming to be
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
in the business of democratizing Finance
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
helping communities of color and helping
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
poor people it's almost always the
 
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.909 align:start position:0%
poor people it's almost always the
opposite

00:22:58.909 --> 00:22:58.919 align:start position:0%
opposite
 
00:23:01.190 --> 00:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
that's crypto many have lost lots of
 
00:23:02.930 --> 00:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
money that they couldn't afford to lose
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
and that money that money which adds up
 
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
to billions and billions of dollars
 
00:23:14.029 --> 00:23:14.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:16.020 align:start position:0%
one study showed that somewhere in the
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of 60 to 70 percent of
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
crypto transactions are done by people
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
with annual incomes of fifty thousand
 
00:23:24.049 --> 00:23:24.059 align:start position:0%
dollars or below
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
they're being sold a marketing Ploy of
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
great riches and low risk which is not
 
00:23:28.559 --> 00:23:32.810 align:start position:0%
great riches and low risk which is not
true

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.370 --> 00:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
I could go on
 
00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:36.900 align:start position:0%
but the fact of the matter is
 
00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is that I'm what
 
00:23:42.409 --> 00:23:42.419 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to warn you all of is that
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
the crypto industry is to say the least
 
00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
not a good idea to embrace
 
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
we have a banking system we have
 
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
essentially a digital currency all
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
already called the dollar
 
00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
and it it's it's uh I think it's about
 
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
55 percent of every uh reserves held in
 
00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
the in capital banks in in National
 
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
Banks around the world so we're we're in
 
00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:11.460 align:start position:0%
very good shape we don't need another we
 
00:24:13.850 --> 00:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
know we don't need another currency
 
00:24:18.529 --> 00:24:18.539 align:start position:0%
and um so I just hope that you
 
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
put the final bullet in this BEAST's
 
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
head and and not concur with the
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
Democrat uh it said minor minor
 
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
differences and when I ever see that in
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
a in a statement with legislation in it
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
I always know it's anything but
 
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.210 align:start position:0%
I always know it's anything but
so

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:43.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.140 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker the committee non-concurs on
 
00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
the change to the bill because they
 
00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:19.850 align:start position:0%
the change to the bill because they
added

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:19.860 align:start position:0%
added
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
a part to do with how employees are
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
going to get paychecks in the form of
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
debit cards and
 
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.390 align:start position:0%
debit cards and
um

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:34.740 align:start position:0%
first of all we didn't consider that
 
00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
really appropriate to put on this
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
criminal justice Bill and second of all
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
we really couldn't figure out how an
 
00:26:42.049 --> 00:26:42.059 align:start position:0%
employee would be able to get all of his
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
money if he for example or she had 58
 
00:26:49.549 --> 00:26:49.559 align:start position:0%
cents left how do you how do you get
 
00:26:51.289 --> 00:26:51.299 align:start position:0%
that out of there uh tell our machine
 
00:26:54.110 --> 00:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
won't give you 58 cents and what happens
 
00:26:55.909 --> 00:26:55.919 align:start position:0%
to the money after so long does it go
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
back to the company where does it go and
 
00:26:59.690 --> 00:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
you start talking about tens of
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
thousands of people that's an awful lot
 
00:27:03.289 --> 00:27:03.299 align:start position:0%
of money that may go back to the company
 
00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:05.820 align:start position:0%
it just the bill didn't have a public
 
00:27:07.610 --> 00:27:07.620 align:start position:0%
Hearing in the house it's very
 
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:08.940 align:start position:0%
complicated it affects people's
 
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
livelihoods and how they get their money
 
00:27:13.430 --> 00:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
and I would ask the house to um
 
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
agree with the committee and vote to
 
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%

no matter where you were charged in the
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
country it would count as a second
 
00:28:18.169 --> 00:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
offense in New Hampshire instead of just
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
a second offense in New Hampshire which
 
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:23.400 align:start position:0%

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:38.340 align:start position:0%
personally for me I voted to support
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
this because as a parent I want access
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
to these so if I find something in my
 
00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
child's possession I want to know what
 
00:29:48.649 --> 00:29:48.659 align:start position:0%
he's or she is dealing with and I think
 
00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
just from a parent's perspective it's
 
00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:53.700 align:start position:0%
important it's all from a public safety
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
perspective very important that people
 
00:29:57.529 --> 00:29:57.539 align:start position:0%
can go somewhere and get a test done to
 
00:29:59.090 --> 00:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
make sure they know what they're dealing
 
00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:01.380 align:start position:0%
with it's bad enough that they have this
 
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
horrible disease that they're addicted
 
00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:03.549 align:start position:0%
horrible disease that they're addicted

sure that they're not being poisoned in
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
addition to the horrific substances
 
00:30:11.570 --> 00:30:11.580 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:31:00.230 --> 00:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues a few weeks ago I came in
 
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
front of you and we made a motion to
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
table a bill that was very similar to
 
00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
this and the reason was because we had
 
00:31:10.730 --> 00:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
sent very strong very agreeable language
 
00:31:13.549 --> 00:31:13.559 align:start position:0%
over to our friends over there and we
 
00:31:15.289 --> 00:31:15.299 align:start position:0%
asked you to table it because in the
 
00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
event that they
 
00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
screwed up the bill we could at least
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
have a chance to fix it and the good
 
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
news is is they actually made some
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
changes to their bill and these are all
 
00:31:27.409 --> 00:31:27.419 align:start position:0%
very agreeable there's just one thing
 
00:31:29.149 --> 00:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
that we did not get that we requested
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%

not apply to county or local boards and
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
it permits state boards to adopt
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
procedures which would allow one-third
 
00:41:14.329 --> 00:41:14.339 align:start position:0%

uh remote the only chain the only change
 
00:41:22.609 --> 00:41:22.619 align:start position:0%
of any substance that the Senate made to
 
00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
the to the proposal was to add language
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
that says remote participation it has to
 
00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
be under our version it has to be the
 
00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
the public has to be able to see and
 
00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:35.579 align:start position:0%
hear what's going on remotely the Senate
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
changed that to say they also need to be
 
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
able to participate that is to ask
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
questions or to testify if it was an
 
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
evidential hearing it seems to me it
 
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.060 align:start position:0%

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%

00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker uh colleagues this
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
uh bill which which we passed previously
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
uh simply deals with the situation of
 
00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:25.380 align:start position:0%
where uh public records have been uh
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
sealed for one reason or another one
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason or another uh but the
 
00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:32.280 align:start position:0%
question of arises as to whether after a
 
00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
period of time there's there's still a
 
00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
reason for sealing and this provides
 
00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
that uh that if if no determination has
 
00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:41.099 align:start position:0%
been made within 10 years of the
 
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
original ceiling than the the public
 
00:44:46.490 --> 00:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
body has to review it the Senate made no
 
00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:48.480 align:start position:0%
substantive changes to this bill at all
 
00:44:50.390 --> 00:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
it changed the language a little bit
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
actually to make it clearer but there's
 
00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
no substantive changes so I recommend we
 
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.030 align:start position:0%
no substantive changes so I recommend we
concur

motion of concur on HB 75 HB 75 was
 
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:45.420 align:start position:0%

00:45:47.329 --> 00:45:47.339 align:start position:0%
threshold of county-owned personal
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
property subject to competitive bidding
 
00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
it was it passed this house on the
 
00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
consent calendar after unanimous vote
 
00:45:56.450 --> 00:45:56.460 align:start position:0%
for municipal and County
 
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
in the body on the other side of the
 
00:45:59.870 --> 00:45:59.880 align:start position:0%
wall all of the language from the bill
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
the original bill was replaced with a
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
bill relative to the election of
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
Stratford County Commissioners
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
the amended bill is nearly identical to
 
00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:11.420 align:start position:0%
a bill retained in Municipal and County
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
HB 270 relative to the election of
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
Stratford County Commissioners
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues do not conflate the bill
 
00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
before you now with the product that
 
00:46:22.069 --> 00:46:22.079 align:start position:0%
will come out of the work on the
 
00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
retained Bill the purpose of retaining
 
00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:26.099 align:start position:0%
this billing committee is to allow the
 
00:46:28.130 --> 00:46:28.140 align:start position:0%
county delegation the full Municipal and
 
00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:30.540 align:start position:0%
County committee another stakeholders
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
the time to work through any issues and
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
find common ground
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
retaining a billing committee is a
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
well-established process that provides
 
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
significantly significantly more
 
00:46:44.290 --> 00:46:44.300 align:start position:0%
opportunity to create sound legislation
 
00:46:47.329 --> 00:46:47.339 align:start position:0%
than by merely adding what is for all
 
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:49.140 align:start position:0%
intent and purpose a non-germaine
 
00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment this committee can get input
 
00:46:52.670 --> 00:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
from the Secretary of State on the
 
00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
suggestion that the amended Bill
 
00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:56.940 align:start position:0%
represents redistricting outside of the
 
00:46:58.490 --> 00:46:58.500 align:start position:0%
prescribed the senior redistricting
 
00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:00.780 align:start position:0%
process the committee can discuss the
 
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
risks of creating a precedent whereby
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
Commissioners districts could be redrawn
 
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
at any time by any party
 
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
the committee will investigate the
 
00:47:11.750 --> 00:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
history of why Stratford County enjoys a
 
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
unique local control of electing their
 
00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
Commissioners at Large
 
00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:18.000 align:start position:0%
the committee will analyze the timing of
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
resetting the election cycle of
 
00:47:21.069 --> 00:47:21.079 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and the potential for
 
00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
expensive special elections because this
 
00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
this legislation would apply to the 2024
 
00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
election forcing two incumbent
 
00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
Commissioners to run against one another
 
00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:34.140 align:start position:0%
if no one from Stratford County sought
 
00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:35.819 align:start position:0%
these changes last year when the
 
00:47:38.210 --> 00:47:38.220 align:start position:0%
legislature redistricted all other
 
00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
elective offices to comply with the 2020
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
census then I submit that we have time
 
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:45.240 align:start position:0%
for a full and Frank discussion through
 
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
the retained Bill process opposing ASB
 
00:47:51.829 --> 00:47:51.839 align:start position:0%
75 now will ensure that the residents
 
00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
delegation representatives and
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
stakeholders of Stratford County will
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
have the best opportunity to discuss the
 
00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
election of Commissioners who will
 
00:48:02.329 --> 00:48:02.339 align:start position:0%
ultimately serve their County best
 
00:48:06.410 --> 00:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
please press the red button thank you
 
00:48:08.589 --> 00:48:08.599 align:start position:0%
representative yeah
 
00:48:10.970 --> 00:48:10.980 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I asked for a division vote
 
00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.230 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I asked for a division vote
okay

00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:14.329 --> 00:48:14.339 align:start position:0%
representative windsurcott is recognized

you Mr Speaker
 
00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
as you just heard the original HB 75 is
 
00:48:24.050 --> 00:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
actually going to be combined into
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
another bill that you're going to hear
 
00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:28.069 align:start position:0%
another bill that you're going to hear
shortly

00:48:28.069 --> 00:48:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:31.560 align:start position:0%
the contents of hb75 that you're voting
 
00:48:35.089 --> 00:48:35.099 align:start position:0%
on now was the original HP 270 that bill
 
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
was inadvertently retained in committee
 
00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
it had a full hearing
 
00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:42.050 align:start position:0%
it had a full hearing
okay

00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
had it not been we would have already
 
00:48:51.890 --> 00:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.690 --> 00:48:53.700 align:start position:0%
as we said the other body on the other
 
00:48:56.750 --> 00:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
side of the wall took HB 270 and placed
 
00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:00.540 align:start position:0%
it into 75. now I'm going to read you a
 
00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:03.920 align:start position:0%
current RSA and this is about
 
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
662-4 County Commissioner districts
 
00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:15.170 --> 00:49:15.180 align:start position:0%
goes on with a little bit more and then
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
says the county shall be divided into
 
00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:20.700 align:start position:0%
districts as follows so I'm going to
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
read you that first part again except
 
00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
for Stratford County
 
00:49:29.750 --> 00:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
Stratford county is the only County in
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
this state that does not have districts
 
00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:37.200 align:start position:0%
so how has this affected Stratford
 
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.170 align:start position:0%
so how has this affected Stratford
County

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:39.180 align:start position:0%
County
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
well I can tell you that that if you're
 
00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
not a city in the county
 
00:49:46.849 --> 00:49:46.859 align:start position:0%
you're almost considered second-class
 
00:49:46.859 --> 00:49:47.990 align:start position:0%
you're almost considered second-class
citizens

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
citizens
 
00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
towns such as Milton Middleton New
 
00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.190 align:start position:0%
towns such as Milton Middleton New
Durham

00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
Farmington Stratford Barrington Madbury
 
00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:00.420 align:start position:0%
Lee and yes even Durham
 
00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
our second thoughts to the criminal
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
current commissioners
 
00:50:07.130 --> 00:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
this bill would for the very first time
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
create districts
 
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
bringing Stratford County up to the same
 
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
standards as everybody else the other
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
nine counties in New Hampshire Equity
 
00:50:20.990 --> 00:50:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
now you may have received a email
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
from a lobbyist from the County
 
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
Association claiming that this was
 
00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:33.170 align:start position:0%
Association claiming that this was
unconstitutional

00:50:33.170 --> 00:50:33.180 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
that is factually incorrect when we
 
00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:38.940 align:start position:0%
first brought this bill forward we
 
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:41.220 align:start position:0%
approached the Secretary of State
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
and he indeed said it was
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional and legal as well as when
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
the individual on the other side of the
 
00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.750 align:start position:0%
the individual on the other side of the
wall

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
wall
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
placed the language into the spillwood
 
00:50:54.770 --> 00:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
debating now
 
00:51:01.370 --> 00:51:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
we heard
 
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:05.640 align:start position:0%
several times why not last term
 
00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
I can tell you about that because I was
 
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
one of the house members on the special
 
00:51:12.349 --> 00:51:12.359 align:start position:0%
committee for redistricting
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
um we had explained at the time that the
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
data due to covid was delayed from uh
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
forget if it was six seven eight months
 
00:51:23.809 --> 00:51:23.819 align:start position:0%
so we were working very diligently to
 
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:27.180 align:start position:0%
try to get that done
 
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
and at that point it was brought up in
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
committee to do this but it was also
 
00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:35.220 align:start position:0%
decided in that committee that we would
 
00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
wait until a future date because we
 
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
didn't want to muddy The Waters at that
 
00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.370 align:start position:0%
didn't want to muddy The Waters at that
time

00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:46.380 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to give you an analogy of
 
00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.710 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to give you an analogy of
why

00:51:47.710 --> 00:51:47.720 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
every County deserves
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
districts for their commissioners
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
take your county that you're in I don't
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
care which county it is
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
and assume that all your state reps
 
00:52:08.150 --> 00:52:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to just pick one off the
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
top of my head
 
00:52:13.790 --> 00:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
I'll use Hillsboro
 
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro has 123 reps
 
00:52:21.589 --> 00:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
if you elected that entire County at
 
00:52:25.430 --> 00:52:25.440 align:start position:0%
large without districts where do you
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
imagine the majority of those reps would
 
00:52:30.530 --> 00:52:30.540 align:start position:0%
come from
 
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
could you say the large cities
 
00:52:37.730 --> 00:52:37.740 align:start position:0%
and all those towns on the outskirts
 
00:52:41.329 --> 00:52:41.339 align:start position:0%
of Nashua Manchester would see very very
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
few Representatives
 
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
if you're way out on the far-flung side
 
00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
of that and towns like Peterborough
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
you're not going to get reps
 
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
that's why
 
00:52:55.329 --> 00:52:55.339 align:start position:0%
Stratford County being the only county
 
00:52:58.190 --> 00:52:58.200 align:start position:0%
that does not
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
have districts deserves
 
00:53:03.410 --> 00:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
to be the same as every other nine
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
counties so I ask that you would concur
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
on this Bill thank you Mr Speaker
 
00:53:10.190 --> 00:53:10.200 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to concur with
 
00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate on House Bill 75 and this is
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
a division vote members please take your
 
00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:53.150 align:start position:0%
a division vote members please take your
seats

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.160 --> 00:54:03.530 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:05.030 --> 00:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to concur with
 
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
the Senate on
 
00:54:09.049 --> 00:54:09.059 align:start position:0%
House Bill 75 this is a division vote
 
00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative grass is recognized for
 
00:54:21.049 --> 00:54:21.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
House Bill 270 which is the non-germaine
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
amendment to eligibility hb75 to allow
 
00:54:28.130 --> 00:54:28.140 align:start position:0%
further consideration and input from
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
parties in Stratford County
 
00:54:31.609 --> 00:54:31.619 align:start position:0%
and if I know for the last 50 years
 
00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:33.780 align:start position:0%
Stratford county has been recognized
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
throughout the state as well-managed and
 
00:54:38.089 --> 00:54:38.099 align:start position:0%
efficient government representing
 
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
citizens and taxpayers throughout the
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
county with its Commissioners elected
 
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
from both parties
 
00:54:45.829 --> 00:54:45.839 align:start position:0%
and many of the towns
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
towns for the last 20 years a town has
 
00:54:49.609 --> 00:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
always been represented
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
if I also know that the adage of if it
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
ain't broke don't fix it certainly
 
00:54:57.049 --> 00:54:57.059 align:start position:0%
applies here
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
and for I know that concurring on this
 
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
bill would open a Pandora's box of legal
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
challenges and possible yearly efforts
 
00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:05.220 align:start position:0%
to redistrict every time control of the
 
00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:07.859 align:start position:0%
legislature changed hands
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
if and I know that just weeks ago the
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
speaker remarked that history was made
 
00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
in bipartisan adoption and state budget
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
showing bipartisanship throughout this
 
00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.290 align:start position:0%
showing bipartisanship throughout this
house

00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:21.180 align:start position:0%
what I now vote to not concur on this
 
00:55:23.089 --> 00:55:23.099 align:start position:0%
highly political redistricting effort
 
00:55:26.089 --> 00:55:26.099 align:start position:0%
that would end this historic session on
 
00:55:27.530 --> 00:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
a very partisan
 
00:55:33.410 --> 00:55:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:35.329 --> 00:55:35.339 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn sarcast recognized
 
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:37.260 align:start position:0%
for parliamentary inquiry thank you Mr
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
Speaker if I know that this bill is not
 
00:55:43.609 --> 00:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
in fact redistricting but a districting
 
00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:45.900 align:start position:0%
of Stratford County Commission districts
 
00:55:47.809 --> 00:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
for the first time
 
00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:50.280 align:start position:0%
if I also know that Stratford county is
 
00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:52.140 align:start position:0%
the only County in our state of New
 
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that does not have districts
 
00:55:56.030 --> 00:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
for commissioners
 
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
if I also know
 
00:56:00.770 --> 00:56:00.780 align:start position:0%
if you happen to live in a small town in
 
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:03.180 align:start position:0%
a county and not in a city
 
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
like we are you are an afterthought
 
00:56:08.589 --> 00:56:08.599 align:start position:0%
and if I know that Equity fairness
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
common sense and representation demands
 
00:56:15.049 --> 00:56:15.059 align:start position:0%
that Stratford County be afforded the
 
00:56:17.210 --> 00:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
same rights as all the other nine
 
00:56:19.309 --> 00:56:19.319 align:start position:0%
counties in New Hampshire what I then
 
00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:22.140 align:start position:0%
support the motion to concur on the bill
 
00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
the question is on the motion to concur
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
if you're in favor of the motion press

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.640 --> 00:57:01.609 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:57:01.609 --> 00:57:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:04.930 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:09.530 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:14.329 --> 00:57:14.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
represent Perez I couldn't tell what
 
00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:28.140 align:start position:0%
have all members presence had an
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote the house will

185 in the affirmative 188 and the
 
00:57:39.049 --> 00:57:39.059 align:start position:0%
negative the motion fails
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
representative majority moves that we
 
00:57:42.890 --> 00:57:42.900 align:start position:0%

concur is actually the
 
01:08:10.190 --> 01:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
combining of three separate and very
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
very similar bills HP 87 HP 83 and hb75
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
for the most part without getting into a
 
01:08:20.510 --> 01:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
lot of detail it increases the amount of
 
01:08:23.269 --> 01:08:23.279 align:start position:0%
uh dollars that the County Commissioners
 
01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:27.450 align:start position:0%

thousand and one of them goes from 300
 
01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:37.500 align:start position:0%
to 3 000 still requires them to give an
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
explanation as to why they did it but it
 
01:08:41.930 --> 01:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
does raise the limit and I would ask
 
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:46.020 align:start position:0%

Bill 167 which this house itl'd
 
01:14:05.930 --> 01:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
about a month ago
 
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
that language creates a

advisory committee within the department
 
01:14:13.669 --> 01:14:13.679 align:start position:0%

now the house originally objected to
 
01:14:32.630 --> 01:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
that bill Senate Bill 167 because that
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%

hydrogen Energy Technologies we thought
 
01:14:47.689 --> 01:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
that was inappropriate this new language
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
in in House Bill 139 makes no mention
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%

ratepayer Investments
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
in addition it places into statute a
 
01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
definition of green hydrogen and that
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
will allow the state to qualify for

01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:06.900 align:start position:0%
residential rate payer
 
01:18:08.810 --> 01:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
of compliance with the renewable
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard
 
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
now we've had enough bills in this
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
session that dealt with the renewable
 
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard
 
01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
so you all know what that is it's a
 
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:22.020 align:start position:0%
requirement that each utility get a
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
certain amount of the electricity that
 
01:18:26.209 --> 01:18:26.219 align:start position:0%
they buy on our behalf and sell to us
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
from renewable sources
 
01:18:31.149 --> 01:18:31.159 align:start position:0%
and I do want to remind you that
 
01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:33.780 align:start position:0%
renewable energy is the only kind of
 
01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.450 align:start position:0%
renewable energy is the only kind of
energy

01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:18:38.050 --> 01:18:38.060 align:start position:0%
resource that is native to New Hampshire
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
we certainly don't have any fossil fuels
 
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:47.390 --> 01:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
so in the Science Tech and energy
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
committee this year every one of our
 
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
state's utilities eversource Unitil
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
Liberty even the New Hampshire co-op
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
has told us that the growth of renewable
 
01:18:59.770 --> 01:18:59.780 align:start position:0%
energy most of it
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
installed behind the meter built with
 
01:19:05.209 --> 01:19:05.219 align:start position:0%
private money with some support from the
 
01:19:05.219 --> 01:19:06.970 align:start position:0%
private money with some support from the
RPS

01:19:06.970 --> 01:19:06.980 align:start position:0%
RPS
 
01:19:09.169 --> 01:19:09.179 align:start position:0%
significantly reduces daytime
 
01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
electricity demand across the region
 
01:19:15.110 --> 01:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
and thus lowers the market clearing
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
price of electricity every day saving
 
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
so specific to the content of this bill
 
01:19:28.550 --> 01:19:28.560 align:start position:0%
When government steps in and mandates
 
01:19:31.090 --> 01:19:31.100 align:start position:0%
that private companies provide certain
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
specific information to every one of
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
their customers that information
 
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
ought to be
 
01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.470 align:start position:0%
ought to be
complete

01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
complete
 
01:19:42.229 --> 01:19:42.239 align:start position:0%
balanced and accurate
 
01:19:45.649 --> 01:19:45.659 align:start position:0%
the information provided under
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
HP 251 would be none of those
 
01:19:53.630 --> 01:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
this bill would provide one-sided
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
that is incomplete information only
 
01:19:58.130 --> 01:19:58.140 align:start position:0%
about the costs
 
01:20:00.290 --> 01:20:00.300 align:start position:0%
and nothing about the benefits
 
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.070 --> 01:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
because the information on the bill
 
01:20:09.530 --> 01:20:09.540 align:start position:0%
a simple dollar figure labeled cost of
 
01:20:12.770 --> 01:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
RPS compliance would be one-sided and
 
01:20:17.510 --> 01:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
it would also be inaccurate because the
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
figure on everyone's bill would be the
 
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:25.260 align:start position:0%
average cost to reach rate payer not a
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
figure specific to that rate payer
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
so an apartment dweller would see a
 
01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
figure that's much larger than the
 
01:20:35.750 --> 01:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
annual average cost and the actual cost
 
01:20:38.689 --> 01:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
to them and the homeowner of a 3 000
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
square foot house would see a figure
 
01:20:42.649 --> 01:20:42.659 align:start position:0%
that's smaller than
 
01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:44.640 align:start position:0%
their actual cost
 
01:20:46.970 --> 01:20:46.980 align:start position:0%
so if this bill is adopted
 
01:20:48.649 --> 01:20:48.659 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire state government would
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
be requiring the utilities to put
 
01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:52.920 align:start position:0%
information on every rate payer's bill
 
01:20:54.410 --> 01:20:54.420 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year that is both
 
01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:55.850 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year that is both
incomplete

01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
incomplete
 
01:20:58.850 --> 01:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
and thus misleading and inaccurate
 
01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:01.980 align:start position:0%
and to top it off
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
I quote from the bill language the costs
 
01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
for the utilities to provide this
 
01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
information shall be recovered
 
01:21:11.870 --> 01:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
from Electric customers through that
 
01:21:15.290 --> 01:21:15.300 align:start position:0%
utilities distribution rates
 
01:21:17.149 --> 01:21:17.159 align:start position:0%
that just doesn't seem like very good
 
01:21:19.010 --> 01:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
public policy
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
and we should be doing better than that
 
01:21:25.490 --> 01:21:25.500 align:start position:0%
so please push the red button
 
01:21:30.169 --> 01:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
and vote no on concurrence with sp251
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:39.649 --> 01:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.410 --> 01:21:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
our friends on the other side of the
 
01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
wall made a few small changes to house
 
01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
bill 251.
 
01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
they clarified that the department of
 
01:21:55.130 --> 01:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
energy not the Public Utilities
 
01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:57.169 align:start position:0%
energy not the Public Utilities
Commission

01:21:57.169 --> 01:21:57.179 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
implements and oversees the requirements
 
01:22:02.930 --> 01:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
those changes are good changes
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
and I recommend that we concur with the
 
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
changes that the Senate May that the
 
01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
I will also say that this house passed
 
01:22:20.870 --> 01:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
this bill because it is good public
 
01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.850 align:start position:0%
this bill because it is good public
policy

01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:22.860 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:24.659 align:start position:0%
people want to know what they're paying
 
01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
for when they buy something
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
So when you buy electricity from your
 
01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
utility you'd like to know exactly what
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
you're paying for
 
01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
and this simple bill
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
requires that the utility tell you once
 
01:22:41.689 --> 01:22:41.699 align:start position:0%
a year
 
01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
approximately what you're pla paying to
 
01:22:46.610 --> 01:22:46.620 align:start position:0%
comply with the renewable portfolio
 
01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:49.669 align:start position:0%
comply with the renewable portfolio
standard

01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
it's no more complicated than that
 
01:22:53.990 --> 01:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to be an exact number to
 
01:22:56.090 --> 01:22:56.100 align:start position:0%
give you a good idea of what you're
 
01:22:56.100 --> 01:22:58.610 align:start position:0%
give you a good idea of what you're
paying

01:22:58.610 --> 01:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.830 --> 01:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
but it's important that we be
 
01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:02.390 align:start position:0%
but it's important that we be
transparent

01:23:02.390 --> 01:23:02.400 align:start position:0%
transparent
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
with the voters
 
01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
of our state
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
about what state government is requiring
 
01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:09.709 align:start position:0%
about what state government is requiring
them

01:23:09.709 --> 01:23:09.719 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:15.169 --> 01:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
so I urge you to
 
01:23:18.169 --> 01:23:18.179 align:start position:0%
support the original passage of House
 
01:23:22.130 --> 01:23:22.140 align:start position:0%
Bill 251 and to concur with the changes
 
01:23:26.090 --> 01:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
made by the Senate thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:23:29.390 --> 01:23:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:32.100 align:start position:0%
yes you may inquire representative
 
01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:33.850 align:start position:0%
yes you may inquire representative
Thomas

01:23:33.850 --> 01:23:33.860 align:start position:0%
Thomas
 
01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr speaker thank the member
 
01:23:38.689 --> 01:23:38.699 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh correct me if
 
01:23:41.149 --> 01:23:41.159 align:start position:0%
I'm if I'm wrong but doesn't state law
 
01:23:44.930 --> 01:23:44.940 align:start position:0%
already require the cost of this program
 
01:23:47.229 --> 01:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
to be put on your electric bill anyway
 
01:23:49.850 --> 01:23:49.860 align:start position:0%
except that it does it in cents per
 
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours and that this bill just
 
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
merely transforms it into dollars so
 
01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:04.010 --> 01:24:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's correct in fact the per kilowatt
 
01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:06.500 align:start position:0%
hour cost that is displayed on your bill
 
01:24:10.130 --> 01:24:10.140 align:start position:0%
gives every electric bill rate payer the
 
01:24:13.130 --> 01:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
opportunity to calculate the exact cost
 
01:24:15.229 --> 01:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
that he's spent over the course of the
 
01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
year if he desires to do so
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to concur with
 
01:24:25.390 --> 01:24:25.400 align:start position:0%
the Senate on House Bill 251
 
01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:27.420 align:start position:0%
representative Reynolds has requested a
 
01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
division vote this will be a division
 
01:25:13.850 --> 01:25:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:15.290 --> 01:25:15.300 align:start position:0%
questions whether concur with the
 
01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
senator on House Bill 251 and this is a
 
01:25:20.149 --> 01:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
division of a representative Corman is
 
01:25:24.770 --> 01:25:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:26.689 --> 01:25:26.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
if I know that
 
01:25:32.630 --> 01:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
misleading and incorrect information is
 
01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
worse than no information and that the
 
01:25:38.870 --> 01:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
amount that would be on the bill is
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
incorrect and misleading unless a
 
01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:44.219 align:start position:0%
customer has exactly the average amount
 
01:25:46.490 --> 01:25:46.500 align:start position:0%
over the entire state
 
01:25:49.070 --> 01:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the information
 
01:25:51.890 --> 01:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
presented is only about the cost of the
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
renewable portfolio standard and nothing
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
about the benefits would I then press
 
01:25:58.189 --> 01:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
the red button
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
against concurrent
 
01:26:02.810 --> 01:26:02.820 align:start position:0%
representative Vos is recognized for
 
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:05.820 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:33:45.830 --> 01:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
colleagues I I was not prepared to speak
 
01:33:48.050 --> 01:33:48.060 align:start position:0%
on this particular issue today because I
 
01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
thought we had an agreement uh
 
01:33:54.350 --> 01:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
beforehand to concur but at 9 55 this
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
morning we found out that a
 
01:33:58.189 --> 01:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
representative who we all have a great
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
deal of respect for told the leadership
 
01:34:02.570 --> 01:34:02.580 align:start position:0%
of our committee that he had some issues
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
with the language of the bill
 
01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
while I understand that there are always
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
things that we can do to improve the
 
01:34:13.010 --> 01:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
language of the bill five minutes before
 
01:34:15.229 --> 01:34:15.239 align:start position:0%
the house session where we are voting on
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
the bill is not the time to be making
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
your objections known
 
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
something else that I understand is that
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
there should be no room for illegal
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
defense in New Hampshire that uses a
 
01:34:29.570 --> 01:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
person's gender or sexual identity as a
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
reason to excuse the actions of a person
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
who was committed a crime against them
 
01:34:38.810 --> 01:34:38.820 align:start position:0%
if you feel the same way that I do
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
please support the position at the house
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
and the position of the Senate
 
01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
and vote against the motion to
 
01:34:47.930 --> 01:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
non-concur with the committee of
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%

01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn has recognized speak
 
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
in support of the motion and I would

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:10.450 align:start position:0%

01:35:10.450 --> 01:35:10.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
colleagues I Rise and the first thing I
 
01:35:17.090 --> 01:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
want to do is apologize to you because
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
representative Muse is right I did raise
 
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:21.780 align:start position:0%
this issue really at the last minute and
 
01:35:23.450 --> 01:35:23.460 align:start position:0%
candidly I have to tell you honestly
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
it's because I looked at the language
 
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
very carefully at the last minute and
 
01:35:30.350 --> 01:35:30.360 align:start position:0%
saw the problem
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
so let me let me explain to you what the
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
problem is it's on the Senate version of
 
01:35:36.530 --> 01:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:35:39.169 --> 01:35:39.179 align:start position:0%
um and the difficulty is this first of
 
01:35:41.030 --> 01:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
all I want to make it clear I have
 
01:35:44.390 --> 01:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely no problem with with the
 
01:35:46.910 --> 01:35:46.920 align:start position:0%
portion of the of the bill that is
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
designed to to eliminate the what has
 
01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
been referred to I guess in the in the
 
01:35:54.649 --> 01:35:54.659 align:start position:0%
committee as the gay Panic defense I
 
01:35:57.169 --> 01:35:57.179 align:start position:0%
think that is entirely appropriate
 
01:35:59.770 --> 01:35:59.780 align:start position:0%
but the problem is in the Senate version
 
01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
it does more than that
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
it goes on to say
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
after the language dealing with
 
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
eliminating the gay Panic defense so to
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
speak it goes on to say
 
01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
that provocation would not be recognized
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm quoting now if the defendant and
 
01:36:20.570 --> 01:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
the and the victim dated or had a
 
01:36:23.330 --> 01:36:23.340 align:start position:0%
romantic or sexual relationship so let
 
01:36:25.070 --> 01:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
me explain to you what I'm talking about
 
01:36:27.229 --> 01:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
and this has nothing I want to emphasize
 
01:36:30.410 --> 01:36:30.420 align:start position:0%
this this has nothing to do with gender
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
or gender identity at all so let me try
 
01:36:36.530 --> 01:36:36.540 align:start position:0%
to give you this example it has been the
 
01:36:39.110 --> 01:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
law in as far as I'm I know in England
 
01:36:42.490 --> 01:36:42.500 align:start position:0%
and in the United States for 500 years
 
01:36:45.649 --> 01:36:45.659 align:start position:0%
that that in the example I'm about to
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
give you if you if you committed a
 
01:36:51.950 --> 01:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
homicide you would be entitled to ask
 
01:36:55.070 --> 01:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
that the homicide be reduced from murder
 
01:36:58.250 --> 01:36:58.260 align:start position:0%
to manslaughter understand this is not a
 
01:37:01.070 --> 01:37:01.080 align:start position:0%
defense if you Prevail on the
 
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
provocation it does not mean that you
 
01:37:05.570 --> 01:37:05.580 align:start position:0%
walk away it simply means that instead
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
of being guilty of murder where you
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
could receive life imprisonment you're
 
01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
guilty of manslaughter where you could
 
01:37:14.689 --> 01:37:14.699 align:start position:0%
only wear the maximum sentences is 30
 
01:37:14.699 --> 01:37:15.770 align:start position:0%
only wear the maximum sentences is 30
years

01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:37:18.590 --> 01:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
so consider this situation
 
01:37:20.510 --> 01:37:20.520 align:start position:0%
and let to make it obvious what I'm
 
01:37:22.490 --> 01:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
talking about let's assume
 
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
that I am a transgender person and I
 
01:37:29.209 --> 01:37:29.219 align:start position:0%
have a long-standing relationship 20 30
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
years whatever with another transgender
 
01:37:34.010 --> 01:37:34.020 align:start position:0%
person and again this could be
 
01:37:35.930 --> 01:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
transgender it could be heterosexual it
 
01:37:37.810 --> 01:37:37.820 align:start position:0%
could be homosexual it doesn't matter
 
01:37:40.250 --> 01:37:40.260 align:start position:0%
that's the problem with this the last
 
01:37:42.709 --> 01:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
Clause of the bill so I'm a transgender
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
person I have a long-standing
 
01:37:46.669 --> 01:37:46.679 align:start position:0%
relationship with another transgender
 
01:37:49.250 --> 01:37:49.260 align:start position:0%
person and I come home from work one day
 
01:37:51.890 --> 01:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
and I find that the transgender person I
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
had a long-standing relationship with is
 
01:37:58.209 --> 01:37:58.219 align:start position:0%
in bed with a third transgender person
 
01:38:00.649 --> 01:38:00.659 align:start position:0%
and I kill
 
01:38:03.050 --> 01:38:03.060 align:start position:0%
I kill the person that I've had the
 
01:38:05.209 --> 01:38:05.219 align:start position:0%
long-standing relationship with
 
01:38:08.510 --> 01:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
under the law that has existed for many
 
01:38:10.370 --> 01:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
many many years
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
the the I as the defendant would be
 
01:38:15.530 --> 01:38:15.540 align:start position:0%
entitled to ask the jury to consider
 
01:38:19.570 --> 01:38:19.580 align:start position:0%
mitigation based on provocation
 
01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
this would do away with that and it
 
01:38:25.129 --> 01:38:25.139 align:start position:0%
makes it has nothing whatsoever to do
 
01:38:26.750 --> 01:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
with the issue of eliminating the gay
 
01:38:29.990 --> 01:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
Panic defense it would change 500 years
 
01:38:31.610 --> 01:38:31.620 align:start position:0%
of Law and I don't think that that's
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
what anybody intended but that would be
 
01:38:36.649 --> 01:38:36.659 align:start position:0%
what the result of this would be and
 
01:38:38.270 --> 01:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
there's been an argument suggesting that
 
01:38:39.649 --> 01:38:39.659 align:start position:0%
it could be interpreted that it's
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat ambiguous it could it perhaps
 
01:38:44.209 --> 01:38:44.219 align:start position:0%
could not be interpreted that way I
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
frankly say having done a lot of
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
interpretation of statutes over my
 
01:38:49.850 --> 01:38:49.860 align:start position:0%
career I don't think that that's correct
 
01:38:53.689 --> 01:38:53.699 align:start position:0%
but even if it could be argued that it's
 
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
ambiguous why would we want to pass a
 
01:39:00.410 --> 01:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
law that we know is ambiguous and that
 
01:39:03.050 --> 01:39:03.060 align:start position:0%
could have really bad unintended
 
01:39:05.450 --> 01:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
consequences why not go to the Senate
 
01:39:08.209 --> 01:39:08.219 align:start position:0%
and just say this is an easy fix we just
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
eliminate the Clause that I quoted to
 
01:39:13.129 --> 01:39:13.139 align:start position:0%
you it's a very easy fix it doesn't
 
01:39:15.590 --> 01:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
change the elimination of the gay Panic
 
01:39:17.810 --> 01:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
defense which I completely agree we
 
01:39:19.970 --> 01:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
should do and I know that there's been
 
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
some uh some lobbyists who have
 
01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
suggested that you know there would be
 
01:39:26.390 --> 01:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
terrible consequences if we eliminated
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
the gay Panic defense that's just flat
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
out wrong we should do that but we this
 
01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
goes too far unintentionally and for
 
01:39:38.149 --> 01:39:38.159 align:start position:0%
that reason I ask that you vote for a
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee of conference thank you very
 
01:39:41.390 --> 01:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
much Mr Speaker and I asked for a
 
01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:48.770 --> 01:39:48.780 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to non-concur
 
01:39:50.090 --> 01:39:50.100 align:start position:0%
request a committee a conference on
 
01:39:52.669 --> 01:39:52.679 align:start position:0%
House Bill 315 this will be a division
 
01:40:57.890 --> 01:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:00.890 --> 01:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:03.229 --> 01:41:03.239 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to request a
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
committee non-concur request committee
 
01:41:06.709 --> 01:41:06.719 align:start position:0%
conference on House Bill 315 and this is
 
01:41:09.050 --> 01:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
a division vote representative philio is
 
01:41:13.410 --> 01:41:13.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:15.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:41:15.590 --> 01:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:41:17.450 --> 01:41:17.460 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
01:41:17.460 --> 01:41:19.430 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
if

01:41:19.430 --> 01:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:41:22.070 --> 01:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
a states have adopted bills to ban the
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
gay Panic defense in identical form to
 
01:41:30.250 --> 01:41:30.260 align:start position:0%
HB 315 including to just name a few
 
01:41:34.850 --> 01:41:34.860 align:start position:0%
California Connecticut Hawaii Maine
 
01:41:38.990 --> 01:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
Nevada New Jersey Pennsylvania Rhode
 
01:41:42.470 --> 01:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
Island and Washington just to name a few
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
and their bills banned the gay Panic
 
01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
defense in identical form and never once
 
01:41:51.950 --> 01:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
never once has the argument raised today
 
01:41:54.350 --> 01:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
been brought up in those States and
 
01:41:56.689 --> 01:41:56.699 align:start position:0%
further Mr Speaker if I believe that the
 
01:41:59.050 --> 01:41:59.060 align:start position:0%
states are the Laboratories of democracy
 
01:42:03.050 --> 01:42:03.060 align:start position:0%
and that the results are in and all this
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
bill does is the gay Panic defense sent
 
01:42:07.370 --> 01:42:07.380 align:start position:0%
nothing more
 
01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I believe that
 
01:42:14.570 --> 01:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
each of us are truly created equal
 
01:42:17.810 --> 01:42:17.820 align:start position:0%
then odd I press the red button on this
 
01:42:20.330 --> 01:42:20.340 align:start position:0%
motion so that a better motion can be
 
01:42:23.629 --> 01:42:23.639 align:start position:0%
made thank you
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
representative Roy is recognized for
 
01:42:29.689 --> 01:42:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:32.209 --> 01:42:32.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
01:42:33.890 --> 01:42:33.900 align:start position:0%
know that I came in here this morning
 
01:42:36.290 --> 01:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
having already indicated I would concur
 
01:42:40.010 --> 01:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
with this bill and if I also know that I
 
01:42:42.169 --> 01:42:42.179 align:start position:0%
also found out five minutes before that
 
01:42:44.330 --> 01:42:44.340 align:start position:0%
there could be a legal problem and I
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
actually had a full head of hair when I
 
01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
got here this morning
 
01:42:53.090 --> 01:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
and I know that if there is any
 
01:42:56.209 --> 01:42:56.219 align:start position:0%
legitimacy to the argument that the
 
01:42:59.390 --> 01:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
chief executive might get advice not to
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
sign it would I not now take the time to
 
01:43:05.990 --> 01:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
just go over it with the other body to
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
make sure that it will be signed and it
 
01:43:11.209 --> 01:43:11.219 align:start position:0%
will go into law and there will be no
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences because if I
 
01:43:17.090 --> 01:43:17.100 align:start position:0%
also know Mr Speaker that I support this
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
bill I worked it through the committee
 
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
and I intend to see it become law would
 
01:43:24.530 --> 01:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
I now support the committee of
 
01:43:26.209 --> 01:43:26.219 align:start position:0%
conference so that we can make sure we
 
01:43:28.129 --> 01:43:28.139 align:start position:0%
get it right and it gets signed into law
 
01:43:31.729 --> 01:43:31.739 align:start position:0%
and before the summer it is the law in
 
01:43:33.709 --> 01:43:33.719 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I ask you to support the
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:38.990 --> 01:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
the question is whether or not concur
 
01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:41.639 align:start position:0%
request Committee of conference on House

01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
representative Leon moves that we
 
01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
non-concur request Committee of
 
01:45:39.060 --> 01:45:40.070 align:start position:0%
non-concur request Committee of
conference

01:45:40.070 --> 01:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:45:41.930 --> 01:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
representative Muse is recognized to
 
01:45:56.689 --> 01:45:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:59.209 --> 01:45:59.219 align:start position:0%
thank you colleagues I rise today to
 
01:46:01.729 --> 01:46:01.739 align:start position:0%
urge you to oppose the motion to
 
01:46:04.850 --> 01:46:04.860 align:start position:0%
non-concur with Committee of conference
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
what the amendment from the other body
 
01:46:08.810 --> 01:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
does is accomplish two things
 
01:46:10.910 --> 01:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
first of all it takes a useful bill with
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
wide support that would expand
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis providers and turns
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:24.850 --> 01:46:24.860 align:start position:0%
it adds the full text of SB
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
258. SB 258 is a bill that we retained
 
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
in the criminal justice and Public
 
01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
Safety Committee that this body has
 
01:46:35.450 --> 01:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
never had an opportunity to vote on and
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
there was a very good reason for that
 
01:46:40.430 --> 01:46:40.440 align:start position:0%
and that's because SB 258 as it came to
 
01:46:42.890 --> 01:46:42.900 align:start position:0%
our committee was a flawed bill with
 
01:46:45.709 --> 01:46:45.719 align:start position:0%
serious constitutional issues and an
 
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
even more serious price tag
 
01:46:51.410 --> 01:46:51.420 align:start position:0%
would this be 252 does is create a
 
01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
presumption of dangerousness that allows
 
01:46:55.850 --> 01:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
a person to be accused of certain crimes
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
to be held without bail for up to 36
 
01:46:58.320 --> 01:46:59.390 align:start position:0%
to be held without bail for up to 36
hours

01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
hours
 
01:47:01.370 --> 01:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
now while we all can agree that there
 
01:47:04.250 --> 01:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
are issues with our bail system there
 
01:47:07.129 --> 01:47:07.139 align:start position:0%
are ways to go about fixing these issues
 
01:47:09.050 --> 01:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
and fixing them in an amendment like
 
01:47:11.750 --> 01:47:11.760 align:start position:0%
this is not the way to do it
 
01:47:14.570 --> 01:47:14.580 align:start position:0%
the judicial system estimates SB 252
 
01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
which is the language incorporated into
 
01:47:19.010 --> 01:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
this bill now would lead to an
 
01:47:21.649 --> 01:47:21.659 align:start position:0%
additional 3 500 bail hearings
 
01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
in a system where we already have a
 
01:47:25.850 --> 01:47:25.860 align:start position:0%
shortage of Judges this is a number that
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
would require the hiring of four
 
01:47:29.930 --> 01:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
additional judges and four additional
 
01:47:32.510 --> 01:47:32.520 align:start position:0%
Court assistance at an unbudgeted cost
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
of close to five million dollars over
 
01:47:36.770 --> 01:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
the next three years
 
01:47:39.350 --> 01:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
on top of that it would also increase
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
the cost for the individ for the
 
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
Indigent defense system as well as
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
Transportation costs for sheriffs
 
01:47:48.290 --> 01:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
because we need a way of getting people
 
01:47:50.209 --> 01:47:50.219 align:start position:0%
back and forth to all of these
 
01:47:53.930 --> 01:47:53.940 align:start position:0%
additional hearings and we and all of
 
01:47:55.729 --> 01:47:55.739 align:start position:0%
those people are also going to need uh
 
01:47:57.290 --> 01:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
representation and some of them are
 
01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
Indigent so they're going to require
 
01:48:00.709 --> 01:48:00.719 align:start position:0%
Indigent services
 
01:48:03.169 --> 01:48:03.179 align:start position:0%
on top of that there's the fact that the
 
01:48:05.810 --> 01:48:05.820 align:start position:0%
current law already allows the court to
 
01:48:08.450 --> 01:48:08.460 align:start position:0%
detain any individual pre-trial
 
01:48:11.090 --> 01:48:11.100 align:start position:0%
the current law also allows prosecutors
 
01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
to challenge any release order that the
 
01:48:14.930 --> 01:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
court disagrees with
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
so instead of allowing the court to
 
01:48:18.590 --> 01:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
assess the facts in an individual case
 
01:48:20.930 --> 01:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
this bill the way that it's written
 
01:48:23.030 --> 01:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
would eliminate the Court's discretion
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
and replace it with a mandatory
 
01:48:29.450 --> 01:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:32.090 --> 01:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
despite these flaws the criminal justice
 
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
and Public Safety Committee decided to
 
01:48:36.410 --> 01:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
retain this bill as part of a good faith
 
01:48:38.090 --> 01:48:38.100 align:start position:0%
effort to try to fix it over the summer
 
01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
as part of an overall bipartisan effort
 
01:48:43.970 --> 01:48:43.980 align:start position:0%
to put all of the proposed solutions to
 
01:48:47.149 --> 01:48:47.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's troubled bail system on
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
the table so we can actually fix them in
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
a systemic way
 
01:48:53.810 --> 01:48:53.820 align:start position:0%
what the other body is doing by
 
01:48:56.570 --> 01:48:56.580 align:start position:0%
attaching SB 252 to a perfectly good
 
01:48:59.209 --> 01:48:59.219 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to impose its will on the
 
01:49:02.209 --> 01:49:02.219 align:start position:0%
house by imposing a solution on us and
 
01:49:04.850 --> 01:49:04.860 align:start position:0%
our constituents that is simply not
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time
 
01:49:10.850 --> 01:49:10.860 align:start position:0%
please give genuine bail reform a chance
 
01:49:12.890 --> 01:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
and give the criminal justice and Public
 
01:49:14.870 --> 01:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
Safety Committee the chance to do the
 
01:49:17.689 --> 01:49:17.699 align:start position:0%
bipartisan problem solving we all have
 
01:49:19.970 --> 01:49:19.980 align:start position:0%
agreed to do over the summer
 
01:49:24.649 --> 01:49:24.659 align:start position:0%
please vote no on this motion thank you
 
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
representative Leon's recognized speak
 
01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.370 --> 01:49:34.380 align:start position:0%
colleagues I stand here before you today
 
01:49:37.310 --> 01:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
to explain why House Bill 610 should
 
01:49:39.169 --> 01:49:39.179 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to proceed to a
 
01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
committee of conference the underlying
 
01:49:43.189 --> 01:49:43.199 align:start position:0%
Bill seeks to fix the unintended
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
discrimination against certain Health
 
01:49:46.729 --> 01:49:46.739 align:start position:0%
Care Providers and their patients
 
01:49:49.490 --> 01:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
regarding access to therapeutic cannabis
 
01:49:52.310 --> 01:49:52.320 align:start position:0%
today there are 89 patients in the
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
program with glaucoma and not a single
 
01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
one of them was certified by their
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
optometrist because optometrists aren't
 
01:50:01.129 --> 01:50:01.139 align:start position:0%
included in the position RSA that gives
 
01:50:02.270 --> 01:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
this power
 
01:50:03.709 --> 01:50:03.719 align:start position:0%
if you think back to the vaccine
 
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:06.360 align:start position:0%
optometrist bill this has a similar root
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
issue because those four groups of
 
01:50:11.090 --> 01:50:11.100 align:start position:0%
doctors are not in the position statutes
 
01:50:13.850 --> 01:50:13.860 align:start position:0%
unfortunately despite House Bill 610
 
01:50:16.490 --> 01:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
passing our committee unanimously and
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
passing on consent the other body
 
01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
decided to attach two other bills and
 
01:50:23.330 --> 01:50:23.340 align:start position:0%
hold these Health Care Providers and
 
01:50:25.669 --> 01:50:25.679 align:start position:0%
their patients hostage
 
01:50:27.590 --> 01:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
I agree with my friend from Portsmouth
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
about the inappropriateness of including
 
01:50:33.169 --> 01:50:33.179 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 252 on this bill
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that this body has been
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
dealing with this is an issue that
 
01:50:39.890 --> 01:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
criminal justice plans to work on
 
01:50:41.510 --> 01:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
through the fall
 
01:50:43.189 --> 01:50:43.199 align:start position:0%
if we proceed to a committee of
 
01:50:43.199 --> 01:50:44.450 align:start position:0%
if we proceed to a committee of
conference

01:50:44.450 --> 01:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
conference
 
01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 252 is a non-starter within
 
01:50:49.370 --> 01:50:49.380 align:start position:0%
an agreement but we need to give the
 
01:50:52.010 --> 01:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
Senate the ability to back off that
 
01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
Amendment and to not do a disservice to
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
these Health Care Providers and their
 
01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:57.950 align:start position:0%
these Health Care Providers and their
patients

01:50:57.950 --> 01:50:57.960 align:start position:0%
patients
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
there's another bill that's been
 
01:51:02.209 --> 01:51:02.219 align:start position:0%
attached as well that's Senate bill 180.
 
01:51:04.850 --> 01:51:04.860 align:start position:0%
that deals with some of the labeling and
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
educational materials and it gives some
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
power that already exists within the
 
01:51:10.850 --> 01:51:10.860 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
01:51:13.850 --> 01:51:13.860 align:start position:0%
board and explicitly puts it into law
 
01:51:16.010 --> 01:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
there's another section too that a lot
 
01:51:17.510 --> 01:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
of people don't want to talk about but
 
01:51:19.310 --> 01:51:19.320 align:start position:0%
it doesn't I hear a lot of Rumblings
 
01:51:22.129 --> 01:51:22.139 align:start position:0%
about people not liking it back in the
 
01:51:25.129 --> 01:51:25.139 align:start position:0%
2018 Farm Bill there was an allowance
 
01:51:27.890 --> 01:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
for hemp as long as the THC Delta 9
 
01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:30.060 align:start position:0%
content was less than I think three
 
01:51:32.330 --> 01:51:32.340 align:start position:0%
percent point three percent I'm not
 
01:51:34.010 --> 01:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
exactly certain on that number but
 
01:51:36.350 --> 01:51:36.360 align:start position:0%
basically as long as a temp where you
 
01:51:39.229 --> 01:51:39.239 align:start position:0%
can't smoke it and receive the benefits
 
01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
it would be allowed there's a large CBD
 
01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
market and so there have been some
 
01:51:45.470 --> 01:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
synthetic cannabinoids that have been
 
01:51:47.629 --> 01:51:47.639 align:start position:0%
synthesized out of that those are in
 
01:51:49.070 --> 01:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
grocery stores
 
01:51:51.290 --> 01:51:51.300 align:start position:0%
there's definitely some labeling issues
 
01:51:53.629 --> 01:51:53.639 align:start position:0%
but adding this in as an amendment on
 
01:51:56.510 --> 01:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 180 and then on this bill is
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
also not appropriate there is a larger
 
01:52:02.149 --> 01:52:02.159 align:start position:0%
discussion on cannabis legalization and
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
going ahead and outlying these without
 
01:52:07.070 --> 01:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
having a larger solution would only send
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
users of this into the black market
 
01:52:11.570 --> 01:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
which is an overall harm
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
that that is actually attached to
 
01:52:14.689 --> 01:52:14.699 align:start position:0%
another bill as well so it's something
 
01:52:16.750 --> 01:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking at regardless
 
01:52:19.609 --> 01:52:19.619 align:start position:0%
but the biggest issue is who are we
 
01:52:21.649 --> 01:52:21.659 align:start position:0%
talking about here
 
01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
we have patients that have different
 
01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
different medical problems they're
 
01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:27.169 align:start position:0%
different medical problems they're
serious

01:52:27.169 --> 01:52:27.179 align:start position:0%
serious
 
01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:29.820 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are seeing a doctor an
 
01:52:33.169 --> 01:52:33.179 align:start position:0%
optometrist podiatrist a naturopath or a
 
01:52:35.689 --> 01:52:35.699 align:start position:0%
dentist who cannot certify them for the
 
01:52:38.209 --> 01:52:38.219 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patient program
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
so if you have glaucoma with elevated
 
01:52:42.590 --> 01:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
intraocular pressure one of those that
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
we have specifically called out as an
 
01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
indication for therapeutic cannabis
 
01:52:48.649 --> 01:52:48.659 align:start position:0%
you can't have your optometrist
 
01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
recommend you you need to go find
 
01:52:53.390 --> 01:52:53.400 align:start position:0%
another doctor we have 89 patients how
 
01:52:54.950 --> 01:52:54.960 align:start position:0%
many would we have if this was allowed
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
and how many people are just going to
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
the black market or crossing straight
 
01:52:57.960 --> 01:52:58.970 align:start position:0%
the black market or crossing straight
lines

01:52:58.970 --> 01:52:58.980 align:start position:0%
lines
 
01:53:00.890 --> 01:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
gets worse when we talk about serious
 
01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:02.229 align:start position:0%
gets worse when we talk about serious
pain

01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
pain
 
01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
podiatrists and dentists deal with
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
people who have failed surgery and are
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
still in severe intractable pain
 
01:53:11.870 --> 01:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
opioids are an option cannabis should be
 
01:53:13.310 --> 01:53:13.320 align:start position:0%
an option too
 
01:53:15.590 --> 01:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis is no cure-all but it's an
 
01:53:17.570 --> 01:53:17.580 align:start position:0%
option for some patients and it
 
01:53:19.490 --> 01:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be denied because of who they
 
01:53:22.370 --> 01:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
see on a regular basis
 
01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
it is discrimination to exclude
 
01:53:27.890 --> 01:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
naturopaths a dentist optometrist and
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
podiatrists while Physicians advanced
 
01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
practice registered nurses and physician
 
01:53:35.330 --> 01:53:35.340 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistants are allowed to
 
01:53:37.729 --> 01:53:37.739 align:start position:0%
certify a patient for cannabis let's fix
 
01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
this by voting yes
 
01:53:43.010 --> 01:53:43.020 align:start position:0%
this also impacts kids
 
01:53:45.410 --> 01:53:45.420 align:start position:0%
they need two providers to sign off and
 
01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
the language says one needs to be a
 
01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:48.410 align:start position:0%
the language says one needs to be a
pediatrician

01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
pediatrician
 
01:53:50.149 --> 01:53:50.159 align:start position:0%
the way it's interpreted today is that
 
01:53:52.189 --> 01:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
your pediatric oncologist counts as a
 
01:53:52.199 --> 01:53:53.450 align:start position:0%
your pediatric oncologist counts as a
pediatrician

01:53:53.450 --> 01:53:53.460 align:start position:0%
pediatrician
 
01:53:55.729 --> 01:53:55.739 align:start position:0%
your pediatric neurologist if you have
 
01:53:57.770 --> 01:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
seizures counts as a pediatrician
 
01:53:59.149 --> 01:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
because they looked at our legislative
 
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
intent my fear here is that if we vote
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
this down without a committee of
 
01:54:05.990 --> 01:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
conference that's going to be harder to
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
have that flexibility and we have kids
 
01:54:11.890 --> 01:54:11.900 align:start position:0%
that have epilepsy severe autism cancer
 
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
PTSD severe pain spinal cord injury and
 
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:18.360 align:start position:0%
traumatic brain injury that are on the
 
01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:21.900 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program right now
 
01:54:23.990 --> 01:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
anybody have a guess as to how many kids
 
01:54:26.689 --> 01:54:26.699 align:start position:0%
under 18 are on this program
 
01:54:28.490 --> 01:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
it's eight
 
01:54:31.370 --> 01:54:31.380 align:start position:0%
and there are
 
01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
let's see and there are 10 18 year olds
 
01:54:35.390 --> 01:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
who are on the program
 
01:54:36.709 --> 01:54:36.719 align:start position:0%
this limiting factor around
 
01:54:38.510 --> 01:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
pediatricians when a lot of these
 
01:54:40.490 --> 01:54:40.500 align:start position:0%
severely complex kids don't have a
 
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
pediatrician because quaint frankly
 
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
they're working with their pediatric
 
01:54:46.669 --> 01:54:46.679 align:start position:0%
oncologist to make it to their 18th
 
01:54:49.430 --> 01:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
birthday is yet another hurdle
 
01:54:52.250 --> 01:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
this is a very very important underlying
 
01:54:53.930 --> 01:54:53.940 align:start position:0%
bill that we should not let the Senate
 
01:54:55.490 --> 01:54:55.500 align:start position:0%
hold hostage
 
01:54:58.250 --> 01:54:58.260 align:start position:0%
we will uphold the house position of
 
01:55:00.109 --> 01:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
working through bail reform this fall
 
01:55:02.450 --> 01:55:02.460 align:start position:0%
and we will not let the Senate Bill 252
 
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
section pass
 
01:55:06.169 --> 01:55:06.179 align:start position:0%
looking for input as well on these
 
01:55:08.450 --> 01:55:08.460 align:start position:0%
synthetic cannabinoids I see a big
 
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
problem with outlawing it right now we
 
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:13.560 align:start position:0%
can talk about it in the overall scheme
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
but if today we do not approve this
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
request for a committee of conference it
 
01:55:22.370 --> 01:55:22.380 align:start position:0%
is on us to deny this access to patients
 
01:55:24.290 --> 01:55:24.300 align:start position:0%
and to continue an injustice against
 
01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:25.800 align:start position:0%
these providers
 
01:55:27.709 --> 01:55:27.719 align:start position:0%
I ask for your support to go to the
 
01:55:29.209 --> 01:55:29.219 align:start position:0%
committee of conference so we can stand
 
01:55:31.609 --> 01:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
firm and protect these people thank you
 
01:55:33.530 --> 01:55:33.540 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker
 
01:55:36.649 --> 01:55:36.659 align:start position:0%
and I request a division vote
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
the question is whether do not concur
 
01:55:40.850 --> 01:55:40.860 align:start position:0%
request committee a conference on House
 
01:55:42.890 --> 01:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
Bill 610 and this is a division vote
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:37.010 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:56:37.010 --> 01:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
the questions whether to non-concur
 
01:56:41.030 --> 01:56:41.040 align:start position:0%
request Committee of conference on House
 
01:56:43.669 --> 01:56:43.679 align:start position:0%
Bill 610 and this is a division vote
 
01:56:45.649 --> 01:56:45.659 align:start position:0%
representative Weber is recognized for a
 
01:56:55.550 --> 01:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
an excellent bill for all the reasons
 
01:56:59.149 --> 01:56:59.159 align:start position:0%
that you've heard
 
01:57:02.450 --> 01:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
but I also know that there are already
 
01:57:06.530 --> 01:57:06.540 align:start position:0%
providers who can certify and I know
 
01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:07.729 align:start position:0%
providers who can certify and I know
that

01:57:07.729 --> 01:57:07.739 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis treatment for children has many
 
01:57:15.669 --> 01:57:15.679 align:start position:0%
reasons why
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
certification may not be the best option
 
01:57:25.790 --> 01:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:28.250 --> 01:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
even though it would it might be easier
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
with these other providers
 
01:57:32.209 --> 01:57:32.219 align:start position:0%
and if I know
 
01:57:35.089 --> 01:57:35.099 align:start position:0%
that so so the point I was trying to
 
01:57:37.129 --> 01:57:37.139 align:start position:0%
make is that
 
01:57:39.410 --> 01:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
um there may be other reasons for this
 
01:57:44.330 --> 01:57:44.340 align:start position:0%
low numbers of kids on the program
 
01:57:49.129 --> 01:57:49.139 align:start position:0%
if I understand that bail reform will be
 
01:57:50.709 --> 01:57:50.719 align:start position:0%
taken up
 
01:57:54.070 --> 01:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
comprehensively thoughtfully and
 
01:57:57.830 --> 01:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
carefully and with the input of all
 
01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
stakeholders which is not what happens
 
01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
in a committee of conference
 
01:58:07.729 --> 01:58:07.739 align:start position:0%
and finally if I know that this is a
 
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:11.480 align:start position:0%
practice by the Senate
 
01:58:14.209 --> 01:58:14.219 align:start position:0%
my apologies by the body on the other
 
01:58:15.950 --> 01:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
side of the wall
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
that most of us deplore and rewarding
 
01:58:23.510 --> 01:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
bad behavior is not a way to get bad
 
01:58:27.290 --> 01:58:27.300 align:start position:0%
behavior to go away what I now vote know
 
01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
on the proposed Committee of conference
 
01:58:31.970 --> 01:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
so a better motion could be made thank
 
01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:34.010 align:start position:0%
so a better motion could be made thank
you

01:58:34.010 --> 01:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:58:35.870 --> 01:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
representative Roy is recognized for
 
01:58:40.010 --> 01:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:41.990 --> 01:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
 
01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:42.950 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker Mr Speaker if I
know

01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:58:46.010 --> 01:58:46.020 align:start position:0%
that indeed the criminal justice
 
01:58:48.589 --> 01:58:48.599 align:start position:0%
committee will deal with the bail issues
 
01:58:49.970 --> 01:58:49.980 align:start position:0%
over the summer
 
01:58:52.850 --> 01:58:52.860 align:start position:0%
and further Mr Speaker if I know we
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
should discourage the practice of
 
01:58:58.669 --> 01:58:58.679 align:start position:0%
committee shopping by the other body
 
01:59:02.689 --> 01:59:02.699 align:start position:0%
but I also know that the prime bill is
 
01:59:06.649 --> 01:59:06.659 align:start position:0%
worthy of saving and
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
there are people that need this
 
01:59:12.830 --> 01:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
for their eyesight it's definitely worth
 
01:59:15.649 --> 01:59:15.659 align:start position:0%
saving we already passed it why would we
 
01:59:17.209 --> 01:59:17.219 align:start position:0%
throw it with a baby with the bathwater
 
01:59:19.370 --> 01:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
at this point Mr Speaker would I then
 
01:59:20.930 --> 01:59:20.940 align:start position:0%
vote for the committee of conference so
 
01:59:22.609 --> 01:59:22.619 align:start position:0%
we can strip it back to the bill that we
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
passed and move forward from there thank
 
01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:28.370 align:start position:0%
passed and move forward from there thank
you

01:59:28.370 --> 01:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
the question is whether a non concur
 
01:59:31.370 --> 01:59:31.380 align:start position:0%
request Committee of conference in House
 
01:59:34.070 --> 01:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 610 and this is a division vote if
 
01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
you're in favor press the green button
 
01:59:37.550 --> 01:59:37.560 align:start position:0%
oppose press thread voting stations are
 
02:00:08.750 --> 02:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:12.709 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:00:12.709 --> 02:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:14.330 --> 02:00:14.340 align:start position:0%
of all members presence and an
 
02:00:23.770 --> 02:00:23.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:26.990 --> 02:00:27.000 align:start position:0%
good thing I asked
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
now of all members present at an
 
02:00:30.050 --> 02:00:30.060 align:start position:0%
opportunity to vote
 
02:00:31.490 --> 02:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
the house will attended the state of the
 
02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:33.169 align:start position:0%

thank you speaker just a quick
 
02:02:42.109 --> 02:02:42.119 align:start position:0%
announcement before the legislative golf
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
tournament on June 26th at 7 30 in the
 
02:02:47.149 --> 02:02:47.159 align:start position:0%
morning there'll be a defend the guard
 
02:02:49.970 --> 02:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
rally for the upcoming legislation
 
02:02:52.669 --> 02:02:52.679 align:start position:0%
so the bill is very simple saying we
 
02:02:54.290 --> 02:02:54.300 align:start position:0%
cannot send the New Hampshire National
 
02:02:57.649 --> 02:02:57.659 align:start position:0%
Guard overseas unless Congress does its
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
job and declares war I think it's very
 
02:03:01.970 --> 02:03:01.980 align:start position:0%
important keep our neighbors here so if
 
02:03:06.229 --> 02:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:08.270 --> 02:03:08.280 align:start position:0%
just to add some bipartisan tip to this
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
it's a very important thing we should
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
not be sending our troops to war unless
 
02:03:14.089 --> 02:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
our representative democracy has
 
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
approved it no Executives should be
 
02:03:18.350 --> 02:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
sending our troop to war without our
 
02:03:20.750 --> 02:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
approval and join us to rally for that
 
02:03:22.729 --> 02:03:22.739 align:start position:0%

we owe it to these kids to do right by

them and make sure that they can use the
 
03:41:52.490 --> 03:41:52.500 align:start position:0%

03:41:59.570 --> 03:41:59.580 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
03:42:01.429 --> 03:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
we should make sure that every single
 
03:42:03.889 --> 03:42:03.899 align:start position:0%
person can benefit that every single
 
03:42:06.170 --> 03:42:06.180 align:start position:0%

03:42:19.429 --> 03:42:19.439 align:start position:0%
conference so that another more sensible
 
03:42:21.710 --> 03:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
motion can be made that supports
 
03:42:27.349 --> 03:42:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:29.330 --> 03:42:29.340 align:start position:0%

thank you very much and good afternoon
 
03:42:47.030 --> 03:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
fellow colleagues I rise in support of
 
03:42:51.110 --> 03:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
not supporting a committee of conference
 
03:42:53.690 --> 03:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
the the issue that we have before us
 
03:42:53.700 --> 03:42:55.490 align:start position:0%
the the issue that we have before us
here

03:42:55.490 --> 03:42:55.500 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:42:58.750 --> 03:42:58.760 align:start position:0%
is accessibility for all our all our
 
03:43:02.570 --> 03:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
families and and citizens regardless of
 
03:43:02.580 --> 03:43:03.410 align:start position:0%
families and and citizens regardless of
age

03:43:03.410 --> 03:43:03.420 align:start position:0%
age
 
03:43:05.389 --> 03:43:05.399 align:start position:0%
when I bring to the table here is one
 
03:43:07.010 --> 03:43:07.020 align:start position:0%
thing that we have led the nation on in
 
03:43:08.690 --> 03:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
my view and I've been here
 
03:43:10.610 --> 03:43:10.620 align:start position:0%
for quite a while I'm not old but I'm
 
03:43:13.729 --> 03:43:13.739 align:start position:0%
aggressively mature is the
 
03:43:16.729 --> 03:43:16.739 align:start position:0%
I hope that that's a good thing
 
03:43:18.650 --> 03:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
is that we have led the nation in home
 
03:43:20.570 --> 03:43:20.580 align:start position:0%
and community-based care and a big part
 
03:43:22.630 --> 03:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
of that is our parents taking care of
 
03:43:25.790 --> 03:43:25.800 align:start position:0%
their handicapped physically handicapped
 
03:43:28.250 --> 03:43:28.260 align:start position:0%
and times mental mental challenges as
 
03:43:31.370 --> 03:43:31.380 align:start position:0%
well children and young adults and also
 
03:43:31.380 --> 03:43:32.450 align:start position:0%
well children and young adults and also
parents

03:43:32.450 --> 03:43:32.460 align:start position:0%
parents
 
03:43:35.809 --> 03:43:35.819 align:start position:0%
and what used to take place prior to
 
03:43:39.410 --> 03:43:39.420 align:start position:0%
1990 when it was a requirement to
 
03:43:39.420 --> 03:43:40.670 align:start position:0%
1990 when it was a requirement to
consider

03:43:40.670 --> 03:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:43:42.889 --> 03:43:42.899 align:start position:0%
adjusting handicapped accessibility to
 
03:43:45.530 --> 03:43:45.540 align:start position:0%
public buildings this one included was
 
03:43:47.990 --> 03:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
the Ada the American Disabilities Act
 
03:43:50.570 --> 03:43:50.580 align:start position:0%
and had some amendments since since then
 
03:43:52.910 --> 03:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
the last one in 2008 and providing for
 
03:43:55.790 --> 03:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable reasonable is the term access
 
03:43:58.610 --> 03:43:58.620 align:start position:0%
what we have about Playgrounds taking
 
03:44:01.070 --> 03:44:01.080 align:start position:0%
place which this bill is focused on and
 
03:44:04.010 --> 03:44:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's for the as the sponsor previously
 
03:44:07.130 --> 03:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
indicated is what's coming to be built
 
03:44:10.010 --> 03:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
is that it provides that access
 
03:44:13.309 --> 03:44:13.319 align:start position:0%
for those with with physical handicaps
 
03:44:15.950 --> 03:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
and and right now in how playgrounds are
 
03:44:17.570 --> 03:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
built and I'm one who did that in my
 
03:44:22.250 --> 03:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
town as well was uh providing a strong
 
03:44:24.650 --> 03:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
not pavement per se but an ability where
 
03:44:24.660 --> 03:44:26.050 align:start position:0%
not pavement per se but an ability where
wheelchairs

03:44:26.050 --> 03:44:26.060 align:start position:0%
wheelchairs
 
03:44:29.750 --> 03:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
Walkers and also canes can be utilized
 
03:44:32.330 --> 03:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
without causing a trip Hazard and when
 
03:44:34.610 --> 03:44:34.620 align:start position:0%
we have the opportunity for young people
 
03:44:37.790 --> 03:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
to participate with their friends who
 
03:44:39.889 --> 03:44:39.899 align:start position:0%
are able-bodied but they can be right
 
03:44:42.550 --> 03:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
there with them that builds up a
 
03:44:45.530 --> 03:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
camaraderie of support not just with
 
03:44:47.809 --> 03:44:47.819 align:start position:0%
their families their friends but with
 
03:44:50.090 --> 03:44:50.100 align:start position:0%
their town because everyone is working
 
03:44:51.650 --> 03:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
with Cooperative collaboration to
 
03:44:53.630 --> 03:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
achieve consensus and that is to help
 
03:44:54.650 --> 03:44:54.660 align:start position:0%
each other
 
03:44:57.889 --> 03:44:57.899 align:start position:0%
so when I'm looking here is to ask that
 
03:45:01.309 --> 03:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
we are asking not to support the vote
 
03:45:02.750 --> 03:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
for committee of conference so that we
 
03:45:06.110 --> 03:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
can move this opportunity forward for
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
future planning of these projects
 
03:45:11.210 --> 03:45:11.220 align:start position:0%
and to get done in one of my lines that
 
03:45:12.650 --> 03:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
I use that let's do it while we're young
 
03:45:15.469 --> 03:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
and that's that's do it today thank you
 
03:45:18.710 --> 03:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
very much thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:45:20.630 --> 03:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative ball is recognized speak
 
03:45:30.530 --> 03:45:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:33.050 --> 03:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:45:35.090 --> 03:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
having accessible Pathways and
 
03:45:37.429 --> 03:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
playgrounds so those both young and old
 
03:45:39.889 --> 03:45:39.899 align:start position:0%
can access the playground equipment has
 
03:45:43.969 --> 03:45:43.979 align:start position:0%
been a federal law since March 15 2012.
 
03:45:47.750 --> 03:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
the Ada 2010 standards requires an
 
03:45:49.370 --> 03:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
accessible path from the building or
 
03:45:51.250 --> 03:45:51.260 align:start position:0%
parking lot to the edge of the play area
 
03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
and again
 
03:45:55.550 --> 03:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
an accessible path from the edge of the
 
03:45:58.849 --> 03:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
play area to the play equipment
 
03:46:01.490 --> 03:46:01.500 align:start position:0%
currently many New Hampshire playgrounds
 
03:46:04.190 --> 03:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
use compressed wood chips to create
 
03:46:05.809 --> 03:46:05.819 align:start position:0%
these pathways
 
03:46:08.750 --> 03:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
however using compressed wood chips to
 
03:46:11.210 --> 03:46:11.220 align:start position:0%
create Pathways requires routine
 
03:46:15.050 --> 03:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
maintenance to keep the chips compacted
 
03:46:17.389 --> 03:46:17.399 align:start position:0%
imagine the disappointment so many New
 
03:46:19.969 --> 03:46:19.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families feel when they arrive
 
03:46:22.429 --> 03:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
at a playground for an afternoon of fun
 
03:46:24.530 --> 03:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
only to find that the chips have been
 
03:46:27.110 --> 03:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
kicked around and loosened to the point
 
03:46:29.510 --> 03:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
that a family member in a wheelchair
 
03:46:33.410 --> 03:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
using a walker a cane or crutches cannot
 
03:46:36.590 --> 03:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
Traverse the now uneven path
 
03:46:39.410 --> 03:46:39.420 align:start position:0%
as a primary caretaker to my mother who
 
03:46:41.809 --> 03:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
is confined in a wheelchair I can tell
 
03:46:44.510 --> 03:46:44.520 align:start position:0%
you that trying to include my mother in
 
03:46:47.570 --> 03:46:47.580 align:start position:0%
our family's outdoor activities required
 
03:46:50.690 --> 03:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
a herculation effort
 
03:46:53.450 --> 03:46:53.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is better than this
 
03:46:55.429 --> 03:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire we believe in
 
03:46:57.590 --> 03:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
supporting our friends and family with
 
03:47:00.229 --> 03:47:00.239 align:start position:0%
Mobility challenges by assuring we
 
03:47:03.050 --> 03:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
provide equal access to all New
 
03:47:06.229 --> 03:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has to offer this includes fun
 
03:47:08.269 --> 03:47:08.279 align:start position:0%
a fun-filled day at our public
 
03:47:08.279 --> 03:47:09.950 align:start position:0%
a fun-filled day at our public
playgrounds

03:47:09.950 --> 03:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
playgrounds
 
03:47:11.990 --> 03:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
given New Hampshire's aging population
 
03:47:14.929 --> 03:47:14.939 align:start position:0%
and the number of grandparents who are
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
now primary caregivers to their
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and or provide daycare for
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
their grandchildren we cannot ignore a
 
03:47:26.929 --> 03:47:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:29.450 --> 03:47:29.460 align:start position:0%

Mobility challenge New Hampshire's
 
03:47:41.269 --> 03:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
caregivers need accessible Pathways in
 
03:47:43.370 --> 03:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
our public playgrounds made from
 
03:47:46.250 --> 03:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
resilient solid surface materials and
 
03:47:49.550 --> 03:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
not a loose fill or aggregate
 
03:47:51.469 --> 03:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
it is well past time for New Hampshire
 
03:47:54.830 --> 03:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
to take proactive measures to assure all
 
03:47:57.290 --> 03:47:57.300 align:start position:0%
those with Mobility challenge have equal
 
03:48:00.590 --> 03:48:00.600 align:start position:0%
access to every piece of playground
 
03:48:04.070 --> 03:48:04.080 align:start position:0%

03:48:07.370 --> 03:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
please vote no to the committee of
 
03:48:07.380 --> 03:48:08.809 align:start position:0%

03:48:15.530 --> 03:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
young and old can enjoy equal access to
 
03:48:19.309 --> 03:48:19.319 align:start position:0%
our public playgrounds thank you
 
03:48:21.349 --> 03:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative Donnelly is recognized
 
03:48:30.110 --> 03:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:33.170 --> 03:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
representative Donnelly
 
03:48:37.010 --> 03:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:39.410 --> 03:48:39.420 align:start position:0%
representative turcott as when turcott
 
03:48:41.090 --> 03:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
has recognized speaking support of the
 
03:48:41.100 --> 03:48:44.030 align:start position:0%
has recognized speaking support of the
motion

03:48:44.030 --> 03:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:46.070 --> 03:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
03:48:48.290 --> 03:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
let's start off
 
03:48:51.590 --> 03:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
making it Crystal Clear there is nothing
 
03:48:55.309 --> 03:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
that prevents a town or a city
 
03:48:58.190 --> 03:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
from doing what this bill is asking to
 
03:48:58.200 --> 03:49:01.550 align:start position:0%
from doing what this bill is asking to
do

03:49:01.550 --> 03:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
what we are doing here is trying to
 
03:49:08.090 --> 03:49:08.100 align:start position:0%
maintain a consistent policy in the
 
03:49:09.830 --> 03:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
municipal and County government
 
03:49:11.510 --> 03:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
committee and I will speak a little bit
 
03:49:13.849 --> 03:49:13.859 align:start position:0%
more on that in a second
 
03:49:16.250 --> 03:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
the Ada already has significant
 
03:49:20.269 --> 03:49:20.279 align:start position:0%
requirements for playgrounds in fact the
 
03:49:23.090 --> 03:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
summary summary document for playgrounds
 
03:49:26.090 --> 03:49:26.100 align:start position:0%
alone is 40 pages that's the summary
 
03:49:26.100 --> 03:49:27.290 align:start position:0%
alone is 40 pages that's the summary
document

03:49:27.290 --> 03:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
document
 
03:49:29.929 --> 03:49:29.939 align:start position:0%
this bill would state
 
03:49:32.809 --> 03:49:32.819 align:start position:0%
would have the state mandate above and
 
03:49:32.819 --> 03:49:33.830 align:start position:0%
would have the state mandate above and
beyond

03:49:33.830 --> 03:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
03:49:36.469 --> 03:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
what the already expensive ADA
 
03:49:40.010 --> 03:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
requirements contain
 
03:49:41.990 --> 03:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
now you I'm sure all of you are going to
 
03:49:43.910 --> 03:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
remember three bills that came out of
 
03:49:45.590 --> 03:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government this
 
03:49:45.600 --> 03:49:46.670 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County government this
year

03:49:46.670 --> 03:49:46.680 align:start position:0%
year
 
03:49:49.070 --> 03:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
that were state mandates thrown down
 
03:49:53.630 --> 03:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:58.790 --> 03:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
failed here in a large bipartisan manner
 
03:50:01.250 --> 03:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
one was four units on a single family
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
law one was rent control and the other
 
03:50:05.750 --> 03:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
one we actually tabled talking about two
 
03:50:08.510 --> 03:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling units
 
03:50:11.410 --> 03:50:11.420 align:start position:0%
we should never support state mandates
 
03:50:14.750 --> 03:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
on municipalities that have the ability
 
03:50:18.950 --> 03:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
to zone or in this case increase or add
 
03:50:24.110 --> 03:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:26.570 --> 03:50:26.580 align:start position:0%
speaking to that last point
 
03:50:29.809 --> 03:50:29.819 align:start position:0%
I've already opened up this test speech
 
03:50:31.849 --> 03:50:31.859 align:start position:0%
talking about there's nothing
 
03:50:34.969 --> 03:50:34.979 align:start position:0%
that prevents a town from installing
 
03:50:38.210 --> 03:50:38.220 align:start position:0%
materials as this bill would have them
 
03:50:40.550 --> 03:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
do there's nothing that requires or
 
03:50:42.110 --> 03:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
prevents them from putting that on there
 
03:50:42.120 --> 03:50:43.910 align:start position:0%
prevents them from putting that on there
now

03:50:43.910 --> 03:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
03:50:46.130 --> 03:50:46.140 align:start position:0%
if a town wants rubber or mats or
 
03:50:47.630 --> 03:50:47.640 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to do they can do
 
03:50:47.640 --> 03:50:48.410 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to do they can do
that

03:50:48.410 --> 03:50:48.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:50:50.269 --> 03:50:50.279 align:start position:0%
we don't need the state telling them to
 
03:50:54.290 --> 03:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:56.450 --> 03:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
it's our belief that we do not need a
 
03:50:59.690 --> 03:50:59.700 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats adding red tape to making
 
03:51:03.349 --> 03:51:03.359 align:start position:0%
these playgrounds more costly than the
 
03:51:09.950 --> 03:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:13.790 --> 03:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
primary concern of one of the sponsors
 
03:51:16.429 --> 03:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
was that a town that they were an
 
03:51:19.070 --> 03:51:19.080 align:start position:0%
occupant went and built a playground
 
03:51:21.349 --> 03:51:21.359 align:start position:0%
based on the contractor's recommendation
 
03:51:24.590 --> 03:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
and after completion they realized it
 
03:51:26.929 --> 03:51:26.939 align:start position:0%
was not perfect so they would have to do
 
03:51:30.170 --> 03:51:30.180 align:start position:0%
some more work or potentially redo it
 
03:51:33.349 --> 03:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
now my points to this are one caveat
 
03:51:33.359 --> 03:51:35.570 align:start position:0%
now my points to this are one caveat
mtor

03:51:35.570 --> 03:51:35.580 align:start position:0%
mtor
 
03:51:39.410 --> 03:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
why did the town elected officials not
 
03:51:41.150 --> 03:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
do their research
 
03:51:43.849 --> 03:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
either on their own regarding what was
 
03:51:43.859 --> 03:51:44.929 align:start position:0%
either on their own regarding what was
required

03:51:44.929 --> 03:51:44.939 align:start position:0%
required
 
03:51:47.750 --> 03:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
or on the contractors that sold them
 
03:51:51.170 --> 03:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
on putting in whatever they put in we
 
03:51:52.729 --> 03:51:52.739 align:start position:0%
only heard that one side of the story
 
03:51:52.739 --> 03:51:55.729 align:start position:0%
only heard that one side of the story
however

03:51:55.729 --> 03:51:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:58.130 --> 03:51:58.140 align:start position:0%
the main focus of the proposed Bill
 
03:52:00.650 --> 03:52:00.660 align:start position:0%
appears to be
 
03:52:02.750 --> 03:52:02.760 align:start position:0%
we have to require rubber matting
 
03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't or didn't do our
 
03:52:05.630 --> 03:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
homework so we need the New Hampshire
 
03:52:09.349 --> 03:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
Nanny state to mandate beyond the Ada
 
03:52:09.359 --> 03:52:12.349 align:start position:0%
Nanny state to mandate beyond the Ada
again

03:52:12.349 --> 03:52:12.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:14.870 --> 03:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that prevents a town or
 
03:52:16.729 --> 03:52:16.739 align:start position:0%
a city from putting down whatever
 
03:52:19.070 --> 03:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
material they want already without
 
03:52:23.090 --> 03:52:23.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:24.950 --> 03:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
so in summary this bill contains
 
03:52:27.469 --> 03:52:27.479 align:start position:0%
excessive bureaucratic overreach that
 
03:52:29.870 --> 03:52:29.880 align:start position:0%
would require regulation that already
 
03:52:33.349 --> 03:52:33.359 align:start position:0%
exceed the comprehensive ADA rules it
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
creates potentially expensive State
 
03:52:36.950 --> 03:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
imposed mandates
 
03:52:40.370 --> 03:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
that can already be considered
 
03:52:43.570 --> 03:52:43.580 align:start position:0%
and we do not need
 
03:52:47.590 --> 03:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
the potential for towns or cities
 
03:52:49.790 --> 03:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
looking at this expensive Edition
 
03:52:52.670 --> 03:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
mandated by the state to the point where
 
03:52:55.429 --> 03:52:55.439 align:start position:0%
they decide maybe we don't even build a
 
03:52:57.769 --> 03:52:57.779 align:start position:0%
playground so for that reason I would
 
03:53:00.170 --> 03:53:00.180 align:start position:0%
ask that you non-concur so we can have a
 
03:53:03.469 --> 03:53:03.479 align:start position:0%
committee a conference there is a
 
03:53:07.070 --> 03:53:07.080 align:start position:0%
language that has been proposed that
 
03:53:09.889 --> 03:53:09.899 align:start position:0%
would at least inform
 
03:53:12.410 --> 03:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
towns through the rsas that they should
 
03:53:14.809 --> 03:53:14.819 align:start position:0%
consider alternatives but it would not
 
03:53:16.790 --> 03:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
mandate those Alternatives thank you Mr
 
03:53:16.800 --> 03:53:18.950 align:start position:0%
mandate those Alternatives thank you Mr
Speaker

03:53:18.950 --> 03:53:18.960 align:start position:0%

to you as our esteemed colleagues have
 
03:53:51.769 --> 03:53:51.779 align:start position:0%

what I would say to you in opposition to
 
03:53:58.130 --> 03:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
non-confurrence is this
 
03:54:01.010 --> 03:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
we are all American citizens we cherish

as legislators we've taken
 
03:54:12.769 --> 03:54:12.779 align:start position:0%
the oath of our office to preserve
 
03:54:15.590 --> 03:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
protect and defend our constitutions
 
03:54:18.830 --> 03:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
we cherish our right to self-govern
 
03:54:20.990 --> 03:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
but these devotions to the ideals of
 
03:54:22.910 --> 03:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
freedom and democracy are the keys to
 
03:54:25.010 --> 03:54:25.020 align:start position:0%
our Civic responsibilities as

better from which we received
 
03:54:39.950 --> 03:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
I voted for House Bill 467 because I
 
03:54:42.170 --> 03:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
believed it would be made better and
 
03:54:44.330 --> 03:54:44.340 align:start position:0%
easier for all granted State children
 
03:54:46.670 --> 03:54:46.680 align:start position:0%

in the future
 
03:54:50.030 --> 03:54:50.040 align:start position:0%

03:54:52.130 --> 03:54:52.140 align:start position:0%
permit all playground participants to
 
03:54:54.950 --> 03:54:54.960 align:start position:0%

the grandparents and the parents who we

03:56:15.680 --> 03:56:17.210 align:start position:0%
use canes

03:56:17.210 --> 03:56:17.220 align:start position:0%
wheelchairs
 
03:56:20.689 --> 03:56:20.699 align:start position:0%
or any other apparatus to get in and to
 
03:56:21.830 --> 03:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
get out
 
03:56:25.189 --> 03:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
of a playground nothing is worse than to
 
03:56:27.110 --> 03:56:27.120 align:start position:0%
see a child
 
03:56:30.950 --> 03:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
in a wheelchair sitting at the edge of a
 
03:56:34.550 --> 03:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
playground because they can't make it to
 
03:56:38.689 --> 03:56:38.699 align:start position:0%
the swing that specifically made for
 
03:56:41.570 --> 03:56:41.580 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker I don't want to
 
03:57:07.389 --> 03:57:07.399 align:start position:0%
reiterate everything my previous
 
03:57:10.490 --> 03:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
colleagues prior to me said but this is
 
03:57:14.210 --> 03:57:14.220 align:start position:0%
an extent you can't hear oh sorry
 
03:57:15.950 --> 03:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to repeat what my fellow
 
03:57:18.110 --> 03:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
colleagues said before me but this is a
 
03:57:20.210 --> 03:57:20.220 align:start position:0%
common sense measure
 
03:57:22.250 --> 03:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
um if you have two children and one's
 
03:57:24.229 --> 03:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
handicapped you have to leave your
 
03:57:26.870 --> 03:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
handicapped child at the entrance of a
 
03:57:28.250 --> 03:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
playground because they can't go play
 
03:57:30.889 --> 03:57:30.899 align:start position:0%
with the other child it's just it's just
 
03:57:32.510 --> 03:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
common sense to pass this bill and I

I'm here to speak in opposition to the

motion for a committee of conference for
 
03:58:09.170 --> 03:58:09.180 align:start position:0%

we are responsible for their care
 
03:58:36.590 --> 03:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
in fact in 2021 there were over 12
 
03:58:39.710 --> 03:58:39.720 align:start position:0%
000 children in New Hampshire with some
 
03:58:43.250 --> 03:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
forms of physical disabilities
 
03:58:46.689 --> 03:58:46.699 align:start position:0%
these children and their caretakers
 
03:58:50.269 --> 03:58:50.279 align:start position:0%
constantly face barriers enjoying their
 
03:58:53.269 --> 03:58:53.279 align:start position:0%
fundamental human rights and inclusion
 
03:58:55.790 --> 03:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
in our communities
 
03:58:57.830 --> 03:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
children with disabilities are
 
03:59:00.010 --> 03:59:00.020 align:start position:0%
overlooked their capacities are
 
03:59:03.110 --> 03:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
underestimated and their needs are given
 
03:59:05.450 --> 03:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
a low priority
 
03:59:08.150 --> 03:59:08.160 align:start position:0%

the ketamini members heard testimony
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
that there were many obstacles for
 
03:59:18.410 --> 03:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
disabled people
 
03:59:22.189 --> 03:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
and their obstacles are found in all of
 
03:59:24.050 --> 03:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
our communities
 
03:59:26.269 --> 03:59:26.279 align:start position:0%
they are reflected in policies
 
03:59:29.330 --> 03:59:29.340 align:start position:0%
regulations created by governments some
 
03:59:32.630 --> 03:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
of the obstacles are physical for for
 
03:59:35.229 --> 03:59:35.239 align:start position:0%

04:00:09.349 --> 04:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
this bill would complement the federal

Americans Disabilities Act
 
04:00:15.950 --> 04:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
improving accessibility will make
 
04:00:19.070 --> 04:00:19.080 align:start position:0%
playgrounds and Parks more inclusive and
 
04:00:22.189 --> 04:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
welcoming to all children and their
 
04:00:25.309 --> 04:00:25.319 align:start position:0%

disabilities
 
04:00:30.710 --> 04:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
in addition adding Pathways made of
 
04:00:33.769 --> 04:00:33.779 align:start position:0%
these materials will relieve towns of
 
04:00:36.349 --> 04:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
the need to replace less accessible
 
04:00:39.590 --> 04:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
materials periodically and save money
 
04:00:44.710 --> 04:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:47.809 --> 04:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
in the municipal committee as well as
 
04:00:51.229 --> 04:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
this house here we both voted
 
04:00:55.429 --> 04:00:55.439 align:start position:0%
to approve HB 467.
 
04:00:58.550 --> 04:00:58.560 align:start position:0%
the changes that our friends on the
 
04:01:03.290 --> 04:01:03.300 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall has only improved
 
04:01:05.689 --> 04:01:05.699 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:01:09.050 --> 04:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
if my fellow Representatives believe as
 
04:01:10.429 --> 04:01:10.439 align:start position:0%
I do
 
04:01:13.429 --> 04:01:13.439 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire State constitutional

with disabilities and their caretakers
 
04:01:28.429 --> 04:01:28.439 align:start position:0%
then we will do the right thing and vote
 
04:01:30.590 --> 04:01:30.600 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:01:56.389 --> 04:01:56.399 align:start position:0%
colleagues I ask you to support the
 
04:02:00.530 --> 04:02:00.540 align:start position:0%
motion on House Bill 467 to non-concur
 
04:02:02.750 --> 04:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
so that the bill can go to a committee
 
04:02:05.689 --> 04:02:05.699 align:start position:0%
of conference to be clear this is not
 
04:02:08.330 --> 04:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
about accessibility it's about an
 
04:02:10.010 --> 04:02:10.020 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate
 
04:02:12.229 --> 04:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
the part of the Senate amendment that
 
04:02:14.030 --> 04:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
changed the description of the material
 
04:02:17.510 --> 04:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
mandated for playground Pathways is
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
highly problematic for a number of
 
04:02:19.920 --> 04:02:21.050 align:start position:0%
highly problematic for a number of
reasons

04:02:21.050 --> 04:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
04:02:24.469 --> 04:02:24.479 align:start position:0%
first the term resilient in reference to
 
04:02:27.590 --> 04:02:27.600 align:start position:0%
a solid surface material is improperly
 
04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
used which creates confusion
 
04:02:33.050 --> 04:02:33.060 align:start position:0%
resiliency indicates the ability of a
 
04:02:35.570 --> 04:02:35.580 align:start position:0%
material to absorb a fall and reduce
 
04:02:38.630 --> 04:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
severity of injury specifically a head
 
04:02:41.809 --> 04:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
injury a resilient material is one that
 
04:02:44.630 --> 04:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
meets impact attenuation industry
 
04:02:44.640 --> 04:02:45.889 align:start position:0%
meets impact attenuation industry
standards

04:02:45.889 --> 04:02:45.899 align:start position:0%
standards
 
04:02:48.729 --> 04:02:48.739 align:start position:0%
typically this applies to material
 
04:02:51.650 --> 04:02:51.660 align:start position:0%
materials used under playground
 
04:02:55.309 --> 04:02:55.319 align:start position:0%
equipment not on pathways
 
04:02:57.469 --> 04:02:57.479 align:start position:0%
to be clear material standards for
 
04:03:00.349 --> 04:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
accessible accessible pathways are
 
04:03:03.410 --> 04:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
established to evaluate firmness and
 
04:03:06.349 --> 04:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
stability of the material not its
 
04:03:10.189 --> 04:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
resiliency so this wording is clearly a
 
04:03:10.199 --> 04:03:10.969 align:start position:0%
resiliency so this wording is clearly a
problem

04:03:10.969 --> 04:03:10.979 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:03:10.979 --> 04:03:12.290 align:start position:0%
problem
second

04:03:12.290 --> 04:03:12.300 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:03:15.290 --> 04:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
solid surface material that is not a
 
04:03:18.050 --> 04:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
loose fill or aggregate is a further
 
04:03:18.060 --> 04:03:19.130 align:start position:0%
loose fill or aggregate is a further
concern

04:03:19.130 --> 04:03:19.140 align:start position:0%
concern
 
04:03:22.250 --> 04:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
this language outright prohibits the use
 
04:03:24.830 --> 04:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
of other acceptable surfacing materials
 
04:03:29.150 --> 04:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
that are both ADA Compliant and meat
 
04:03:33.950 --> 04:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
ASTM 1951 standards moreover this
 
04:03:37.130 --> 04:03:37.140 align:start position:0%
language mandates the use of a single
 
04:03:40.729 --> 04:03:40.739 align:start position:0%
material and it's an unfunded mandate
 
04:03:43.269 --> 04:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
notably materials
 
04:03:47.389 --> 04:03:47.399 align:start position:0%
material experts that I spoke with agree
 
04:03:50.689 --> 04:03:50.699 align:start position:0%
that the only resilient solid surface
 
04:03:54.170 --> 04:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
material that is not a loose fill or an
 
04:03:57.769 --> 04:03:57.779 align:start position:0%
aggregate is in fact solid rubber or
 
04:04:00.170 --> 04:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
rubber composite surfacing
 
04:04:02.570 --> 04:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
so in effect the Ascend the Senate
 
04:04:04.910 --> 04:04:04.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment complicates the problematic
 
04:04:04.920 --> 04:04:06.050 align:start position:0%
Amendment complicates the problematic
language

04:04:06.050 --> 04:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:04:09.950 --> 04:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
third this single material specified by
 
04:04:12.830 --> 04:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
this mandate has serious implications
 
04:04:16.070 --> 04:04:16.080 align:start position:0%
since rubber surfacing has a number of
 
04:04:19.010 --> 04:04:19.020 align:start position:0%
problems and concerns associated with it
 
04:04:21.650 --> 04:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
poured in place rubber surfacing is
 
04:04:24.170 --> 04:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
extremely expensive to install and
 
04:04:27.469 --> 04:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
maintain over time and with exposure to
 
04:04:30.650 --> 04:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
the elements cracks can form on the
 
04:04:33.290 --> 04:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
surface allowing moisture to penetrate
 
04:04:36.229 --> 04:04:36.239 align:start position:0%
to the subsurface below once the crack
 
04:04:39.410 --> 04:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
has formed it slowly worsens through
 
04:04:42.189 --> 04:04:42.199 align:start position:0%
seasonal freezing and thawing Cycles
 
04:04:45.530 --> 04:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
combined with the effects of erosion and
 
04:04:48.530 --> 04:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
oftentimes aggravated by vandalism
 
04:04:51.710 --> 04:04:51.720 align:start position:0%
eventually the surface is undermined to
 
04:04:55.090 --> 04:04:55.100 align:start position:0%
the point that a portion of it implodes
 
04:04:59.210 --> 04:04:59.220 align:start position:0%
requiring a very expensive repair by a
 
04:05:02.030 --> 04:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
qualified Technic technician
 
04:05:04.130 --> 04:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
then there is the prohibitive cost
 
04:05:06.410 --> 04:05:06.420 align:start position:0%
Factor associated with the installation
 
04:05:10.010 --> 04:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
of rubber surfacing for example for 200
 
04:05:12.290 --> 04:05:12.300 align:start position:0%
square feet of solid rubber surfacing
 
04:05:15.830 --> 04:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
the cost of materials in labor is 25
 
04:05:18.530 --> 04:05:18.540 align:start position:0%
dollars per square foot or fifty
 
04:05:21.950 --> 04:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars total compared to three
 
04:05:25.370 --> 04:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
dollars and 75 cents per square foot or
 
04:05:27.229 --> 04:05:27.239 align:start position:0%
seventy five hundred dollars for
 
04:05:31.429 --> 04:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
engineered wood fiber which is Ada and
 
04:05:35.990 --> 04:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
ASTM 1951 standard compliant material
 
04:05:38.689 --> 04:05:38.699 align:start position:0%
rubber surfacing is nearly seven times
 
04:05:41.750 --> 04:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
more expensive compared to an acceptable
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
alternate material
 
04:05:46.490 --> 04:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
such an extreme cost difference for the
 
04:05:48.830 --> 04:05:48.840 align:start position:0%
mandated rubber surfacing would
 
04:05:51.410 --> 04:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily drive up the cost of new
 
04:05:54.050 --> 04:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
playgrounds causing projects to be
 
04:05:57.229 --> 04:05:57.239 align:start position:0%
scaled back or even tabled because they
 
04:06:00.010 --> 04:06:00.020 align:start position:0%
are simply too expensive to build
 
04:06:03.290 --> 04:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
ironically rather than providing more
 
04:06:06.290 --> 04:06:06.300 align:start position:0%
accessible playgrounds this amendment
 
04:06:08.990 --> 04:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
will most likely end up having the
 
04:06:12.650 --> 04:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
opposite effect resulting in fewer new
 
04:06:15.469 --> 04:06:15.479 align:start position:0%
playgrounds it's also worth noting that
 
04:06:17.830 --> 04:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
rubber surface surfacing is a
 
04:06:21.170 --> 04:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
petroleum-based non-renewable man-made
 
04:06:24.110 --> 04:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
foreign product rubber surfacing is not
 
04:06:26.809 --> 04:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
a green product rubber surfacing is not
 
04:06:29.150 --> 04:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
biodegradable and it ends up in our
 
04:06:31.790 --> 04:06:31.800 align:start position:0%
landfills there are also serious health
 
04:06:34.070 --> 04:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
and safety concerns associated with
 
04:06:36.650 --> 04:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
rubber surfacing under certain weather
 
04:06:39.530 --> 04:06:39.540 align:start position:0%
conditions such as long sun exposure or
 
04:06:42.290 --> 04:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
extreme heat situations it's possible
 
04:06:44.929 --> 04:06:44.939 align:start position:0%
for children to sustain thermal burns
 
04:06:48.110 --> 04:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
from the rubber surfacing additionally
 
04:06:51.229 --> 04:06:51.239 align:start position:0%
there are a number of ongoing safety
 
04:06:51.239 --> 04:06:52.309 align:start position:0%
there are a number of ongoing safety
studies

04:06:52.309 --> 04:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
studies
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
which may result in future Federal
 
04:06:58.910 --> 04:06:58.920 align:start position:0%
Regulations requiring the removal and
 
04:07:01.790 --> 04:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
replacement of rubber materials on
 
04:07:04.130 --> 04:07:04.140 align:start position:0%
playgrounds lastly
 
04:07:07.309 --> 04:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
by placing in into Statute in
 
04:07:07.319 --> 04:07:08.650 align:start position:0%
by placing in into Statute in
unnecessary

04:07:08.650 --> 04:07:08.660 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
04:07:12.229 --> 04:07:12.239 align:start position:0%
expensive unfunded mandate for
 
04:07:14.929 --> 04:07:14.939 align:start position:0%
playground design and construction above
 
04:07:18.710 --> 04:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
and beyond what is already required by
 
04:07:21.229 --> 04:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
federal law for accessibility the
 
04:07:24.769 --> 04:07:24.779 align:start position:0%
amended Bill constrains local control in
 
04:07:27.889 --> 04:07:27.899 align:start position:0%
decision making which in turn negatively
 
04:07:31.510 --> 04:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
affects local spending and Taxation
 
04:07:35.090 --> 04:07:35.100 align:start position:0%
therefore I urge my fellow colleagues to
 
04:07:38.269 --> 04:07:38.279 align:start position:0%
support the motion by voting yes so that
 
04:07:40.670 --> 04:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
this bill can go to a committee of
 
04:07:43.189 --> 04:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
conference thank you Mr Speaker and I
 
04:07:45.410 --> 04:07:45.420 align:start position:0%
asked for a division vote does the
 
04:07:49.370 --> 04:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:52.790 --> 04:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
remember yields you may inquire

thank you Mr speaker thank you for
 
04:07:56.269 --> 04:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
taking my question isn't it true that
 
04:07:57.969 --> 04:07:57.979 align:start position:0%
according to our state constitution
 
04:08:01.550 --> 04:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates are against the state
 
04:08:01.560 --> 04:08:02.870 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates are against the state

04:08:12.110 --> 04:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
question before the house is whether to
 
04:08:13.550 --> 04:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
non-concur request committee a
 
04:08:16.630 --> 04:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
conference on House Bill 467.
 
04:08:19.010 --> 04:08:19.020 align:start position:0%

recognized for parliamentary inquiry
 
04:09:27.530 --> 04:09:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:30.530 --> 04:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
if I know that this is a civil rights
 
04:09:33.290 --> 04:09:33.300 align:start position:0%
issue about freedom
 
04:09:36.410 --> 04:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
and access for all Granite Staters to
 
04:09:39.530 --> 04:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
enjoy our public playgrounds regardless
 
04:09:43.130 --> 04:09:43.140 align:start position:0%
of age or mobility issues
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
if I know that this is already federal
 
04:09:48.229 --> 04:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
law under the Americans with
 
04:09:50.389 --> 04:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
Disabilities standards for accessible
 
04:09:54.590 --> 04:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
design has bipartisan support and
 
04:09:56.750 --> 04:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
support from the New Hampshire Municipal
 
04:09:56.760 --> 04:09:58.729 align:start position:0%
support from the New Hampshire Municipal

04:09:58.729 --> 04:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
Association
 
04:10:01.729 --> 04:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
and if I believe the deeply personal
 
04:10:05.050 --> 04:10:05.060 align:start position:0%
testimony that spanned all ages
 
04:10:08.630 --> 04:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
political parties and included a wide
 
04:10:10.550 --> 04:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
array of Mobility
 
04:10:13.370 --> 04:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
abilities that would benefit from this
 
04:10:13.380 --> 04:10:15.170 align:start position:0%
abilities that would benefit from this
legislation

04:10:15.170 --> 04:10:15.180 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
04:10:17.689 --> 04:10:17.699 align:start position:0%
did I invite you to support the
 
04:10:21.050 --> 04:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
bipartisan legislation and press the red
 
04:10:24.349 --> 04:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
button to ensure that all Granite
 
04:10:26.570 --> 04:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
Staters have the freedom
 
04:10:29.630 --> 04:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
to access our public playgrounds with
 
04:10:31.969 --> 04:10:31.979 align:start position:0%
their loved ones and so another motion
 
04:10:35.150 --> 04:10:35.160 align:start position:0%
can be made thank you
 
04:10:37.070 --> 04:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
representative Powers recognized for
 
04:10:45.889 --> 04:10:45.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:49.070 --> 04:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
the law for playground pathways
 
04:10:52.429 --> 04:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
mandating the use of a single expensive
 
04:10:54.410 --> 04:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
material with known negative
 
04:10:57.710 --> 04:10:57.720 align:start position:0%
characteristics in prohibiting the use
 
04:11:02.030 --> 04:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
of other ADA Compliant materials fails
 
04:11:04.630 --> 04:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
to make more playgrounds more accessible
 
04:11:08.210 --> 04:11:08.220 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the bill as amended
 
04:11:12.610 --> 04:11:12.620 align:start position:0%
is imprudent in or in an unfunded
 
04:11:16.070 --> 04:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
overreaching State mandate that strips
 
04:11:18.590 --> 04:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
away local control and will
 
04:11:21.469 --> 04:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily drive up the cost of any
 
04:11:24.650 --> 04:11:24.660 align:start position:0%
future playground projects resulting in
 
04:11:27.950 --> 04:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
fewer not more accessible playgrounds
 
04:11:30.590 --> 04:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
across the granite state
 
04:11:32.750 --> 04:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
and if I know that towns can already
 
04:11:36.650 --> 04:11:36.660 align:start position:0%
install solid surface material if they
 
04:11:38.929 --> 04:11:38.939 align:start position:0%
want to there's absolutely nothing
 
04:11:42.469 --> 04:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
stopping them what I now vote Yes to
 
04:11:42.479 --> 04:11:44.030 align:start position:0%
stopping them what I now vote Yes to
support

281
 
04:14:44.510 --> 04:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
this bill started out as a bad Bill and
 
04:14:46.610 --> 04:14:46.620 align:start position:0%
it ended up worse
 
04:14:49.309 --> 04:14:49.319 align:start position:0%
it deletes the state's consumer
 
04:14:52.010 --> 04:14:52.020 align:start position:0%
protection statute that requires
 
04:14:54.650 --> 04:14:54.660 align:start position:0%
utilities to provide a leased cost
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%

Regulators every five years

plans help make sure the utilities do
 
04:15:05.090 --> 04:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
not saddle rate payers with stranded
 
04:15:08.570 --> 04:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
costs on their electric bills
 
04:15:12.229 --> 04:15:12.239 align:start position:0%
this statute requires quote an
 
04:15:14.769 --> 04:15:14.779 align:start position:0%
assessment of short and long-term
 
04:15:18.469 --> 04:15:18.479 align:start position:0%

and a number of other requirements but
 
04:15:26.510 --> 04:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to go into them here
 
04:15:29.769 --> 04:15:29.779 align:start position:0%
if we no longer require
 
04:15:33.050 --> 04:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
energy analysis uh that New Hampshire
 
04:15:35.809 --> 04:15:35.819 align:start position:0%
currently has in law how do we keep the
 
04:15:37.969 --> 04:15:37.979 align:start position:0%
utilities accountable for how they spend
 
04:15:39.590 --> 04:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
our money
 
04:15:42.650 --> 04:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
lease cost energy planning is in statute
 
04:15:44.510 --> 04:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
for a reason
 
04:15:47.269 --> 04:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
we agreed to update some language
 
04:15:49.429 --> 04:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
but then this bill came along to throw
 
04:15:51.530 --> 04:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
the baby out with the bath water and
 
04:15:54.410 --> 04:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
that will lead to granted Staters in the
 
04:15:57.889 --> 04:15:57.899 align:start position:0%
future asking us how did we get here
 
04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
so there was opposition to HB 281 before
 
04:16:03.110 --> 04:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
it went over to the other side of the
 
04:16:03.120 --> 04:16:04.790 align:start position:0%
it went over to the other side of the
wall

04:16:04.790 --> 04:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
wall
 
04:16:07.250 --> 04:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
once there it was morphed into a
 
04:16:07.260 --> 04:16:08.809 align:start position:0%
once there it was morphed into a
Frankenstein

04:16:08.809 --> 04:16:08.819 align:start position:0%
Frankenstein
 
04:16:11.809 --> 04:16:11.819 align:start position:0%
it is now five bills attempting to pass
 
04:16:14.150 --> 04:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
the house as one
 
04:16:16.370 --> 04:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
most of these bills had distinct
 
04:16:16.380 --> 04:16:18.590 align:start position:0%
most of these bills had distinct
opposition

04:16:18.590 --> 04:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
04:16:21.050 --> 04:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
one was a good bill that was taken
 
04:16:23.950 --> 04:16:23.960 align:start position:0%
Hostage to sweeten the idea of Passage
 
04:16:28.910 --> 04:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
we lose more than we gain so I ask you
 
04:16:32.570 --> 04:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
to understand that fact as legislators
 
04:16:35.750 --> 04:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
over and over those of us who were
 
04:16:38.990 --> 04:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
closely looking at this Frankenstein
 
04:16:41.030 --> 04:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
came to the same conclusion
 
04:16:43.670 --> 04:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
just because they can do it doesn't mean
 
04:16:46.010 --> 04:16:46.020 align:start position:0%
we should let them
 
04:16:48.469 --> 04:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
two of the bills that are being included
 
04:16:53.929 --> 04:16:53.939 align:start position:0%
in HB 281 uh our monster Bill were
 
04:16:56.030 --> 04:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
retained in committee so they have not
 
04:16:58.729 --> 04:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
been before the house they were pulled
 
04:17:00.650 --> 04:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
out of retained status and incorporated
 
04:17:03.290 --> 04:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
into this Frankenstein
 
04:17:05.389 --> 04:17:05.399 align:start position:0%
so they skipped the hard part of the law
 
04:17:07.610 --> 04:17:07.620 align:start position:0%
making and just decided to cut to
 
04:17:10.010 --> 04:17:10.020 align:start position:0%
pressing us for our votes
 
04:17:11.929 --> 04:17:11.939 align:start position:0%
the last piece of this Frankenstein
 
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
monster is the last bill from stne that
 
04:17:19.790 --> 04:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
you voted down already today so I guess
 
04:17:22.670 --> 04:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
it's a second bite at the Apple we were
 
04:17:24.889 --> 04:17:24.899 align:start position:0%
told that its purpose was transparency
 
04:17:29.510 --> 04:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
but as amended it's actually worse it
 
04:17:31.189 --> 04:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
has the department of energy now
 
04:17:33.110 --> 04:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
calculating the average renewable
 
04:17:36.170 --> 04:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
portfolio standard charge on an average
 
04:17:38.929 --> 04:17:38.939 align:start position:0%
bill and then they make the utilities
 
04:17:42.530 --> 04:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
print that number on every bill at the
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
end of the year
 
04:17:45.769 --> 04:17:45.779 align:start position:0%
for the entire year
 
04:17:48.110 --> 04:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
and the charge will either be more than
 
04:17:49.729 --> 04:17:49.739 align:start position:0%
what you actually paid or less than what
 
04:17:51.349 --> 04:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
you actually paid but it will not be
 
04:17:53.450 --> 04:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
what you actually paid
 
04:17:56.630 --> 04:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
so the law on transparency should not
 
04:18:00.290 --> 04:18:00.300 align:start position:0%
make your bill clear as mud
 
04:18:03.229 --> 04:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
if you agree that this is no way to pass
 
04:18:03.239 --> 04:18:05.650 align:start position:0%
if you agree that this is no way to pass
laws

04:18:05.650 --> 04:18:05.660 align:start position:0%
laws
 
04:18:10.490 --> 04:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
then I ask you to understand also that a
 
04:18:12.830 --> 04:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
committee of conference cannot fix what
 
04:18:14.510 --> 04:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
is wrong with this bill
 
04:18:16.309 --> 04:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
or bills
 
04:18:19.969 --> 04:18:19.979 align:start position:0%
HB 281 is a Frankenstein please push the
 
04:18:22.670 --> 04:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
red button to vote against concurrence
 
04:18:25.630 --> 04:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
so that a more villager-friendly Bill
 
04:18:28.969 --> 04:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry motion can be made and a
 
04:18:32.450 --> 04:18:32.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:34.250 --> 04:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
representative versus recognized
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:42.349 --> 04:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:18:45.710 --> 04:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning I spoke about House
 
04:18:48.110 --> 04:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
Bill 139
 
04:18:51.889 --> 04:18:51.899 align:start position:0%
and how its original contents
 
04:18:54.469 --> 04:18:54.479 align:start position:0%
were so attractive to the
 
04:18:56.570 --> 04:18:56.580 align:start position:0%
colleagues of ours on the other side of
 
04:18:58.670 --> 04:18:58.680 align:start position:0%
the wall that they put it in another
 
04:18:58.680 --> 04:19:00.469 align:start position:0%
the wall that they put it in another
bill

04:19:00.469 --> 04:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:19:02.150 --> 04:19:02.160 align:start position:0%
well this is the bill they put it into
 
04:19:06.290 --> 04:19:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:09.349 --> 04:19:09.359 align:start position:0%
and that language expands a program
 
04:19:14.090 --> 04:19:14.100 align:start position:0%
called Municipal host net metering
 
04:19:15.889 --> 04:19:15.899 align:start position:0%
this is a program that allows
 
04:19:17.990 --> 04:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities to build Renewable Energy
 
04:19:18.000 --> 04:19:19.670 align:start position:0%
municipalities to build Renewable Energy
Systems

04:19:19.670 --> 04:19:19.680 align:start position:0%
Systems
 
04:19:22.429 --> 04:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
but right now it restricts those systems
 
04:19:26.570 --> 04:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
to the music municipality itself it
 
04:19:28.429 --> 04:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
can't go outside the boundaries of the
 
04:19:28.439 --> 04:19:32.689 align:start position:0%
can't go outside the boundaries of the
municipality

04:19:32.689 --> 04:19:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:35.330 --> 04:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
the language that the Senate put that
 
04:19:36.889 --> 04:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
the body on the other side of the wall
 
04:19:38.450 --> 04:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
put into this bill
 
04:19:41.450 --> 04:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
removes those Municipal boundaries this
 
04:19:44.330 --> 04:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
will allow municipalities to band
 
04:19:44.340 --> 04:19:45.410 align:start position:0%
will allow municipalities to band
together

04:19:45.410 --> 04:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:19:47.990 --> 04:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
and build Renewable Energy Systems of
 
04:19:50.630 --> 04:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
three to five megawatts if they so
 
04:19:50.640 --> 04:19:53.570 align:start position:0%
three to five megawatts if they so
choose

04:19:53.570 --> 04:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:57.229 --> 04:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:59.990 --> 04:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday the mayor of
 
04:20:00.000 --> 04:20:01.849 align:start position:0%
yesterday the mayor of
Nashua

04:20:01.849 --> 04:20:01.859 align:start position:0%
Nashua
 
04:20:04.130 --> 04:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
and the mayor of Keene
 
04:20:06.349 --> 04:20:06.359 align:start position:0%
wrote an op-ed
 
04:20:09.769 --> 04:20:09.779 align:start position:0%
saying that expanding Municipal host net
 
04:20:12.429 --> 04:20:12.439 align:start position:0%
metering is a big win for New Hampshire
 
04:20:15.950 --> 04:20:15.960 align:start position:0%
they advocated for the passage of house
 
04:20:19.550 --> 04:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:21.429 --> 04:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
many other
 
04:20:25.750 --> 04:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
environmental Advocates have also
 
04:20:28.550 --> 04:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
advocated for the passage of House Bill
 
04:20:28.560 --> 04:20:30.290 align:start position:0%
advocated for the passage of House Bill
281

04:20:30.290 --> 04:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
281
 
04:20:35.750 --> 04:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:37.550 --> 04:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
but our colleagues on the other side of
 
04:20:38.929 --> 04:20:38.939 align:start position:0%
the wall
 
04:20:41.809 --> 04:20:41.819 align:start position:0%
made this bill even more important to
 
04:20:41.819 --> 04:20:43.849 align:start position:0%
made this bill even more important to
pass

04:20:43.849 --> 04:20:43.859 align:start position:0%
pass
 
04:20:46.189 --> 04:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
one of the most important new features
 
04:20:47.809 --> 04:20:47.819 align:start position:0%
of this bill
 
04:20:50.750 --> 04:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
is a reform of the operations of the
 
04:20:55.070 --> 04:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:57.229 --> 04:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
what the amendment from the other side
 
04:20:59.630 --> 04:20:59.640 align:start position:0%
of the wall does
 
04:21:02.030 --> 04:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
is it asserts the authority of
 
04:21:03.889 --> 04:21:03.899 align:start position:0%
individual state agencies in the
 
04:21:05.750 --> 04:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
permitting process
 
04:21:08.150 --> 04:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
it makes the department of energy the
 
04:21:10.550 --> 04:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
Monitor and enforcer of certificate
 
04:21:12.889 --> 04:21:12.899 align:start position:0%
requirements concerning the construction
 
04:21:15.530 --> 04:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
of energy projects
 
04:21:17.450 --> 04:21:17.460 align:start position:0%
and it gives to the department the power
 
04:21:20.090 --> 04:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
to Levy fines and take other enforcement
 
04:21:20.100 --> 04:21:22.849 align:start position:0%
to Levy fines and take other enforcement
actions

04:21:22.849 --> 04:21:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:25.729 --> 04:21:25.739 align:start position:0%
it allows the department to adopt rules
 
04:21:27.710 --> 04:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
and furtherance of its monitoring and
 
04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement responsibilities
 
04:21:32.570 --> 04:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
it requires that all orders granting or
 
04:21:35.870 --> 04:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
denying a site certificate summarize
 
04:21:39.410 --> 04:21:39.420 align:start position:0%
public reactions to the project
 
04:21:41.269 --> 04:21:41.279 align:start position:0%
and it clarifies the Department's
 
04:21:44.330 --> 04:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
authority to fund its site evaluation
 
04:21:44.340 --> 04:21:47.210 align:start position:0%
authority to fund its site evaluation
actions

04:21:47.210 --> 04:21:47.220 align:start position:0%
actions
 
04:21:49.790 --> 04:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
now this is important legislation right
 
04:21:51.710 --> 04:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
now we have a dysfunctional site
 
04:21:53.510 --> 04:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee
 
04:21:55.670 --> 04:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
and we've got new energy projects that
 
04:21:57.830 --> 04:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
are coming down the pike that are going
 
04:21:59.570 --> 04:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
to have to go before the site evaluation
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
committee and without reforms like this
 
04:22:05.330 --> 04:22:05.340 align:start position:0%
those projects will get bogged down in a
 
04:22:09.170 --> 04:22:09.180 align:start position:0%
process that could delay them for years
 
04:22:17.269 --> 04:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:19.610 --> 04:22:19.620 align:start position:0%
now in addition to
 
04:22:24.290 --> 04:22:24.300 align:start position:0%
these major changes that HB 281 makes it
 
04:22:26.330 --> 04:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
retains the original
 
04:22:28.010 --> 04:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
language of the bill
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
which was to eliminate something called
 
04:22:32.510 --> 04:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
the least cost integrated resource
 
04:22:37.910 --> 04:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:40.790 --> 04:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
now back in the days when utilities own
 
04:22:43.010 --> 04:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
their own generation plants
 
04:22:45.050 --> 04:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
this was an important part of the
 
04:22:46.670 --> 04:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
planning process
 
04:22:48.610 --> 04:22:48.620 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't want to
 
04:22:51.650 --> 04:22:51.660 align:start position:0%
misjudge what your future electricity
 
04:22:54.889 --> 04:22:54.899 align:start position:0%
needs were going to be and build more a
 
04:22:56.929 --> 04:22:56.939 align:start position:0%
bigger power plant than you need
 
04:22:59.929 --> 04:22:59.939 align:start position:0%
or conversely not build enough of a
 
04:23:04.010 --> 04:23:04.020 align:start position:0%
power plant to supply that need
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
so resource planning was important back
 
04:23:10.550 --> 04:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
when the utilities owned generation
 
04:23:12.710 --> 04:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
but they don't anymore
 
04:23:15.050 --> 04:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
we fully divested
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
the ownership of generation from the
 
04:23:18.000 --> 04:23:19.550 align:start position:0%
the ownership of generation from the
utilities

04:23:19.550 --> 04:23:19.560 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
04:23:24.110 --> 04:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:29.090 --> 04:23:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.910 --> 04:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't do what some people think it
 
04:23:31.920 --> 04:23:33.710 align:start position:0%
it doesn't do what some people think it
does

04:23:33.710 --> 04:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
does
 
04:23:35.570 --> 04:23:35.580 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
04:23:40.910 --> 04:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
allow proposals to modernize the grid
 
04:23:44.210 --> 04:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
it doesn't require the utilities
 
04:23:46.550 --> 04:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
to go out and buy power from the
 
04:23:49.070 --> 04:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
cheapest source available
 
04:23:51.050 --> 04:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
none of that is part of resource
 
04:23:51.060 --> 04:23:54.110 align:start position:0%
none of that is part of resource
planning

04:23:54.110 --> 04:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:57.290 --> 04:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
what resource planning does do does it
 
04:23:59.210 --> 04:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
cost a lot of money for the utilities to
 
04:24:00.769 --> 04:24:00.779 align:start position:0%
write these plans
 
04:24:04.130 --> 04:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
and they pass those costs along to us
 
04:24:06.290 --> 04:24:06.300 align:start position:0%
and it costs a lot of money for the puc
 
04:24:08.210 --> 04:24:08.220 align:start position:0%
and the department of energy to review
 
04:24:11.630 --> 04:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:17.150 --> 04:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:21.050 --> 04:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
so this absolute stat obsolete statute
 
04:24:23.269 --> 04:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
has been removed according to the Senate
 
04:24:23.279 --> 04:24:25.370 align:start position:0%
has been removed according to the Senate
Amendment

04:24:25.370 --> 04:24:25.380 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:24:26.689 --> 04:24:26.699 align:start position:0%
pardon my
 
04:24:29.210 --> 04:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
forgetfulness and saying Senate when I
 
04:24:30.710 --> 04:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
mean the people on the other side of the
 
04:24:30.720 --> 04:24:35.210 align:start position:0%
mean the people on the other side of the
wall

04:24:35.210 --> 04:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:37.429 --> 04:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
in addition to
 
04:24:41.090 --> 04:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
removing the least least cost integrated
 
04:24:43.070 --> 04:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
resource planning statute
 
04:24:45.290 --> 04:24:45.300 align:start position:0%
which reduces the size of administrative
 
04:24:45.300 --> 04:24:48.290 align:start position:0%
which reduces the size of administrative
government

04:24:48.290 --> 04:24:48.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:52.910 --> 04:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
this bill also replaces the
 
04:24:55.189 --> 04:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and sustainable energy
 
04:24:57.530 --> 04:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
board with a smaller and more
 
04:24:59.450 --> 04:24:59.460 align:start position:0%
streamlined process within the
 
04:25:01.670 --> 04:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
department of energy
 
04:25:04.610 --> 04:25:04.620 align:start position:0%
which further reduces the size and the
 
04:25:08.809 --> 04:25:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:11.750 --> 04:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
so House Bill 281
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
is a winner as amended by our friends on
 
04:25:16.250 --> 04:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
the other side of the ball
 
04:25:18.110 --> 04:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
is a winner
 
04:25:20.210 --> 04:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
on five counts
 
04:25:23.450 --> 04:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
and I urge you to vote to concur
 
04:25:26.570 --> 04:25:26.580 align:start position:0%
with my motion to concur
 
04:25:28.729 --> 04:25:28.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker does the member
 
04:25:31.309 --> 04:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
yield for a question yes
 
04:25:33.410 --> 04:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
I'm Harrington you may inquire thank you
 
04:25:34.729 --> 04:25:34.739 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker and thank you member for
 
04:25:36.889 --> 04:25:36.899 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:25:39.290 --> 04:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
um just would you agree that the way the
 
04:25:41.630 --> 04:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
electric uh utility rates are actually
 
04:25:44.090 --> 04:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
set is by going out for competitive bid
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
every six months and that's how the
 
04:25:48.170 --> 04:25:48.180 align:start position:0%
default Service rates are actually set
 
04:25:50.149 --> 04:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
and Lease cost planning has no effect on
 
04:25:55.070 --> 04:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:57.349 --> 04:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
correct least cost integrated resource
 
04:25:59.929 --> 04:25:59.939 align:start position:0%
planning has no effect on what we pay
 
04:26:01.610 --> 04:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
for our electricity
 
04:26:05.330 --> 04:26:05.340 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis I also forgot to
 
04:26:05.340 --> 04:26:06.469 align:start position:0%
on a day-to-day basis I also forgot to
mention

04:26:06.469 --> 04:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
mention
 
04:26:06.479 --> 04:26:07.790 align:start position:0%
mention
that

04:26:07.790 --> 04:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:26:10.429 --> 04:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
the Senate also put into this bill
 
04:26:13.370 --> 04:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
House Bill 251 which we actually
 
04:26:16.969 --> 04:26:16.979 align:start position:0%
rejected a little while ago
 
04:26:20.689 --> 04:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
but the fact remains that
 
04:26:20.699 --> 04:26:22.010 align:start position:0%
but the fact remains that
statute

04:26:22.010 --> 04:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
statute
 
04:26:25.490 --> 04:26:25.500 align:start position:0%
still contains a requirement
 
04:26:27.889 --> 04:26:27.899 align:start position:0%
that the department of energy lists the
 
04:26:30.290 --> 04:26:30.300 align:start position:0%
cost of compliance with the renewable
 
04:26:32.870 --> 04:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
portfolio portfolio standard on your
 
04:26:36.050 --> 04:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
electric bill every year
 
04:26:42.229 --> 04:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
all this bill HB 28251 did was add a
 
04:26:45.170 --> 04:26:45.180 align:start position:0%
estimated yearly dollar figure to the
 
04:26:45.180 --> 04:26:45.950 align:start position:0%
estimated yearly dollar figure to the
bill

04:26:45.950 --> 04:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:26:50.330 --> 04:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:52.370 --> 04:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
so that is another reason that this bill
 
04:26:53.809 --> 04:26:53.819 align:start position:0%
is worthy of
 
04:26:58.729 --> 04:26:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:00.170 --> 04:27:00.180 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to concur with
 
04:27:03.530 --> 04:27:03.540 align:start position:0%
the Senate on House Bill 281
 
04:27:06.170 --> 04:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
representative McKee's requested a
 
04:27:08.030 --> 04:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
division vote members please take your
 
04:27:08.040 --> 04:27:19.010 align:start position:0%
division vote members please take your
seats

04:27:19.010 --> 04:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:19.020 --> 04:27:54.530 align:start position:0%
 
uh

04:27:54.530 --> 04:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:56.450 --> 04:27:56.460 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to concur with
 
04:27:59.450 --> 04:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
the Senate on House Bill 281
 
04:28:01.189 --> 04:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
representative Corman is recognized for
 
04:28:05.090 --> 04:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:06.889 --> 04:28:06.899 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker
 
04:28:09.410 --> 04:28:09.420 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that even though
 
04:28:11.570 --> 04:28:11.580 align:start position:0%
the utilities don't generate electricity
 
04:28:13.490 --> 04:28:13.500 align:start position:0%
they still have to build resources
 
04:28:15.410 --> 04:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
because after all it does have to get to
 
04:28:17.630 --> 04:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
your house one way or another
 
04:28:19.370 --> 04:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the underlying Bill
 
04:28:22.670 --> 04:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
HB 281 allows the utilities to build
 
04:28:25.070 --> 04:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
resources at more than the least cost
 
04:28:27.649 --> 04:28:27.659 align:start position:0%
which would leave rate payers on the
 
04:28:29.570 --> 04:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
hook for the excess costs
 
04:28:32.510 --> 04:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
and if I know that the other body tacked
 
04:28:34.689 --> 04:28:34.699 align:start position:0%
on four other house bills onto this one
 
04:28:37.910 --> 04:28:37.920 align:start position:0%
and two of these tacked on bills were
 
04:28:40.189 --> 04:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
retained in committee so that they have
 
04:28:42.710 --> 04:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
not been discussed in the house as a
 
04:28:42.720 --> 04:28:43.910 align:start position:0%
not been discussed in the house as a
body

04:28:43.910 --> 04:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
body
 
04:28:47.389 --> 04:28:47.399 align:start position:0%
and if I know that despite that we've
 
04:28:49.250 --> 04:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
heard that some Mayors are supporting
 
04:28:50.809 --> 04:28:50.819 align:start position:0%
this bill and actually some
 
04:28:53.330 --> 04:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
environmental groups are the bad parts
 
04:28:55.130 --> 04:28:55.140 align:start position:0%
of this bill outweigh the good and in
 
04:28:56.990 --> 04:28:57.000 align:start position:0%
fact there are environmental groups that
 
04:29:01.070 --> 04:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
recognize that and are against this bill
 
04:29:03.710 --> 04:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
then Mr Speaker would I press the red
 
04:29:06.110 --> 04:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
button and vote against concurring with
 
04:29:08.630 --> 04:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
the Amendments that turned this into a
 
04:29:11.750 --> 04:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:13.550 --> 04:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
representative versus recognized for
 
04:29:16.250 --> 04:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
parliamentary inquiry
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:21.410 --> 04:29:21.420 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker if I know that this bill
 
04:29:23.149 --> 04:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
House Bill 281
 
04:29:25.610 --> 04:29:25.620 align:start position:0%
includes an important expansion of
 
04:29:29.510 --> 04:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:32.630 --> 04:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
that is wanted by the mayor of Nashua
 
04:29:35.050 --> 04:29:35.060 align:start position:0%
the mayor of Keene and many other
 
04:29:37.969 --> 04:29:37.979 align:start position:0%
renewable energy Advocates without our
 
04:29:37.979 --> 04:29:40.849 align:start position:0%
renewable energy Advocates without our
state

04:29:40.849 --> 04:29:40.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:42.889 --> 04:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
if I know for example
 
04:29:46.130 --> 04:29:46.140 align:start position:0%
that those Mayors said recently and I
 
04:29:46.140 --> 04:29:47.570 align:start position:0%
that those Mayors said recently and I
quote

04:29:47.570 --> 04:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
quote
 
04:29:50.450 --> 04:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
the evidence is clear that HB 281 will
 
04:29:52.729 --> 04:29:52.739 align:start position:0%
do far more good than harm for our
 
04:29:55.610 --> 04:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
state's environment and economy
 
04:29:57.950 --> 04:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
let's take this opportunity to expand
 
04:29:59.689 --> 04:29:59.699 align:start position:0%
energy Independence for New Hampshire
 
04:30:02.510 --> 04:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
cities and towns while offsetting
 
04:30:04.370 --> 04:30:04.380 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of pounds of carbon
 
04:30:08.929 --> 04:30:08.939 align:start position:0%
pollution every year for decades to come
 
04:30:11.330 --> 04:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
and Mr Speaker if I also know that this
 
04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
bill contains other important important
 
04:30:17.630 --> 04:30:17.640 align:start position:0%
reforms to the site evaluation committee
 
04:30:19.910 --> 04:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
and finally Mr Speaker if I know that
 
04:30:21.070 --> 04:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:30:24.830 --> 04:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
reduces costs
 
04:30:28.130 --> 04:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
and administrative overhead for our
 
04:30:31.790 --> 04:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
utilities and reduces administrative
 
04:30:35.330 --> 04:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
burden for our regulatory bodies
 
04:30:37.429 --> 04:30:37.439 align:start position:0%
when I now place the green button to
 
04:30:42.710 --> 04:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:44.689 --> 04:30:44.699 align:start position:0%
the question is whether to concur with
 
04:30:46.910 --> 04:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate on House Bill 281 this is a
 
04:30:48.889 --> 04:30:48.899 align:start position:0%
division vote if you're in favor press
 
04:30:50.689 --> 04:30:50.699 align:start position:0%
the green button opposed press the red
 
04:31:23.150 --> 04:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:23.160 --> 04:31:37.969 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:31:40.550 --> 04:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:52.189 --> 04:31:52.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:54.170 --> 04:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
hello members present had an opportunity
 
04:31:55.250 --> 04:31:55.260 align:start position:0%
to vote
 
04:31:56.689 --> 04:31:56.699 align:start position:0%
the house will attend to the state of
 
04:31:58.689 --> 04:31:58.699 align:start position:0%
the vote
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
176 in the affirmative 180 in the
 
04:32:04.729 --> 04:32:04.739 align:start position:0%
negative the motion fails
 
04:32:07.969 --> 04:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
for what reason does a member rise
 
04:32:11.090 --> 04:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
Mr Speaker I move non-concur and request
 
04:32:13.189 --> 04:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
a committee of conference
 
04:32:15.170 --> 04:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
representative votes moves a thousand
 
04:32:16.670 --> 04:32:16.680 align:start position:0%
non-concurrent request to committee a
 
04:32:16.680 --> 04:32:22.450 align:start position:0%
non-concurrent request to committee a
conference

04:32:22.450 --> 04:32:22.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:25.189 --> 04:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
okay you ready for the what
 
04:32:27.110 --> 04:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
who did
 
04:32:28.490 --> 04:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
04:32:30.469 --> 04:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
representative Weber requests a division
 
04:32:31.849 --> 04:32:31.859 align:start position:0%
vote this will be a division vote
 
04:33:16.131 --> 04:33:16.141 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:17.269 --> 04:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
the question is whether or not
 
04:33:18.650 --> 04:33:18.660 align:start position:0%
concurrent request a committee a
 
04:33:21.709 --> 04:33:21.719 align:start position:0%
conference on House Bill 281
 
04:33:23.449 --> 04:33:23.459 align:start position:0%
representative McGee is recognized for
 
04:33:28.310 --> 04:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:29.929 --> 04:33:29.939 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:33:33.590 --> 04:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
if I know that this bill has more bad in
 
04:33:36.709 --> 04:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
it than good and if I know that the good
 
04:33:40.070 --> 04:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
in the bill was put there expressly to
 
04:33:43.369 --> 04:33:43.379 align:start position:0%
split us on whether or not we should let
 
04:33:44.689 --> 04:33:44.699 align:start position:0%
this bill go through for the good that
 
04:33:47.750 --> 04:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
it would do in order to get
 
04:33:50.510 --> 04:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
aspects of the law that we would not

thank you
 
04:40:51.170 --> 04:40:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Speaker this bill as it
 
04:40:52.970 --> 04:40:52.980 align:start position:0%
came to us was the complete
 
04:40:55.310 --> 04:40:55.320 align:start position:0%
restructuring of the board of
 
04:40:57.948 --> 04:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing this is not a
 
04:41:01.130 --> 04:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
regulatory board it's a quasi-judicial
 
04:41:04.630 --> 04:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
board to hear complaints from members of
 
04:41:07.788 --> 04:41:07.798 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing communities
 
04:41:10.970 --> 04:41:10.980 align:start position:0%
we heard a great deal of opposition from
 
04:41:13.310 --> 04:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
the members of the
 
04:41:15.770 --> 04:41:15.780 align:start position:0%
these communities against this
 
04:41:18.288 --> 04:41:18.298 align:start position:0%
restructuring they were violently
 
04:41:18.298 --> 04:41:20.150 align:start position:0%
restructuring they were violently
opposed

04:41:20.150 --> 04:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
04:41:22.670 --> 04:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
in fact the house position is at this
 
04:41:25.368 --> 04:41:25.378 align:start position:0%
board which has taken no action since at
 
04:41:29.868 --> 04:41:29.878 align:start position:0%
least 2019 is no longer necessary and
 
04:41:32.208 --> 04:41:32.218 align:start position:0%
therefore it was deleted in house bill
 
04:41:32.218 --> 04:41:33.650 align:start position:0%
therefore it was deleted in house bill
2.

04:41:33.650 --> 04:41:33.660 align:start position:0%
2.
 
04:41:33.660 --> 04:41:35.510 align:start position:0%
2.
so

04:41:35.510 --> 04:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:41:37.550 --> 04:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
the committee decided there was no need
 
04:41:39.350 --> 04:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
to restructure a board that we didn't
 
04:41:41.090 --> 04:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
see any need
 
04:41:43.990 --> 04:41:44.000 align:start position:0%
to continue and therefore we just
 
04:41:46.970 --> 04:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
amended the bill to say let's keep their
 
04:41:49.128 --> 04:41:49.138 align:start position:0%
history on the website for a few years
 
04:41:51.770 --> 04:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
and in case some other organization
 
04:41:54.350 --> 04:41:54.360 align:start position:0%
wants to take up
 
04:41:56.990 --> 04:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
settling these problems

aligning with the theme of yoga for the

vasudeva kutumbakam for the year which
 
04:59:46.910 --> 04:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
means a global family
 
04:59:49.730 --> 04:59:49.740 align:start position:0%
the word yoga is derived from the

Sanskrit root
 
04:59:55.128 --> 04:59:55.138 align:start position:0%
meaning to join
 
04:59:58.368 --> 04:59:58.378 align:start position:0%
or to yoke or to unite
 
05:00:01.610 --> 05:00:01.620 align:start position:0%

yoga leads to the union of individual
 
05:00:05.400 --> 05:00:06.948 align:start position:0%
yoga leads to the union of individual
consciousness

05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
consciousness
 
05:00:10.610 --> 05:00:10.620 align:start position:0%
with that of universal consciousness
 
05:00:14.208 --> 05:00:14.218 align:start position:0%
indicating a perfect harmony between the
 
05:00:19.128 --> 05:00:19.138 align:start position:0%
mind and the body man and nature
 
05:00:21.350 --> 05:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
human being and nature
 
05:00:25.730 --> 05:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
in essence it is a non-verbal process
 
05:00:29.990 --> 05:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
an inner Journey to the true center of
 
05:00:31.128 --> 05:00:31.138 align:start position:0%
the Soul
 
05:00:34.670 --> 05:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
which is the source of all happiness and
 
05:00:37.128 --> 05:00:37.138 align:start position:0%
ultimately of union or
 
05:00:37.138 --> 05:00:39.350 align:start position:0%
ultimately of union or
non-separativeness

05:00:39.350 --> 05:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
non-separativeness
 
05:00:42.948 --> 05:00:42.958 align:start position:0%
the inner Journey follows many
 
05:00:45.350 --> 05:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
concurrent paths
 
05:00:48.590 --> 05:00:48.600 align:start position:0%
the pursuit of personal integrity
 
05:00:50.868 --> 05:00:50.878 align:start position:0%
moral restraint
 
05:00:52.850 --> 05:00:52.860 align:start position:0%
physical exercise
 
05:00:55.430 --> 05:00:55.440 align:start position:0%
and breathing techniques
 
05:00:58.310 --> 05:00:58.320 align:start position:0%
and I'm just going to focus on breathing
 
05:01:02.030 --> 05:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
technique just for a brief moment
 
05:01:04.970 --> 05:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
this is called the pranayama or freedom
 
05:01:07.990 --> 05:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:13.310 --> 05:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
in Sanskrit means life force and IMR
 
05:01:15.708 --> 05:01:15.718 align:start position:0%
means to extend
 
05:01:19.910 --> 05:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
draw out restrain or control
 
05:01:23.448 --> 05:01:23.458 align:start position:0%
breathing is a normal part of our life
 
05:01:27.110 --> 05:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
and we often forget to pay attention to
 
05:01:27.120 --> 05:01:28.010 align:start position:0%
and we often forget to pay attention to
it

05:01:28.010 --> 05:01:28.020 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:01:32.208 --> 05:01:32.218 align:start position:0%
when the breath is steady so is the mind
 
05:01:35.830 --> 05:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
with breathing we can help to either
 
05:01:40.788 --> 05:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
calm or excite the entire nervous system
 
05:01:44.868 --> 05:01:44.878 align:start position:0%
when the breath becomes irregular and
 
05:01:49.310 --> 05:01:49.320 align:start position:0%
unsteady so is our mental status
 
05:01:53.470 --> 05:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
the ancient yogis measure the person's
 
05:01:56.690 --> 05:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
lifespan not by years by the number of
 
05:01:58.490 --> 05:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
his respiration
 
05:02:01.010 --> 05:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
they believed that everyone is allocated
 
05:02:04.788 --> 05:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
a fixed number of respirations in his or
 
05:02:06.530 --> 05:02:06.540 align:start position:0%
her lifetime
 
05:02:10.310 --> 05:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
breath is life life is breath
 
05:02:12.890 --> 05:02:12.900 align:start position:0%
keep breathing and let us have freedom
 
05:02:16.010 --> 05:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
to breathe breathing is fundamental to
 
05:02:23.770 --> 05:02:23.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:29.510 --> 05:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:31.550 --> 05:02:31.560 align:start position:0%

foot to head but Heroes bled for it
 
05:03:09.410 --> 05:03:09.420 align:start position:0%
