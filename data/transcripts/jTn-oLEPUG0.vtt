00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 align:start position:0%

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
it's let me start over here this is a
 
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 align:start position:0%
Community Conference for HB 1386 an act
 
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 align:start position:0%
relative to prohibiting the disposal of
 
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
lithium ion batteries and solid waste
 
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 align:start position:0%
landfill facilities composting
 
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
facilities or
 
00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
incinerators and we've all
 
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
been charged to come here today and uh
 
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 align:start position:0%
fix the difference that happened uh we
 
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 align:start position:0%
had the house version that went over to
 
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the Senate amended it and
 
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there was uh drafting
 
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
errors or whatever but um there was
 
00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 align:start position:0%
definitely some problems with the
 
00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 align:start position:0%
resulting version from the
 
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
Senate and I would uh now turn this over
 
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 align:start position:0%
to representative eil who eel who is the
 
00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor of this bill to explain um
 
00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
what happened and what needs to be fixed
 
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
to fix it okay all right there are very
 
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 align:start position:0%
few differences between the house
 
00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 align:start position:0%
version and the Senate version um but
 
00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 align:start position:0%
where this started was during the
 
00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB
 
00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 align:start position:0%
1386 um a staff person from uh the dees
 
00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh noted that there were a couple of
 
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 align:start position:0%
typographical type uh errors that should
 
00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
be fixed so uh one was inserting the
 
00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 align:start position:0%
word or in the definition of computer
 
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
and the other one was replacing the term
 
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
used as with used with in the definition
 
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
of computer monitor that was it and so
 
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 align:start position:0%
um a amendment was requested to correct
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
that and unfortunately although the
 
00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
language of the amendment was correct
 
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
the way it was set up it said that we
 
00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:56.199 align:start position:0%
were going to amend
 
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
1386 by replacing in the house version
 
00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
of the bill sections five and
 
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
six so what happened was uh the
 
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
definition of computer which was in
 
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
section four remained in the Senate bill
 
00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
so when the Senate version of the bill
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
came out it had the it had two
 
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
definitions of computer in it one the
 
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 align:start position:0%
old one and one the new
 
00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 align:start position:0%
one um so there the Senate version now
 
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
has two ver two definitions of computer
 
00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 align:start position:0%
one of which needs to be removed in my
 
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
opinion um and then the other thing um
 
00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
that I
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
did that was done as part of the um as
 
00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:44.759 align:start position:0%
part of the drafting of the
 
00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
bill in the
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
statute uh section four was combined
 
00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 align:start position:0%
with section two section four had to do
 
00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 align:start position:0%
with um with ewaste and section two was
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
the one that had this the information
 
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
about wet cell batteries that we added
 
00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 align:start position:0%
to so by combining four and
 
00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:13.759 align:start position:0%
two um section uh we basically had to
 
00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:16.800 align:start position:0%
get rid of the old section four and
 
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in the Senate process the
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
necessary repeal language was deleted
 
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
and so in my
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment um I've reinstated the repeal
 
00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
the necessary repeal
 
00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
language so I can show you uh basically
 
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
the the in my Amendment if you've got it
 
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.510 align:start position:0%
the the in my Amendment if you've got it
2146

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
2146
 
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:46.160 align:start position:0%
H um we also discovered that there was
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
another missing or and another
 
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 align:start position:0%
word there's a lot of ores in here so
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
what's new here so first of all okay so
 
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 align:start position:0%
the old comp old definition of computer
 
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
is being
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
removed um and in the and then on line
 
00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:06.319 align:start position:0%
five before the word electrochemical
 
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
I've got the word or and after the word
 
00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:11.879 align:start position:0%
electrical chemical I've got the word
 
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 align:start position:0%
data so this all makes sense on line six
 
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.000 align:start position:0%
before the word storage we've added the
 
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.150 align:start position:0%
before the word storage we've added the
word

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
or on the word on line 11 before the
 
00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:28.759 align:start position:0%
term a computer we have used with and
 
00:07:32.589 --> 00:07:32.599 align:start position:0%
then on line not uh 14 I've reinstated
 
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
the necessary repeal language and that's
 
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
difference I mean really the the the
 
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
Senate amendment was fine it's just the
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
way I don't think any of us focused on
 
00:07:54.749 --> 00:07:54.759 align:start position:0%
the fact that they were inserting it as
 
00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
section they were replacing sections
 
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
five and six um and it kind of messed
 
00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:02.560 align:start position:0%
and there was no renumbering and it kind
 
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
of messed with everything so it's
 
00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:09.479 align:start position:0%
basically a shift represent BBY so um
 
00:08:11.309 --> 00:08:11.319 align:start position:0%
procedurally is the next thing we do
 
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
make a motion to accept the amendment
 
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
well I'd like to hear from rep uh
 
00:08:19.629 --> 00:08:19.639 align:start position:0%
Senator Pearl on his thoughts on this
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning thank you
 
00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:22.879 align:start position:0%
representative evil looks like you did a
 
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
good job the fixing and cleaning up the
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
error that was made I think it was just
 
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:29.800 align:start position:0%
a drafting error as you stated because
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
this this seems to
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
uh seems to further the intent of the
 
00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:37.680 align:start position:0%
Senate what we were trying to do by I'm
 
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
reading it and doing a little clean up
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
here so I I don't think we'd have any
 
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:45.080 align:start position:0%
objection to this so you'd be fine with
 
00:08:48.269 --> 00:08:48.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment yes okay um so then I
 
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:50.600 align:start position:0%
guess uh as a as a body of committee
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
here shall we uh make a motion to accept
 
00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
the amendment so move second okay um so
 
00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
so represent Craton moves
 
00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.430 align:start position:0%
so represent Craton moves
to

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.350 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.350 align:start position:0%
 
246h

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
246h
 
00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
and oh you second you you you moved okay
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.990 align:start position:0%
 
moved

00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
moved
 
00:09:41.829 --> 00:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
okay so um I guess I don't need to call
 
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
the role but
 
00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:47.519 align:start position:0%
