yep so just a couple of highlights i
would

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
i would i would put for the committee um
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
first of course you know we're con we've
 
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
continued through this whole pandemic at
 
00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 align:start position:0%
the department
 
00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
um really working uh with our business
 
00:06:01.029 --> 00:06:01.039 align:start position:0%
community and with stakeholders around
 
00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 align:start position:0%
the state on a whole host of issues
 
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 align:start position:0%
at the least of which is uh working with
 
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
the gopher
 
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
team which is in our office at the bea
 
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.189 align:start position:0%
team which is in our office at the bea
and

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 align:start position:0%
making those programs work effectively
 
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.550 align:start position:0%
making those programs work effectively
together

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
overall our budget for this upcoming
 
00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 align:start position:0%
biennium is proposed at a 17
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
reduction in general fund expenditures
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
over the previous biennium i'm going to
 
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
walk through
 
00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:25.120 align:start position:0%
a couple of quick highlights for each of
 
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
our major divisions the first being the
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
division of economic development
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned this staff has been
 
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
really central to our
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
response to the recovery uh and
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
throughout this pandemic over the last
 
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
couple of months
 
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
we do have some new leadership down at
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
our office of workforce opportunity
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
and they've been really active in
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
working with employers
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
who are struggling and looking for
 
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
services around rapid response and
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
those types of programs and and we work
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
very closely with our friends at
 
00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
employment security
 
00:06:59.430 --> 00:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh on that front in the ded budget we
 
00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
see a reduction of roughly 13 in general
 
00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759 align:start position:0%
fund expenditures
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
which are the three handouts that we
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
have here i'm sorry the handouts that i
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
gave you is one the letter in response
 
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
to your questions
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i got that and now we've got three
 
00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets so i don't know which one
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
to look
 
00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
there are two spreadsheets and i haven't
 
00:07:17.589 --> 00:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
gotten to those yet okay um
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
um and i'll i'll let you know so where
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
in your budget should we look then
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
because we do have your budget so the
 
00:07:24.790 --> 00:07:24.800 align:start position:0%
budget you're talking about where should
 
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:25.029 align:start position:0%
budget you're talking about where should
we

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
i'm just giving you the overall
 
00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
highlights the reduction numbers all
 
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
um we could skip all that if you'd like
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
i'll just get right to it we just
 
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
look at those pesky details you know how
 
00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
we are well they didn't have percentages
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
so i thought i would i would give you
 
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:37.990 align:start position:0%
so i thought i would i would give you
some

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay um so the uh the reduction that we
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
saw in dd is primarily in our marketing
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
class lines and the travel budgets are
 
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
obviously reduced
 
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of our travelers normally to
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
conferences recruitment efforts
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
and our international team does travel
 
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.830 align:start position:0%
and our international team does travel
internationally

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
internationally
 
00:07:57.189 --> 00:07:57.199 align:start position:0%
normally of course we're not going to
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
have that at least in the fir in fiscal
 
00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:01.919 align:start position:0%
year 22 from our understanding and
 
00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
probably at a limited amount in 23.
 
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
and also we did take a look at all of
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
the subscription services that we use
 
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
many of which we could probably be
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
without for for uh for this coming year
 
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.390 align:start position:0%
without for for uh for this coming year
and

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
share some data resources with other
 
00:08:18.869 --> 00:08:18.879 align:start position:0%
agencies if necessary
 
00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:22.160 align:start position:0%
over at travel and tourism um this uh
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
this obviously continues to be something
 
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
that is really important to us
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
given the role the the impact that's
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
occurred to the hospitality industry
 
00:08:33.909 --> 00:08:33.919 align:start position:0%
over the last couple of months
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
particularly we maintained some level of
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
marketing activity in key markets
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic
 
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
but overall that reduction amounted to
 
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
about 3.1 million dollars that
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
of our in our summer campaign last year
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
that we did not spend
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
that um under accounting unit 2019 is a
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing fund so
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
that's going to continue to turn through
 
00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
this coming summer
 
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:03.360 align:start position:0%
fall and winter campaigns um
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
but we did a lot of in-state marketing
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
with those resources this year
 
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
we did the early on when it was to stay
 
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:11.600 align:start position:0%
at home
 
00:09:13.509 --> 00:09:13.519 align:start position:0%
we wanted people to be able to stay
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
within new hampshire
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
and so we did a lot of marketing in that
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
respect also
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
in support of small businesses with our
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
a couple of campaigns that we ran
 
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
stronger together uh emphasizing the
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
need for people to get out
 
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
when they can safely and uh and and
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
visit local businesses and restaurants
 
00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
um so overall the travel tourism
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
reduction for this biennium is
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
roughly about 20 general fund reductions
 
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:42.870 align:start position:0%
roughly about 20 general fund reductions
again

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
most of that is in the reduction uh of
 
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
our marketing budgets
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
um but also we did eliminate the
 
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:53.120 align:start position:0%
film office within the division of
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
travel and tourism
 
00:09:56.949 --> 00:09:56.959 align:start position:0%
we made reductions of about a hundred
 
00:09:58.710 --> 00:09:58.720 align:start position:0%
and fifty thousand dollars per year in
 
00:10:00.949 --> 00:10:00.959 align:start position:0%
the joint promotional program
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh and again in the out of state travel
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
category we saw some
 
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
pretty significant reductions there
 
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
in the bureau of visitor services which
 
00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
is the rest areas and welcome centers
 
00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
they were closed for a good portion of
 
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
the pandemic in the height of the
 
00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.069 align:start position:0%
the pandemic in the height of the
pandemic

00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
pandemic
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
we're currently operating at a somewhat
 
00:10:19.269 --> 00:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
reduced schedule
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
slightly fewer hours and then closed on
 
00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:23.839 align:start position:0%
tuesdays and thursdays
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
this is a result of some reductions we
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
made in expenditures but also it's
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult to find people
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
at this point to staff the work uh staff
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
the centers
 
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
so that's been an ongoing challenge for
 
00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
our staff there overall
 
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
between the turnpike and general funds
 
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
that reduction was around 15
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
total and then um
 
00:10:47.829 --> 00:10:47.839 align:start position:0%
the hb2 provisions that uh
 
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh i wanted to address there's a couple
 
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
in there but the highlights really i
 
00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:53.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned the film office
 
00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
we do have hb2 things as well yep
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
54. section 54. so if you're at home
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
looking at this section 54.
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
so that's a reduction by by cutting that
 
00:11:19.839 --> 00:11:21.110 align:start position:0%
so that's a reduction by by cutting that
office

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
savings about 265 000 of the biennium
 
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:27.980 align:start position:0%
and one labor grade 29 position
 
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.590 align:start position:0%
and one labor grade 29 position
[Music]

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
most of it is salary and benefits cost
 
00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
obviously the film industry has changed
 
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.389 align:start position:0%
obviously the film industry has changed
substantially

00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
substantially
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
and that office was
 
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
really something that we can handle
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
within our division of travel
 
00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:46.480 align:start position:0%
tourism is our feeling on that
 
00:11:49.030 --> 00:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
on the economic development fund i know
 
00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
you had a question about that which is
 
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
under section 52.
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
hb2 that is just ex that that
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
the language in that was meant to just
 
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
be a housekeeping
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
references to organizations that no
 
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
longer exist
 
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
so we just replaced some of those with
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
some of our current stakeholders like
 
00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
chambers of commerce and regional
 
00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:15.680 align:start position:0%
development corporations and so on
 
00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
there's no money in that fund
 
00:12:21.269 --> 00:12:21.279 align:start position:0%
but that you know with the anticipation
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
potentially of
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
stimulus funds from washington
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
potentially flowing through
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
state agencies i just wanted to update
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
that one section so that's the only
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's nothing substantive other than
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
some changes in housekeeping measures
 
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.030 align:start position:0%
some changes in housekeeping measures
there

00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
i'm the director of intergovernmental
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
affairs which is
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
section 53 53 thank you
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
um that is taking an existing classified
 
00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:49.750 align:start position:0%
um that is taking an existing classified
position

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
and transferring it to an unclassified
 
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.030 align:start position:0%
and transferring it to an unclassified
position

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
the goal there would be to keep that a
 
00:12:56.550 --> 00:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
cost neutral
 
00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
transition the reason for that change is
 
00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.310 align:start position:0%
transition the reason for that change is
that

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
we do a tremendous amount of work with
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
other state agencies with local
 
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.110 align:start position:0%
other state agencies with local
governments

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
governments
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
with town managers and with the federal
 
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.350 align:start position:0%
with town managers and with the federal
government

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
and here with the legislature and so
 
00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:16.639 align:start position:0%
having a position that can cut across
 
00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
all of our divisional areas
 
00:13:20.389 --> 00:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
economic development travel tourism
 
00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
workforce development and so on
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
um is a position that i feel strongly
 
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
that we need to be able to have
 
00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:29.200 align:start position:0%
um so that we are consistent in those
 
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.069 align:start position:0%
um so that we are consistent in those
relationships

00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
relationships
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
what is the current title of that
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
position the current
 
00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:35.839 align:start position:0%
title is an industrial agent at large
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
grade 25.
 
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
and you're proposing to take it to what
 
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.550 align:start position:0%
and you're proposing to take it to what
grade

00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
grade
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
well i do believe it's subject to a
 
00:13:43.829 --> 00:13:43.839 align:start position:0%
market analysis but
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
we uh looked at grade cc
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
as an equivalent to the current grade
 
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:50.389 align:start position:0%
as an equivalent to the current grade
level

00:13:50.389 --> 00:13:50.399 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
what's the difference in the salary
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
salary would be
 
00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.350 align:start position:0%
salary would be
uh

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
approximately that would save around
 
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
fourteen hundred dollars per year
 
00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
assuming that it came through they would
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
get a lower salary slightly lower yes
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
overall it would be a little lower we
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
were at a step five for that labor grade
 
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.590 align:start position:0%
were at a step five for that labor grade
25

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
25
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
this would be a grade cc step one
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
and does he know you or she know you're
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
proposing to lower their
 
00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
yearly intake uh there's no one in the
 
00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
position currently
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
so it's currently vacant that's right so
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
it was uh
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
someone left and went to another agency
 
00:14:32.389 --> 00:14:32.399 align:start position:0%
so i took advantage of that
 
00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
so we're not lowering anybody's no ma'am
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry i should have made that
 
00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:37.690 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry i should have made that
clear

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:37.700 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:38.870 align:start position:0%
clear
[Music]

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
excellent point however um
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
the last piece here really uh all go
 
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.350 align:start position:0%
the last piece here really uh all go
together

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
and are some of the handouts that i gave
 
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:48.470 align:start position:0%
and are some of the handouts that i gave
you

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
are with regard to the office of
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
planning and development
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
which uh under hb2 um in the transition
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
to the new department of energy would
 
00:14:57.279 --> 00:14:58.310 align:start position:0%
to the new department of energy would
move

00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
move
 
00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
that division from the office of
 
00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:02.240 align:start position:0%
strategic initiatives
 
00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
to the department of business and
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
economic affairs
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
there was some money that was
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
accommodated for
 
00:15:12.629 --> 00:15:12.639 align:start position:0%
in the osi budget for
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
um for them for the move over but we
 
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:16.560 align:start position:0%
will have to
 
00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
expand the lease that we have in our
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
offices across the street
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
at 100 north main street in order to
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
accommodate additional staff
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
so that's the primary source of the
 
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.000 align:start position:0%
supplemental requests that i handed out
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
to you
 
00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
those costs all total between moving
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
and new lease costs a new printer rental
 
00:15:43.350 --> 00:15:43.360 align:start position:0%
and some small additional telecom and
 
00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.230 align:start position:0%
and some small additional telecom and
doit

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:44.240 align:start position:0%
doit
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
costs comes to um
 
00:15:49.829 --> 00:15:49.839 align:start position:0%
eighty thousand dollars in fy twenty two
 
00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:51.920 align:start position:0%
and sixty thousand dollar roughly
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
in fy23 i have also
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
added in here um
 
00:16:01.590 --> 00:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
a request for 20 000 in
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
each fiscal year for employee training
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
for the office of planning
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh this is an area where uh we did this
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
with our
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
economic development staff when we moved
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
them over from dred and it was highly
 
00:16:15.990 --> 00:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
effective in getting them up to speed on
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
everything that's going on i
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
am not aware that that's been made
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
available to that staff for some time
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
now so i did put that request in there
 
00:16:27.189 --> 00:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
um as it relates to um the planning
 
00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:31.269 align:start position:0%
um as it relates to um the planning
division

00:16:31.269 --> 00:16:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
what are the titles of the people you're
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
getting you're getting six people right
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
yes um i'm going on memory now
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
ma'am it's uh out i think there's a 20
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
labor grade 27
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
um at uh in two two or
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
two twenty four two twenty fives and
 
00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
maybe a twenty three
 
00:16:53.430 --> 00:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to get back to you on
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
the exact numbers i don't have that
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
so i can tell you the representative
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
leishman's going to ask you a question
 
00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that the governor's
 
00:17:08.549 --> 00:17:08.559 align:start position:0%
budget director
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
has said this is cost neutral there will
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
be no additional cost
 
00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
so they apparently are not including
 
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
any of these increases that you're
 
00:17:18.799 --> 00:17:19.669 align:start position:0%
any of these increases that you're
requesting

00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
00:17:22.949 --> 00:17:22.959 align:start position:0%
is that correct uh our assessment is at
 
00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
this point that we would have to have
 
00:17:25.669 --> 00:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
somewhere to put them
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
and that that cost was not anticipated
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
when they
 
00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.360 align:start position:0%
um when they the the transmission
 
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
we have yet to hear from the governor's
 
00:17:37.669 --> 00:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
budget director but he is coming to talk
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
about the department
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
of energy and the reorgan we knew six
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
people had gone to you so i just wanted
 
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:43.990 align:start position:0%
people had gone to you so i just wanted
to

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:44.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
be sure representation you had to put
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
your hand up
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:55.210 align:start position:0%
i'm curious on
 
00:17:55.210 --> 00:17:58.950 align:start position:0%
i'm curious on
[Music]

00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
centers

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
um that was in the category of difficult
 
00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:26.799 align:start position:0%
budget decisions to be made
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
i think yes as you indicate we have a
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
a good relationship with the sbdc
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
somewhere right after that is the irc
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
which is another program that we fund
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh the university of new hampshire to um
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
to invest either it is it's i'm sorry
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
accounting unit 1457.
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh that those two programs are both
 
00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
funds that we provide the university of
 
00:18:58.470 --> 00:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
as match to grants that they apply for
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
from the united states small business
 
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.950 align:start position:0%
from the united states small business
administration

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.240 align:start position:0%
the decision was made that those two
 
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.590 align:start position:0%
the decision was made that those two
programs

00:19:09.590 --> 00:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
probably could find some additional
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
income from
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
other sources to carry the program
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
for the biennium and so that's the
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
reason why
 
00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
we had to make that difficult decision i
 
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:24.720 align:start position:0%
know that
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
the governor sent over a supplemental
 
00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:30.390 align:start position:0%
the governor sent over a supplemental
priority

00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
request was it last week and
 
00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:37.039 align:start position:0%
the restoring that to the 315 was
 
00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:38.070 align:start position:0%
the restoring that to the 315 was
included

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:38.080 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
in that priority request so this remains
 
00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
an open question in our budget however
 
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:44.640 align:start position:0%
we zeroed those two programs
 
00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
i think the governor sent that over as
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
an additional request because i did let
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
the budget director know that
 
00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:52.160 align:start position:0%
none of us had usable emails anymore
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
because we've been flooded with people
 
00:19:55.990 --> 00:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
complaining about the cut in the small
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
business development center
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
so it has really hit
 
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
a note with many of our constituents yes
 
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:05.669 align:start position:0%
a note with many of our constituents yes
ma'am

00:20:05.669 --> 00:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
ma'am
 
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:08.250 align:start position:0%
i have heard from them as well
 
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.750 align:start position:0%
i have heard from them as well
[Music]

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
if you can hold that one because we are
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
going to have the governor's
 
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
budget director come and talk to us in
 
00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.990 align:start position:0%
budget director come and talk to us in
general

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
general
 
00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
and i think the commissioner probably
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
was asked to take the planning people as
 
00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
part of it but not did not initiate it
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
so that's a very valid question
 
00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:42.880 align:start position:0%
but maybe we could hold that until we
 
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
get uh
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
mr melu in here and he will be happy to
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay one more and then representative
 
00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
waltz will follow you
 
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:10.549 align:start position:0%
 
leitchman

00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
that's correct so they they uh they
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
they're required to provide a match
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
in order to access the federal resource
 
00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
and and again there isn't any statutory
 
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
requirement that the state
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
provide that match so that was what we
 
00:21:28.710 --> 00:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
were hanging our hat on as it relates to
 
00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
being able to find a reduction
 
00:21:34.549 --> 00:21:34.559 align:start position:0%
that was sufficient to meet the targets
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative walls yes and i just
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to say
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
i didn't know if the commissioner was
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
aware that we had i'd heard from the
 
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:46.470 align:start position:0%
aware that we had i'd heard from the
small

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
business development council and they
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
said they will have to shut down without
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
this state money
 
00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
that whatever you think is coming on a
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
federal match is apparently not and is
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
not enough to keep them open and the
 
00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:57.990 align:start position:0%
not enough to keep them open and the
director

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
personally told me she expects that they
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
will have to shut down if they do not
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
get this money
 
00:22:04.310 --> 00:22:04.320 align:start position:0%
so i just wanted to correct any
 
00:22:06.549 --> 00:22:06.559 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding about that and perhaps
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
suggest that you may want to reach out
 
00:22:09.669 --> 00:22:09.679 align:start position:0%
to her and hear from yourself
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
how dire this cut would be
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am i i have spoken to liz
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
and with
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
dean merrill sands at university of new
 
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:21.830 align:start position:0%
dean merrill sands at university of new
hampshire

00:22:21.830 --> 00:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh commissioner i think
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay let's uh move
 
00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
taylor why don't you pull that
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
microphone closer to you i don't know
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
how sensitive they are
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
but if representative hatch is having
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
troll i know in
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
and now he's shaking his head thank you
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
is that better representative can you
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
hear me better
 
00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
i could always um hear you commissioner
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's just uh
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
other people asking questions i had
 
00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:02.240 align:start position:0%
trouble hearing actually what you did
 
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
pull it back because it's a little more
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
fuzzy there that's better
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you madam chair
 
00:23:11.669 --> 00:23:11.679 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative patch
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
asking i'm sorry mountain chair it's a
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
participant asking
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
questions that i can't hear i'm i'm not
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
sure about bearing best but thank you
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative emery and you
 
00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
pull that microphone a little closer as
 
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.390 align:start position:0%
pull that microphone a little closer as
well

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam i could not hear
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
representative leishman either i was
 
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
getting a little bit
 
00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
his we're addressing that mary beth
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
we're addressing this
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
but one at a time and now as
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
representative emerick's got his hand up
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
i i fairly stubborn on the small
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
business development center
 
00:23:45.029 --> 00:23:45.039 align:start position:0%
because it looks like if you look at
 
00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
their performance
 
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
their return on investments very high
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
and i know i know several businesses in
 
00:23:55.830 --> 00:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
my town and immediate area
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
that they've supported and have cont
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
continued to consult with i know they
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
have representation throughout the state
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
so it's not a concord-centric operation
 
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:16.480 align:start position:0%
their performance is stellar
 
00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
so i don't know what measurement you use
 
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
to say let's don't have performance
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
let's have
 
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:24.720 align:start position:0%
somebody else pay for it i i think
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
you're shooting your feet off here
 
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh because i look up up above the
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
federal funds that are coming in for
 
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:31.750 align:start position:0%
federal funds that are coming in for
workforce

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
workforce
 
00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity and you said that's working
 
00:24:35.669 --> 00:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
with main street businesses
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh due to the pandemic and the feds seem
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
to want to invest a lot of money in that
 
00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh and and we're throwing in for 75 000
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
and then eighty thousand the next
 
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:48.950 align:start position:0%
and then eighty thousand the next
biennium

00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
i'd i'm i'm at a loss quite honestly is
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
that you would discontinue something so
 
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:55.990 align:start position:0%
that you would discontinue something so
successful

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
successful
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
out of hand well again our intention is
 
00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
not to discontinue the program
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
we believe that the program can continue
 
00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
to operate with additional funding
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
perhaps even from the university of new
 
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.750 align:start position:0%
perhaps even from the university of new
hampshire

00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
as a match if that's not the case then
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
by all means i think that that's
 
00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
something that this committee should
 
00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:14.870 align:start position:0%
something that this committee should
review

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
i would also say that as relates to the
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
office of workforce opportunity those
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
are funds that we receive from the
 
00:25:20.559 --> 00:25:21.190 align:start position:0%
are funds that we receive from the
division

00:25:21.190 --> 00:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
department of labor to provide adult
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
dislocation services
 
00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
for workforce development and for rapid
 
00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.070 align:start position:0%
for workforce development and for rapid
response

00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
response
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
to businesses that are unfortunately
 
00:25:34.549 --> 00:25:34.559 align:start position:0%
having to lay off individuals
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
plus the youth displacement programs
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
which provide
 
00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
resources for students that are have
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
dropped out of high school are in danger
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
of dropping after high school in order
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
to give them
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
training for workforce so so i think
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
that there is
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
we when we had to look at the priorities
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
of the department
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
workforce became a high priority for our
 
00:25:54.159 --> 00:25:55.430 align:start position:0%
workforce became a high priority for our
department

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:57.440 align:start position:0%
across the board that's what employers
 
00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
are most concerned with at this point
 
00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that it was an easy
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
decision to come up with these numbers
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
that we put in here for the sbdc or the
 
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
ir city
 
00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:09.840 align:start position:0%
but in the scope of what we were asked
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to come up with in terms of
 
00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:12.149 align:start position:0%
to be able to come up with in terms of
targets

00:26:12.149 --> 00:26:12.159 align:start position:0%
targets
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of reduction of close to 20 of
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
our general fund budget
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
um those were unfortunate decisions that
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
we had to make
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
and i don't disagree with your
 
00:26:23.029 --> 00:26:23.039 align:start position:0%
assessment as to the effectiveness of
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
the program but i do think that there
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
would be other opportunities
 
00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
in a crisis situation to find additional
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
funding to make that match for a period
 
00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:32.480 align:start position:0%
of a year or two years
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
commissioner let me give you a little
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
fact of life for house finance
 
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:40.640 align:start position:0%
we have to have the budget finished and
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
approved by the end of march because
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
of house deadlines and you have you have
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
time for lba to get things together
 
00:26:49.029 --> 00:26:49.039 align:start position:0%
moving on
 
00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
we don't even have final march revenues
 
00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:52.240 align:start position:0%
we know that
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
and then business taxes as you and i
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
both know come in
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
in april and may and that's a big jump
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
so when we when the budget gets
 
00:27:02.630 --> 00:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
to the senate the senate always has
 
00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:04.880 align:start position:0%
actually more dollars than we had
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to balance here and
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
there and i can tell you that
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
probably what you're going to see happen
 
00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
is some of your funding in some areas
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
are going to get cut in order to put
 
00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
some money back into the small business
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
development center we hear what you're
 
00:27:22.630 --> 00:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
saying we're hopeful when it gets to the
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
senate the economy keeps turning around
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
they've got the money
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
anything we cut here you can restore
 
00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
plus get some money out to small
 
00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.269 align:start position:0%
plus get some money out to small
business

00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
centers so i think we hear you but i
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
also think we're going to have to make
 
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.950 align:start position:0%
also think we're going to have to make
some

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
decisions we feel like there needs to be
 
00:27:40.870 --> 00:27:40.880 align:start position:0%
a little more money in there so
 
00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to work with you to
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
make that happen at the least amount of
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
impact we appreciate where you were
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
coming from and
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
you're i guess i'm going to say
 
00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
restraints because i know what the
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
governor was dealing with during the
 
00:27:56.149 --> 00:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
pandemic and you guys started this
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
last summer which most people don't know
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
so while most of us were home
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
pandemic was really raging you're trying
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
to work on a budget for the next two
 
00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
years so we appreciate the work
 
00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
you're gonna just expect to see a few
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
cuts and go the senate
 
00:28:13.590 --> 00:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm gonna say to gary daniels and
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
chuck morris listen we know you got more
 
00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
money here's what we had to do we didn't
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
like but we
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
we need to have money in there so
 
00:28:21.430 --> 00:28:21.440 align:start position:0%
representative emerick did you have a
 
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.190 align:start position:0%
representative emerick did you have a
follow-up

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
no madam chair i feel we're moving into
 
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
an argumentative position yeah we're not
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
going to argue with him because he knows
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
what he had to do we understand it was
 
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:34.240 align:start position:0%
he was making a budget last summer which
 
00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think a lot of people in the
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
public understand these
 
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
budget books of a thousand pages don't
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
show up
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
overnight after november when we're
 
00:28:44.149 --> 00:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
getting a little better so
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
we do know that could you answer a
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
question for me on
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
workforce opportunity what do you use
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
your general funds for and where would i
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
find those
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
and i'm looking at page 588 where i see
 
00:28:58.710 --> 00:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
the general funds are you you're
 
00:29:00.149 --> 00:29:00.159 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized were 80
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
021 you cut it to about 76 and 22
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
and back up to 8023 what do you spend
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
those on and where are those because
 
00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
that might be an area we kind of cut
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
back because i can see
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
that several years ago in 2020 you only
 
00:29:21.029 --> 00:29:21.039 align:start position:0%
spent 200
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
and now i've got a little money i can
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
put it into small business which
 
00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:27.760 align:start position:0%
clearly there's a feeling across the
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
state we need to refund
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
we need to fund it some level
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am i see that i don't have a good
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
answer for you right now but that
 
00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:36.789 align:start position:0%
answer for you right now but that
program

00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
is almost exclusively federally funded i
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
can see that
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
yep uh and so i'm going to uh have to
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
say that i would give you that
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
information later today
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
that would be fine thank you i mean now
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
we're looking to cut we're looking to
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
cut some general fund pennies that don't
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
 you hoping what happens in the
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
senate you heard me
 
00:30:00.389 --> 00:30:00.399 align:start position:0%
you know where we're going yes ma'am we
 
00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
know the constraints you were under we
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to work with you on all

please continue if you could
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
um i think i pretty much hit everything
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
that i was going to
 
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:17.120 align:start position:0%
um we um go to your budget
 
00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
and why don't we just leaf through
 
00:30:23.669 --> 00:30:23.679 align:start position:0%
and ask our questions so uh for
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
and do i see any questions from
 
00:30:56.470 --> 00:30:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.029 --> 00:30:59.039 align:start position:0%
represent walls yeah i have a general
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
question that it's precipitated by this
 
00:31:01.669 --> 00:31:01.679 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
are there going to be any layoffs within
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
your department
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
he's laid off one position i believe he
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
spoke to that
 
00:31:13.269 --> 00:31:13.279 align:start position:0%
he's repealed that entire agency
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
the only positions he's gaining are
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
gifts from the department of energy
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
reorganization which
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
um the governor's budget director will
 
00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
come speak and answer
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
all of our questions on that he is being
 
00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
scheduled for that and he knows that
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct isn't it correct i knew
 
00:31:33.669 --> 00:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
it was defunded it was not clear to me
 
00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
with the paper available to me whether
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
there was an actual layoff so thank you
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:43.350 --> 00:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
i think that's you'll find that in your
 
00:31:46.710 --> 00:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
budget book all right let's turn to
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
page 580 and you talked in
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
in general about the safety rest areas
 
00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:53.120 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
an area my friend represent patch
 
00:31:58.830 --> 00:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
frequently has a question on
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
um representative burris do you have a
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
question on this
 
00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
yes thank you commissioner for being
 
00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:07.669 align:start position:0%
yes thank you commissioner for being
here

00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
um up north in coast county on route two
 
00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
between uh which goes east to west
 
00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.190 align:start position:0%
between uh which goes east to west
between

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
maine and vermont you're aware that
 
00:32:19.029 --> 00:32:19.039 align:start position:0%
there are no rest areas
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
yes we constantly representative hatch
 
00:32:22.389 --> 00:32:22.399 align:start position:0%
to myself being
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
from coast county he i'm from berlin
 
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
he's from gorham
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
continuously get complaints because of
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
the lack of arrest area
 
00:32:32.230 --> 00:32:32.240 align:start position:0%
are there any plans in the near future
 
00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
to restore that
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
well i know we've had discussion um
 
00:32:39.029 --> 00:32:39.039 align:start position:0%
with representative hatch and d.o.t on
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
the shelburne the former shelburne
 
00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:43.029 align:start position:0%
the shelburne the former shelburne
restaurant

00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
and i believe now my recollection was
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
that when we
 
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
worked with dot they were in the midst
 
00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:50.149 align:start position:0%
worked with dot they were in the midst
of

00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
transferring ownership of that property
 
00:32:54.549 --> 00:32:54.559 align:start position:0%
to a local campground
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
when we had this discussion two years
 
00:32:58.950 --> 00:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
ago i believe that since then
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
um that deal has fallen apart
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative hatch may know better
 
00:33:02.789 --> 00:33:02.799 align:start position:0%
than i do
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
and he's got his hand up so he'll yeah
 
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:08.840 align:start position:0%
and and so my understanding is that that
 
00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.149 align:start position:0%
and and so my understanding is that that
property

00:33:10.149 --> 00:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
property
 
00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:12.640 align:start position:0%
as one of i think it was about five or
 
00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.190 align:start position:0%
as one of i think it was about five or
six

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
rest areas that were closed prior to my
 
00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
time here
 
00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:21.279 align:start position:0%
remains closed and vacant
 
00:33:24.630 --> 00:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
and in dot ownership but other than that
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of any other opportunities
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
on route 2
 
00:33:29.909 --> 00:33:29.919 align:start position:0%
for rest areas representative hatch
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you madam chair just just a
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
couple things on the rest area
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
and i know it's a complicated mess that
 
00:33:38.149 --> 00:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
existed long before your existence
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
there but um as representative tuber
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
said i
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't uh would hope
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
that you would um take an active role
 
00:33:51.029 --> 00:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
in rectifying that issue particularly
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
with the shelburne
 
00:33:54.630 --> 00:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh rest area i think that's uh something
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
there solvable
 
00:33:57.509 --> 00:33:57.519 align:start position:0%
it's something we've been dealing with
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
for i don't know uh representative leach
 
00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:00.230 align:start position:0%
for i don't know uh representative leach
and

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
leachman may have a better idea but for
 
00:34:03.269 --> 00:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
quite a few years
 
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
then i and i feel as though it's been
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
ignored that's one thing
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
enough said secondly um
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
a few years ago in speaking of breast
 
00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.349 align:start position:0%
a few years ago in speaking of breast
areas

00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
i had a suggestion to you that
 
00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
work with the csep program that's where
 
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:20.550 align:start position:0%
work with the csep program that's where
uh

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
older individuals are hired or retired
 
00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.310 align:start position:0%
older individuals are hired or retired
individuals

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
in many cases um you're paid for by the
 
00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:27.750 align:start position:0%
in many cases um you're paid for by the
csep

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
csep
 
00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
pro it's a senior citizens employment
 
00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:31.909 align:start position:0%
pro it's a senior citizens employment
program

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
um rest areas would be an ideal fit
 
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
for that um i know of one person that
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
was from the cseps program in the
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
littleton rest area but
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
other than that have you actively
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
pursued that
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
um i think and i'll stop after this um
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
that's something that should have been
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
developed and it's a very strong
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
program viable program and so how much
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
are you using it now commissioner
 
00:35:01.589 --> 00:35:01.599 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh you fit on a really
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
important point here which is that
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
some of the in my experience now i have
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
two years of plus
 
00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
with this program i can make a couple of
 
00:35:12.390 --> 00:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
observations one is
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
the rest areas are exceptionally
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to operate
 
00:35:17.589 --> 00:35:17.599 align:start position:0%
due to the staffing constraints that we
 
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
have so
 
00:35:21.109 --> 00:35:21.119 align:start position:0%
the jobs that are there pay extremely
 
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:22.230 align:start position:0%
the jobs that are there pay extremely
low

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
low
 
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
and increasingly in a lot of our rest
 
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.270 align:start position:0%
and increasingly in a lot of our rest
areas

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
areas
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
particularly in the southern tier being
 
00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.109 align:start position:0%
particularly in the southern tier being
open

00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
into the evenings in other words
 
00:35:31.599 --> 00:35:33.750 align:start position:0%
into the evenings in other words
occasionally

00:35:33.750 --> 00:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
occasionally
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
are put in difficult situations whether
 
00:35:37.589 --> 00:35:37.599 align:start position:0%
they're homeless people that are
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
at the site whether there's drug use at
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
the site which has occurred
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
there's not a regular police presence
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
there and then add in
 
00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and the fact that you know
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
while we do
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
everything we can to protect our staff
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
in those situations it is
 
00:35:58.230 --> 00:35:58.240 align:start position:0%
increasingly difficult to find people to
 
00:35:59.990 --> 00:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
put in those jobs
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
and that is the height the most limiting
 
00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.430 align:start position:0%
and that is the height the most limiting
factor

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
factor
 
00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
i would say to to our ability to
 
00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
continue to maintain those
 
00:36:11.750 --> 00:36:11.760 align:start position:0%
the maintenance budgets the costs the
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
we've made some pretty
 
00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
decent improvements some of some of them
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
are things that you don't see
 
00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:20.720 align:start position:0%
septic tanks electrical upgrades
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
water systems wi-fi those sorts of
 
00:36:25.109 --> 00:36:25.119 align:start position:0%
things have all been improved over the
 
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:26.720 align:start position:0%
last couple of years
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
but the staffing is extremely i will say
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
a challenge for many reasons
 
00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:34.880 align:start position:0%
maintaining staff and then when we had
 
00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:38.640 align:start position:0%
the close down during a good portion of
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
last spring a lot of those people didn't
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
just did not come back
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
we made every effort to move a lot of
 
00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:45.280 align:start position:0%
those individuals into other positions
 
00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
like at the liquor commission
 
00:36:49.829 --> 00:36:49.839 align:start position:0%
several of them did do that and some of
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
them have come back
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
but that is our largest challenge
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
representative and it's
 
00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh even with the additional funds that
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
were provided last time to
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
keep all of our areas open um um
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
um through throughout the year the the
 
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:06.310 align:start position:0%
um through throughout the year the the
fact

00:37:06.310 --> 00:37:06.320 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
that remained was the staffing issue
 
00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
so i'm not looking to make excuses
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
representative i'm just telling you
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's my observation at this point that
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's a real challenge and
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
and going after in some cases you know
 
00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:18.870 align:start position:0%
and going after in some cases you know
maybe

00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh some of the programs that you're
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
referencing would be would be good but
 
00:37:22.950 --> 00:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
00:37:24.630 --> 00:37:24.640 align:start position:0%
sure that's always the best choice in
 
00:37:26.710 --> 00:37:26.720 align:start position:0%
places like hampton or salem
 
00:37:29.990 --> 00:37:30.000 align:start position:0%
um and others i agree but
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
it's something i think could be utilized
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
a little bit better i'm very familiar
 
00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:34.720 align:start position:0%
with the program
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
and i know of several several
 
00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.069 align:start position:0%
and i know of several several
individuals

00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
that are placed in it it's a great
 
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:41.349 align:start position:0%
that are placed in it it's a great
benefit

00:37:41.349 --> 00:37:41.359 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:37:43.270 --> 00:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
and they uh overcome all those
 
00:37:44.710 --> 00:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
challenges you spoke to but
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner just uh please
 
00:37:48.790 --> 00:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
follow up on that thank you i will
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
follow up with you representative
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative hatch sounds like you
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
might have an opportunity for a bill
 
00:37:54.550 --> 00:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
next year
 
00:37:57.670 --> 00:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
um you've got the familiarity and maybe
 
00:37:59.349 --> 00:37:59.359 align:start position:0%
it would so just you maybe you and the
 
00:38:01.109 --> 00:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner can take that up offline
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
and see if it can go anywhere
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair all right
 
00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%

00:38:16.839 --> 00:38:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.550 --> 00:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
you're doing that i'm turn to the top of
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
page 584.

i see general funds but i also see a
 
00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
again the big numbers there are in the
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
in the marketing budget was a reduction
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
of 275 000

and some of our subscription services
 
00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
and so on under class 102.
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%

but they run all the time quite loudly
 
00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
they don't run in a quiet mode they are
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
full blast all day long all right noted
 
00:39:34.390 --> 00:39:34.400 align:start position:0%

thank you okay
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh procurement and government contracts

00:39:53.109 --> 00:39:53.119 align:start position:0%

and it says the estimated source of
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
funds for procurement government
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
contracts and
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
it shows the general funds going from
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
126 9
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%

00:40:52.069 --> 00:40:52.079 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
the question we have the technology
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
hi good morning good morning thank you
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
for having me um
 
00:41:06.069 --> 00:41:06.079 align:start position:0%
so we did something we moved some
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
rent around last uh biennium all the
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
rent was in class
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
207 on the first page and
 
00:41:17.829 --> 00:41:17.839 align:start position:0%
we reallocated it to all the
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
divisions that have federal funds so
 
00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.390 align:start position:0%
divisions that have federal funds so
that

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:25.030 --> 00:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
oh the office of workforce opportunity
 
00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
could pay their
 
00:41:29.190 --> 00:41:29.200 align:start position:0%
part yet the rest of it was transferred
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
to um ptac and one other unit i believe
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
um it's still being paid with general
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
funds but it had to be allocated
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
to all of the federal funded agent
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
divisions in order for oboe to pay it if
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
that makes sense
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's just transparent money so we have
 
00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:49.520 align:start position:0%
we have several federally funded offices
 
00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
yep uh and we wanted them all to be
 
00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
paying rent that's class
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
22. so yes she's right we see that thank
 
00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%

questions at this time the majority of
 
00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.390 align:start position:0%
questions at this time the majority of
that

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
nearly 10 million dollars is federal
 
00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:14.630 align:start position:0%
nearly 10 million dollars is federal
funds

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.230 --> 00:42:16.240 align:start position:0%

yes ma'am um they are parts of two
positions

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:42:25.750 --> 00:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the department um not everything they
 
00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:26.309 align:start position:0%
in the department um not everything they
do

00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:42:29.190 --> 00:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
is always reimbursable by the federal
 
00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:29.990 align:start position:0%
is always reimbursable by the federal
department

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:42:33.270 --> 00:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
and in some cases where grants what
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
went longer than they should have the
 
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
grant funds ran out
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
just so you know i think when you get
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
those grants it does say general funds
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
will not be used
 
00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
to displace when they run out they go
 
00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:51.829 align:start position:0%
to displace when they run out they go
away

00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
away
 
00:42:55.270 --> 00:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
you bring those to fiscal that really is
 
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
what's supposed to happen representative
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%

represent patch can hear you i don't
 
00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:04.640 align:start position:0%
know if he wants to though
 
00:43:08.150 --> 00:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think so there he is
 
00:43:11.349 --> 00:43:11.359 align:start position:0%
um i'm glad you're here with us because
 
00:43:11.359 --> 00:43:12.150 align:start position:0%
um i'm glad you're here with us because
i

00:43:12.150 --> 00:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious again what maybe the
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
commissioner touched on this these
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
different transfers
 
00:43:21.109 --> 00:43:21.119 align:start position:0%
49 and 85 did you explain because
 
00:43:21.119 --> 00:43:21.829 align:start position:0%
49 and 85 did you explain because
there's

00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:24.560 align:start position:0%
we're going from a half a million
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
dollars and 49 to zero
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
and then down in 85 we're going from
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
zero to 5.2 million is that have
 
00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:33.280 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the department of
 
00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.710 align:start position:0%
anything to do with the department of
energy

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:36.640 align:start position:0%
those six positions that the chair
 
00:43:38.230 --> 00:43:38.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
um i'm sorry representative where are
 
00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:42.680 align:start position:0%
you what page i'm on page
 
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
587 587
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
so last line 49 and 85.
 
00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:54.400 align:start position:0%
that's the consultant class line no 46
 
00:43:55.510 --> 00:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry transfer
 
00:43:57.430 --> 00:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
which one which lines are you on peter
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
49 madam chair
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
transferred to other state agencies yes
 
00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:02.960 align:start position:0%
going to zero and then
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
an 85 going from zero to 5.2 million
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
harley do you know that yes those are
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
actually moved to
 
00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:19.040 align:start position:0%
um 0.85 again a technical thing where
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
we were just requested to pay it out of
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
a different class
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
so those two numbers the transfers went
 
00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:35.200 align:start position:0%
don't really match up as far as the
 
00:44:36.790 --> 00:44:36.800 align:start position:0%
transfer amount
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
well i think that yeah no
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's and there's some of 102 went into
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
85 as well
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
so just a follow-up so could you tell us
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
more on this transfer amount what that
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
breaks down
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:03.990 --> 00:45:04.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't understand the
 
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.829 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i didn't understand the
question

00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:08.720 align:start position:0%
on the class 80 class line 85 hallie
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
where we um
 
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:14.400 align:start position:0%
what is the full title because we have
 
00:45:17.109 --> 00:45:17.119 align:start position:0%
interagency transfers out of f and so
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
there must be something
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
that goes beyond f i i'm sorry i don't
 
00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:27.589 --> 00:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's cut off in the um yeah it's cut
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
open ours too
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
maybe you could get that we'll get that
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
for you it's an awful lot of money if
 
00:45:31.839 --> 00:45:32.230 align:start position:0%
for you it's an awful lot of money if
it's

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden all right commissioner
 
00:45:35.430 --> 00:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
add that to your list
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
i will say just generally in those
 
00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.349 align:start position:0%
i will say just generally in those
instances

00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
instances
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative there there were a couple
 
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
of places where we had to reassemble
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
based on the transfer over from dread
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
which had um different use different
 
00:45:55.359 --> 00:45:55.750 align:start position:0%
which had um different use different
class

00:45:55.750 --> 00:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
class
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
lines we when hallie came on board which
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
is just about a year ago
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
we went through and made some
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
adjustments so that they made more sense
 
00:46:03.119 --> 00:46:03.510 align:start position:0%
adjustments so that they made more sense
so

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
once we get the answer i'm sure it will
 
00:46:12.390 --> 00:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay so now we're on 589 which of course
 
00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
the small business development center
 
00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
and i think we all know where we stand
 
00:46:23.589 --> 00:46:23.599 align:start position:0%
on that it currently is funded at 50 000
 
00:46:23.599 --> 00:46:24.150 align:start position:0%
on that it currently is funded at 50 000
and

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
we need to find some money to move back
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
in there representative emerick do you
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:46:29.589 --> 00:46:29.599 align:start position:0%
i'm sure would you like to hear from the
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
director i believe she's probably online
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
liz gray no we understand the problem
 
00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
i think everybody understands the
 
00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.309 align:start position:0%
i think everybody understands the
problem

00:46:40.309 --> 00:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
unless she knows what class line and
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
what a you to transfer the money out of
 
00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:56.240 align:start position:0%
that's what we have to figure out
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
funded but vacant except for that one
 
00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:04.640 align:start position:0%
that you're going to promote to
 
00:47:07.829 --> 00:47:07.839 align:start position:0%
we have uh two positions right now that
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
we are in final interviews these are
 
00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.550 align:start position:0%
we are in final interviews these are
replacement

00:47:10.550 --> 00:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
positions so two individuals that left
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
the division of economic development
 
00:47:18.069 --> 00:47:18.079 align:start position:0%
one retired and one moved to another job
 
00:47:20.150 --> 00:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
and then we have the outdoor recreation
 
00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.349 align:start position:0%
and then we have the outdoor recreation
position

00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
which we've discussed in the past which
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
is federally funded
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
that position is in final interviews uh
 
00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:29.440 align:start position:0%
this week actually
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
so your position is you're fully staffed
 
00:47:32.079 --> 00:47:36.829 align:start position:0%
so your position is you're fully staffed
basically

00:47:36.829 --> 00:47:36.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:36.839 --> 00:47:39.030 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:47:42.150 --> 00:47:42.160 align:start position:0%
looking at the division of tribalism
 
00:47:45.990 --> 00:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:48.400 align:start position:0%
on page starts on page bottom of the
 
00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.030 align:start position:0%
on page starts on page bottom of the
page

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:47:53.349 --> 00:47:53.359 align:start position:0%
591 flips over and goes into 592 and
 
00:47:53.359 --> 00:47:53.990 align:start position:0%
591 flips over and goes into 592 and
finishes

00:47:53.990 --> 00:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
finishes
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
talk to us about class line 75 on page
 
00:48:09.990 --> 00:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
592 which is grant
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
subsidies and relief that's the joint
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
promotional program
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh which is a match program that we
 
00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.150 align:start position:0%
uh which is a match program that we
administer

00:48:18.150 --> 00:48:18.160 align:start position:0%
administer
 
00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:21.599 align:start position:0%
um and uh with our uh
 
00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:24.720 align:start position:0%
dmos and chambers of commerce to do uh
 
00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:25.349 align:start position:0%
dmos and chambers of commerce to do uh
regional

00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
regional
 
00:48:28.549 --> 00:48:28.559 align:start position:0%
tourism marketing so uh we've operated
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
that in a million it was obviously a
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
little low in 2020 because we closed the
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
program for a period of time
 
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
and and we've funded it at a reduced
 
00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:38.150 align:start position:0%
and and we've funded it at a reduced
number

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
of 8.75 per year so that's a mat 5050
 
00:48:42.549 --> 00:48:42.559 align:start position:0%
match program
 
00:48:44.950 --> 00:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
in class 69 your promotional marketing
 
00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:46.640 align:start position:0%
expense is that where we see some of the
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
rooms and meals money you spend
 
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am that's um you see class 69
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
under accounting unit 2013
 
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
as well as class 69 under accounting
 
00:48:57.349 --> 00:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
unit 2019.
 
00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
those are that source of those resources
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
just so you know that's probably going
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
to be the easy hit to
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
fund the small business group but when
 
00:49:08.710 --> 00:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
you get to the senate
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
you heard my words earlier i don't need
 
00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:11.250 align:start position:0%
to repeat them
 
00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:14.829 align:start position:0%
to repeat them
[Music]

00:49:14.829 --> 00:49:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.839 --> 00:49:17.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
i don't see any questions let's move on
 
00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
to page
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
593 uh ma'am could i just make one quick
 
00:49:25.589 --> 00:49:25.599 align:start position:0%
point on that
 
00:49:28.710 --> 00:49:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh comment uh again going back to the
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
process that we went through in terms of
 
00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:31.910 align:start position:0%
process that we went through in terms of
prioritization

00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
prioritization
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
again the one of the issues with the
 
00:49:35.109 --> 00:49:35.119 align:start position:0%
marketing budget
 
00:49:37.750 --> 00:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
and the focus of that right now is that
 
00:49:39.430 --> 00:49:39.440 align:start position:0%
of all the industries that have been
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
hardest hit during this pandemic it's
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
been the hospitality industry
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
the tourism industry that's been
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
effectively shut down for
 
00:49:51.349 --> 00:49:51.359 align:start position:0%
several months now the intention
 
00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:54.400 align:start position:0%
and our goal and our priority again
 
00:49:56.710 --> 00:49:56.720 align:start position:0%
within the resources that we have
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
has been to assist um in promoting the
 
00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:00.309 align:start position:0%
has been to assist um in promoting the
state

00:50:00.309 --> 00:50:00.319 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:03.520 align:start position:0%
and getting tourists to come back and
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
reinvest in those in those jobs and in
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
those that
 
00:50:08.390 --> 00:50:08.400 align:start position:0%
that very very important industry to the
 
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:10.720 align:start position:0%
state so that again just to give you an
 
00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
insight as to the prioritization that we
 
00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
had to make separate from yours
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
yeah uh but that was some that was the
 
00:50:17.349 --> 00:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
process that we discussed
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
i understand that and i know you were
 
00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
doing this in the summer months which
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
was the absolute worst i mean how many
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
months were the beaches even closed up
 
00:50:25.109 --> 00:50:25.119 align:start position:0%
here so
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
yes but i also know as we move money
 
00:50:29.589 --> 00:50:29.599 align:start position:0%
here and there right now
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
it has no negative impact on the money
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
you have now to work
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
and we will have worked it out before
 
00:50:37.349 --> 00:50:37.359 align:start position:0%
this fiscal year starts
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
together with the senate and i'm one of
 
00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:41.670 align:start position:0%
together with the senate and i'm one of
these

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
i guess rose-colored glasses people were
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
getting vaccinated we're seeing an
 
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:48.960 align:start position:0%
improvement and cdc came out with
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
release guidelines yesterday
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm thinking that more people are
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
going to eat out i know
 
00:50:56.309 --> 00:50:56.319 align:start position:0%
russ and i ate out on sunday and the
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
restaurant was absolutely packed and
 
00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:00.800 align:start position:0%
people are starting to
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
feel a little relief so some of our
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
revenues are going to go up
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
yeah i had i couldn't agree more so
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
we're just
 
00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
we need to make it clear we do want the
 
00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
small business development center to
 
00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.589 align:start position:0%
small business development center to
continue

00:51:13.589 --> 00:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
we want tourism to continue we want you
 
00:51:17.349 --> 00:51:17.359 align:start position:0%
to be full funded we're going to do the
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
best we can
 
00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:23.200 align:start position:0%
thank you page 593
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh we're into a lot of zeros
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
this is the area that they have already
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
told us
 
00:51:34.230 --> 00:51:34.240 align:start position:0%
they have deleted and they're repealing
 
00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:34.630 align:start position:0%
they have deleted and they're repealing
in

00:51:34.630 --> 00:51:34.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:37.839 align:start position:0%
hb2 so therefore you see the zeros
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
however they exist because it was
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
authorized spending for the last year
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
i have a quick question sure
 
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
representation uh thanks madam chair and
 
00:51:49.589 --> 00:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
thanks commissioner again for being here
 
00:51:51.430 --> 00:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
so in new england cable news they have
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
this business show i'm sure you've seen
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
it from time to time and they actually
 
00:51:56.710 --> 00:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
had a special on the film industry in
 
00:51:58.870 --> 00:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
massachusetts how important it was they
 
00:52:00.790 --> 00:52:00.800 align:start position:0%
have a whole agency they
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
said it brings in you know millions
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
millions and millions of dollars
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
a year so is it wise to eliminate this
 
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
all together
 
00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:11.040 align:start position:0%
in our i know it's one of those things
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
as the chair mentioned it was a tough
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
budget year but
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
it seems like at least in massachusetts
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
this is a huge huge
 
00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:20.640 align:start position:0%
industry yeah well i think the the
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
difference really is in massachusetts
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
the state makes major major investments
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
in that industry uh through tax credits
 
00:52:28.470 --> 00:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
and other programs
 
00:52:30.630 --> 00:52:30.640 align:start position:0%
that the industry demands they won't
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
even talk to you
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh unless you're willing to put a lot of
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
money on the table as a state
 
00:52:38.309 --> 00:52:38.319 align:start position:0%
and so that's been a fact that we just
 
00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
don't have
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh those resources to sort of play on
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
that field and honestly
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
the film and digital office was working
 
00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:46.720 align:start position:0%
primarily with
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
um entities that are looking to film ads
 
00:52:50.710 --> 00:52:50.720 align:start position:0%
so you see the forward
 
00:52:52.309 --> 00:52:52.319 align:start position:0%
commercial during the red sox game and
 
00:52:53.829 --> 00:52:53.839 align:start position:0%
it shows them driving along a beach i
 
00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:55.280 align:start position:0%
think that's in hampton
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
so that's that's the level at which our
 
00:52:59.670 --> 00:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
ability to compete
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
in the film industry has been at for
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
some time now so
 
00:53:05.829 --> 00:53:05.839 align:start position:0%
i do think that you know this would make
 
00:53:05.839 --> 00:53:06.470 align:start position:0%
i do think that you know this would make
sense

00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
if the industry didn't make those types
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
of demands
 
00:53:12.870 --> 00:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
so it ends up being
 
00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
an office that um and a level of work
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
that we can easily integrate
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
into our existing travel and tourism
 
00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:23.349 align:start position:0%
into our existing travel and tourism
team

00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:26.950 --> 00:53:26.960 align:start position:0%
okay the next we're in now into the osi
 
00:53:27.990 --> 00:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
division of planning which
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
i think we have discussed i didn't see
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
any hands when we were going over it
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
second thoughts on hands the
 
00:53:36.309 --> 00:53:36.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner gave us a spreadsheet on
 
00:53:37.990 --> 00:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
that specifically
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
we know we'll have further discussions
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the department of
 
00:53:41.599 --> 00:53:42.390 align:start position:0%
when we talk about the department of
agents

00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
agents
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
of energy with the governor's budget
 
00:53:44.559 --> 00:53:47.829 align:start position:0%
of energy with the governor's budget
director

00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
i think you covered that force
 
00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:51.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner yes ma'am
 
00:53:54.829 --> 00:53:54.839 align:start position:0%
um we're getting to the end of your
 
00:53:54.839 --> 00:53:56.230 align:start position:0%
um we're getting to the end of your
budget

00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:56.240 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:54:09.589 --> 00:54:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
we can see that under adjusted
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
close to 28 million you're now down in
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
the 26 million
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
line so that reflects those percentage
 
00:54:27.670 --> 00:54:27.680 align:start position:0%
cuts that you talked to us about earlier
 
00:54:29.670 --> 00:54:29.680 align:start position:0%
and we appreciate that you had hard cuts
 
00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
of your own to make and you're trying to
 
00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.150 align:start position:0%

representative walls
 
00:56:23.670 --> 00:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um my recollection
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
is and maybe this doesn't exist anymore
 
00:56:28.309 --> 00:56:28.319 align:start position:0%
that there was a division of film in the
 
00:56:30.309 --> 00:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
cultural office as well
 
00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
um and i don't know quite where the role
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
was in your offices about that didn't
 
00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:36.230 align:start position:0%
was in your offices about that didn't
you

00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
i i believe i'm going to ask the
 
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:39.680 align:start position:0%
commissioner when
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
we had dread and cultural affairs
 
00:56:48.710 --> 00:56:48.720 align:start position:0%
merge and split i believe that piece
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
went to commissioner caswell is that
 
00:56:51.839 --> 00:56:52.390 align:start position:0%
went to commissioner caswell is that
correct

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am uh but representative waltz i
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
think you're remembering that
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
i believe that happened after we
 
00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:01.280 align:start position:0%
actually did the split so we did that
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
subsequently so ba did exist so you're
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
right it was a dncr
 
00:57:09.750 --> 00:57:09.760 align:start position:0%
it moved to bea after the split but
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
shortly thereafter thank you
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
answer your question yeah i was trying
 
00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:17.040 align:start position:0%
to figure out if another office existed
 
00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
somewhere else in the state and the
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
answer obviously is no this is the only
 
00:57:22.470 --> 00:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
film division left in the state
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
yes and we've not been able to fund it
 
00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%

chairman carol mcguire of house edna
 
01:00:55.829 --> 01:00:55.839 align:start position:0%

come out of that
 
01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%

01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
with approving these sections if these
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%

and last but not least the attorney
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
general is a department head
 
01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
so in the public protection division
 
01:08:49.269 --> 01:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
there is a criminal justice bureau i'm
 
01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
sure that you are all aware of that that
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
seems to be the
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
the bureau that has us um in the news
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
more often than not
 
01:08:58.550 --> 01:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
we are the prosecutors for homicide
 
01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
cases so anyone who
 
01:09:02.070 --> 01:09:02.080 align:start position:0%
murders someone else in the state and
 
01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:04.400 align:start position:0%
faces up to life in prison we prosecute
 
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
those cases
 
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.120 align:start position:0%
that includes a cold case unit where we
 
01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:09.510 align:start position:0%
that includes a cold case unit where we
have

01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
attorneys that are prosecuting the cold
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
cases they are reviewing those cases
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
those are cases that are not initially
 
01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
solved and
 
01:09:20.309 --> 01:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
and as you know those are cases that you
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
know the families bear the burden for
 
01:09:24.630 --> 01:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
sometimes decades of what happened
 
01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
to their loved one we also have a robust
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
drug prosecution unit we have in the
 
01:09:31.679 --> 01:09:32.149 align:start position:0%
drug prosecution unit we have in the
past

01:09:32.149 --> 01:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
past
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
addressed death resulting cases
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i think that this state is
 
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
going to see an
 
01:09:41.349 --> 01:09:41.359 align:start position:0%
increase in methamphetamine cases so we
 
01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:42.390 align:start position:0%
increase in methamphetamine cases so we
are

01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:42.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
we are marshaling some of our resources
 
01:09:45.510 --> 01:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
to that we work
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
very close with not only our state
 
01:09:49.269 --> 01:09:49.279 align:start position:0%
partners but with our federal partners
 
01:09:50.789 --> 01:09:50.799 align:start position:0%
at the dea
 
01:09:52.870 --> 01:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
in fact we have one attorney in this
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
office who's embedded in dea
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
to work with some of those prosecutions
 
01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
of the drug unit is we have a drug task
 
01:10:01.750 --> 01:10:01.760 align:start position:0%
force that
 
01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
that covers areas primarily in this
 
01:10:08.149 --> 01:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
central area in into the north to deal
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
with the rural areas where
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
some of the other agencies just can't
 
01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
get there because of time and
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
in geography and manpower
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
we also have a public integrity unit you
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
will see that a number of our budget
 
01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:22.790 align:start position:0%
will see that a number of our budget
requests

01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
requests
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
are to make that unit more robust
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
as a result of the leaked commission
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
there was a recommendation that there be
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
a free-standing public integrity
 
01:10:36.229 --> 01:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
unit so we are in the process of
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
building that out
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
we have already identified a leader for
 
01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
that unit and we have
 
01:10:44.310 --> 01:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
recruited uh one attorney from
 
01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.350 align:start position:0%
recruited uh one attorney from
massachusetts

01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
01:10:47.590 --> 01:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
into that unit and we are looking to add
 
01:10:49.669 --> 01:10:49.679 align:start position:0%
to that unit in investigating
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
paralegal we also have a medicaid
 
01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
fraud control unit in this state
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that that unit has been
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
staffed recently um
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
we took the last director out of there
 
01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
to be the chief of staff
 
01:11:08.709 --> 01:11:08.719 align:start position:0%
but that unit is making not only marx
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
and here in new hampshire
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
but nationally we are not only
 
01:11:14.149 --> 01:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
prosecuting those cases
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
in getting convictions but in certain
 
01:11:18.229 --> 01:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
situations where warranted people are
 
01:11:18.239 --> 01:11:19.110 align:start position:0%
situations where warranted people are
serving

01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
serving
 
01:11:21.430 --> 01:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
jail time in addition to providing uh
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
restitution to
 
01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
uh the medicaid fraud program
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
we also have a victim witness
 
01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:32.960 align:start position:0%
unit those are individuals that in
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
homicide case they will respond they
 
01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.550 align:start position:0%
homicide case they will respond they
will

01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
have the awful job of sometimes being
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
the first
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
people at the door to tell somebody that
 
01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
their loved one
 
01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
um has been murdered they will lead them
 
01:11:47.590 --> 01:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
through what is also a
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
tangled process through the criminal
 
01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:51.520 align:start position:0%
justice system so they understand what's
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:11:54.149 --> 01:11:54.159 align:start position:0%
when there are trials they work with
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
witnesses to make sure that witnesses
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
get to court
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
you know in in the days of covid that
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
witnesses can appear
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
via zoom and other electronic mediums so
 
01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
that is some of the work that
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
um that unit does also in the public
 
01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh protection division we have an
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
environmental bureau that is
 
01:12:14.070 --> 01:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
working to make sure that our
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
environment and our waters and our air
 
01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:16.390 align:start position:0%
environment and our waters and our air
are

01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:12:19.030 --> 01:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
safe and clean for our individuals in
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
we have a consumer protection bureau
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
that is out there making sure that
 
01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.350 align:start position:0%
that is out there making sure that
consumers

01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
and that the elderly are protected from
 
01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:28.630 align:start position:0%
and that the elderly are protected from
scams

01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:28.640 align:start position:0%
scams
 
01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:31.040 align:start position:0%
that unit recently has also there's an
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
antitrust component to that unit
 
01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
has also been working feverishly with
 
01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
01:12:39.430 --> 01:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
hospital mergers we're seeing you know
 
01:12:42.070 --> 01:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
that there was one recently
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
in the seacoast area with partners
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
dartmouth and catholic medical center
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
are working on a merger
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
and there is currently a merger with the
 
01:12:53.830 --> 01:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
failing lakes region hospital in the
 
01:12:55.189 --> 01:12:55.199 align:start position:0%
concord hospital
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
so one of the positions that we're
 
01:12:58.709 --> 01:12:58.719 align:start position:0%
looking for is to
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
assist that unit in their very busy
 
01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:02.149 align:start position:0%
assist that unit in their very busy
practice

01:13:02.149 --> 01:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
and we also have the office of the chief
 
01:13:05.910 --> 01:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
medical examiner
 
01:13:07.830 --> 01:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
there is a chief medical examiner and
 
01:13:09.189 --> 01:13:09.199 align:start position:0%
there is a deputy
 
01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:12.400 align:start position:0%
and hopefully soon there will be a third
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
member to that unit to
 
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
assist with the number of autopsies that
 
01:13:17.830 --> 01:13:17.840 align:start position:0%
is the one
 
01:13:19.830 --> 01:13:19.840 align:start position:0%
unit in this state that is charged with
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
conducting all autopsies
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
and there's also an administrative
 
01:13:27.189 --> 01:13:27.199 align:start position:0%
prosecution unit i think that you have
 
01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
heard from oplc
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
that they are sort of restructuring and
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
so that unit will be
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
folded into oplc and the attorneys that
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
are in that unit
 
01:13:40.149 --> 01:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
as well as the staff will be performing
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
some other functions
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
in this office to assist oplc so that is
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
just a brief
 
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
overview of one unit the the division of
 
01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:49.840 align:start position:0%
public protection
 
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:51.600 align:start position:0%
and then we have the division of legal
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
counsel and as i indicated we
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
defend all of the lawsuits brought
 
01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.030 align:start position:0%
defend all of the lawsuits brought
against

01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:14:00.470 --> 01:14:00.480 align:start position:0%
the state um that also encompasses the
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
civil rights unit
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
that looks at individuals the civil
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
rights when they are violated whether we
 
01:14:07.510 --> 01:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
can bring
 
01:14:09.990 --> 01:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
any type of action to prohibit somebody
 
01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:10.709 align:start position:0%
any type of action to prohibit somebody
from

01:14:10.709 --> 01:14:10.719 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:14:13.189 --> 01:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
conducting that behavior again we're
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
also in the community doing
 
01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
trainings with police departments what
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%

01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
an individual who primarily uh did
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%

publications
 
01:19:47.590 --> 01:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
that work will have to um be shifted to
 
01:19:49.110 --> 01:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
graphic services we will have to
 
01:19:50.550 --> 01:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
outsource that work
 
01:19:52.229 --> 01:19:52.239 align:start position:0%

working and assisting the business
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
office will have to be absorbed by
 
01:19:59.750 --> 01:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
others so then if you um go to page
 
01:20:02.149 --> 01:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
nine of our handout the new positions
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%

01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
requesting this is in direct response to
 
01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
your question number one
 
01:20:10.229 --> 01:20:10.239 align:start position:0%
um representative ober the positions
 
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
that we are looking for are
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
three attorney positions one of those

will be for the public integrity unit
 
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
that i described that we are standing up
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
that was a direct recommendation of the
 
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
leact commission
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
another is um to address the hospital
 
01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.350 align:start position:0%
another is um to address the hospital
mergers

01:20:29.350 --> 01:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
mergers
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
with the volume coming in on those in
 
01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
the intense work
 
01:20:35.590 --> 01:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
and another one would be to assist the
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
division of
 
01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
legal counsel lee act
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
also recommended a criminal justice
 
01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:43.830 align:start position:0%
also recommended a criminal justice
investigator

01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:43.840 align:start position:0%
investigator
 
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
tasked with public integrity matters
 
01:20:49.590 --> 01:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
public integrity matters being law
 
01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers who commit
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
crimes in the course of their duties
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
that is what the investigator will look
 
01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:57.110 align:start position:0%
that is what the investigator will look
at

01:20:57.110 --> 01:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:21:00.149 --> 01:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
we get a number of complaints
 
01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
and calls on those this would be
 
01:21:03.189 --> 01:21:03.199 align:start position:0%
somebody that would be tasked
 
01:21:05.669 --> 01:21:05.679 align:start position:0%
to that so those would become a priority
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
and also a paralegal
 
01:21:11.669 --> 01:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
to assist um in that in that unit
 
01:21:13.189 --> 01:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
and the last position that we are
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
seeking is a director of diversity and
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
community outreach
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
this is another position that was
 
01:21:22.629 --> 01:21:22.639 align:start position:0%
recommended by the leact commission
 
01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
this person will be a liaison a trainer
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
an educator um someone who will go out
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
and work with law enforcement
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
and work with the communities in which
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
they serve
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
all communities to try and better those
 
01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.510 align:start position:0%
all communities to try and better those
relationships

01:21:39.510 --> 01:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
relationships
 
01:21:43.350 --> 01:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
and i think that that um
 
01:21:46.470 --> 01:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
is my sort of general description of
 
01:21:49.189 --> 01:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
who we are what we do and what our
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:55.910 --> 01:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative leishman has a question
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh thanks madam chair and uh
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
thanks for such a complete uh
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
breakdown of the chairs questions i
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
think it's probably the most extensive
 
01:22:10.070 --> 01:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
one we've seen so far you could
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
teach it to some of our other
 
01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:13.350 align:start position:0%
teach it to some of our other
commissioners

01:22:13.350 --> 01:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
01:22:17.430 --> 01:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
to come forward so the public integrity
 
01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
commission's report i have not seen it
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
i've heard something about it is it just
 
01:22:24.070 --> 01:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
strictly law enforcement officers or
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
could it
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.669 --> 01:22:33.679 align:start position:0%
so i think that that so the the public
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
integrity unit primarily
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
will look at state so any of your state
 
01:22:41.350 --> 01:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
if you have commissioners any of your
 
01:22:42.550 --> 01:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
state employees
 
01:22:44.950 --> 01:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
it at least the way that it's currently
 
01:22:45.910 --> 01:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
set up
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
it is not going to be equipped to look
 
01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.030 align:start position:0%
it is not going to be equipped to look
at

01:22:49.030 --> 01:22:49.040 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
your local selectmen or certain other
 
01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:52.870 align:start position:0%
your local selectmen or certain other
individuals

01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean that there can't be a
 
01:22:56.790 --> 01:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
case that depending on sort of what the
 
01:22:58.709 --> 01:22:58.719 align:start position:0%
facts are we may not look at it
 
01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
but currently the goal would be law
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement as well as
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
state officials uh further
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
further question uh i
 
01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
see within the budget and in house bill
 
01:23:15.189 --> 01:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
2 there's an appropriation for the
 
01:23:15.199 --> 01:23:15.990 align:start position:0%
2 there's an appropriation for the
internet

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
internet
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
crimes against children's fund
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
is that something you'll have a direct
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
oversight on if approved or
 
01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
do you have i didn't see anything in the
 
01:23:27.350 --> 01:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
budget that had a specific
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
line for uh i
 
01:23:32.550 --> 01:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
think that's a pass-through grant to the
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
portsmouth police department
 
01:23:36.950 --> 01:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
am i correct attorney young you are
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
correct so that is a grant i will tell
 
01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:39.669 align:start position:0%
correct so that is a grant i will tell
you

01:23:39.669 --> 01:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
that this office works closely with the
 
01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:43.110 align:start position:0%
that this office works closely with the
internet

01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
internet
 
01:23:45.750 --> 01:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
crimes against children task force which
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
is out of
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
portsmouth it was mike leclair the last
 
01:23:50.629 --> 01:23:50.639 align:start position:0%
time but i think that i had heard that
 
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:52.400 align:start position:0%
he had moved on but
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
it comes through a grant we have an
 
01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:56.639 align:start position:0%
investigator here who works closely with
 
01:23:56.639 --> 01:23:57.590 align:start position:0%
investigator here who works closely with
them

01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
those cases primarily are prosecuted at
 
01:24:01.510 --> 01:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
the county level
 
01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
and sometimes even at the u s attorney
 
01:24:03.679 --> 01:24:04.629 align:start position:0%
and sometimes even at the u s attorney
level

01:24:04.629 --> 01:24:04.639 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:24:09.830 --> 01:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
okay see no additional questions at this
 
01:24:13.679 --> 01:24:14.470 align:start position:0%
okay see no additional questions at this
time

01:24:14.470 --> 01:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:24:16.149 --> 01:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
but you know jane that's going to change
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
it any minute i know
 
01:24:19.990 --> 01:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
can i add one other thing representative
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
two of the other areas that we had to um
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
defund and i think that you're aware of
 
01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:26.390 align:start position:0%
defund and i think that you're aware of
this

01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
one of um one of them was the
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
child advocacy centers and i know in the
 
01:24:32.639 --> 01:24:33.270 align:start position:0%

letter dated march 3rd
 
01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
he indicated that there was additional
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
money to include that in the budget
 
01:24:42.790 --> 01:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
but there was also unfortunately that
 
01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:43.270 align:start position:0%
but there was also unfortunately that
letter

01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
letter
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
said i'd like these funded but didn't
 
01:24:47.430 --> 01:24:47.440 align:start position:0%

01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:49.600 align:start position:0%

01:25:25.590 --> 01:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
social media realm that was another area
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%

01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
cut and so i i just say we'd be happy to
 
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
fund that for you what line item do you
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
want us to cut to provide that funding
 
01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:34.639 align:start position:0%
within your budget
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
well that's the problem right make hard
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
choices so i just i wanted to put a
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
pitch in for them but we think long and
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
hard before we cut anything
 
01:25:47.590 --> 01:25:47.600 align:start position:0%
um they called me and i said look you
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
know there's less money
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
the house thinks there's less money than
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
the governor thinks the house is a
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
cautious with so many people including
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
fidelity in our own
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
market saying they're expecting an
 
01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:04.239 align:start position:0%
economic downturn and
 
01:26:07.110 --> 01:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to go forward we're
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
struggling with money over here so
 
01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:11.920 align:start position:0%
anything you want handed added we can
 
01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
add for you but we are going to look for
 
01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:14.310 align:start position:0%
add for you but we are going to look for
you

01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:26:17.350 --> 01:26:17.360 align:start position:0%
to give us an associated cut within your
 
01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:17.910 align:start position:0%
to give us an associated cut within your
line

01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
your budget line that you can deal with
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have any money and i read the
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
governor's letter yes he'd like that but
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
he didn't send
 
01:26:28.470 --> 01:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
us any money so we we're struggling the
 
01:26:30.550 --> 01:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
same as you are unfortunately
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
i know but if we could all kind of keep
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
an eye out you know they do good work so
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
i'll look again why don't you we have a
 
01:26:40.629 --> 01:26:40.639 align:start position:0%
couple of other pages from you
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
um as i see this the directory of
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
diversity and community outreach
 
01:26:50.310 --> 01:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
reach you're expecting to have a total
 
01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:50.950 align:start position:0%
reach you're expecting to have a total
salary

01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
salary
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
i mean a total cost of 118 000 in 2022
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
and even though the salary goes up
 
01:26:59.189 --> 01:26:59.199 align:start position:0%
you're expecting the cost
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
to go down um
 
01:27:07.110 --> 01:27:07.120 align:start position:0%
in 2000 what's the two thousand dollars
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.870 --> 01:27:16.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative that is um basic
 
01:27:18.629 --> 01:27:18.639 align:start position:0%
startup equipment desk
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
computer phone well you've got your
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
computer under technology hardware which
 
01:27:25.990 --> 01:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
is another 1200.
 
01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
and telecommunications has another 1200
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
which is your phone
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
so uh my director of administration is
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
just telling me it's sort of the hard
 
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:40.400 align:start position:0%
startup it's the chair
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's the desk it's things of that sort
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
office space you can kathy you can hop
 
01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
on too
 
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
okay office space is typically another
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:57.669 --> 01:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
all right why don't we start and we will
 
01:27:57.679 --> 01:27:58.830 align:start position:0%
all right why don't we start and we will
go

01:27:58.830 --> 01:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
through your budget line by line which
 
01:28:05.669 --> 01:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
is probably the least thing you're going
 
01:28:06.870 --> 01:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
to like
 
01:28:10.149 --> 01:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
doing since you couldn't convince
 
01:28:13.270 --> 01:28:13.280 align:start position:0%
the former ag to stay one more week but
 
01:28:15.669 --> 01:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
we we understand where you're coming
 
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
from we appreciate understanding why she
 
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
can't see me
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay um on page
 
01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
i don't quite understand how class 10
 
01:28:41.110 --> 01:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
can go down
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
it goes from what the adjusted
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
authorized is
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
in 2017 in 2021
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
down and then up i know you said you
 
01:28:53.110 --> 01:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
unfunded some positions but were they
 
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
only unfunded for one year
 
01:28:57.590 --> 01:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
because no it can't be three positions
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
but it goes back up
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
how did that happen are you looking at
 
01:29:03.669 --> 01:29:03.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
additional the additional pay period is
 
01:29:07.270 --> 01:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
in 22
 
01:29:11.750 --> 01:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
but it goes up in 23.
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
so those are handed to us
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:24.320 align:start position:0%
removed a position um
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
we unfunded it and those are the dollars
 
01:29:28.470 --> 01:29:28.480 align:start position:0%
that are sent to us from through the new
 
01:29:30.149 --> 01:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire first system those
 
01:29:34.070 --> 01:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
you unfunded a position in 2601 kathy
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
yes we did but it doesn't seem to
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
show as unfunded yes i know
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
i know we um moved a position
 
01:29:47.830 --> 01:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
over there in
 
01:29:51.990 --> 01:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
in 2020 and 2021
 
01:29:54.149 --> 01:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
we had moved to position over there and
 
01:29:56.390 --> 01:29:56.400 align:start position:0%
then we removed a position
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
um it's a very low cost position it's
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
the records control clerk
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
that we just um that i had
 
01:30:08.790 --> 01:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
that we had discussed um
 
01:30:11.830 --> 01:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
and those dollars were given
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
to us through the system a lot of that
 
01:30:16.870 --> 01:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
has to do with the long-term people
 
01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
you've got longevity
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
and i can look into exactly why those
 
01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.310 align:start position:0%
and i can look into exactly why those
dollars

01:30:30.310 --> 01:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
are different um but a lot of that has
 
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
to do with the length of time people
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
have been here
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
and plans for their you know it depends
 
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
on when they come in and they go up in
 
01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.110 align:start position:0%
on when they come in and they go up in
increment

01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
increment
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
and then they've got their longevity um
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't look like we cut anyone
 
01:30:50.709 --> 01:30:50.719 align:start position:0%
but the position that we did cut
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
was like a thirty thousand dollar
 
01:30:56.950 --> 01:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
salary range that record
 
01:30:58.790 --> 01:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
yeah but you're only down twelve
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars me get back to you on
 
01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
that one i'll look
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
not on that page what page do you have a
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
question on representation
 
01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative leishman is on page 279
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
and you have a question yeah hi kathy uh
 
01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:39.590 align:start position:0%
and you have a question yeah hi kathy uh
so

01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
on 279 uh revolving funds
 
01:31:49.990 --> 01:31:50.000 align:start position:0%
class line three i'm just curious um
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
why those numbers all seem quite skewed
 
01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
like agency income
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
this seems to be a lot of difference
 
01:31:59.830 --> 01:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
between last year and
 
01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
moving forward so what we had done
 
01:32:06.790 --> 01:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
um is we had carved out
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
the administrative prosecution unit into
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
its own
 
01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
accounting unit and that accounting unit
 
01:32:14.310 --> 01:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
is on the next page
 
01:32:18.229 --> 01:32:18.239 align:start position:0%
okay 33.05 and
 
01:32:20.870 --> 01:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
they will receive all their 100 of their
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
funding was oplc
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
and as we spoke um about
 
01:32:28.629 --> 01:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
that is being restructured and i'm still
 
01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:30.320 align:start position:0%
working on numbers
 
01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
i am going to have to be sending you a
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
technical correction
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
once we redistribute
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
those positions to a new location
 
01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:42.480 align:start position:0%
but that's why you're seeing a
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
difference in dollars
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
is we separated out apu into its own
 
01:32:50.310 --> 01:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
accounting unit so we could better track
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
it was a one-to-one relationship with
 
01:32:52.080 --> 01:32:53.590 align:start position:0%
it was a one-to-one relationship with
oplc

01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
oplc
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
and that was before all the
 
01:32:54.880 --> 01:32:56.629 align:start position:0%
and that was before all the
restructuring

01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
restructuring
 
01:32:59.830 --> 01:32:59.840 align:start position:0%
okay thanks so much okay except class
 
01:33:02.310 --> 01:33:02.320 align:start position:0%
three on page 279
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
you have zero adjusted authorized
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
dollars in 2021
 
01:33:09.270 --> 01:33:09.280 align:start position:0%
yes and i don't know and now you're
 
01:33:09.990 --> 01:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
going to almost
 
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
3 million in 22 and 23.
 
01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
and that i don't know why that showed
 
01:33:21.110 --> 01:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
up that way that 1947
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:28.950 --> 01:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
and because that's where the money comes
 
01:33:28.960 --> 01:33:29.270 align:start position:0%
and because that's where the money comes
from

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:29.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:33:32.390 --> 01:33:32.400 align:start position:0%
in twenty one
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
it's that money should be split between
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
zero zero
 
01:33:37.990 --> 01:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
three and zero zero nine and is there
 
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.120 align:start position:0%
somebody on
 
01:33:41.590 --> 01:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
attending with you who could answer that
 
01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:45.669 align:start position:0%
attending with you who could answer that
question

01:33:45.669 --> 01:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:49.030 --> 01:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
it's just so the the two million
 
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
thirteen thousand
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
most of that should be coming out of
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:59.110 --> 01:33:59.120 align:start position:0%
and then the zero zero nine there's a
 
01:34:00.629 --> 01:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
smaller portion
 
01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
like about three hundred thousand
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
dollars or so but the question is why
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
zero in 2021 and why three million in
 
01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:11.430 align:start position:0%
zero in 2021 and why three million in
2022

01:34:11.430 --> 01:34:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
number one is there there's an error in
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
21 of where that money
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
is supposed to be the funding source of
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
that unit
 
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
should be in zero zero three um
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
and that's an error in
 
01:34:29.030 --> 01:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
what page will we find that funding in
 
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
so we can see it in 2021
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
and represent walsh you're right after
 
01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.910 align:start position:0%
and represent walsh you're right after
this

01:34:35.910 --> 01:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
so if you look on page 279
 
01:34:43.669 --> 01:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
and you see the 1947 no i see the zero
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm talking about you said
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
that's an arrow error
 
01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:54.229 --> 01:34:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative that's agency income as
 
01:34:56.709 --> 01:34:56.719 align:start position:0%
opposed to revolving funds
 
01:34:59.109 --> 01:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be revolving funds and
 
01:34:59.119 --> 01:35:01.189 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be revolving funds and
that's

01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
then why did your revolving funds go up
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
nine hundred thousand dollars
 
01:35:08.629 --> 01:35:08.639 align:start position:0%
so what happened was um we to keep
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
target um to keep
 
01:35:14.229 --> 01:35:14.239 align:start position:0%
at our general fund target we had to
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
move five positions
 
01:35:20.229 --> 01:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
that are um more
 
01:35:23.590 --> 01:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
public protection in nature under
 
01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
this account and the three new positions
 
01:35:29.350 --> 01:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
the three new attorney positions were
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
also added
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
to that so you've got a total of eight
 
01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.950 align:start position:0%
to that so you've got a total of eight
positions

01:35:34.950 --> 01:35:34.960 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:42.159 align:start position:0%
additional positions to be funded by
 
01:35:42.159 --> 01:35:42.550 align:start position:0%
additional positions to be funded by
cell

01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
cell
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
funds that use that used to be
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
five of those were general funds three
 
01:35:50.629 --> 01:35:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:53.830 --> 01:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
except on page 279
 
01:35:57.030 --> 01:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
permanent classified positions in 2021
 
01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:00.639 align:start position:0%
were six unclassified positions were 10
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
for a total of 16.
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
in 2022 it's 5
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
and 15 and you're saying 9 positions
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
were added
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
well there are three brand new ones and
 
01:36:14.470 --> 01:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.550 --> 01:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
because we have five that were moved
 
01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:21.750 align:start position:0%
because we have five that were moved
over

01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:36:26.950 --> 01:36:26.960 align:start position:0%
from another accounting unit
 
01:36:30.149 --> 01:36:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:30.159 --> 01:36:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
2610

01:36:35.510 --> 01:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:37.830 --> 01:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
which doesn't really show because it's
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
the reason why you're seeing the
 
01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:39.910 align:start position:0%
the reason why you're seeing the
difference

01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
is because we carved out three
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
additional positions to go into page um
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
280 which is okay that's three of nine
 
01:36:51.990 --> 01:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
where the other six coming from
 
01:36:54.550 --> 01:36:54.560 align:start position:0%
criminal bureau and you're not going to
 
01:36:56.229 --> 01:36:56.239 align:start position:0%
see that either because we added
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
positions in there for public integrity
 
01:37:02.390 --> 01:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
so the difference between the ones we
 
01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
carved out and the new ones that we
 
01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:05.350 align:start position:0%
carved out and the new ones that we
asked

01:37:05.350 --> 01:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
asked
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
for the public integrity unit um
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
is not gonna it's not gonna show you the
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
actual cuts that we made
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
in the criminal bureau the moves we
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
didn't make cuts we moved
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
not the actual well if you look at 2610
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
it's gonna look like we only went up
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
um we went down three positions
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
when we really went down
 
01:37:42.229 --> 01:37:42.239 align:start position:0%
five positions but added
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:47.910 --> 01:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
for public integrity three positions i
 
01:37:49.510 --> 01:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
apologize i'm not sure who's doing your
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
budget now but whoever's over there
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
could they please prepare a crosswalk
 
01:37:55.590 --> 01:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
get that sent
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
to janet clayman hopefully by late this
 
01:38:00.629 --> 01:38:00.639 align:start position:0%
afternoon to show where all these
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
positions moved around with accounting
 
01:38:02.719 --> 01:38:03.430 align:start position:0%
positions moved around with accounting
unit

01:38:03.430 --> 01:38:03.440 align:start position:0%
unit
 
01:38:06.390 --> 01:38:06.400 align:start position:0%
and line so that we can look at it and
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
represent walls you've been patiently
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
waiting with your hand
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
thank you actually it has been a while
 
01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
and my question dates back to
 
01:38:20.950 --> 01:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
attorney young and the question simply
 
01:38:23.350 --> 01:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
was are they laying anybody off because
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
with all this movement i can't tell if
 
01:38:25.119 --> 01:38:25.510 align:start position:0%
with all this movement i can't tell if
it's

01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
if they're actually people being laid
 
01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:29.430 align:start position:0%
if they're actually people being laid
off

01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
they just unfunded positions but not
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily laid off
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
that's what i wanted to clarify so it's
 
01:38:38.870 --> 01:38:38.880 align:start position:0%
just movement it's because this
 
01:38:40.629 --> 01:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
position is leaving positions coming and
 
01:38:42.149 --> 01:38:42.159 align:start position:0%
i just didn't know if anybody was
 
01:38:44.070 --> 01:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
actually being laid off and it's serious
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
the answer is clearly no that's my
 
01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:48.709 align:start position:0%
the answer is clearly no that's my
question

01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
okay other questions from the division
 
01:39:01.430 --> 01:39:01.440 align:start position:0%

see those
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
you'll see those throughout um
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
now chief justice mcdonald one of um
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
one of his big initiatives was to not
 
01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
only recruit people but to retain
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
people there was a significant amount of
 
01:39:55.040 --> 01:39:56.070 align:start position:0%
people there was a significant amount of
turnover

01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
turnover
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
there was a study done and so these
 
01:39:59.350 --> 01:39:59.360 align:start position:0%

01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%

the icac so on page 40
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
of hb2 we have the icac um that we just
 
01:40:49.830 --> 01:40:49.840 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:40:56.229 --> 01:40:56.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.750 --> 01:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
on page okay talk to us a little bit
 
01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
about the frm
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
appropriation is that general funds
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
uh it the way that it's the way that it
 
01:41:08.470 --> 01:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
is drafted
 
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
the money would come out of general
 
01:41:12.470 --> 01:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
funds not otherwise appropriated is the
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay so we have the internet crimes
 
01:41:25.189 --> 01:41:25.199 align:start position:0%
against children people watching at home
 
01:41:26.709 --> 01:41:26.719 align:start position:0%
that's icac
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
and that's section 75 and then
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
76 we have a million dollars in general
 
01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:33.669 align:start position:0%
76 we have a million dollars in general
funds

01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
what other sections attorney young uh
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
then we did a technical correction
 
01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:40.550 align:start position:0%
then we did a technical correction
chairwoman

01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
chairwoman
 
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh starting on page 65 uh that
 
01:41:46.149 --> 01:41:46.159 align:start position:0%
that involves the medical examiner's
 
01:41:47.669 --> 01:41:47.679 align:start position:0%
office that will take you
 
01:41:57.109 --> 01:41:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:59.350 --> 01:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
this looks a little more than a
 
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
technical correction
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
so this is where we were we have right i
 
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
told you we have the
 
01:42:08.629 --> 01:42:08.639 align:start position:0%
the chief medical examiner the deputy
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
and the associate
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
then you have um associate medical
 
01:42:14.070 --> 01:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
examiners that are out in the field that
 
01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:14.629 align:start position:0%
examiners that are out in the field that
actually

01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
will respond to deaths will make a
 
01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:18.629 align:start position:0%
will respond to deaths will make a
determination

01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
determination
 
01:42:21.669 --> 01:42:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh there was an issue with the irs that
 
01:42:22.629 --> 01:42:22.639 align:start position:0%
they were
 
01:42:24.870 --> 01:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
independent contractors we owed attacks
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
on them
 
01:42:28.790 --> 01:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
we did not uh we had some concern
 
01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:29.750 align:start position:0%
we did not uh we had some concern
initially

01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
initially
 
01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
we were not able to negotiate as we
 
01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:33.040 align:start position:0%
thought we would be
 
01:42:36.629 --> 01:42:36.639 align:start position:0%
able to with the irs
 
01:42:39.510 --> 01:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
we put this in we decided that we were
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
going to put on a full court litigation
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
press with the irs and
 
01:42:47.350 --> 01:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
we were successful they reversed their
 
01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:48.310 align:start position:0%
we were successful they reversed their
position

01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:42:50.950 --> 01:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
we do not need to change the medical
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
examiners in the field at this time
 
01:42:56.149 --> 01:42:56.159 align:start position:0%
i will tell you that there perhaps could
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
be a better
 
01:43:00.229 --> 01:43:00.239 align:start position:0%
way than the way that we do it now
 
01:43:02.310 --> 01:43:02.320 align:start position:0%
but we're too late in the game to try to
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
restructure this
 
01:43:04.950 --> 01:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
that would be something that i think
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
that the new attorney general should
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
look at when
 
01:43:10.390 --> 01:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
he assumes the post in talking with the
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
chief medical examiner
 
01:43:13.830 --> 01:43:13.840 align:start position:0%
so for now we would like to leave it
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
status quo which means we do not need
 
01:43:17.109 --> 01:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
those four
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
full-time positions or the 20 part-time
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
positions to
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
assist them so are you telling me you
 
01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
don't need these sections in hb2
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
we need them to revert to the way to the
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
way that they were
 
01:43:34.390 --> 01:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
certain parts of it but some of this is
 
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
the policy change so if i
 
01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
we're on page 65 and it starts in
 
01:43:41.350 --> 01:43:41.360 align:start position:0%
section 150
 
01:43:44.070 --> 01:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
and it looks like this is all existing
 
01:43:47.189 --> 01:43:47.199 align:start position:0%
law until we get to page 66
 
01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:53.440 align:start position:0%
line 21.
 
01:43:56.790 --> 01:43:56.800 align:start position:0%
can you talk about that change
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
correct so we would revert it we would
 
01:44:02.070 --> 01:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
things in bold aren't reverting their
 
01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
new language
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
over what's in law so from us when we
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
our perspective's slightly different
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
from yours so you may be reverting but
 
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
keep in mind we don't know
 
01:44:17.990 --> 01:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
this situation as well as you do so
 
01:44:19.270 --> 01:44:19.280 align:start position:0%
we're just looking at this
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
as it is so on line 21 sherwin the
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
yes associate medical examiner that will
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
stay that is our new
 
01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:28.639 align:start position:0%
third time position that we are hoping
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
that the um
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
we have selected a candidate that we're
 
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
hoping the governor and council
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
will endorse so that will stay so that's
 
01:44:38.709 --> 01:44:38.719 align:start position:0%
an unfilled position that was budgeted
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
in the current budget year
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
and then you have farther down
 
01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
you've renumbered a section but you've
 
01:44:54.390 --> 01:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
scratched out
 
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:57.920 align:start position:0%
lines 30 through 33.
 
01:45:00.950 --> 01:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
what's the impact of that establishing
 
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
the chief
 
01:45:03.590 --> 01:45:03.600 align:start position:0%
those are the positions of the adme
 
01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:05.270 align:start position:0%
those are the positions of the adme
positions

01:45:05.270 --> 01:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
positions
 
01:45:07.750 --> 01:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
right here yep i have yeah i don't think
 
01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:13.350 align:start position:0%
right here yep i have yeah i don't think
so

01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
does that have to do with the telephone
 
01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:25.430 align:start position:0%
does that have to do with the telephone
consultation

01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
can i have one moment please absolutely
 
01:46:26.950 --> 01:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
chairwoman can we get back to you on
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
that one we are having some sort of
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
internal dispute if that should stay or
 
01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:32.229 align:start position:0%
internal dispute if that should stay or
go

01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
so may we respond to you by the end of
 
01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
the day on that one
 
01:46:37.990 --> 01:46:38.000 align:start position:0%
we would appreciate that because we want
 
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
this to stay or go to be correct
 
01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:42.639 align:start position:0%
when we get there so that's the purpose
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
of looking at this and while we're doing
 
01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:44.709 align:start position:0%
of looking at this and while we're doing
that

01:46:44.709 --> 01:46:44.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:46:47.830 --> 01:46:47.840 align:start position:0%
page 67 and then mary beth waltz is
 
01:46:49.189 --> 01:46:49.199 align:start position:0%
going to ask a question you have a
 
01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
couple more
 
01:46:54.870 --> 01:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
strikeouts in section 156
 
01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
and additions and if you could just
 
01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:59.270 align:start position:0%
and additions and if you could just
include

01:46:59.270 --> 01:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
include
 
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
one section 156 in what you're going to
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
get back
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
to us it would be greatly appreciated so
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
we understand
 
01:47:11.669 --> 01:47:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you representative walsh
 
01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
i do thank you so i i we found
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
i finally got access to the questions
 
01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
and answers provided by attorney young
 
01:47:27.030 --> 01:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
and in question five her answer is
 
01:47:30.070 --> 01:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh is she fully funded and she says no
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
and my question is if we take the
 
01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars that's attributed to frm
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
and return it to her budget for all the
 
01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
things that have been cut where she's
 
01:47:39.669 --> 01:47:39.679 align:start position:0%
not able to do her job
 
01:47:41.590 --> 01:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if that's enough money to
 
01:47:43.750 --> 01:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
restore the positions or restore the
 
01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:44.470 align:start position:0%
restore the positions or restore the
cuts

01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
cuts
 
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
that would make it possible for her or
 
01:47:48.310 --> 01:47:48.320 align:start position:0%
for the agency to do the job
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
from money not otherwise appropriated
 
01:47:59.910 --> 01:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
so representative walls my understanding
 
01:48:00.950 --> 01:48:00.960 align:start position:0%
of the frm
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
bill is that the money is not taken from
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
our line
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
it's taken from what we submit to the
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
01:48:11.590 --> 01:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
over and above what we can hold for the
 
01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
escrow account out of consumer
 
01:48:13.199 --> 01:48:14.629 align:start position:0%
escrow account out of consumer
protection

01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
protection
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
so the way that i read it it doesn't
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
come directly from our budget
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
is my reading of that but if that money
 
01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:22.149 align:start position:0%
is my reading of that but if that money
were

01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:48:25.669 --> 01:48:25.679 align:start position:0%
taken and and attributed to your budget
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
instead of given to the frm uh people
 
01:48:32.709 --> 01:48:32.719 align:start position:0%
would that then allow you to fund what
 
01:48:34.149 --> 01:48:34.159 align:start position:0%
you need to fund and to meet your
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
statutory obligations
 
01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
well i do not believe i'm i'm checking
 
01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:50.470 align:start position:0%
well i do not believe i'm i'm checking
with

01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:48:52.870 --> 01:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
administrator carr i do not think that a
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars will cover all of them
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
but we certainly could fund
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
a couple of we could the administrator
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
position and an investigator in the cold
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
case attorney
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
we could fund but again that that's
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
money that's coming out of the general
 
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
fund that frm is not out of our budget i
 
01:49:12.390 --> 01:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that
 
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
i'm clear as to what my understanding of
 
01:49:16.070 --> 01:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
you're correct attorney young that's not
 
01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
in your budget
 
01:49:23.109 --> 01:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
um so chairwoman continuing on what we
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
have in
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 yes also have if you uh 67
 
01:49:35.910 --> 01:49:35.920 align:start position:0%
number 57 starting at page 26
 
01:49:37.910 --> 01:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
that is the director of diversity and
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
community outreach that we
 
01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:44.870 align:start position:0%
community outreach that we
discussed

01:49:44.870 --> 01:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:46.629 --> 01:49:46.639 align:start position:0%
why would your director serve a
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
five-year term when most directors i
 
01:49:51.589 --> 01:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
believe are a four-year term
 
01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's the way it is here so it
 
01:49:57.510 --> 01:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
that would mirror uh chairwoman the
 
01:49:59.350 --> 01:49:59.360 align:start position:0%
attorney positions in this office those
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
are five-year terms so while the
 
01:50:03.589 --> 01:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
attorney general and the deputy have
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
four-year commissions
 
01:50:07.189 --> 01:50:07.199 align:start position:0%
the attorneys all have five-year
 
01:50:07.199 --> 01:50:08.310 align:start position:0%
the attorneys all have five-year
commissions

01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
01:50:10.550 --> 01:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
i think probably some of the logic was
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
they would depending on the cycle
 
01:50:14.390 --> 01:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
a new attorney general couldn't come in
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
and clean house so to speak
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:24.159 align:start position:0%
and i think that that and that goes into
 
01:50:26.470 --> 01:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
section 158 those two sections go
 
01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:34.550 align:start position:0%
section 158 those two sections go
together

01:50:34.550 --> 01:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%
and that's what we've identified
 
01:50:47.189 --> 01:50:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:49.589 --> 01:50:49.599 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney young all right
 
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
01:50:52.070 --> 01:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
you were looking through your
 
01:50:53.750 --> 01:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
representative leashman
 
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh thanks madam chair
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
so attorney general young the
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
frm two years ago we said did we set
 
01:51:05.109 --> 01:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
some money aside or at least create an
 
01:51:05.119 --> 01:51:06.229 align:start position:0%
some money aside or at least create an
account

01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
to accept any funds recovered or is
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
in 2016 representative leishman there
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
was a bill
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
to the people came and said that there
 
01:51:22.709 --> 01:51:22.719 align:start position:0%
were private funds that would be donated
 
01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
if they could accept
 
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
if they had a fund to put the private
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
funds in the state can't just
 
01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly accept funds
 
01:51:33.350 --> 01:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
and that bill passed and the
 
01:51:33.360 --> 01:51:34.629 align:start position:0%
and that bill passed and the
administrator

01:51:34.629 --> 01:51:34.639 align:start position:0%
administrator
 
01:51:37.910 --> 01:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
of it was to be paid 10 of the funds
 
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
donated that is in the
 
01:51:45.910 --> 01:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
charities budget a section of the doj
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
to my understanding to this date
 
01:51:52.470 --> 01:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
zero funds have been donated therefore
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
nobody's been hired to administer that
 
01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:55.990 align:start position:0%
nobody's been hired to administer that
funds

01:51:55.990 --> 01:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
and i believe that is why representative
 
01:52:01.589 --> 01:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
weiler when he talked about his frm bill
 
01:52:05.589 --> 01:52:05.599 align:start position:0%
that we retained was talking about
 
01:52:05.599 --> 01:52:06.390 align:start position:0%
that we retained was talking about
providing

01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
providing
 
01:52:09.830 --> 01:52:09.840 align:start position:0%
federal funding the governor two years
 
01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:10.709 align:start position:0%
federal funding the governor two years
ago

01:52:10.709 --> 01:52:10.719 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:52:13.589 --> 01:52:13.599 align:start position:0%
put five million dollars up with surplus
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
in each of the two years in hb2
 
01:52:19.109 --> 01:52:19.119 align:start position:0%
that was taken out in division two so
 
01:52:19.119 --> 01:52:19.669 align:start position:0%
that was taken out in division two so
that

01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:52:21.830 --> 01:52:21.840 align:start position:0%
no general fund dollars were passed on
 
01:52:23.910 --> 01:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of the history to date
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
and then we see this money
 
01:52:34.870 --> 01:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:37.109 --> 01:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
thanks and attorney young is going to
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
send me a chocolate bar for getting her
 
01:52:42.950 --> 01:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:43.850 --> 01:52:43.860 align:start position:0%
you'll get a case
 
01:52:43.860 --> 01:52:48.870 align:start position:0%
you'll get a case
[Laughter]

01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes rub reserve walls i have
 
01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
a question of the chair
 
01:52:57.030 --> 01:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
and that is if we pass section
 
01:53:00.149 --> 01:53:00.159 align:start position:0%
76 and house bill two
 
01:53:04.470 --> 01:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:06.390 --> 01:53:06.400 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm practical what page is that
 
01:53:07.910 --> 01:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
on representative wall is my book
 
01:53:20.310 --> 01:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:23.990 --> 01:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
section 72 about the family medical
 
01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:24.790 align:start position:0%
section 72 about the family medical
leave

01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
leave
 
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
no 76 about frm
 
01:53:31.669 --> 01:53:31.679 align:start position:0%
on page 40. correct um that would tell
 
01:53:33.750 --> 01:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
the governor
 
01:53:37.030 --> 01:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
that sometime during the biennium if he
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
had surplus money
 
01:53:40.870 --> 01:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
he could draw a million dollars five
 
01:53:41.830 --> 01:53:41.840 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand
 
01:53:44.950 --> 01:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
in each of the years and put it into the
 
01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:46.470 align:start position:0%
in each of the years and put it into the
fund

01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:53:51.669 --> 01:53:51.679 align:start position:0%
to go to the frm investors
 
01:53:55.030 --> 01:53:55.040 align:start position:0%
so what a lapse create surplus money
 
01:53:57.669 --> 01:53:57.679 align:start position:0%
so no because it's not appropriate the
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
language says the governor is
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
authorized to draw a warrant so he
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't draw a warrant unless he was
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:08.149 --> 01:54:08.159 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to understand where he
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
he gets the money from general fund tax
 
01:54:13.679 --> 01:54:14.310 align:start position:0%
he gets the money from general fund tax
dollars

01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:54:17.270 --> 01:54:17.280 align:start position:0%
at any time this is typical language
 
01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:17.669 align:start position:0%
at any time this is typical language
that

01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
has been in bills that are not in the
 
01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:22.390 align:start position:0%
has been in bills that are not in the
budget

01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
in all the years i've been in the
 
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
legislature okay
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
and representative alicia was shaking
 
01:54:29.990 --> 01:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
and said yes that's normal language
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
thank you it's just i'm not as familiar
 
01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
some of you are with this exact language
 
01:54:35.430 --> 01:54:35.440 align:start position:0%
and i was just trying to understand so
 
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
within his discretion he could find the
 
01:54:40.070 --> 01:54:40.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:54:43.030 --> 01:54:43.040 align:start position:0%
my understanding from talking to
 
01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:43.830 align:start position:0%
my understanding from talking to
previous

01:54:43.830 --> 01:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:54:49.030 --> 01:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:52.310 --> 01:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
is that he can draw that money whether
 
01:54:54.149 --> 01:54:54.159 align:start position:0%
it exists in the general fund
 
01:54:57.430 --> 01:54:57.440 align:start position:0%
or not just like any item that's
 
01:55:00.390 --> 01:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
in the budget this year this year's
 
01:55:02.310 --> 01:55:02.320 align:start position:0%
budget which was passed two years ago
 
01:55:04.310 --> 01:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
before we had a pandemic
 
01:55:06.390 --> 01:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
we have more spending in this year's
 
01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:07.430 align:start position:0%
we have more spending in this year's
budget

01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:55:09.830 --> 01:55:09.840 align:start position:0%
that the agencies are working on than we
 
01:55:11.669 --> 01:55:11.679 align:start position:0%
had revenue because of the pandemic
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
which nobody could foresee
 
01:55:15.430 --> 01:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
and that's why the governor had to take
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
steps to stop that spending
 
01:55:20.550 --> 01:55:20.560 align:start position:0%
so he has a choice with that language to
 
01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
and spend the money whether it exists or
 
01:55:23.760 --> 01:55:25.270 align:start position:0%
and spend the money whether it exists or
not

01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
but we have not voted on that language
 
01:55:28.550 --> 01:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
we have a bill
 
01:55:33.030 --> 01:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
that as you know representative weiler
 
01:55:36.070 --> 01:55:36.080 align:start position:0%
put forward it's my understanding he is
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
working with a couple of people and
 
01:55:40.629 --> 01:55:40.639 align:start position:0%
may come and make a presentation to the
 
01:55:40.639 --> 01:55:41.030 align:start position:0%
may come and make a presentation to the
us

01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:55:42.870 --> 01:55:42.880 align:start position:0%
on that later but i have not yet
 
01:55:44.629 --> 01:55:44.639 align:start position:0%
scheduled him
 
01:55:47.109 --> 01:55:47.119 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the clarification no
 
01:55:47.119 --> 01:55:47.750 align:start position:0%
i appreciate the clarification no
problem

01:55:47.750 --> 01:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
chairman it's just i'm not as i say i'm
 
01:55:51.350 --> 01:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
not quite as familiar with the language
 
01:55:52.470 --> 01:55:52.480 align:start position:0%
as you all and i
 
01:55:54.470 --> 01:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
really appreciate your clarity yeah
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%

will be looking forward
 
01:57:29.830 --> 01:57:29.840 align:start position:0%
to what you guys are going to send over
 
01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
to us so that we can
 
01:57:33.750 --> 01:57:33.760 align:start position:0%
figure out what we're going to do with
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
some of these sections one of my
 
01:57:35.760 --> 01:57:36.629 align:start position:0%
some of these sections one of my
concerns

01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
01:57:39.189 --> 01:57:39.199 align:start position:0%
and i hope you can address it is whether
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're putting some sort of policy in
 
01:57:42.870 --> 01:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
there with your medical examiner that
 
01:57:45.030 --> 01:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
hasn't gone to a policy committee
 
01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
but i think you can clarify that in a
 
01:57:49.990 --> 01:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph or two for us when you
 
01:57:52.550 --> 01:57:52.560 align:start position:0%
send that over so that we all understand
 
01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
and if we don't understand
 
01:57:57.750 --> 01:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
we will reach out to you
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
