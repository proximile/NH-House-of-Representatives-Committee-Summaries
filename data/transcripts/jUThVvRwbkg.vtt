Maguire representing marac District
 
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
27 and I'm presenting Amendment
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
2293 to House Bill
 
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
274 when we heard this in the spring
 
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
there was a quite a bit of opposition
 
00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 align:start position:0%
from various agencies that didn't think
 
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
they should be included in the
 
00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
bill or Exempted or included in
 
00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.150 align:start position:0%
bill or Exempted or included in
rulemaking

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
um I worked with the prime sponsor to
 
00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 align:start position:0%
review those agencies and in most cases
 
00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 align:start position:0%
their testimony was that they were not
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
entirely state agencies they
 
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
were they were in a kind of limbo
 
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
created so that they would comply with
 
00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
Federal rules and laws rather than State
 
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 align:start position:0%
rules and laws
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
and if they were subjected to the
 
00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
administrative rulemaking act they would
 
00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 align:start position:0%
be considered state agencies and
 
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
therefore would not be eligible for the
 
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
large quantities of federal money that
 
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
they were Distributing
 
00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:01.479 align:start position:0%
so I I couldn't see including them in
 
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
this bill we also included from the
 
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
original House Bill
 
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
274 some
 
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
Clauses that
 
00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919 align:start position:0%
um were easy to implement we put them in
 
00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:16.670 align:start position:0%
um were easy to implement we put them in
house

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 align:start position:0%
bills 357 I think it was and so that
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
included the requirement that every um
 
00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 align:start position:0%
rule making register be sent to every
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
member of the legislature
 
00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 align:start position:0%
and also that when there were public
 
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:37.960 align:start position:0%
comments on a rule the agency had to
 
00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
report to Jael car what those comments
 
00:06:44.589 --> 00:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
were and how they handled
 
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
them so what's left of 274 after
 
00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 align:start position:0%
deleting all those agencies are a couple
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
of cases
 
00:06:57.029 --> 00:06:57.039 align:start position:0%
where the sponsor and I felt that we
 
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to to strengthen than legislative
 
00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 align:start position:0%
oversight so if you look at the
 
00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
amendment part one when they're sending
 
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
out notice of
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
rulemaking they have to send it to known
 
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:16.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders which we hope will settle a
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
common complaint that the professional
 
00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479 align:start position:0%
organizations if in case of
 
00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:24.189 align:start position:0%
organizations if in case of
lenses

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:24.199 align:start position:0%
lenses
 
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 align:start position:0%
or um known lobbyists or whatever don't
 
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
get the not of Ru
 
00:07:33.749 --> 00:07:33.759 align:start position:0%
making and so that's something that
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
we're um we think should be fixed and
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
these days when they're sending the
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
notices out by email it doesn't cost a
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
whole lot more to send out 200 notices
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
than 50 so that's there and also they
 
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
will specifically send notice if the
 
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
it's a rule implementing new
 
00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
legislation which is the time that the
 
00:07:59.830 --> 00:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
legislature most
 
00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
wants to be present because that's the
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
time when the first interpretation of
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
legislative intent is made into the rule
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
and it's most important that it be
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
congruent with the legislative intent
 
00:08:14.629 --> 00:08:14.639 align:start position:0%
envisioned by the
 
00:08:17.629 --> 00:08:17.639 align:start position:0%
legislature so they'll send that
 
00:08:24.309 --> 00:08:24.319 align:start position:0%
out and that's part part one part two is
 
00:08:26.589 --> 00:08:26.599 align:start position:0%
in the case where an
 
00:08:26.599 --> 00:08:28.230 align:start position:0%
in the case where an
agency

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
is normally when they're either doing a
 
00:08:36.589 --> 00:08:36.599 align:start position:0%
major rewrite or um implementing new
 
00:08:39.790 --> 00:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
legislation they might go out for
 
00:08:43.149 --> 00:08:43.159 align:start position:0%
comment prior to having a draft of the
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
rule it h so they'll work with people on
 
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know what are the issues and this
 
00:08:51.070 --> 00:08:51.080 align:start position:0%
one says that that when they're doing
 
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
this there they solicit comments they
 
00:08:55.590 --> 00:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
also solicit comments from the
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
legislative policy committee it so uh if
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
Dees is writing a new water
 
00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:05.000 align:start position:0%
rule or they're working on a major
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
revision they would deal with
 
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
resources if oplc is deciding they're
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
going to totally rewrite their uh
 
00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:15.160 align:start position:0%
investigative procedures they might
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
solicit our comment that sort of thing
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
um but again this is only in the case
 
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
where they're soliciting information
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
they just have to include the
 
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
legislature and the third one is
 
00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
right now if the if Del car makes a
 
00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
final objection to a rule for whatever
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
appropriate reason it chooses but
 
00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't vote to submit a um joint
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
resolution to be approved by the full
 
00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:53.000 align:start position:0%
legislature the agency can implement the
 
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:55.320 align:start position:0%
rule except that
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
they do not have the assumption that
 
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
they are interpreting the legislature
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
correctly they have to to prove that
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
they are provide meeting the
 
00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:06.200 align:start position:0%
requirements of the
 
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
legislature this doesn't happen all that
 
00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
often but it does happen and so this
 
00:10:16.670 --> 00:10:16.680 align:start position:0%
goes on to say that if a if someone sues
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
to say this rule does not meet
 
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
legislative intent or it's got some
 
00:10:25.269 --> 00:10:25.279 align:start position:0%
other uh effect the judge the court can
 
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
rule that the the rule is invalid and
 
00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
this amendment simply says that in that
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
fees uh so it's a two rare cases piled
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
on top of each other but um yeah we
 
00:10:49.389 --> 00:10:49.399 align:start position:0%
thought it would encou it would
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
discourage agencies from adopting rules
 
00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:52.990 align:start position:0%
discourage agencies from adopting rules
that

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
are usually very controversial because
 
00:10:58.629 --> 00:10:58.639 align:start position:0%
that's the case where jail car can
 
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
submit a final objection but not submit
 
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.310 align:start position:0%
submit a final objection but not submit
a

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.230 align:start position:0%
a
u

00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
u
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
uh P
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
petition thank you
 
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
so so that was U these are the three
 
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
changes that this amendment would make
 
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
to um the administrative rulemaking
 
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
process simply to get more legislative
 
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.389 align:start position:0%
process simply to get more legislative
involvement

00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
involvement
 
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
early and then if a rule is is judged
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
invalid there's also a monetary penalty
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
namely they pay the uh the plaintiff's
 
00:11:36.079 --> 00:11:37.509 align:start position:0%
namely they pay the uh the plaintiff's
legal

00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
legal
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
fees it completely replaces everything
 
00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:42.519 align:start position:0%
else that was in House Bill
 
00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:45.160 align:start position:0%
274 and if there's any questions I'll be
 
00:11:46.629 --> 00:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
glad to answer them any questions from
 
00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.269 align:start position:0%
glad to answer them any questions from
the

00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee ah
 
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.949 align:start position:0%
committee ah

00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
sure thank you Mr chair um I see that
 
00:12:00.509 --> 00:12:00.519 align:start position:0%
the sponsor s on this bill some of whom
 
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
are shall we say Heavy Hitters in the
 
00:12:07.269 --> 00:12:07.279 align:start position:0%
legislature are they all on board with
 
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
uh this amendment do you
 
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
know I I believe so I've only spoken to
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.069 --> 00:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
there the uh the sponsor is still
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
working on the question of can a um a
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
committee o is it constitutional for a
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
sub Committee of the legislature act in
 
00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
the case place of the full legislature
 
00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
but that is not included here um I'm
 
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:45.069 --> 00:12:45.079 align:start position:0%
shows but she's happy with this any
 
00:12:46.829 --> 00:12:46.839 align:start position:0%
other questions to
 
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
00:12:52.509 --> 00:12:52.519 align:start position:0%
gr thank you I'm in support of your of
 
00:12:55.509 --> 00:12:55.519 align:start position:0%
the amendment um I do think it's
 
00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
important that we work out how the
 
00:12:59.629 --> 00:12:59.639 align:start position:0%
legislative subcommittee
 
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680 align:start position:0%
on rule making interact with and I with
 
00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:04.959 align:start position:0%
the Committees themselves and it might
 
00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
be that depending on what the committee
 
00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:11.240 align:start position:0%
who the committee is there might be a
 
00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
you know there might be um targeted
 
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
approach for each of these um
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
legislative subcommittees and their
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
committees based on R making and their
 
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
tendency to get
 
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:26.120 align:start position:0%
involved okay but that's a matter of
 
00:13:28.990 --> 00:13:29.000 align:start position:0%
house rules is how the how the sub
 
00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
committee's work this would simply
 
00:13:32.199 --> 00:13:33.550 align:start position:0%
committee's work this would simply
require

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
notice and from there how the how it's
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
implemented is up to US Representative
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you Mr chairman uh and
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you very
 
00:13:50.749 --> 00:13:50.759 align:start position:0%
much for your thoughtful Amendment uh I
 
00:13:55.829 --> 00:13:55.839 align:start position:0%
I my my question uh will go to the
 
00:13:59.350 --> 00:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
aspect of workability because uh
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
as you know uh the Jael car meets at
 
00:14:07.949 --> 00:14:07.959 align:start position:0%
least once a month um year round but the
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
legislature is effectively kind of not
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
participatory for about half the year uh
 
00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
in the first year and the second year is
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
white largely impacted by the upcoming
 
00:14:25.350 --> 00:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
election process so how much the the
 
00:14:29.189 --> 00:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
policy committee would be available is
 
00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:33.560 align:start position:0%
an issue and it is yes it is an issue I
 
00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:37.759 align:start position:0%
am expecting that during the offseason
 
00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
well actually even even during the main
 
00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040 align:start position:0%
season we'll be lucky if you get one or
 
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:43.880 align:start position:0%
two people on the committee to actually
 
00:14:47.389 --> 00:14:47.399 align:start position:0%
read the rules this doesn't Force the
 
00:14:49.749 --> 00:14:49.759 align:start position:0%
legislature to do anything it merely
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
gives them the opportunity to be
 
00:14:55.710 --> 00:14:55.720 align:start position:0%
involved and I think we need to continue
 
00:14:58.829 --> 00:14:58.839 align:start position:0%
with the the education to convince
 
00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
people that when you've got your bill
 
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
passed you're not done if it requires
 
00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:07.240 align:start position:0%
rul making you'd better get involved in
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
the rules so if there if it's if the
 
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
rule is created by new
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
legislation I would expect the
 
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor and the CH and maybe somebody
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
else to get involved followup follow up
 
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so um there there already
 
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
is as you know a process by which PE
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
stakeholders would be impacted by these
 
00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
rules uh are invited to participate
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
incourage to participate in the
 
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:42.680 align:start position:0%
formation of the rules by the by the
 
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
agency that will be o charged with
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
overseeing them um uh and uh and that
 
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
culminates in a in a public hearing
 
00:15:59.629 --> 00:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
after the agency has gotten its uh stuff
 
00:16:02.509 --> 00:16:02.519 align:start position:0%
together uh before that rule even goes
 
00:16:05.430 --> 00:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
to the jel car attorneys for their
 
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
vetting of the rule uh and then a public
 
00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
hearing as part of the jel car process
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
but is it your hope that that by this
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
informational process that the that you
 
00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:20.440 align:start position:0%
that you've been speaking to that it
 
00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
will encourage more stakeholders to get
 
00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
informed to get involved because the
 
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
more they bring up issues of workability
 
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.160 align:start position:0%
of a rule and so forth the better we
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
should wind up having a workable rule uh
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
when it when it comes to time for the
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
the final product to come before J
 
00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
you're you're exactly right by getting
 
00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and the PE the people in
 
00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature that are trying to
 
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
change the law that the rule implements
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
getting them
 
00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.240 align:start position:0%
involved at the
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
preliminary rule level or or
 
00:17:02.949 --> 00:17:02.959 align:start position:0%
before is way more effective and it's
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
easier for the
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
agency all right it getting if they get
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
the comments in from the the sponsor of
 
00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
the bill that created the rule saying uh
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
this is pretty good except this one
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
section doesn't doesn't do what I
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
thought it ought to
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
do you know that that's where I hope
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
that the that the comments can be useful
 
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:30.440 align:start position:0%
is when they Iden identify places where
 
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
the agency has made an assumption that
 
00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't worn out and it's within the
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
scope of the law so that the jail car
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
attorneys will say yep that's
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
legal but you might have to deal with
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
intent one more followup thank thank you
 
00:17:53.549 --> 00:17:53.559 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um so one of the aspects um
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
that that is uh is troubling to all of
 
00:17:59.390 --> 00:17:59.400 align:start position:0%
us who are you know involved in the
 
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
process as you and I are on the Jael car
 
00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
is um this interaction uh at when the
 
00:18:12.149 --> 00:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
attorneys bring us their work product um
 
00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:13.640 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that you
 
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:16.120 align:start position:0%
referenced in your testimony was that
 
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
final objections are quite rare do you
 
00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
have any information with regard to how
 
00:18:25.230 --> 00:18:25.240 align:start position:0%
often I've been on the Jael car now for
 
00:18:29.149 --> 00:18:29.159 align:start position:0%
about 17 years uh and and I it seems to
 
00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
me like final objections are quite rare
 
00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
do do you have any statistical
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
information on that no just uh that like
 
00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:41.440 align:start position:0%
you it doesn't I remember two in 11
 
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
there's one about the medic from the
 
00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:45.640 align:start position:0%
medical board and they changed their
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
rules eventually to figure to clear it
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
up and then there was objection to the
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh medical
 
00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:56.039 align:start position:0%
malpractice uh fund that was sustained
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
because you the point that you raised is
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
very valid that uh that the courts have
 
00:19:03.830 --> 00:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
already held that uh that if the if
 
00:19:05.710 --> 00:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
there's been a final objection and the
 
00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
agency has implemented the rule over the
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
final objection of the Jael car that the
 
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
state uh will not back up the agency
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
they're on their own to demonstrate that
 
00:19:19.029 --> 00:19:19.039 align:start position:0%
that rule in fact is
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
constitutional so forth so right um but
 
00:19:24.909 --> 00:19:24.919 align:start position:0%
I it would be interesting for me to know
 
00:19:26.669 --> 00:19:26.679 align:start position:0%
if we could get out of
 
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
oplc uh how of and final because it's
 
00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:32.200 align:start position:0%
not from op from uh it would be from
 
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.470 align:start position:0%
not from op from uh it would be from
legislative

00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
Services that's correct um I will try to
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
have that information for for Thursday
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
because as you stated the the the um
 
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
joint resolution stops a rule that the
 
00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
jail car attorneys uh and the jail car
 
00:19:55.149 --> 00:19:55.159 align:start position:0%
uh just will not accept uh and but that
 
00:19:57.950 --> 00:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
does have to pass both bodies to to
 
00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
become law so that's pretty pretty
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
uncommon as well because the agencies
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
usually do try to accommodate the Jael
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
cars objections and and come up with a
 
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:11.480 align:start position:0%
rule that that the legislative
 
00:20:15.029 --> 00:20:15.039 align:start position:0%
side can can approve so yeah but this I
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
think can be helpful the only time I
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
remember that a rule was implemented
 
00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:23.720 align:start position:0%
over a final objection without a joint
 
00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:27.080 align:start position:0%
resolution was the first uh learn
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
everywhere rules
 
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
where um gel the majority of Jael car
 
00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:35.440 align:start position:0%
voted to make a final resolution but but
 
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
there weren't enough votes to submit a
 
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
joint resolution so those were
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
implemented it was a partisan issue
 
00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
entirely unrelated to the
 
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
the so that I remember that happening
 
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
but that's I there were very very few
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
other I will try and find out any other
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
questions with the committee
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%

00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%

00:21:05.789 --> 00:21:05.799 align:start position:0%

274 okay seeing none I'm going to close
 
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:10.360 align:start position:0%
the uh hearing on the amendment to House
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
Bill 274 and I think we've got about a
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.039 --> 00:30:59.110 align:start position:0%
 
next

00:30:59.110 --> 00:30:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.230 align:start position:0%
 
all

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.240 align:start position:0%

back I'm opening the hearing on
 
00:31:08.279 --> 00:31:10.789 align:start position:0%
back I'm opening the hearing on
Amendment

00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
2349 to House Bill 58 and I call
 
00:31:14.799 --> 00:31:25.310 align:start position:0%
2349 to House Bill 58 and I call
Representative

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
groa thank you madam chair
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
um House Bill 518 which originally was
 
00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission to study
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
revisions of Occupational regulations of
 
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
Pharmacists and pharmacies was retained
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
by our committee with the thought that
 
00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480 align:start position:0%
we would be using it as a vehicle for a
 
00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:48.480 align:start position:0%
non non- gerain Amendment having to do
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
with the modifications that were brought
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
about uh in oplc through House Bill 655
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
655 as you may recall was a rather large
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
bill and we took different um we took it
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
in bite-size
 
00:32:09.830 --> 00:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
pieces and there were these small
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
um elements that were left behind that
 
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
need to be changed in order to make the
 
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
current statute harmonious with the um
 
00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:21.200 align:start position:0%
changes that we made in House Bill
 
00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:25.720 align:start position:0%
655 so that's where this amendment um
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
2349 would be Place House Bill
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
518 and um
 
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
the I don't know if you've had a chance
 
00:32:38.909 --> 00:32:38.919 align:start position:0%
to read it but it does talk about how um
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
the license fee um collection how
 
00:32:46.029 --> 00:32:46.039 align:start position:0%
licenses will be reinstated where this
 
00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
used to be done by the board this is all
 
00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:52.519 align:start position:0%
being done by oplc now and RSA 310 is
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
going to be um the RSA that all of these
 
00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:57.549 align:start position:0%
going to be um the RSA that all of these
um

00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
legislative components um will be
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
found um I think there are people here
 
00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
from oplc who can answer any further
 
00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:10.760 align:start position:0%
questions I believe there is
 
00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
one um one word that needs to be changed
 
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
which Miss which I missed I apologize
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
and I think ah there you are hang for
 
00:33:26.549 --> 00:33:26.559 align:start position:0%
thanks it's on page two and it's um page
 
00:33:31.470 --> 00:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
line 26 where it says holders of lapsed
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
licenses so that sentence makes more
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
sense because we do say earlier that
 
00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.669 align:start position:0%
sense because we do say earlier that
laps

00:33:43.669 --> 00:33:43.679 align:start position:0%
laps
 
00:33:43.679 --> 00:33:46.269 align:start position:0%
laps
licenses

00:33:46.269 --> 00:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
licenses
 
00:33:50.070 --> 00:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
um I mean sorry expired licenses shall
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
not be able to renew all right so that's
 
00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
where that's the only change that we
 
00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
think needs to be done correct yeah are
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
there any
 
00:34:02.669 --> 00:34:02.679 align:start position:0%
questions always a lot of questions when
 
00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
bills thank you Madame chair
 
00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh on what uh repres the representative
 
00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
brought up on line 26 on page two I I
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
can accept that uh but I just wonder
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
what would be the flavor of this
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
committee you know because where we
 
00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:28.720 align:start position:0%
needed to draft another amendment Madam
 
00:34:32.669 --> 00:34:32.679 align:start position:0%
chair on this and uh can we give it sort
 
00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:34.280 align:start position:0%
of like the green light if that's the
 
00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
only change that is to be made because
 
00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
it seems like an awful lot of work went
 
00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:42.919 align:start position:0%
into this yes we
 
00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
should we're meeting again on Wednesday
 
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
to vote on this today is the hearing so
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
we should debate whether this is what we
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
intend and if so can we get enough
 
00:35:00.150 --> 00:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
another amendment that fixes it and but
 
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
for now it's she's saying her intent is
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
that it's for expired
 
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
um well it makes if you read the
 
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
sentence before it says expired licenses
 
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
shall elapse for one year from
 
00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
expiration and holders of expired
 
00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:22.000 align:start position:0%
licenses so it's a it's a continuation
 
00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
of that but I'm sure we can get it
 
00:35:28.950 --> 00:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
redrafted okay and so so to clarify the
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
intent is that for one year after their
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
license expires they may apply for renal
 
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
correct if it's been more than a year
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
they've got to take some extra steps
 
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:41.800 align:start position:0%
correct okay thank you representative
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
Dolan yes thank you madam chair I as one
 
00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
Committee Member I would indeed support
 
00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:50.440 align:start position:0%
that edit uh going forward thank you
 
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:53.440 align:start position:0%
okay repres
 
00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:56.160 align:start position:0%
Mani thank you madam chair I said I was
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
not going to to make a comment but
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
having um had a profession where I had
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
to get licensed for 35 plus years um you
 
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
know it was that onee Gap I mean onee
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
grace period is very helpful because you
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
get the renewal the previous year
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
December if you miss it you forget about
 
00:36:23.349 --> 00:36:23.359 align:start position:0%
it used to be twoyear renewal window and
 
00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
so that really helps if it wasn't for
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
that one year I would have a harder time
 
00:36:33.069 --> 00:36:33.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you any other questions
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
comments thank you very
 
00:36:39.150 --> 00:36:39.160 align:start position:0%
much all right I think we time to bring
 
00:36:42.390 --> 00:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
up OPC and the heavy
 
00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
guns Mr Oster house and director
 
00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:49.040 align:start position:0%
cordney yes representative Schmidt thank
 
00:36:53.829 --> 00:36:53.839 align:start position:0%
you madam chair looking at page two uh
 
00:36:53.839 --> 00:36:55.670 align:start position:0%
you madam chair looking at page two uh
line

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
of uh line
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
8 uh is a kind of a linguistic tangle
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
here I think there's something
 
00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:09.560 align:start position:0%
grammatically wrong or a word
 
00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
missing uh or maybe I'm not able to read
 
00:37:15.950 --> 00:37:15.960 align:start position:0%
it in my Advanced age uh lensy
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
possessing a license in good standing
 
00:37:22.829 --> 00:37:22.839 align:start position:0%
May if to the best of the lenes
 
00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge is what's the subject of is
 
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:33.430 align:start position:0%
 
question

00:37:33.430 --> 00:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
ly I think what you're saying is there
 
00:37:38.349 --> 00:37:38.359 align:start position:0%
should be a comma after
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge no you need you need a noun a
 
00:37:44.790 --> 00:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
ver a noun there or a pronoun the
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
license he possessing May if the best of
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
their knowledge they are
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
not that that that phrasing makes some
 
00:37:55.750 --> 00:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
sense this just doesn't work very well
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
or it's going to be hard for people to
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
really know what it means yes okay so
 
00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:02.599 align:start position:0%
that needs to be reworked I think thank
 
00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
you the intent of that was to clarify
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
that if the office has gone through the
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
bother of collecting of evaluating your
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
application and then denying
 
00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
it not I get I get that part but okay
 
00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:20.440 align:start position:0%
all right yes grammatically it looks
 
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
like they need a they or something in
 
00:38:26.550 --> 00:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
that all right any other questions for
 
00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:28.309 align:start position:0%

00:38:59.230 --> 00:38:59.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak on behalf of the
 
00:39:01.270 --> 00:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
amendment to HB
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
518 um which is essentially just uh
 
00:39:07.589 --> 00:39:07.599 align:start position:0%
further cleanup of opl's uh codification
 
00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
efforts last session um the first part
 
00:39:13.150 --> 00:39:13.160 align:start position:0%
of this is really intended to clarify
 
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
when licenses expire versus when they're
 
00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
able to reinstate I will say
 
00:39:20.870 --> 00:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
historically some boards had been able
 
00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:24.680 align:start position:0%
to do uh a late renewal as opposed to a
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
re a late reinstatement um and this
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
meant that after they their license
 
00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
expired they were permitted to renew
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
their license up to a certain period of
 
00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
time the challenge with that is that the
 
00:39:41.829 --> 00:39:41.839 align:start position:0%
licens uh issuance would back dat to
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
their original period of lure which um
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
which misrepresented a period of
 
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
potential unlicensed practice so last
 
00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:54.359 align:start position:0%
year uh the statute was changed to make
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
it clear that licenses expired at their
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
expiration date and may be subject to
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
reinstatement but with the clarification
 
00:40:05.309 --> 00:40:05.319 align:start position:0%
between the terms lapse and expire the
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
intent is to make clear how long a
 
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
lensey can reinstate and that obviously
 
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:12.520 align:start position:0%
is a policy decision up to you um what's
 
00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:14.160 align:start position:0%
represented here is a period of
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
reinstatement for a year um which is
 
00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:19.400 align:start position:0%
pretty typical but um obviously that's
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
something for you to consider the other
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
thing that this bill does is it defines
 
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
good standing which is a term that we
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
use last here in HB
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
594 um but it was not defined in statute
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
so I thought we should probably Define
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
statute the other major
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
um change that this bill proposes to
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
accomplish is to make clear that our
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
presiding officers can and should assist
 
00:40:53.030 --> 00:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
the boards with um presiding over
 
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary adjudicate adjudicative
 
00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.030 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary adjudicate adjudicative
proceedings

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
so last session we um were able to
 
00:41:02.870 --> 00:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
obtain legislation that directed our
 
00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
presiding officers who are lawyers to
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
preside over disciplinary proceedings
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
but there are hearings that we have um
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
for which are not disciplinary in nature
 
00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:13.960 align:start position:0%
there are licensing proceedings and then
 
00:41:16.910 --> 00:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
non-disciplinary remedial proceedings
 
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
and I would like to say that the process
 
00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
is going very well um and so I think
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
that it makes sense to further require
 
00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
present officers to assist the boards in
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
that regard and there's no real policy
 
00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:31.480 align:start position:0%
reason why I think we would want to
 
00:41:33.309 --> 00:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
distinguish between those two types of
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
proceedings so this proposed uh
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment would make that change as well
 
00:41:43.589 --> 00:41:43.599 align:start position:0%
um and then finally I think on page five
 
00:41:46.390 --> 00:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
and uh this is there the same change is
 
00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
made throughout the bill in a couple of
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
different um places but we have run into
 
00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which a board cannot
 
00:41:56.550 --> 00:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
meet Quorum and has not been been able
 
00:41:59.550 --> 00:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
to meet Quorum and the question becomes
 
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
what is our what are our legal remedies
 
00:42:05.069 --> 00:42:05.079 align:start position:0%
when there is no board for example the
 
00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.440 align:start position:0%
board of registration of medical
 
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
technicians has not met in I believe two
 
00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:11.920 align:start position:0%
years we have a number of complaints uh
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
two of which were uh considered
 
00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
emergencies and there's nothing the
 
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
agency or the state can do other than to
 
00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
try to fill the board position so this
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
would uh allow a situation in those rare
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
circumstances for the agency to act
 
00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
um if the board is not uh if there is no
 
00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:32.480 align:start position:0%
board um and then I said final but I
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
will say final again on page seven um
 
00:42:36.079 --> 00:42:37.109 align:start position:0%
will say final again on page seven um
last

00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
year uh in a couple of different
 
00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
practice acts the what we call charging
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
language for discipline was
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
repealed um with the with the idea that
 
00:42:52.349 --> 00:42:52.359 align:start position:0%
the original version of hp2 650 655 and
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
then 409 included some charging language
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
it didn't end up um being included in
 
00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:00.559 align:start position:0%
the final version and so we think that
 
00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:02.480 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some General charging
 
00:43:04.349 --> 00:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
language for what could constitute
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
misconduct for all professions and then
 
00:43:09.309 --> 00:43:09.319 align:start position:0%
the board still retain the authority to
 
00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
further clarify that in rules or rely on
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
their own practice acts but there should
 
00:43:15.910 --> 00:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
at least be some general C charging
 
00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
language and that's included on page
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
else yes okay
 
00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:29.559 align:start position:0%
no I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:43:32.349 --> 00:43:32.359 align:start position:0%
certain representative sha has a
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
question yes I I think uh another tweak
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
on page five line
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
18 um direct that evidence be sole
 
00:43:47.230 --> 00:43:47.240 align:start position:0%
received solely I think that should be
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.079 --> 00:44:03.150 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
18 yeah should be received solely by a
 
00:44:06.599 --> 00:44:23.870 align:start position:0%
18 yeah should be received solely by a
presiding

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
officer that's the problem with having
 
00:44:29.390 --> 00:44:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
e representative leus sorry um so I'm
 
00:44:36.630 --> 00:44:36.640 align:start position:0%
noticing on line 18 it's received solely
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
and if we make that change solely Oh by
 
00:44:42.069 --> 00:44:42.079 align:start position:0%
a presiding officer and below the next
 
00:44:44.589 --> 00:44:44.599 align:start position:0%
line The Authority given to the
 
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
matter looks like those should be the
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
same so whichever
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.030 align:start position:0%
same so whichever
way

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
it's it just looks odd probably meaning
 
00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:02.270 align:start position:0%
it's it just looks odd probably meaning
is

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
fine it should probably be the yeah all
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
right any other questions representative
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair so uh you
 
00:45:18.349 --> 00:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
referenced earlier in your excuse me in
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
your testimony Madam director um
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
that situations where it's
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
remedial but not
 
00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
disciplinary so that strikes me as a
 
00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
a a gray area that is that well defined
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
it may be that something is not being
 
00:45:44.549 --> 00:45:44.559 align:start position:0%
done right but it's not illegal
 
00:45:50.109 --> 00:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
or awful or what destructive or whatever
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
in which case I mean but the question
 
00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
is how did it happen just ineffective
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
practice is that well defined yes it's
 
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
defined in our statute and it
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
essentially is intended to Encompass the
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances in which typically happens
 
00:46:09.670 --> 00:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
if somebody starts to experience
 
00:46:13.750 --> 00:46:13.760 align:start position:0%
cognitive uh deficiencies it may not be
 
00:46:17.109 --> 00:46:17.119 align:start position:0%
fit to practice but it's not necessarily
 
00:46:18.870 --> 00:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
I mean you could bring a disciplinary
 
00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
action but you don't necessarily want to
 
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
because the issue is not um did they
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
commit misconduct the issue is at some
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
point we have to re-evaluate their
 
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:30.760 align:start position:0%
current Fitness to practice so that
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
those are usually the
 
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
circumstances um and they're few and far
 
00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.800 --> 00:47:09.710 align:start position:0%

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
couple of the items that I was going to
 
00:47:37.109 --> 00:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
bring up I think have been addressed but
 
00:47:39.109 --> 00:47:39.119 align:start position:0%
I'm going to just rein restate them just
 
00:47:42.030 --> 00:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
so we're we're um all on the same page
 
00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
representative fellows you caught one of
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
the the the typos on page five line 18
 
00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:49.960 align:start position:0%
you change B to buy I think that also
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
needs to happen on page six line 16 same
 
00:47:55.829 --> 00:47:55.839 align:start position:0%
thing I think it must have probably just
 
00:47:59.069 --> 00:47:59.079 align:start position:0%
been a a cut and paste yes indeed thank
 
00:48:00.790 --> 00:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
you for catching
 
00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:03.349 align:start position:0%
you for catching
that

00:48:03.349 --> 00:48:03.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:03.359 --> 00:48:05.030 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:08.440 align:start position:0%
so going back to page one in the uh
 
00:48:13.270 --> 00:48:13.280 align:start position:0%
issue of uh reinstatement and re U
 
00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:16.040 align:start position:0%
versus renewal after your license
 
00:48:18.430 --> 00:48:18.440 align:start position:0%
expires so how it is set up is that your
 
00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
license expires today tomorrow week from
 
00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:25.240 align:start position:0%
today you could you could uh pay a late
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
fee and get your license renewed we we
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that with this
 
00:48:32.309 --> 00:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
new language that if I my license
 
00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
expires and a couple of days later a
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
couple weeks later we uh get our license
 
00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
reinstated that we're not paying uh
 
00:48:44.349 --> 00:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
renewal fee and a reinstatement fee as
 
00:48:45.750 --> 00:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
it's set up right now we renew our
 
00:48:47.349 --> 00:48:47.359 align:start position:0%
license and if we're late we pay 50
 
00:48:49.470 --> 00:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
bucks we just want to make sure that
 
00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
it's not a reinstatement fee and a
 
00:48:54.030 --> 00:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
renewal fee I did consult with with
 
00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
director Courtney uh prior to uh this
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
meeting and she said that it's not but I
 
00:49:01.349 --> 00:49:01.359 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make sure that that is
 
00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
brought up and and that we can get some
 
00:49:06.950 --> 00:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
a confirmation on that additionally uh
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
in that section uh starting on line 27
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
page one we would request a potential of
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
a 60-day grace period uh prior to for
 
00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:17.240 align:start position:0%
for many many many many years your
 
00:49:19.109 --> 00:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
license renewed on your birthday kind of
 
00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:20.240 align:start position:0%
like when you need to get your car
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
inspected that's something you know I
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
don't really think about getting my car
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
inspected oh it's October it's my
 
00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
birthday I got to get it inspected so
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
now it's just a date and and with all
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's going on licenses sometimes just
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
forget that date and they've asked for
 
00:49:38.710 --> 00:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh or are requesting um kind of a grace
 
00:49:41.950 --> 00:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
period uh I I'm throwing out 60 days
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
could be less could be more that's up to
 
00:49:45.430 --> 00:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
you and I think you could put this I
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
believe Mr Thompson that we when we went
 
00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.230 align:start position:0%
believe Mr Thompson that we when we went
over

00:49:49.230 --> 00:49:49.240 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
this the
 
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.510 align:start position:0%
this the
license

00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't you can you the lapse occurs one
 
00:50:00.670 --> 00:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
year after the expiration date so there
 
00:50:02.309 --> 00:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
should be no problem
 
00:50:06.750 --> 00:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
whatsoever within a day or a month and
 
00:50:08.789 --> 00:50:08.799 align:start position:0%
if that's not clear enough perhaps we
 
00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
should consider tweaking the language
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
because I think that's the intent that
 
00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay we definitely don't want to
 
00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
penalize someone you know if they mail
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
in their license and and it gets lost in
 
00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:21.760 align:start position:0%
the mail and they have to try again a
 
00:50:25.030 --> 00:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
week later yes representative gr you
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
have an answer
 
00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
well I have a comment I don't think the
 
00:50:30.710 --> 00:50:30.720 align:start position:0%
so what we don't want to have happen if
 
00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't renew because everyone's
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for getting their license
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
renewed at a particular time because
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
they all know when their license is
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
going to expire what we don't want is
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
someone to realize that they haven't
 
00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:46.040 align:start position:0%
renewed their license and then it's
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
reinstated and then it's backdated to
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
the time that it should have been
 
00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:53.160 align:start position:0%
because that they didn't have a license
 
00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
then so I think that that's one of the
 
00:50:59.390 --> 00:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
things we have to consider when we
 
00:51:03.069 --> 00:51:03.079 align:start position:0%
um discuss this the intent is not for
 
00:51:04.549 --> 00:51:04.559 align:start position:0%
that to
 
00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:08.680 align:start position:0%
happen right right so I think the only
 
00:51:12.030 --> 00:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
go back to my my car inspection uh
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
analogy is that you do have 10 days
 
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:16.640 align:start position:0%
after your birthday month to get your
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
car inspected and you can still drive it
 
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
legally so we're just trying to make
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
sure that there is there is times where
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
you do forget uh your renewal dat um and
 
00:51:29.430 --> 00:51:29.440 align:start position:0%
so we were just asking for some grace
 
00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
period there but I do also understand
 
00:51:35.589 --> 00:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
the portion of of not having a license
 
00:51:37.789 --> 00:51:37.799 align:start position:0%
during that that 30 to 60 day period so
 
00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
I I just I don't know I don't have a
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
fixed rate this second but I just was
 
00:51:44.109 --> 00:51:44.119 align:start position:0%
asked to convey that there should be
 
00:51:47.309 --> 00:51:47.319 align:start position:0%
some grace period okay well it appears
 
00:51:50.349 --> 00:51:50.359 align:start position:0%
that there is a one-year grace period to
 
00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:54.720 align:start position:0%
be able to reinstate the license without
 
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:01.960 align:start position:0%
penalty you're but it doesn't start you
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
you don't cover the it doesn't cover the
 
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
period of time where you hadn't renewed
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
it okay and if that and I believe this
 
00:52:13.670 --> 00:52:13.680 align:start position:0%
is a sort of fine print that is normally
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
covered in the r broken out in the rule
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
so I hope you will read it
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
representative representative leus thank
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
you I'm just trying to clarify my
 
00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
understanding the process and maybe
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
somebody from oplc will end up answering
 
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:31.680 align:start position:0%
but so if you don't get it renewed by
 
00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.549 align:start position:0%
but so if you don't get it renewed by
the

00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
expiration then you're you're operating
 
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
without a license for some period of
 
00:52:41.069 --> 00:52:41.079 align:start position:0%
time which is illegal I guess and so the
 
00:52:45.589 --> 00:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
question is yeah you I mean you can get
 
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
it or reinstated by paying the extra 50
 
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
bucks but is somebody going to be
 
00:52:53.349 --> 00:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for operating without a
 
00:52:55.470 --> 00:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
license during that period and and I
 
00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
don't see anything that says you
 
00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:58.309 align:start position:0%
don't see anything that says you
wouldn't

00:52:58.309 --> 00:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
00:53:01.270 --> 00:53:01.280 align:start position:0%
be or is that
 
00:53:04.549 --> 00:53:04.559 align:start position:0%
rules so I can explain uh representative
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
leas uh how it works um right now which
 
00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:12.559 align:start position:0%
is uh if somebody files an application
 
00:53:14.349 --> 00:53:14.359 align:start position:0%
for reinstatement one of the questions
 
00:53:16.710 --> 00:53:16.720 align:start position:0%
is have have you practice without a
 
00:53:20.150 --> 00:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
license and if they answer yes we still
 
00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:21.880 align:start position:0%
proceed with reinstatement because
 
00:53:23.589 --> 00:53:23.599 align:start position:0%
they've met the minimum qualifications
 
00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
to have the license but it gets referred
 
00:53:27.390 --> 00:53:27.400 align:start position:0%
over to enforcement for potential
 
00:53:29.109 --> 00:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
inquiry into whether or not there should
 
00:53:29.119 --> 00:53:30.069 align:start position:0%
inquiry into whether or not there should
be

00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:32.680 align:start position:0%
discipline usually when that happens and
 
00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:34.280 align:start position:0%
the Board of Nursing has the set forth
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
in rules um they go through disciplinary
 
00:53:40.589 --> 00:53:40.599 align:start position:0%
process and they're issued either after
 
00:53:42.309 --> 00:53:42.319 align:start position:0%
a settlement agreement or hearing an
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
administrative fine for practicing
 
00:53:47.309 --> 00:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
without a license but if you if you just
 
00:53:50.390 --> 00:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
let your license expire you know you
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
took 3 months off and then decided to
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
reinstate and you didn't practice there
 
00:53:57.270 --> 00:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be that display plenary process
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
the boards used to hold up somebody's
 
00:54:03.549 --> 00:54:03.559 align:start position:0%
reinstatement if somebody answered yes I
 
00:54:05.750 --> 00:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
practice without a license and and use
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
it to consider whether or not they
 
00:54:09.270 --> 00:54:09.280 align:start position:0%
should issue the license but from our
 
00:54:11.190 --> 00:54:11.200 align:start position:0%
perspective that should never be really
 
00:54:14.589 --> 00:54:14.599 align:start position:0%
a factor because the person has minimum
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
competency okay thank
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
you yes all right thank you and thank
 
00:54:23.710 --> 00:54:23.720 align:start position:0%
you for that and I guess my last I
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
didn't get to ask Lindsay about director
 
00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:28.280 align:start position:0%
Courtney about this but the on page uh
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
three line 10 I'll start above it says
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
the docket file for each such proceeding
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
shall be retained in accordance with the
 
00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:40.119 align:start position:0%
retention policy established by oplc and
 
00:54:41.630 --> 00:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
I just didn't know if it would be
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
prudent to either site where that
 
00:54:45.910 --> 00:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
retention policy
 
00:54:49.990 --> 00:54:50.000 align:start position:0%
is um that would be a good idea except
 
00:54:54.710 --> 00:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
that we that the oplc and the Secretary
 
00:54:58.190 --> 00:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
of St state are uh are working out
 
00:55:00.270 --> 00:55:00.280 align:start position:0%
exactly who would be responsible for
 
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
that the the archist has given um the
 
00:55:07.789 --> 00:55:07.799 align:start position:0%
oplc some guidelines which they are
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
using and enforcing but it's not really
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
their rule it's somebody else's rule
 
00:55:15.549 --> 00:55:15.559 align:start position:0%
okay at at the moment this should get
 
00:55:18.510 --> 00:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
you to it
 
00:55:23.789 --> 00:55:23.799 align:start position:0%
okay that is all I had so well thank you
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
very much thank you representative gou
 
00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:28.400 align:start position:0%
though might have a
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
question thank you madam chair I'm not
 
00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:33.799 align:start position:0%
sure who this question goes to but I
 
00:55:35.789 --> 00:55:35.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I was
 
00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
understanding if a
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
liy forgets to get their renewal in on
 
00:55:45.069 --> 00:55:45.079 align:start position:0%
time and then they oops and they get
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
their application into renew they have a
 
00:55:51.390 --> 00:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
fee for
 
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
reinstatement is there also a penalty
 
00:55:56.710 --> 00:55:56.720 align:start position:0%
were there two fees I I got confused a
 
00:55:57.950 --> 00:55:57.960 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
there thank
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative gold so
 
00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:04.680 align:start position:0%
there is a fee to get your license which
 
00:56:06.270 --> 00:56:06.280 align:start position:0%
is if you're renewing it's the renewal
 
00:56:07.470 --> 00:56:07.480 align:start position:0%
fee if you're reinstating it's the
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
reinstatement fee if you're getting your
 
00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:10.880 align:start position:0%
initial license it's the initial license
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
application fee the only time a fine
 
00:56:15.549 --> 00:56:15.559 align:start position:0%
comes into play is whether you've
 
00:56:17.510 --> 00:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
practiced without a license because that
 
00:56:21.029 --> 00:56:21.039 align:start position:0%
is misconduct and is considered
 
00:56:22.870 --> 00:56:22.880 align:start position:0%
discipline thank
 
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:26.240 align:start position:0%
you any other representative
 
00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:29.559 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you mam chair so I I wonder
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
whether we need to give some more
 
00:56:34.029 --> 00:56:34.039 align:start position:0%
thought to this idea of practicing
 
00:56:37.470 --> 00:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
without a license because uh
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
you uh your license has expired and you
 
00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
forgot about it or whatever but so much
 
00:56:51.309 --> 00:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
of our lives are uh governed by what the
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
insurance companies will cover or not uh
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
and if you're outside of that insurance
 
00:57:02.789 --> 00:57:02.799 align:start position:0%
coverage and there's a problem uh a
 
00:57:05.950 --> 00:57:05.960 align:start position:0%
doctor makes a mistake has an accident
 
00:57:10.029 --> 00:57:10.039 align:start position:0%
or whatever uh and and and they're in
 
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
that gray area where the license has
 
00:57:12.319 --> 00:57:13.789 align:start position:0%
that gray area where the license has
technically

00:57:13.789 --> 00:57:13.799 align:start position:0%
technically
 
00:57:16.910 --> 00:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
expired um or or it's discovered
 
00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:18.309 align:start position:0%
expired um or or it's discovered
afterwards

00:57:18.309 --> 00:57:18.319 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
00:57:22.710 --> 00:57:22.720 align:start position:0%
oh he or she was practicing for maybe a
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
couple of months without the license and
 
00:57:28.109 --> 00:57:28.119 align:start position:0%
then something happened I I I wonder if
 
00:57:30.349 --> 00:57:30.359 align:start position:0%
we need to kind of try and think through
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
this maybe not to solve this particular
 
00:57:37.230 --> 00:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
bills language at the moment but whether
 
00:57:39.589 --> 00:57:39.599 align:start position:0%
we need to think it through a little bit
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
more and come up with a better situation
 
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
I mean for example my I I'm my birthday
 
00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
is on May
 
00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
29th okay so that means when May comes
 
00:57:53.309 --> 00:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
around Bing I know I have to get my
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
license and my registration
 
00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
my vehicle registration
 
00:58:01.630 --> 00:58:01.640 align:start position:0%
renewed uh and I know you have 10 days
 
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
to get the car inspected after the
 
00:58:07.630 --> 00:58:07.640 align:start position:0%
registration period but the registration
 
00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
period the next day if I'm driving on
 
00:58:15.069 --> 00:58:15.079 align:start position:0%
June 1st and I haven't re-registered my
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
vehicle I'm driving an illegal vehicle
 
00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
if I I'm stopped or if I have an
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
accident and so forth um in my case as I
 
00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:28.599 align:start position:0%
say I I I'm aware that I I have H an
 
00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:31.280 align:start position:0%
obligation to re-register my vehicle but
 
00:58:33.630 --> 00:58:33.640 align:start position:0%
somehow it's it's not really till the
 
00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
29th of the month when my birthday is
 
00:58:39.270 --> 00:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
that it it starts flashing red yes thank
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
and I've only got a couple of days
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
before the end of the month so it it
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's but the insurance aspect as I say
 
00:58:49.230 --> 00:58:49.240 align:start position:0%
I'm just wonder whether we we could give
 
00:58:52.710 --> 00:58:52.720 align:start position:0%
some more thought to something about is
 
00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:55.480 align:start position:0%
there an additional period where the
 
00:58:58.910 --> 00:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
license is I don't know director cartney
 
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
if someone submits
 
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
a renewal
 
00:59:07.630 --> 00:59:07.640 align:start position:0%
application you know the day the day of
 
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
the expiration and the pro and it takes
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of days for processing is that
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
considered practicing without a license
 
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:19.400 align:start position:0%
no so and we are required to notify
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
lenses and we do notify lenes 60 days
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
prior to their uh expiration date that
 
00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
they have to renew but under 541a 29a I
 
00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
believe it is um as long as they submit
 
00:59:32.789 --> 00:59:32.799 align:start position:0%
it prior to the expiration and it could
 
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:36.440 align:start position:0%
be 11:59 p.m. it will remain active in
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
our system as designated active renewal
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
until we process the
 
00:59:43.069 --> 00:59:43.079 align:start position:0%
application um so they won't be
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
practicing without a
 
00:59:47.029 --> 00:59:47.039 align:start position:0%
license okay so that as long as they've
 
00:59:50.349 --> 00:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
gotten the application in by the end of
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
the before the expiration date they're
 
00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
good yeah yes and however inconvenient
 
00:59:58.349 --> 00:59:58.359 align:start position:0%
it is for the office right and as long
 
01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
as they can demonstrate an intent or or
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
an attempt to renew we treat that as
 
01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:09.200 align:start position:0%
coming under 541a 29a so if you know
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
they say that the system was not working
 
01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:13.400 align:start position:0%
or the payment processing as long as
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
they demonstrate an an attempt we C we
 
01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
count that as well okay thank you that's
 
01:00:23.029 --> 01:00:23.039 align:start position:0%
reassuring representative ly thank you
 
01:00:25.549 --> 01:00:25.559 align:start position:0%
uh with this is online filing you could
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
do it if the system is down or something
 
01:00:32.109 --> 01:00:32.119 align:start position:0%
but if you mail it by snail mail it gets
 
01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
lost so to have a proof is that
 
01:00:37.789 --> 01:00:37.799 align:start position:0%
something that would be
 
01:00:37.799 --> 01:00:40.029 align:start position:0%
something that would be
considered

01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:40.039 align:start position:0%
considered
 
01:00:43.510 --> 01:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh of that it was with intention of
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
doing it before the expiration like you
 
01:00:48.870 --> 01:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
can say stamped but if the mail is
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
lost so I believe our current rules
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
require that um for paper applications
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
that it be
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
received by the expiration date
 
01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:00.680 align:start position:0%
or um that is something that we could
 
01:01:02.549 --> 01:01:02.559 align:start position:0%
consider changing although I will say
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
that we're gladly moving away from as a
 
01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720 align:start position:0%
matter of routine have our license
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
applications processed via paper um so
 
01:01:13.150 --> 01:01:13.160 align:start position:0%
that may become a nonissue but that's
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
something that we can certainly consider
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative leus thank you uh so
 
01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
the discussion of the motor vehicle
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
registration brought up a question that
 
01:01:25.109 --> 01:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
is a motor vehicle registration you can
 
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
actually handle that the month before
 
01:01:30.789 --> 01:01:30.799 align:start position:0%
your month of your birthday which is
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
what I usually do so how early can
 
01:01:34.829 --> 01:01:34.839 align:start position:0%
someone start the renewal process before
 
01:01:37.910 --> 01:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
the expiration 60 days representative
 
01:01:39.950 --> 01:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay which is when they are
 
01:01:46.230 --> 01:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
reminded okay all
 
01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
right than other
 
01:01:52.430 --> 01:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
questions all right in that case I will
 
01:01:55.269 --> 01:01:55.279 align:start position:0%
close the hearing I will will mention to
 
01:01:58.109 --> 01:01:58.119 align:start position:0%
the committee that we are meeting to
 
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
vote on this on Wednesday so I'll see
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
you all then somebody G clean up the
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
language representative bro are you
 
01:02:11.109 --> 01:02:11.119 align:start position:0%
taking care of these
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:23.359 --> 01:02:26.359 align:start position:0%
 
much
