it provides an extensive overview of how

the committee conducted its business the
 
00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
procedures required of those submitting
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 align:start position:0%
documents because many people today
 
00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 align:start position:0%
allude to that 2012 committee
 
00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
with various degrees of understanding as
 
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 align:start position:0%
to what it actually was and what it
 
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
actually did
 
00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 align:start position:0%
there were 28 petitions initially
 
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 align:start position:0%

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 align:start position:0%

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
other abuses of discretion or power by
 
00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 align:start position:0%
decision makers this is a quote the
 
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 align:start position:0%

modified September 29 2012 comes this
statement

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
the committee determined 20 of the 27
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
complaints were legitimate and
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
pronounced seven unfounded if you read
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
through the various documents coming
 
00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
from this process 11 years ago you will
 
00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 align:start position:0%
discover that reviews were done of court
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
cases in great detail
 
00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:05.639 align:start position:0%
while the committee had no authority to
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
overturn Court decisions because of the
 
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Supreme Court ruling of
 
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
Meryl V Sherburne 1818. nevertheless the
 
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
committee made recommendations against
 
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%
certain judges and marital Masters being
 
00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
mentioned by name and it made specific
 
00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539 align:start position:0%
recommendations for legislation
 
00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
first I mention all of this to steer
 
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
people invoking the memory of this
 
00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
committee for the redress of grievances
 
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
to inform themselves of what it actually
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
was and did before quoting it
 
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
and secondly to let anyone coming before
 
00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:46.199 align:start position:0%
us to know in no uncertain terms we are
 
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
not round two of that committee we will
 
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 align:start position:0%
not be reviewing court cases but looking
 
00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 align:start position:0%
only at slices
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
little sections of a case
 
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
nor will we be making specific
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations about any individual
 
00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 align:start position:0%
those of you wishing to testify please
 
00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
fill out a pink card
 
00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
while you have only to write your name
 
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
I suggest but do not require that you
 
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
also put on the card your telephone
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
number and email address written very
 
00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
legibly so that later as the committee
 
00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 align:start position:0%
starts looking at specific categories of
 
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.080 align:start position:0%
alleged difficulties in the family court
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
system should we need more information
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
from you we can find you
 
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
it has been strongly suggested to me
 
00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:42.900 align:start position:0%
that I read the notice and disclaimer
 
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
statement before every Committee hearing
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
those of you who get the house record
 
00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
will recall that last week this notice
 
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
was on the back page I believe it will
 
00:07:57.529 --> 00:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
continue to appear
 
00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360 align:start position:0%
but anyway I'm asked to read this so
 
00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:02.039 align:start position:0%
here goes
 
00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:04.139 align:start position:0%
the special committee on Family Division
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
of the Circuit Court was formed to
 
00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
investigate allegations of the
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
irregularities including failure to
 
00:08:15.249 --> 00:08:15.259 align:start position:0%
follow or enforce statutes
 
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
unwarranted waiver of or failure to
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
follow court rules delay in rendering
 
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:25.740 align:start position:0%
decisions denial of due process and
 
00:08:28.909 --> 00:08:28.919 align:start position:0%
other procedural issues the committee
 
00:08:30.589 --> 00:08:30.599 align:start position:0%
will conduct hearings relative to the
 
00:08:32.269 --> 00:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
process of the Family Division of
 
00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:33.899 align:start position:0%
circuit court and may make
 
00:08:36.769 --> 00:08:36.779 align:start position:0%
recommendations for future legislation
 
00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:38.700 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the committee is to
 
00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:40.860 align:start position:0%
discover areas where changes in
 
00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
procedure or changes in law regarding
 
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
the Family Division of the Circuit Court
 
00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:47.459 align:start position:0%
might be made
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this special committee is
 
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
not to retry the cases of citizens who
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
disagree with the outcome of litigation
 
00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:00.600 align:start position:0%

court you go to not here
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
members of the public will be given the
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify and present
 
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
information to the committee because of
 
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
the number of people who may wish to
 
00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
testify there may be a time limit
 
00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
imposed on each person testifying which
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
is permissible under house rule 100.
 
00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
appropriate subject matter for
 
00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.750 align:start position:0%
appropriate subject matter for
testifying

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
will be limited
 
00:09:32.329 --> 00:09:32.339 align:start position:0%
to specific instances of where there
 
00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
seemed to be irregularities in process
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
procedure or adherence to rules and
 
00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:39.540 align:start position:0%
statutes that's it
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate subject matter those
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
testifying about subject matter relating
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
to a court case or who submit
 
00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:48.300 align:start position:0%
documentation relating to a court case
 
00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:51.540 align:start position:0%
should know that both will be made part
 
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
of the public record
 
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
therefore subject matter that is either
 
00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
confidential or may be under Co
 
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
should not be discussed should not be
 
00:10:06.170 --> 00:10:06.180 align:start position:0%
submitted to the committee as disclosure
 
00:10:08.269 --> 00:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
of such matters would be a violation of
 
00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.100 align:start position:0%
Statute or a court order
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
the committee reserves the right not to
 
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:19.620 align:start position:0%
accept written or oral testimony or
 
00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:21.980 align:start position:0%
materials which would in its judgment
 
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
violate the foregoing that's the end of
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
the specific statement and I'll close
 
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
with a few more things from me
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
now with that in mind
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
three things please should you wish to
 
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:38.160 align:start position:0%
testify here
 
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
number one that statement I just read
 
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
was a joint effort of myself the
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
speaker's office and the house legal
 
00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:52.200 align:start position:0%
counsel it has passed legal muster
 
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:55.019 align:start position:0%
secondly of the things you may present
 
00:10:56.930 --> 00:10:56.940 align:start position:0%
to us orally electronically or in
 
00:10:59.329 --> 00:10:59.339 align:start position:0%
written form we as a committee do not
 
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
know what may be confidential or under
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
the seal how could we know therefore it
 
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
is entirely up to those bringing us
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
testimony to filter out those items lest
 
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:18.180 align:start position:0%
you find yourself in difficulty you the
 
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
one wishing to provide testimony are
 
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:23.100 align:start position:0%
solely responsible for not bringing
 
00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:24.899 align:start position:0%
these matters forward
 
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
additionally under this point there may
 
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:28.860 align:start position:0%
be some items simple facts or broader
 
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
anecdotes that are not confidential or
 
00:11:34.009 --> 00:11:34.019 align:start position:0%
under the seal that you nevertheless may
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
want to present quietly but not as
 
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
public testimony
 
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
because should they be brought forth in
 
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
form and they are accepted into the
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
record they become part of the public
 
00:11:48.530 --> 00:11:48.540 align:start position:0%
record if you don't want the public to
 
00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:50.519 align:start position:0%
have access to the record of that item
 
00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
don't create the record and please don't
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
do or say or write anything that may be
 
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
hurtful or embarrassing to your children
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
third this is how your testimony shall
 
00:12:05.449 --> 00:12:05.459 align:start position:0%
be presented to us
 
00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
first of all give us your name
 
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
secondly please to the degree you can
 
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.329 align:start position:0%
secondly please to the degree you can
remember

00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
the date time courtroom and judge
 
00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
where the alleged era of the Court took
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
place remember we're not trying a case
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a slice or a snapshot
 
00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:26.820 align:start position:0%
and we need to be able to identify that
 
00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
and then third give us the alleged error
 
00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:31.800 align:start position:0%
what are you complaining about be
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
extremely brief say it in one phrase I
 
00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:36.420 align:start position:0%
believe there was a violation of the
 
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence or the judge let the
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
other party introduce motion after
 
00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:44.220 align:start position:0%
motion after motion tell us in a phrase
 
00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:47.339 align:start position:0%
what your complaint is describe before
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
describe briefly why you think this is a
 
00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:52.620 align:start position:0%
violation of court rules
 
00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:55.019 align:start position:0%
and then five if you or your lawyer
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
objected at that time what was the
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
judge's ruling why did the judge say
 
00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
what the judge said and why did the
 
00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
judge do what the judge did
 
00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:07.740 align:start position:0%
you will have five minutes at which
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
point the microphone your microphone
 
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.480 align:start position:0%
will be shut off
 
00:13:14.269 --> 00:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
um if you wish to give us written or
 
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
electronic testimony it must be as brief
 
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459 align:start position:0%
as five minutes if somebody were to read
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
it aloud if you cannot do this in five
 
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
minutes or less you're not following the
 
00:13:29.449 --> 00:13:29.459 align:start position:0%
rules of what we want
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
those five items I gave can be done in
 
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
under five minutes
 
00:13:37.069 --> 00:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
if your testimony does not follow you
 
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
may be cut off from speaking further if
 
00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:40.740 align:start position:0%
written or electronic your testimony
 
00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
will not be accepted by us in when we go
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
to consider things it won't be
 
00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.790 align:start position:0%
to consider things it won't be
considered

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
considered
 
00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
now remember the last sentence of that
 
00:13:50.629 --> 00:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
notice and disclaimer the committee
 
00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:52.740 align:start position:0%
reserves the right not to accept written
 
00:13:55.129 --> 00:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
or oral testimony or materials which
 
00:13:57.170 --> 00:13:57.180 align:start position:0%
would in its judgment violate the
 
00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.370 align:start position:0%
would in its judgment violate the
foregoing

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
foregoing
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
the reason for this is not to be mean
 
00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
it's not to be insensitive to what
 
00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
you're bringing us
 
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
but to remind you please we are not
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
the second round of the committee of
 
00:14:16.250 --> 00:14:16.260 align:start position:0%
redress of grievances
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
we're going about our business in a very
 
00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
different way so the manner in which the
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
testimony comes to us must serve that
 
00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
purpose it must be usable if we're going
 
00:14:27.889 --> 00:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
to get anything done
 
00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
so testimony in a different form won't
 
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
be useful to us and therefore we won't
 
00:14:35.389 --> 00:14:35.399 align:start position:0%
accept it we don't need it so give us
 
00:14:38.329 --> 00:14:38.339 align:start position:0%
what we need so we can make the
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
suggestions for change that we would
 
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
like to
 
00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:44.030 align:start position:0%
like to
so

00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
some of that will be read again next
 
00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:49.260 align:start position:0%
week and the week after and with that in
 
00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:50.150 align:start position:0%

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
director dcif wonderful to see everybody
 
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.180 align:start position:0%
um thank you chair for the guidance I
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
just had a few things that I wanted to
 
00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
share I wanted to kind of first do a
 
00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
very brief overview of what we do in the
 
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
in the space related to this commission
 
00:16:20.689 --> 00:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
and a little bit about how the court
 
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
process works and then some ideas for
 
00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:25.139 align:start position:0%
things that might be able to be thought
 
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
about differently or better
 
00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
so first off really going to focus on
 
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
the child protection side of the house
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
because I think that's where this is
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
dcyf for those of you who are familiar
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
really focuses on both child protection
 
00:16:37.129 --> 00:16:37.139 align:start position:0%
and juvenile justice but for today's
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
purposes it's going to focus on the
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
child protection side of that the way
 
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
the child protection system works you
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
know very very high level
 
00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:46.860 align:start position:0%
things start with a call to intake
 
00:16:49.189 --> 00:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's our 24 7 hotline somebody picks
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
up that phone takes information about
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
allegations of abuse or neglect we get
 
00:16:55.129 --> 00:16:55.139 align:start position:0%
north of 20 000 calls to that hotline a
 
00:16:55.139 --> 00:16:55.930 align:start position:0%
north of 20 000 calls to that hotline a
year

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:55.940 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:16:58.790 --> 00:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
at that hotline what somebody's somebody
 
00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:00.779 align:start position:0%
has to do is go through what those
 
00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:02.820 align:start position:0%
allegations are and make a determination
 
00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:05.579 align:start position:0%
that if those allegations are true would
 
00:17:07.370 --> 00:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
they be abuse or neglect as a matter of
 
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
Law and if the answer to that question
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
is yes then it gets screened in for an
 
00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:13.980 align:start position:0%
assessment or an investigation
 
00:17:15.949 --> 00:17:15.959 align:start position:0%
we do just north of ten thousand
 
00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
investigations per year assessments
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
investigations per year
 
00:17:21.949 --> 00:17:21.959 align:start position:0%
at that point there's a couple different
 
00:17:24.169 --> 00:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
things that happen one they're assessing
 
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
to see whether in fact abuse or neglect
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
as a matter of law has occurred and two
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
they do a risk assessment to understand
 
00:17:32.330 --> 00:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
kind of what a family's needs and risks
 
00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:34.020 align:start position:0%
are to determine are there any types of
 
00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:35.460 align:start position:0%
supports or services that would be
 
00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
helpful to that family to prevent abuse
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
or neglect from happening in the future
 
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:43.500 align:start position:0%
um only about 10 percent of
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
Investigations result in a substantiated
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
finding of abuse or neglect per year
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
and less than about a thousand per year
 
00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
um child abuse neglect cases go to court
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
that's not how many are necessarily open
 
00:17:57.049 --> 00:17:57.059 align:start position:0%
at any given time but that's how many go
 
00:17:59.570 --> 00:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
to court in a given year right so you're
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
starting from north of 20 000 and the
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
ones that go to court are counted in the
 
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
hundreds so there's a you know quite a
 
00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
filter that occurs through that process
 
00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:10.020 align:start position:0%
um the times that we go to court really
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
fall into a couple a couple buckets
 
00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:13.860 align:start position:0%
um the broad way to think about it the
 
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:14.940 align:start position:0%
Broadway that I think about it is
 
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
whenever we're going to do something
 
00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:17.820 align:start position:0%
that would impinge Upon A Parent's
 
00:18:20.029 --> 00:18:20.039 align:start position:0%
rights then we should be going to court
 
00:18:23.029 --> 00:18:23.039 align:start position:0%
right so specifically if a child is
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
going to be removed from their home and
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
put into foster care some other type of
 
00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:28.320 align:start position:0%
placement then we need to go to court
 
00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:30.419 align:start position:0%
and once you go to court there's
 
00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:32.820 align:start position:0%
judge oversight attorney oversight Casa
 
00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
oversight Etc through that process or if
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
we're going to do something that's going
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
to otherwise you know impinge on a
 
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
parent's right say that we're limiting
 
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:42.240 align:start position:0%
the access of a parent to a child or
 
00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:43.500 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to get a court to
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
order services for that family to try to
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
keep you know that family together and
 
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.350 align:start position:0%
keep you know that family together and
safe

00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
safe
 
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
the work over the past few years has
 
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
shifted quite a bit
 
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:56.460 align:start position:0%
um you know back in 2015 the work really
 
00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
did you know case work where we're
 
00:19:00.049 --> 00:19:00.059 align:start position:0%
opening up a case with families really
 
00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:02.220 align:start position:0%
happened only through the court process
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
and that's because laws had been changed
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
and funding had been changed in the
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
Years prior to reduce our ability to
 
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
offer voluntary services to families
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
that's all been reinstated around
 
00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:16.500 align:start position:0%
2017-2018 in terms of resources and
 
00:19:18.289 --> 00:19:18.299 align:start position:0%
funding so at this point if you looked
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
at the number of cases that we have open
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's after investigation we're opening
 
00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
up you'd see a couple different shifts
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
you would see that the number of kids in
 
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
out of Home Care have decreased over the
 
00:19:29.630 --> 00:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
past few years you would also see the
 
00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:31.740 align:start position:0%
number of in-home cases have increased
 
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
and you would see kind of a new category
 
00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:35.760 align:start position:0%
that has grown and actually surpassed
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
the number of other types of cases which
 
00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
we call prevention cases or voluntary
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
cases and those are cases where we're
 
00:19:43.490 --> 00:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
working with a family either directly on
 
00:19:45.409 --> 00:19:45.419 align:start position:0%
a voluntary basis or through a
 
00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
contracted provider on a voluntary basis
 
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
so there have been major shifts in the
 
00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:51.900 align:start position:0%
past few years to try to shift our work
 
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:53.940 align:start position:0%
away from always relying on court as the
 
00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
intervention towards just being able to
 
00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:57.539 align:start position:0%
help families out because families need
 
00:19:59.750 --> 00:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
help and that's a big that's a big
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
change from the way that we had to do
 
00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:03.900 align:start position:0%
business about five or six years ago
 
00:20:06.110 --> 00:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
when really everything had to go through
 
00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
court if you wanted to provide a service
 
00:20:10.430 --> 00:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
to a family so that's kind of big
 
00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
picture overview
 
00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:14.900 align:start position:0%
um from where I sit you know I think the
 
00:20:17.390 --> 00:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
dcyf's work with the family court has
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
been you know positive I think you know
 
00:20:21.529 --> 00:20:21.539 align:start position:0%
there are uh processes in place if
 
00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
there's disagreements on individual
 
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:24.900 align:start position:0%
cases right motions for reconsideration
 
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
and appeal processes
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
um there is also something called the
 
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
children and Court Improvement project
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
which has meetings once a month it
 
00:20:36.789 --> 00:20:36.799 align:start position:0%
includes judges Court staff dcyf staff
 
00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419 align:start position:0%
parent attorneys children's attorneys
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
Casas judicial Council and they meet
 
00:20:43.909 --> 00:20:43.919 align:start position:0%
monthly to talk about kind of how the
 
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:46.559 align:start position:0%
children in court process is working for
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
dcyf related matters and create
 
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:51.720 align:start position:0%
trainings and protocols and hosts of
 
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
other things sometimes come up with
 
00:20:54.409 --> 00:20:54.419 align:start position:0%
recommendations for legislation that
 
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
have been passed in the years since I've
 
00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
been here so you know from that level I
 
00:21:00.409 --> 00:21:00.419 align:start position:0%
think that works quite well and it works
 
00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
quite well because they get you know key
 
00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
stakeholders from across different sides
 
00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:06.660 align:start position:0%
of these issues to talk through what's
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
working what's not working and how to
 
00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
make sure the process is working well
 
00:21:13.730 --> 00:21:13.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
so big picture that's kind of you know
 
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
background on this if I wanna I can take
 
00:21:20.450 --> 00:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
questions now or I can jump into some of
 
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
my thoughts about where we might be
 
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
thinking about doing better in the
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
future if folks would like
 
00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'd like to give the committee a chance
 
00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
to ask any questions of what we've heard
 
00:21:34.610 --> 00:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
thus far representative long
 
00:21:36.710 --> 00:21:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you Mr
 
00:21:39.289 --> 00:21:39.299 align:start position:0%
ribson the um the appeals and
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
reconsideration process uh
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
what percentage is that at and would
 
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%
that be would that percentage be of the
 
00:21:49.970 --> 00:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
hundred that go to court
 
00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
I don't know DNA or bathroom either of
 
00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:53.750 align:start position:0%
I don't know DNA or bathroom either of

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:55.140 align:start position:0%
so if I understand your question
 
00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
representative long you're saying that
 
00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
the appeals and reconsideration process
 
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
that is only for court involved cases
 
00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
okay okay and what percentage uh follow
 
00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:06.059 align:start position:0%
up for me follow up what percentage is
 
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
that I don't know I would have to ask
 
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.409 align:start position:0%
that I don't know I would have to ask
Deanna

00:22:09.409 --> 00:22:09.419 align:start position:0%
Deanna
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
we do not have data on that oh okay okay
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
thank you probably not a majority right
 
00:22:14.159 --> 00:22:15.529 align:start position:0%
thank you probably not a majority right
no

00:22:15.529 --> 00:22:15.539 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
so dance behind it sorry that was quick
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
wow what what I would say is that um so
 
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
my position is the legal director
 
00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:29.700 align:start position:0%
position that in 2017 was placed under
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
the supervision of the Attorney
 
00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
General's office and so I am responsible
 
00:22:36.289 --> 00:22:36.299 align:start position:0%
for the supervision of the entire dcyf
 
00:22:39.049 --> 00:22:39.059 align:start position:0%
legal team which consists now of a lot
 
00:22:42.289 --> 00:22:42.299 align:start position:0%
more attorneys thankfully to do the work
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%
and because we are so connected now with
 
00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office we are
 
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
regularly looking at cases that come
 
00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
down that we disagree with and if we
 
00:22:53.390 --> 00:22:53.400 align:start position:0%
need to we are having conversations
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
about the best approach to deal with the
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
case and we are also now able to take
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
cases to the New Hampshire Supreme Court
 
00:23:03.169 --> 00:23:03.179 align:start position:0%
previously we were required to do a de
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
novo appeal and now we are taking cases
 
00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
up and we are getting decisions and it's
 
00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:10.740 align:start position:0%
been great
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
would you say that with the new and
 
00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
improved and enlarged team on site and
 
00:23:18.900 --> 00:23:20.450 align:start position:0%
improved and enlarged team on site and
appeals

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:20.460 align:start position:0%
appeals
 
00:23:24.470 --> 00:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
this filters down so that judges will
 
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
say oh if this kind of thing is likely
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
to be appealed we won't do this kind of
 
00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
thing so the number of appeals is
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
decreasing one would hope well so the
 
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
appeal process that's in place now has
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
not been in place for a really long time
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
so we're still too soon getting there
 
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
um I would say that anytime new judges
 
00:23:49.310 --> 00:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
come on the bench we think to ourselves
 
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
oh I hope they've been trained really
 
00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:52.980 align:start position:0%
well in child protection because there's
 
00:23:55.690 --> 00:23:55.700 align:start position:0%
so many nuances to the work that we do
 
00:23:59.450 --> 00:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
and director ribsum referred to those
 
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:02.700 align:start position:0%
protocols those are really helpful in
 
00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
giving a road map not just to judges but
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
to everybody that's involved in the
 
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
child protection system
 
00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:13.100 align:start position:0%
so we would hope that the soon to be
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
expanded amount of hours devoted to
 
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:20.220 align:start position:0%
continuing education of Judges that I'm
 
00:24:22.850 --> 00:24:22.860 align:start position:0%
going to request will really get them up
 
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
to speed quickly and the number of
 
00:24:27.649 --> 00:24:27.659 align:start position:0%
appeals would start to move down as the
 
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
system starts flowing better potentially
 
00:24:33.529 --> 00:24:33.539 align:start position:0%
as new laws are enacted there's going to
 
00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
be challenges to those laws so it's not
 
00:24:39.409 --> 00:24:39.419 align:start position:0%
just dcyf that's able to appeal if
 
00:24:41.870 --> 00:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
parent attorneys it's Casa every party
 
00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
to our child protection cases can take a
 
00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
case to the Supreme Court
 
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
for cause or just because they're
 
00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
mandatory Appeals
 
00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.850 align:start position:0%
mandatory Appeals
oh

00:24:52.850 --> 00:24:52.860 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:24:54.529 --> 00:24:54.539 align:start position:0%
so they're accepted by the Supreme Court
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
so and we've seen a lot of actually an
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
increase recently in appeals from
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
permanency decisions um which is sort of
 
00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
at the end of I'm sorry I can't see all
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
of you which is sort of at the end of
 
00:25:11.390 --> 00:25:11.400 align:start position:0%
the 169 C Child Protection proceeding we
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
have something called a permanency
 
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
hearing and that's the point where we
 
00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
ask the court to adopt a permanent plan
 
00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
for a child which hopefully is
 
00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:19.730 align:start position:0%
for a child which hopefully is
reunification

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:19.740 align:start position:0%
reunification
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
if not it would be adoption guardianship
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
or apple which is another planned
 
00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:27.480 align:start position:0%
permanent living Arrangement just to
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
nail it down
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
um this is a mandatory appeal correct
 
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court is taking them not
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
appeal for violation of law or process
 
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
just mandatory
 
00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure folks are clear
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
on the term mandatory there it's
 
00:25:45.169 --> 00:25:45.179 align:start position:0%
mandatory in terms that the Supreme
 
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:47.700 align:start position:0%
Court must hear it if it is brought it's
 
00:25:49.130 --> 00:25:49.140 align:start position:0%
not mandatory in the sense that an
 
00:25:51.890 --> 00:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
appeal must be brought on every case
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:25:54.600 --> 00:26:00.490 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
Smith

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:00.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.409 --> 00:26:03.419 align:start position:0%
correct okay which is a very different
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
yes statements in mandatory appeals
 
00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:08.700 align:start position:0%
thank you yes
 
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the committee
 
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
representative long I thank you Mr
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
chairman you'd spoke briefly on uh the
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
permanency hearings as one common uh I
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
was going to ask any particular appeals
 
00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:27.960 align:start position:0%
or re or reconsiderations that stand out
 
00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
to you other than it sounds like
 
00:26:32.930 --> 00:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
permanency hearings are one of them is
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
there something else we frequently see
 
00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:38.100 align:start position:0%
appeals from uh termination of parental
 
00:26:41.330 --> 00:26:41.340 align:start position:0%
rights cases and now because we no
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
longer need to have a de novo appeal
 
00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
before the Superior Court there are
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
appeals of 169 C adjudicatory and
 
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:58.130 --> 00:26:58.140 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon
 
00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Mr ripson you've
 
00:27:03.769 --> 00:27:03.779 align:start position:0%
uh spoke of a children's Court
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
Improvement project that's ongoing and
 
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
based on the description of the special
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
committee on the on the family circuit
 
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
court is there a redundancy between that
 
00:27:16.850 --> 00:27:16.860 align:start position:0%
existing committee and what we're now
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
initiating at this point
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know that I would call it a
 
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
redundancy because I think this this
 
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
committee has a broader purview that
 
00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
really is focused specifically on the
 
00:27:27.049 --> 00:27:27.059 align:start position:0%
processes that happen within a child
 
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
protection court case and a lot of it
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
really digs deeply into you know the the
 
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:34.140 align:start position:0%
protocols for how things could best
 
00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:36.299 align:start position:0%
operate within court right so you have
 
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
of course you know your laws and you
 
00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:39.419 align:start position:0%
have your court rules and this is a
 
00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
group of people that come together to
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
try to make sure that on case-by-case
 
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:44.220 align:start position:0%
basis you know that not on Facebook but
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
that on individual cases
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
um the process is working well so I
 
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
think there's definitely some overlap
 
00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
but I wouldn't call it a a redundancy
 
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
because I think your purview is broader
 
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
one follow-up Mr chairman follow-up uh
 
00:27:57.289 --> 00:27:57.299 align:start position:0%
brief follow-up in the description of
 
00:27:59.890 --> 00:27:59.900 align:start position:0%
this committee is to review
 
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
issues quote including failure to follow
 
00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:05.880 align:start position:0%
or enforce statutes and the work for the
 
00:28:07.909 --> 00:28:07.919 align:start position:0%
for the Improvement project is there any
 
00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:10.460 align:start position:0%
reports or data you can provide this
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
committee on Finance in that regard yeah
 
00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
so I think most of what they most of
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
what they uh release are comes out in
 
00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
the form of kind of Court protocols and
 
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
how kind of the court process is
 
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
supposed to work and those those are
 
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:25.500 align:start position:0%
public and published so I imagine we
 
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
could provide those so that folks can
 
00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:29.220 align:start position:0%
see you know kind of the the outcome of
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
that work okay thank you sir thank you
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and the chair is yet again
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
grateful that the committee researchers
 
00:28:36.289 --> 00:28:36.299 align:start position:0%
are already typing out what I haven't
 
00:28:38.269 --> 00:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
yet asked her but she knows I'm going to
 
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:40.740 align:start position:0%
and that is who are they on this when do
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%
they meet and get me the reports thank
 
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:43.870 align:start position:0%
they meet and get me the reports thank
you

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:28:45.769 --> 00:28:45.779 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you um if I could just follow up
 
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
on my my colleague's comment isn't The
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
crucial difference that this is a
 
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
legislative committee and in terms of
 
00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:00.200 align:start position:0%
separation of powers there are
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
opportunities and responsibilities that
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch has that
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
significantly differ from either the
 
00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:12.779 align:start position:0%
administrative executive branch and the
 
00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:15.000 align:start position:0%
judicial branch yeah Andy that makes
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
sense to me I'd agree
 
00:29:19.669 --> 00:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
representative Lanza
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:29:26.029 --> 00:29:26.039 align:start position:0%
um how many caseworkers do you usually
 
00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:29.640 align:start position:0%
have and how how many how much is their
 
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
caseload when they have families that
 
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:35.100 align:start position:0%
they have to see yes so we have at this
 
00:29:36.769 --> 00:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
point I think
 
00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:38.940 align:start position:0%
if I'm talking just Frontline case
 
00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:40.440 align:start position:0%
workers because we have folks that do
 
00:29:42.169 --> 00:29:42.179 align:start position:0%
other types of case work so front line
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
that's our assessment workers that do
 
00:29:45.049 --> 00:29:45.059 align:start position:0%
investigations and Family Service
 
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
workers who do you know these Court
 
00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:48.480 align:start position:0%
types of cases that we're talking about
 
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:51.380 align:start position:0%
I think we have somewhere around
 
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
280 positions
 
00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:55.260 align:start position:0%
I think we have currently about a 10
 
00:29:57.649 --> 00:29:57.659 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate
 
00:29:57.659 --> 00:29:58.250 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate
um

00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:58.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
which is you know better than it has
 
00:30:02.330 --> 00:30:02.340 align:start position:0%
been and in the current climate you know
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
compared to what we're seeing in other
 
00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
areas of state government it's you know
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
better than what we're we're seeing
 
00:30:08.389 --> 00:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
which I think part of that I think that
 
00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
has to do with a couple things one there
 
00:30:12.049 --> 00:30:12.059 align:start position:0%
was work done over the last couple years
 
00:30:13.850 --> 00:30:13.860 align:start position:0%
to adjust the salaries of Frontline
 
00:30:15.529 --> 00:30:15.539 align:start position:0%
staff to make them more competitive with
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
other states and other types of jobs
 
00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
which has helped bring people in and a
 
00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:20.820 align:start position:0%
lot of work to try to reduce caseloads
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
which you know when I first got here
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
were in the 60s and currently are in the
 
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
The High Teens our goal for case loads
 
00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:28.980 align:start position:0%
though is to get lower than we are today
 
00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
so the goal for us for caseloads is that
 
00:30:33.769 --> 00:30:33.779 align:start position:0%
we want to get to 12 cases per
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
assessment staff that's the folks doing
 
00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:40.140 align:start position:0%
the investigatory work and 10 cases per
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
um family service worker those are the
 
00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:43.860 align:start position:0%
folks that do the ongoing cases right
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
now our caseloads have been hovering
 
00:30:47.389 --> 00:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
more in the mid the the mid to Upper
 
00:30:49.610 --> 00:30:49.620 align:start position:0%
teens up to even 20 for assessment staff
 
00:30:52.549 --> 00:30:52.559 align:start position:0%
and in the mid-teens around 15 14 for
 
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
family service staff
 
00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.100 align:start position:0%
and there's a few things that have
 
00:30:57.409 --> 00:30:57.419 align:start position:0%
contributed to that over the past few
 
00:30:59.330 --> 00:30:59.340 align:start position:0%
years um particularly over this last
 
00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:01.130 align:start position:0%
years um particularly over this last
year

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:01.140 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:31:03.470 --> 00:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
we've actually seen increased volume
 
00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
over the past 12 months in terms of
 
00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
calls to the hotline in terms of new
 
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
assessments and in terms of court cases
 
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
over the prior couple years so the
 
00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:15.240 align:start position:0%
volume of work has actually grown even
 
00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:16.740 align:start position:0%
though our Workforce has grown the
 
00:31:18.289 --> 00:31:18.299 align:start position:0%
volume of work has also grown at the
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
same time and while I don't have good
 
00:31:21.889 --> 00:31:21.899 align:start position:0%
debt on exactly what the driving forces
 
00:31:23.750 --> 00:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
are behind that the anecdotal things
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
that I'm hearing from staff is that a
 
00:31:27.049 --> 00:31:27.059 align:start position:0%
lot of it has to do with kind of what I
 
00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:29.340 align:start position:0%
would call increased complexity or
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
Acuity of some of the families and cases
 
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
that we're working with particularly
 
00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:34.940 align:start position:0%
related to things like Fentanyl
 
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
and and that being a substance that's
 
00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:39.980 align:start position:0%
just simply deadly
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
compared to some of the other substances
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
that that we've historically been
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
working with
 
00:31:48.409 --> 00:31:48.419 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:49.860 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
00:31:51.289 --> 00:31:51.299 align:start position:0%
and answering answering our questions
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
today I just wondered and I know that
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
the complexity of case to case is very
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
very different but do you have kind of
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
like an average
 
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
um how long these investigations and I
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
do know that there's going to be some
 
00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:04.500 align:start position:0%
outliers either way but what your normal
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
length of time for doing an
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
investigation and kind of coming to
 
00:32:09.889 --> 00:32:09.899 align:start position:0%
either found it or not found it is yeah
 
00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
so the our protocol is that they're
 
00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
supposed to be completed within 60 days
 
00:32:15.230 --> 00:32:15.240 align:start position:0%
I think on average we see that they are
 
00:32:16.909 --> 00:32:16.919 align:start position:0%
completed within 60 days but there are a
 
00:32:18.289 --> 00:32:18.299 align:start position:0%
number that end up taking longer than
 
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
that for a number of reasons it could be
 
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
it could be within a discrete office
 
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
Workforce issues that are getting in the
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
way it could be complexities with
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
co-occurring law enforcement
 
00:32:29.389 --> 00:32:29.399 align:start position:0%
investigations which when that occurs we
 
00:32:30.950 --> 00:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
kind of Step into the front seat for the
 
00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
purpose of child safety but they're kind
 
00:32:34.370 --> 00:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
of in the front seat for the purpose of
 
00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
investigatory processes so we kind of
 
00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
take a step back to let them do what
 
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
they need to do from a criminal
 
00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:40.740 align:start position:0%
perspective which means that you know
 
00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:42.539 align:start position:0%
some of our investigatory processes kind
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
of get paused so there's a couple
 
00:32:45.649 --> 00:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
different reasons why things could take
 
00:32:48.049 --> 00:32:48.059 align:start position:0%
long longer than that but the I think on
 
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:50.640 align:start position:0%
average and by policy 60 days is the
 
00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:52.140 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:53.330 align:start position:0%
time frame
follow-up

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
thank you so when it does take a little
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
bit longer is there some kind of
 
00:32:59.690 --> 00:32:59.700 align:start position:0%
communication like you know not giving
 
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
specifics obviously because you can't
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
open up a case when it's still being but
 
00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:04.380 align:start position:0%
saying like hey this is just going to
 
00:33:06.169 --> 00:33:06.179 align:start position:0%
take a little bit longer or people just
 
00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
kind of in limbo until it gets done yeah
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
there should you know caseworkers should
 
00:33:11.149 --> 00:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
be having Communications with the
 
00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:12.659 align:start position:0%
families that they're working with all
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
along there's requirements for for
 
00:33:16.669 --> 00:33:16.679 align:start position:0%
contact on a monthly basis and
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
everything like that so there should be
 
00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.789 --> 00:33:25.799 align:start position:0%
in the um
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
I jotted it down quickly as children in
 
00:33:29.990 --> 00:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
court Improvement project that may not
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
be the correct title exactly
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
did I get that wrong no I may have
 
00:33:36.769 --> 00:33:36.779 align:start position:0%
written it wrong I may have gotten it
 
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:37.980 align:start position:0%
wrong too
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
well I'm not playing one dance manship
 
00:33:42.350 --> 00:33:42.360 align:start position:0%
with you so stop it
 
00:33:44.570 --> 00:33:44.580 align:start position:0%
it's the New Hampshire Court Improvement
 
00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
Project New Hampshire Court Improvement
 
00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:50.700 align:start position:0%
project okay
 
00:33:54.169 --> 00:33:54.179 align:start position:0%
the group of us that are on the
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
committee are called the model Court
 
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:01.039 align:start position:0%
model the model the model m-o-d-e-l not
 
00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:04.220 align:start position:0%
m-o-t-t-l-e yes
 
00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
okay and you would be part of this I am
 
00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
okay I have been since about
 
00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:15.740 align:start position:0%
2009 I think 79 wow no not that one
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
any other questions for what we've heard
 
00:34:22.609 --> 00:34:22.619 align:start position:0%
so far is seeing none
 
00:34:26.329 --> 00:34:26.339 align:start position:0%
pick it up okay so a few few areas that
 
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
I have for recommendations and I I don't
 
00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:30.540 align:start position:0%
know if how many of these would really
 
00:34:32.930 --> 00:34:32.940 align:start position:0%
be a huge surprise to folks but you know
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
one of the pain points I currently hear
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
is you know access to bench time and
 
00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
judge time right which comes down to
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
oftentimes you know the number of Judges
 
00:34:41.869 --> 00:34:41.879 align:start position:0%
that we have available to hear cases I
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
do know that child protection cases tend
 
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
to get priority so you know if we are
 
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
having a hard time accessing I imagine
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
that other folks who have you know cases
 
00:34:52.490 --> 00:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
before the family court have oftentimes
 
00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:54.419 align:start position:0%
even more difficulty accessing I think
 
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
that often does come down to just simply
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
you know availability of judges and the
 
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
number of judges
 
00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:02.820 align:start position:0%
um well we're working on that this
 
00:35:06.109 --> 00:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
budget we are and I'm glad to see that
 
00:35:07.849 --> 00:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
couple other things that come up a lot
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
that I think are worth the committee's
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
thought for the long term is thinking
 
00:35:13.609 --> 00:35:13.619 align:start position:0%
about parental representation and better
 
00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
support for that I believe there's
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
something in this budget process for
 
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
that as well but um we often have a hard
 
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
time having enough parent attorneys to
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
represent parents in these matters part
 
00:35:26.089 --> 00:35:26.099 align:start position:0%
of that could come down to the the
 
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
funding and I do believe like I said
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
there's something in the budget this
 
00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:29.820 align:start position:0%
year I haven't been following it closely
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
to address that issue but also in terms
 
00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:34.370 align:start position:0%
to address that issue but also in terms
of

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:34.380 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
um you know access to training and
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
resources and support for those family
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
attorneys that do parental
 
00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:42.660 align:start position:0%
representation in these cases you know
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire because we're a
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
smaller State this has been established
 
00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:47.460 align:start position:0%
essentially in a way that individual
 
00:35:49.370 --> 00:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
attorneys out in the community get paid
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
an hourly rate to do this work other
 
00:35:53.630 --> 00:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions set up kind of centralized
 
00:35:55.430 --> 00:35:55.440 align:start position:0%
offices where you have staff attorneys
 
00:35:57.770 --> 00:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
who do this work that specialize in it I
 
00:35:59.390 --> 00:35:59.400 align:start position:0%
don't know you know I can't answer the
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
question as to whether our state is of
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
the size to support that I think that's
 
00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.099 align:start position:0%
really a question for other folks to
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
weigh in on for the the towards the
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
judicial Council Etc but it is something
 
00:36:10.670 --> 00:36:10.680 align:start position:0%
to think about I think in terms of being
 
00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
able to make sure you have a pool of
 
00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys that are are capable
 
00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
well-educated supported in doing this
 
00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:17.870 align:start position:0%
well-educated supported in doing this
work

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:18.970 align:start position:0%
work
um

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:18.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:23.329 --> 00:36:23.339 align:start position:0%
give me a guess as to how many dedicated
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
family attorneys I don't mean they're
 
00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
dedicated to their job they're dedicated
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
to the task of being a family attorney
 
00:36:34.849 --> 00:36:34.859 align:start position:0%
versus how many GP lawyers are you
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
having do family from time to time oh I
 
00:36:39.230 --> 00:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
don't know that do you have any sense of
 
00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's a that's difficult I think that
 
00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.130 align:start position:0%
that's a that's difficult I think that
there's

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:36:48.109 --> 00:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
always been sort of a core group of
 
00:36:51.230 --> 00:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys who have represented parents
 
00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:55.500 align:start position:0%
in um in our cases and many of them will
 
00:36:59.089 --> 00:36:59.099 align:start position:0%
travel anywhere from Berlin to Nashua
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
um which is a huge swath and it's a huge
 
00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
responsibility for those parent
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
attorneys to have to
 
00:37:08.050 --> 00:37:08.060 align:start position:0%
do that work
 
00:37:10.910 --> 00:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
numbers wise if I had to guess I would
 
00:37:16.490 --> 00:37:16.500 align:start position:0%
say maybe 30 around the state
 
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:19.380 align:start position:0%
that regularly do it and and will take
 
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.450 align:start position:0%
that regularly do it and and will take
appointments

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
appointments
 
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
and that's just a guess so I'm going to
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
beat this point to death therefore those
 
00:37:28.089 --> 00:37:28.099 align:start position:0%
who are not dedicated
 
00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:31.740 align:start position:0%
Specialists to this but do it sometimes
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
because it needs to be done
 
00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:35.940 align:start position:0%
um are at a disadvantage that they are
 
00:37:37.849 --> 00:37:37.859 align:start position:0%
not doing it full time and so therefore
 
00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:39.540 align:start position:0%
there needs to be more training well I
 
00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:41.700 align:start position:0%
think training is always a good thing
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
um and I think that of those 30 those
 
00:37:45.829 --> 00:37:45.839 align:start position:0%
are the people that I'm saying like we
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
see regularly so we work with them
 
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
regularly they know the protocols they
 
00:37:52.130 --> 00:37:52.140 align:start position:0%
know the statutes and they understand
 
00:37:55.130 --> 00:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
the work there are certain times when
 
00:37:57.410 --> 00:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
you know private attorneys will come
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
into our cases and they have no idea
 
00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
what the general process is supposed to
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
look like and sometimes those cases can
 
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
go sideways yeah representative Smith
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
thank you when you are
 
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
talking about the need for more
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
attorneys specializing
 
00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:17.030 align:start position:0%
attorneys specializing
um

00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:20.220 align:start position:0%
are you also proposing that these
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
attorneys be compensated with public
 
00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:23.770 align:start position:0%
attorneys be compensated with public
funds

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:23.780 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:38:26.270 --> 00:38:26.280 align:start position:0%
yes as long as you know the the way that
 
00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
it currently works if the parents you
 
00:38:30.589 --> 00:38:30.599 align:start position:0%
know qualify for
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
um for support on that then public funds
 
00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
do support that so I think to the extent
 
00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
that you know and that's an awful lot of
 
00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:39.240 align:start position:0%
our cases an awful lot of our cases fall
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
into that bucket so yeah public funds
 
00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
would need to be available to support
 
00:38:44.569 --> 00:38:44.579 align:start position:0%
that work
 
00:38:48.589 --> 00:38:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
representative ball
 
00:38:52.790 --> 00:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me I'm just curious if this list
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
of attorneys who specialize in this
 
00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:00.300 align:start position:0%
field is that list provided to all the
 
00:39:02.569 --> 00:39:02.579 align:start position:0%
parents or is it accessible to the
 
00:39:05.089 --> 00:39:05.099 align:start position:0%
parents to know who to go to to
 
00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
um so the courts generally know the
 
00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:15.060 align:start position:0%
court clerks will know who in the area
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
is willing to take the work if we
 
00:39:20.750 --> 00:39:20.760 align:start position:0%
um over the years if I've encountered an
 
00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:22.500 align:start position:0%
attorney who I think would be good at
 
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
doing our work I would encourage them to
 
00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:27.380 align:start position:0%
sign up with thank you
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
sign up with the um the court clerk in
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
their area that they're willing to take
 
00:39:34.609 --> 00:39:34.619 align:start position:0%
the work but there's not a list that
 
00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
parents can call and cold call attorneys
 
00:39:39.170 --> 00:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
and ask them although they could call
 
00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
any attorney in the state of New
 
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
follow up please follow up thank you so
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
in other words we don't have a situ um a
 
00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
law or anything in place that entitles
 
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
parents at once they become involved
 
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
with dcyf that entitles them to be
 
00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
provided with a list of recommended
 
00:39:59.270 --> 00:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys they don't get a list of
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
recommended attorneys but they get
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
appointed an attorney immediately by the
 
00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.650 align:start position:0%
appointed an attorney immediately by the
court

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:03.660 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
so they at their first hearing will have
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
somebody there that is there for them to
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
work them through the process
 
00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.510 align:start position:0%
 
great

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
um a couple other things that I would
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
just you know again put forward as ideas
 
00:40:23.569 --> 00:40:23.579 align:start position:0%
for future work in this space
 
00:40:25.490 --> 00:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
um you do see in other jurisdictions you
 
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
know parent attorneys having other types
 
00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
of supports then then we are able to
 
00:40:31.010 --> 00:40:31.020 align:start position:0%
offer them here and specifically what
 
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about is access to a social
 
00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
worker who works directly with the
 
00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
parent attorney and the parents and the
 
00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
reason why that's valuable is right
 
00:40:42.349 --> 00:40:42.359 align:start position:0%
oftentimes when dcyf is first involved
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
with the family there's going to be an
 
00:40:45.050 --> 00:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
awful lot of distrust between the agency
 
00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
and the parents right and we're we're in
 
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
an adversarial process a court process
 
00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
as much as in these instances it's
 
00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
interesting because our goals are often
 
00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:54.180 align:start position:0%
aligned the goals of both parties are
 
00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
typically to try to help heal the family
 
00:40:59.450 --> 00:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
and reunify the family but
 
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
um nevertheless it is an adversarial
 
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:03.300 align:start position:0%
process and it is a process for which
 
00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:05.220 align:start position:0%
you know it wouldn't shouldn't be a
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
surprise that a parent Who's involved in
 
00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
that would be distrustful of the agency
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
at that time so the purpose in other
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions of having a social worker
 
00:41:15.410 --> 00:41:15.420 align:start position:0%
work alongside of a parent's attorney is
 
00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
to one give that parent somebody else to
 
00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
talk to who can help kind of direct that
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
parent towards the right types of
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
supports and services and hope maybe
 
00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:24.180 align:start position:0%
that person will be somebody the parents
 
00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
a little more ready and willing to work
 
00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
with than our own staff in those moments
 
00:41:29.569 --> 00:41:29.579 align:start position:0%
where those tensions are high and
 
00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
moreover to be able to have a closer
 
00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:33.300 align:start position:0%
relationship with that parent that
 
00:41:34.670 --> 00:41:34.680 align:start position:0%
they're representing one of the
 
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:36.420 align:start position:0%
challenges that you see is that you know
 
00:41:38.390 --> 00:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
frankly attorney time is is expensive
 
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
and attorney time is is infrequent right
 
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
there's just not enough of it and that
 
00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:45.060 align:start position:0%
was even true in the state that I last
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
worked in in New Jersey where we
 
00:41:47.990 --> 00:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
actually did have a dedicated unit to
 
00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.190 align:start position:0%
actually did have a dedicated unit to
this

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
um even there it was hard for attorneys
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
to spend the amount of time with parents
 
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
to be able to develop that type of
 
00:41:56.210 --> 00:41:56.220 align:start position:0%
trusting relationship and deep
 
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
understanding of what was happening
 
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
there that would be most beneficial to
 
00:42:00.349 --> 00:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
help that parent move forward and
 
00:42:01.609 --> 00:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
ultimately be successful in
 
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
reunification so the idea of injecting a
 
00:42:06.290 --> 00:42:06.300 align:start position:0%
social worker into that process somebody
 
00:42:07.910 --> 00:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
who's got you know maybe a different
 
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
skill set in terms of Engagement with
 
00:42:11.329 --> 00:42:11.339 align:start position:0%
the parents a different skill set in
 
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
terms of connecting those parents to
 
00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:14.400 align:start position:0%
resources and working alongside the
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
agency and connecting those parents to
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
resources and in general being able to
 
00:42:21.170 --> 00:42:21.180 align:start position:0%
kind of speed up the hopefully the
 
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
timeline to reunification by getting
 
00:42:24.410 --> 00:42:24.420 align:start position:0%
those parents the supports and services
 
00:42:26.569 --> 00:42:26.579 align:start position:0%
that they need so did you have this in
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
New Jersey a dedicated social worker we
 
00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
only had a handful it was a pilot
 
00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
program at the time in New Jersey
 
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
there's other jurisdictions that use it
 
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
more broadly though
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
um and who would employ uh these social
 
00:42:43.370 --> 00:42:43.380 align:start position:0%
work and that's where I think it gets
 
00:42:44.930 --> 00:42:44.940 align:start position:0%
really complicated in New Hampshire with
 
00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
our current structure right where you
 
00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:48.540 align:start position:0%
have basically individual attorneys out
 
00:42:49.849 --> 00:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
there doing this work that are being
 
00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:52.140 align:start position:0%
compensated on an hourly basis
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
um so I think that's something that
 
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
would have to be thought through you
 
00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:55.740 align:start position:0%
know potentially with the judicial
 
00:42:56.810 --> 00:42:56.820 align:start position:0%
Council I don't think it would be
 
00:42:58.730 --> 00:42:58.740 align:start position:0%
appropriate for dcyf to be that entity
 
00:43:00.589 --> 00:43:00.599 align:start position:0%
because you know we're in an adversarial
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
court process and if they're our
 
00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
attorney or our social workers you're
 
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
not going to solve that kind of distrust
 
00:43:07.849 --> 00:43:07.859 align:start position:0%
process that I'm talking about so I
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
think you'd have to look to some other
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
entity you know potentially judicial
 
00:43:13.490 --> 00:43:13.500 align:start position:0%
counselor potentially you know some some
 
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:15.180 align:start position:0%
grouping of parents attorneys who'd be
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
willing to come together to support that
 
00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:23.510 --> 00:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
you may continue great
 
00:43:25.069 --> 00:43:25.079 align:start position:0%
um the last big thing that I did want to
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
talk about was the idea of family
 
00:43:28.069 --> 00:43:28.079 align:start position:0%
treatment Court
 
00:43:28.079 --> 00:43:28.609 align:start position:0%
treatment Court
um

00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
which uh is something that we've piloted
 
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
here in Sullivan County the courts
 
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
actually led the charge on that with
 
00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:36.420 align:start position:0%
with us and many other stakeholders at
 
00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
the table with Federal grant dollars and
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
this is essentially for folks who are
 
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
familiar to kind of the drug court model
 
00:43:42.839 --> 00:43:44.210 align:start position:0%
familiar to kind of the drug court model
for

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
um for uh adult criminal cases this is
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
kind of the the analog to that for child
 
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
protection cases and what you see in
 
00:43:54.589 --> 00:43:54.599 align:start position:0%
these processes are
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
folks coming together more frequently
 
00:43:58.670 --> 00:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
very very frequent Court hearings you
 
00:44:01.309 --> 00:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
know oftentimes every two weeks of
 
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:03.240 align:start position:0%
course to support something like that
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
you need a lot more judge time and
 
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
attorney time and staff time and that's
 
00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
really the the drain on on resources to
 
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
put forward something like a family
 
00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:12.060 align:start position:0%
treatment court but you see really good
 
00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
outcomes in terms of being able to get
 
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
those families who are struggling with
 
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
substance use and that being their
 
00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:17.700 align:start position:0%
primary reason for not being able to
 
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
have their children to have them be
 
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:22.140 align:start position:0%
engaged in Services quickly have them
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
being kind of very regularly seen and
 
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
you know supported through the court
 
00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
process and having all the stakeholders
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
who are part of this process that is
 
00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
right the Child Protection Agency the
 
00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
Casas the attorneys for the children
 
00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
attorneys for parents
 
00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:39.170 align:start position:0%
attorneys for parents
um

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
um all those folks kind of part of this
 
00:44:43.370 --> 00:44:43.380 align:start position:0%
process on a regular basis with kind of
 
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
a Judicial oversight moving that through
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
it also creates kind of a forum locally
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
for folks to to Think Through how does
 
00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:52.020 align:start position:0%
the treatment process work for parents
 
00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
who are involved in the child protection
 
00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
system and some space for local advocacy
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
around prioritizing access for parents
 
00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
in these cases right because there's
 
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
obviously scarcity of resources
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
everywhere and at least in my own view
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
you know of all the people who need
 
00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:09.480 align:start position:0%
resources and access to treatment
 
00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
services folks who you know have young
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
children that they're responsible for
 
00:45:14.930 --> 00:45:14.940 align:start position:0%
are are pretty high up on that list in
 
00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:16.920 align:start position:0%
my view how long has this been going in
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County Sullivan County I think
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
the pilot started a couple years ago but
 
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
they actually just started taking it was
 
00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:23.220 align:start position:0%
like a year of planning so they started
 
00:45:25.309 --> 00:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
taking cases about a year ago there are
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
currently some conversations happening
 
00:45:28.609 --> 00:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
about how to implement some of the best
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
practices from that in other courts but
 
00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
there's not the resources in place to
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
actually duplicate a full-fledged family
 
00:45:36.829 --> 00:45:36.839 align:start position:0%
treatment Court in other places have
 
00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:39.540 align:start position:0%
they issued a preliminary report yet I
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
don't know that there's anything in
 
00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.930 align:start position:0%
don't know that there's anything in
writing

00:45:41.930 --> 00:45:41.940 align:start position:0%
writing
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
I haven't seen anything in writing yet
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
but they're still in the trying it out
 
00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
and sharing stage okay that'll be
 
00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:49.980 align:start position:0%
fascinating to look at representative
 
00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:51.470 align:start position:0%
fascinating to look at representative
Smith

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
00:45:53.870 --> 00:45:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have any idea about
 
00:45:57.349 --> 00:45:57.359 align:start position:0%
what percentage of
 
00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
the child protection cases
 
00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.910 align:start position:0%
the child protection cases
um

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:05.030 --> 00:46:05.040 align:start position:0%
have the problem centered around drug
 
00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
use so if you're asking that question
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of what's coming in
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
to cause that intake that number is
 
00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:13.380 align:start position:0%
actually smaller than people would think
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
but if you're asking that question from
 
00:46:16.069 --> 00:46:16.079 align:start position:0%
the perspective of what goes to court
 
00:46:18.650 --> 00:46:18.660 align:start position:0%
it's the majority of a substance use
 
00:46:20.829 --> 00:46:20.839 align:start position:0%
involvement that go to court
 
00:46:23.329 --> 00:46:23.339 align:start position:0%
so when I talked earlier about kind of
 
00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
what we're seeing is this increased kind
 
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
of Acuity or complexity those cases
 
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
almost always involve substances and I
 
00:46:31.309 --> 00:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
think if this I don't have an exact
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
number but it is probably the majority
 
00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:35.700 align:start position:0%
of cases that go to court that have a
 
00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
substance use dynamic thank you
 
00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
um with respect to uh if
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
whether it's
 
00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:55.680 align:start position:0%
a child in your system with parents and
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
you're working on reunification
 
00:46:59.450 --> 00:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
um is there
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
an opportunity if there's been a civil
 
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
action or a criminal action against one
 
00:47:09.050 --> 00:47:09.060 align:start position:0%
of the parents do you get those reports
 
00:47:11.630 --> 00:47:11.640 align:start position:0%
and do you use those in your
 
00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:13.069 align:start position:0%
and do you use those in your
determination

00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
determination
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
uh dude I get the questions yeah yeah
 
00:47:20.089 --> 00:47:20.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.190 --> 00:47:22.200 align:start position:0%
I believe I'm understanding your
 
00:47:24.410 --> 00:47:24.420 align:start position:0%
question so if there's a criminal action
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
or another civil action like a marital
 
00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
proceeding or a guardianship proceeding
 
00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:31.859 align:start position:0%
um it depends a little bit criminal
 
00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
cases we work jointly with law
 
00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement so we often get access to
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
those records we can certainly reach out
 
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
to the court on non-confidential matters
 
00:47:43.010 --> 00:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
to get access to the cases there have
 
00:47:45.170 --> 00:47:45.180 align:start position:0%
been times where we are not allowed
 
00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
access to guardianship cases because
 
00:47:50.089 --> 00:47:50.099 align:start position:0%
they're confidential and so we then need
 
00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:51.599 align:start position:0%
to file a motion to intervene in those
 
00:47:53.569 --> 00:47:53.579 align:start position:0%
cases and typically the courts will let
 
00:47:55.609 --> 00:47:55.619 align:start position:0%
us get the information we need to keep
 
00:47:57.130 --> 00:47:57.140 align:start position:0%
Kids Safe
 
00:48:00.770 --> 00:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah just to um so you are
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
able to access you just
 
00:48:05.630 --> 00:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
you just correct yeah so the court has
 
00:48:07.430 --> 00:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
the court call center
 
00:48:09.230 --> 00:48:09.240 align:start position:0%
um and thankfully the administrative
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
office of the courts worked with me
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
years ago to come up with a forum that
 
00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:15.660 align:start position:0%
we can use that we can submit by email
 
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
to the court and somebody somewhere in
 
00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:19.800 align:start position:0%
the court system I'm not sure exactly
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
who responds to us with the information
 
00:48:23.930 --> 00:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
that we need
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:31.140 align:start position:0%

00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:41.940 align:start position:0%

good morning everyone nice to see some
 
00:49:19.309 --> 00:49:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:21.349 --> 00:49:21.359 align:start position:0%

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Ned Gordon and
 
00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:33.240 align:start position:0%
I am a member of the Guardian that light
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
on board I am a public member appointed
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
by the governor
 
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
uh to serve in that capacity
 
00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:42.140 align:start position:0%
and have been for some time
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
and I guess you'd if you'd like me to
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
start with a statement I'll do that okay
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:49:53.089 --> 00:49:53.099 align:start position:0%
I'm familiar with Guardian the litems uh
 
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
in three different capacities one is an
 
00:49:58.309 --> 00:49:58.319 align:start position:0%
attorney uh who practiced and did some
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
family law
 
00:50:03.490 --> 00:50:03.500 align:start position:0%
as a judge in which um I actually
 
00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:06.180 align:start position:0%
appointed guardian of items in certain
 
00:50:06.180 --> 00:50:07.730 align:start position:0%
appointed guardian of items in certain
circumstances

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:07.740 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:50:10.309 --> 00:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
and as a senator
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
as a senator I actually sponsored the
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
legislation that created the guardian
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
that laid on board
 
00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
back in the 1990s
 
00:50:21.530 --> 00:50:21.540 align:start position:0%
prior to that
 
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
the guardian ad litems were appointed by
 
00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:28.400 align:start position:0%
the court and there was and there was
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
authorization by Court rule to appoint a
 
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
guardian items guardian of items isn't
 
00:50:34.190 --> 00:50:34.200 align:start position:0%
something that was created by New
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or is unique to New Hampshire
 
00:50:37.609 --> 00:50:37.619 align:start position:0%
virtually every jurisdiction in the
 
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
country uses Guardian ad litems
 
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
but in our particular case up until the
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%
1990s they were controlled pretty
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
exclusively by the court
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
and there were no real standards for
 
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
Guardian medal items that were
 
00:50:56.210 --> 00:50:56.220 align:start position:0%
established at the time there were no
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
rules or standards for Guardian metal
 
00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
items for their practice and there was
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
no system of discipline other than what
 
00:51:12.470 --> 00:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
judges might impose and so there were
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
numbers of complaints at the time with
 
00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:15.960 align:start position:0%
regard to Guardian of items and that's
 
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
what precipitated legislation back in
 
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
the 1990s to create a guardian that
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
light on board
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
regarding and to take that
 
00:51:26.569 --> 00:51:26.579 align:start position:0%
responsibility for supervision from
 
00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
Guardian lightens away from the courts
 
00:51:30.650 --> 00:51:30.660 align:start position:0%
and actually put it into administrative
 
00:51:33.170 --> 00:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
Services the guardian of item board fell
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
under administrative services
 
00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
and the guardian that lied on board put
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
in place rules
 
00:51:42.109 --> 00:51:42.119 align:start position:0%
established standards provided training
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
for Guardian nettle items
 
00:51:51.609 --> 00:51:51.619 align:start position:0%
and they uh and and basically
 
00:51:55.069 --> 00:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
professionalized guardian of items more
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
so than they were previously
 
00:51:59.690 --> 00:51:59.700 align:start position:0%
prior to that
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
basically a judge could pick whoever
 
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
they wanted as a guardian that lied him
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
and in back in those days pick primarily
 
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
attorneys because that's who judges knew
 
00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
as attorneys but
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
under the guardian of the item board you
 
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have to be an attorney
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
to be a guardian I'd like them and I
 
00:52:20.329 --> 00:52:20.339 align:start position:0%
have to say that many of the finest
 
00:52:21.890 --> 00:52:21.900 align:start position:0%
Guardian lawyers I worked with weren't
 
00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:23.030 align:start position:0%
Guardian lawyers I worked with weren't
attorneys

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
because basically a guardian that laid
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
him in many cases the best guardian of
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
the Lambs are ones that have good common
 
00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
sense and that's not something
 
00:52:34.609 --> 00:52:34.619 align:start position:0%
necessarily you can teach
 
00:52:37.089 --> 00:52:37.099 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:39.900 align:start position:0%
the guardian of items the role that they
 
00:52:41.870 --> 00:52:41.880 align:start position:0%
play in the state they play a really a
 
00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:43.800 align:start position:0%
critical role in our state as they do in
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
other states there are certain
 
00:52:46.970 --> 00:52:46.980 align:start position:0%
circumstances where Guardian that items
 
00:52:49.609 --> 00:52:49.619 align:start position:0%
are mandated so just as you've heard in
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
the dcyf cases abuse and neglect cases
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
there's mandatory appointment and
 
00:52:58.089 --> 00:52:58.099 align:start position:0%
guardian that'll items we have casa
 
00:53:02.809 --> 00:53:02.819 align:start position:0%
who provides in a majority of the cases
 
00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
across the state guarding that items and
 
00:53:07.609 --> 00:53:07.619 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect cases if they're unable to
 
00:53:10.730 --> 00:53:10.740 align:start position:0%
supply a casa guarding that light them
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
in an abuse neglect case then the court
 
00:53:16.849 --> 00:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
will appoint a private Guardian Ad Litem
 
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:19.260 align:start position:0%
one who will agree to serve in that
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
capacity we appoint guardian of items
 
00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:23.660 align:start position:0%
and termination of parental rights cases
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
mandatory appointment
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
in divorce cases it is not mandatory
 
00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:31.010 align:start position:0%
in divorce cases it is not mandatory
appointment

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
appointment
 
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
and up until uh we had our financial
 
00:53:40.069 --> 00:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
crisis in 2008
 
00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:44.579 align:start position:0%
we used to the state used to pay for
 
00:53:48.049 --> 00:53:48.059 align:start position:0%
Guardian ad litems in parenting cases in
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
divorce cases and parenting cases
 
00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:53.579 align:start position:0%
and it uh
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
and that was uh and and and and and
 
00:53:58.849 --> 00:53:58.859 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:54:02.089 --> 00:54:02.099 align:start position:0%
very helpful and
 
00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:05.940 align:start position:0%
needed in many cases but in 2008 it was
 
00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:07.500 align:start position:0%
decided that the state could no longer
 
00:54:10.609 --> 00:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.530 --> 00:54:12.540 align:start position:0%
I have to say you know from my own
 
00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
experience having been a judge at the
 
00:54:17.089 --> 00:54:17.099 align:start position:0%
time that probably we were appointing
 
00:54:19.309 --> 00:54:19.319 align:start position:0%
too many Guardian adult items
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
um at the time because in cases maybe
 
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%
where it just wasn't necessary because
 
00:54:27.470 --> 00:54:27.480 align:start position:0%
it was convenient to do that and the
 
00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
state was paying for it
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
but now I can say that there are
 
00:54:35.210 --> 00:54:35.220 align:start position:0%
certainly many marital cases where a
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem is needed and one
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't get appointed because there is
 
00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:42.420 align:start position:0%
no means of paying for it
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
so right now we're a pointing guardian
 
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
of items when you can in marital cases
 
00:54:49.849 --> 00:54:49.859 align:start position:0%
where you can find a means of paying for
 
00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:51.540 align:start position:0%
the guardian that light them either
 
00:54:54.049 --> 00:54:54.059 align:start position:0%
usually one or both of the parties to
 
00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
pay for those Guardians that light them
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
and why do you need a guardian Adel item
 
00:55:00.770 --> 00:55:00.780 align:start position:0%
you know I can tell you these
 
00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:02.460 align:start position:0%
circumstances having sat there on the
 
00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:04.069 align:start position:0%
circumstances having sat there on the
bench

00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
bench
 
00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
where uh one spouse is there saying I
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
need to have Primary Residential
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility for Johnny because
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
my ex over here he's got a new
 
00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:20.940 align:start position:0%
girlfriend they do drugs they're stoned
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
every night they're selling drugs
 
00:55:23.809 --> 00:55:23.819 align:start position:0%
there's people in and out of the house
 
00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
every day
 
00:55:27.710 --> 00:55:27.720 align:start position:0%
all the times of the day all times of
 
00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:28.680 align:start position:0%
the night
 
00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:32.940 align:start position:0%
we need to do something and and he's
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
only you know they're only sending the
 
00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:36.720 align:start position:0%
school half the time
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
and so I need to have Primary
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
Residential responsibility
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
and then I say well geez you know what
 
00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:46.740 align:start position:0%
do you say and the guy says well GC you
 
00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:48.300 align:start position:0%
can't believe she's just saying that
 
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
because she's
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
getting benefits for having him in the
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
house that's not true at all and let me
 
00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
tell you about their house she's got a
 
00:55:58.370 --> 00:55:58.380 align:start position:0%
new boyfriend with a criminal record as
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
long as your arm he's beating her up
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
every night there's domestic violence in
 
00:56:04.030 --> 00:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
and the teacher tells me that Johnny
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
When Johnny Comes to school he wears the
 
00:56:13.010 --> 00:56:13.020 align:start position:0%
same clothes every day he's dirty
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
and so you're there sitting as a judge
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
and you say well geez you know who do I
 
00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:18.720 align:start position:0%
believe what do I do well it would be
 
00:56:20.089 --> 00:56:20.099 align:start position:0%
really nice to have a guardian that
 
00:56:23.510 --> 00:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
light him somebody who could go out
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
talk to the teachers find out what's
 
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
going on talk to somebody in the
 
00:56:30.650 --> 00:56:30.660 align:start position:0%
community that understands talk to both
 
00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
of the parents talk to Johnny and get a
 
00:56:36.530 --> 00:56:36.540 align:start position:0%
sense of what's going on to help me make
 
00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:39.000 align:start position:0%
a a good decision for what's in Johnny's
 
00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
best interest
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
and that's what a guardian ad litem does
 
00:56:46.430 --> 00:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
works in the child's best interest
 
00:56:49.430 --> 00:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
guardian of the items are basically fact
 
00:56:50.870 --> 00:56:50.880 align:start position:0%
finders but generally make
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
recommendations with regard to what may
 
00:56:54.849 --> 00:56:54.859 align:start position:0%
be in a child's
 
00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:56.880 align:start position:0%
best interest
 
00:56:59.329 --> 00:56:59.339 align:start position:0%
the court has made it clear that when a
 
00:57:01.809 --> 00:57:01.819 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem makes a recommendation
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
or makes findings of facts those
 
00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:08.700 align:start position:0%
findings of facts are evidence just like
 
00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
any other evidence you hear
 
00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:19.370 --> 00:57:19.380 align:start position:0%
hears from a guardian that lightened
 
00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:21.780 align:start position:0%
they consider that to be evidence it's
 
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
not a
 
00:57:28.089 --> 00:57:28.099 align:start position:0%
it's not uh it's get not given
 
00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
favorable treatment you measure the
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
credibility of a guardian litem like you
 
00:57:35.329 --> 00:57:35.339 align:start position:0%
would the parties themselves
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
you hear what they have to say
 
00:57:40.370 --> 00:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
you take it into consideration but again
 
00:57:43.450 --> 00:57:43.460 align:start position:0%
it's just evidence and I can tell you
 
00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
historically there have been times when
 
00:57:46.490 --> 00:57:46.500 align:start position:0%
guardian of the volumes have made
 
00:57:48.829 --> 00:57:48.839 align:start position:0%
recommendations I certainly have found
 
00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:51.960 align:start position:0%
the other way because I didn't think
 
00:57:54.170 --> 00:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
that was the right thing to do let me
 
00:57:56.990 --> 00:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
interrupt to say the uh breadth of
 
00:57:59.390 --> 00:57:59.400 align:start position:0%
latitude of judges in family court is
 
00:58:01.130 --> 00:58:01.140 align:start position:0%
one of the major issues before us so
 
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
thank you for addressing that and that's
 
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:05.579 align:start position:0%
helpful yeah
 
00:58:05.579 --> 00:58:06.650 align:start position:0%
helpful yeah
um

00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:08.089 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:58:08.089 --> 00:58:08.099 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:08.099 --> 00:58:09.829 align:start position:0%
the
the

00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:58:11.630 --> 00:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
guardian of items in terms of the
 
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
Guardian the light on board uh we act on
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
complaints that come in to the guardian
 
00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:20.339 align:start position:0%
that light on board
 
00:58:20.339 --> 00:58:21.230 align:start position:0%
that light on board
um

00:58:21.230 --> 00:58:21.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
one of the things I think has happened
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
since we've had the guardian ad litem
 
00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:26.870 align:start position:0%
since we've had the guardian ad litem
board

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
board
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
is that we have a more professional
 
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:34.980 align:start position:0%
group of people because basically they
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
have to go through a training process
 
00:58:40.010 --> 00:58:40.020 align:start position:0%
they understand that there are standards
 
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
that they have to follow
 
00:58:44.270 --> 00:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
and if they don't follow those standards
 
00:58:48.170 --> 00:58:48.180 align:start position:0%
they're subject to discipline and we do
 
00:58:50.809 --> 00:58:50.819 align:start position:0%
when it's appropriate impose discipline
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
on guarding that items
 
00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:56.220 align:start position:0%
at different levels I mean the worst
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
being the fact that they would no longer
 
00:59:01.250 --> 00:59:01.260 align:start position:0%
be able to serve in that capacity in
 
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:02.640 align:start position:0%
those circumstances
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
we do not get involved just like you're
 
00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
in circumstances where you don't want to
 
00:59:09.950 --> 00:59:09.960 align:start position:0%
be involved in the middle of cases uh
 
00:59:11.210 --> 00:59:11.220 align:start position:0%
the guardian of the light and board
 
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
cannot get involved in the middle of a
 
00:59:16.010 --> 00:59:16.020 align:start position:0%
case so if you just don't like what the
 
00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:17.400 align:start position:0%
guardian Enlightenment is saying or
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
doing we're not going to get involved
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
with that the case has to be complete in
 
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
order for the guardian ad litem board to
 
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
get involved and to make a determination
 
00:59:28.609 --> 00:59:28.619 align:start position:0%
as to whether a guardian ad litem acted
 
00:59:28.619 --> 00:59:31.430 align:start position:0%
as to whether a guardian ad litem acted
properly

00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
properly
 
00:59:36.289 --> 00:59:36.299 align:start position:0%
the guardian Adel items we have many
 
00:59:38.809 --> 00:59:38.819 align:start position:0%
across the state we probably could use a
 
00:59:40.569 --> 00:59:40.579 align:start position:0%
lot more
 
00:59:44.809 --> 00:59:44.819 align:start position:0%
uh that we used to have a lot more back
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
when it was
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
um when there were a lot more cases when
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
back in prior to 2008 when we had
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
uh when the system allowed for
 
00:59:59.329 --> 00:59:59.339 align:start position:0%
appointment and the state was funding
 
01:00:01.870 --> 01:00:01.880 align:start position:0%
guarding that items there was a lot more
 
01:00:05.809 --> 01:00:05.819 align:start position:0%
uh activity wood Guardian little items
 
01:00:08.030 --> 01:00:08.040 align:start position:0%
judges in terms of discretion if you're
 
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
talking about discretion of Judges
 
01:00:13.190 --> 01:00:13.200 align:start position:0%
judges they were two circumstances
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
particularly in marital cases
 
01:00:18.130 --> 01:00:18.140 align:start position:0%
where you
 
01:00:20.930 --> 01:00:20.940 align:start position:0%
have guardian of items one is the
 
01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:22.849 align:start position:0%
have guardian of items one is the
parties

01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
parties
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
what you find is that people with
 
01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:26.650 align:start position:0%
what you find is that people with
attorneys

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:26.660 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
particularly experienced and capable
 
01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:30.950 align:start position:0%
particularly experienced and capable
attorneys

01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
attorneys
 
01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:33.420 align:start position:0%
will pick their own Guardian at items
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
because they know who is good and who
 
01:00:38.809 --> 01:00:38.819 align:start position:0%
will do a great job for them or what
 
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:40.980 align:start position:0%
Guardian Ad Litem skills fit their
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
particular case
 
01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:46.260 align:start position:0%
so in those circumstances
 
01:00:48.589 --> 01:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
the guardian let him get picked that way
 
01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
in other cases where people don't have
 
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
the experience don't know the guardian
 
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:55.980 align:start position:0%
of the items they rely on the court to
 
01:00:58.069 --> 01:00:58.079 align:start position:0%
pick the guardian and light them when
 
01:01:00.049 --> 01:01:00.059 align:start position:0%
the court judge picks a guardian that
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
light and they're going to do their best
 
01:01:04.370 --> 01:01:04.380 align:start position:0%
to try to pick someone that would be
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the circumstances
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
so if
 
01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:13.140 align:start position:0%
if the case was a case where one parent
 
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
wants to move out of state
 
01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
and the question is where is Johnny
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%
going to live is Johnny going to live in
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire or is Johnny going to move
 
01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:28.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.309 --> 01:01:31.319 align:start position:0%
and you know what's in the child's best
 
01:01:31.319 --> 01:01:32.990 align:start position:0%
and you know what's in the child's best
interest

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
well you're going to pick a guardian to
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
light him and you'd want a Guardian Ad
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
Litem that might would have the skill to
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
make that type of determination whereas
 
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
if you had
 
01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
you know a very contentious you had a
 
01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:50.220 align:start position:0%
very contentious case with people
 
01:01:52.849 --> 01:01:52.859 align:start position:0%
fighting and the issues like indicated
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
early with drugs on one side and
 
01:01:56.569 --> 01:01:56.579 align:start position:0%
domestic abuse on the other you might
 
01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
want guarding that item with skills to
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
handle those types of cases and you get
 
01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
get to learn the skills of guarding as a
 
01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
judge you learn the skills of a guardian
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
the guardian ad litems over time some
 
01:02:13.069 --> 01:02:13.079 align:start position:0%
are much more capable of dealing with
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
certain types of cases than others some
 
01:02:18.849 --> 01:02:18.859 align:start position:0%
as I said you can't teach common sense
 
01:02:23.089 --> 01:02:23.099 align:start position:0%
that's something that you pick up from
 
01:02:25.609 --> 01:02:25.619 align:start position:0%
the guardian items a lot of people
 
01:02:27.530 --> 01:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
qualify as guardian the Lions judges
 
01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
have a tendency to use some of the same
 
01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:31.140 align:start position:0%
Guardian the litems over and over and
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
over again because they trust them you
 
01:02:36.049 --> 01:02:36.059 align:start position:0%
know and and it's the same as appointing
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
attorneys for cases and because you know
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
who's competent and you can trust them
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
to do a good job so you tend to appoint
 
01:02:48.829 --> 01:02:48.839 align:start position:0%
people over and over again
 
01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:52.740 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of the biggest concern I
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
have with regard to the guardian ad
 
01:02:58.730 --> 01:02:58.740 align:start position:0%
litem board right now is the proposed
 
01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:01.140 align:start position:0%
chain what what happened regard with
 
01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:02.460 align:start position:0%
regarding the lighting board it was
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
taken out of administrative services and
 
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:12.299 align:start position:0%
in in The Proposal in House Bill 2 there
 
01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:15.020 align:start position:0%
was a proposal to take away
 
01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:18.839 align:start position:0%
the seven-member board that's been
 
01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
working I think pretty efficiently and
 
01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
make it a three-member Advisory Board
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
this was uh and that was taken out of
 
01:03:31.609 --> 01:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
house bill to
 
01:03:34.430 --> 01:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
was not put it in the Senate but I
 
01:03:36.049 --> 01:03:36.059 align:start position:0%
understand that it's an effort perhaps
 
01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:39.780 align:start position:0%
an effort uh politically to get it into
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
another bill in the Senate and that
 
01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
concerns me because I think that will
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
deteriorate the way and which we've
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
managed guardian of items and the
 
01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
quality that we have
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
um and basically one of the three
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
members would be an appointment from the
 
01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:01.140 align:start position:0%
court which uh may put us back where we
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
were to begin with and I don't really
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.410 --> 01:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
and I think that's
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
what I can offer today
 
01:04:15.289 --> 01:04:15.299 align:start position:0%
is there a differentiation in the
 
01:04:19.609 --> 01:04:19.619 align:start position:0%
percentage of jils that the court would
 
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
wish to appoint
 
01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:24.599 align:start position:0%
if one or both parties are per se versus
 
01:04:24.599 --> 01:04:26.030 align:start position:0%
if one or both parties are per se versus
if

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:04:30.589 --> 01:04:30.599 align:start position:0%
to both parties have retained Council
 
01:04:30.599 --> 01:04:32.289 align:start position:0%
to both parties have retained Council
uh

01:04:32.289 --> 01:04:32.299 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
no uh there would not there wouldn't be
 
01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
any difference I think we'd look at the
 
01:04:38.569 --> 01:04:38.579 align:start position:0%
type of case and the issues in the case
 
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
to make that determination now
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
I have to say that a different Guardian
 
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
that items have different rates and so
 
01:04:52.849 --> 01:04:52.859 align:start position:0%
you know high-end cases May hire a
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
guardian that'll item which may who
 
01:04:58.130 --> 01:04:58.140 align:start position:0%
would charge more for their services
 
01:05:00.289 --> 01:05:00.299 align:start position:0%
at a different rate
 
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:02.520 align:start position:0%
but in terms of the Court appointing
 
01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:04.619 align:start position:0%
Guardian enlightens it would not make a
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
difference to the judge
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
with regard to the type or quality of
 
01:05:09.359 --> 01:05:10.010 align:start position:0%
with regard to the type or quality of
the

01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:05:14.089 --> 01:05:14.099 align:start position:0%
guardian of item do any gals serve pro
 
01:05:14.099 --> 01:05:19.849 align:start position:0%
guardian of item do any gals serve pro
bono

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:19.859 --> 01:05:21.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:23.839 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware of
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
that it could be that they are but I'm
 
01:05:32.750 --> 01:05:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:35.450 --> 01:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Greg thank you
 
01:05:36.890 --> 01:05:36.900 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I actually have two
 
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
questions so get ready I'm gonna do
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up I just had two oh okay all
 
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
right I didn't know if we were allowed
 
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:44.700 align:start position:0%
that thank you so much for being here
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
today and for taking our questions
 
01:05:48.049 --> 01:05:48.059 align:start position:0%
um I had a couple questions the first
 
01:05:49.849 --> 01:05:49.859 align:start position:0%
one now in other states I know they have
 
01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
a different program but kind of similar
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
it's called parental rights evaluators
 
01:05:56.890 --> 01:05:56.900 align:start position:0%
so pre which is is pretty pretty similar
 
01:06:00.349 --> 01:06:00.359 align:start position:0%
one big difference though that I see I
 
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
now do the the gals do they have any do
 
01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:04.980 align:start position:0%
they do any kind of testing like
 
01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
personality testing when they do this
 
01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
psychological testing anything like that
 
01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
that gets submitted as evidence like for
 
01:06:13.730 --> 01:06:13.740 align:start position:0%
both parents
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
do they do uh
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
if I understand your question
 
01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
you're asking whether or not the
 
01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:25.640 align:start position:0%
guardian Adel items
 
01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh suggest that there be that type of
 
01:06:30.410 --> 01:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
testing if they if they I don't know
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
what they're like in in other states
 
01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
parental rights evaluators they usually
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
have some kind of like a psychology
 
01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
degree a Psychiatry degree because that
 
01:06:40.010 --> 01:06:40.020 align:start position:0%
way they can evaluate not just what the
 
01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
parent is telling them but what an
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
actual like personality test would show
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
if there are signs of you know sociopath
 
01:06:48.289 --> 01:06:48.299 align:start position:0%
or anything like that do we have
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
anything like that within the gal system
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
no there there's no uh
 
01:06:56.510 --> 01:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:06:59.390 --> 01:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement that the guardian
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
ad litems have those types of skills
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay okay okay
 
01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
they potentially could have those types
 
01:07:08.029 --> 01:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
of skills
 
01:07:10.190 --> 01:07:10.200 align:start position:0%
but there's no requirement that they
 
01:07:11.930 --> 01:07:11.940 align:start position:0%
have those types of skills and there
 
01:07:13.789 --> 01:07:13.799 align:start position:0%
were other states where
 
01:07:18.049 --> 01:07:18.059 align:start position:0%
uh they have uh like your uh parental
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
evaluates uh they there are other states
 
01:07:22.670 --> 01:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
with Guardian ad litems which have
 
01:07:26.270 --> 01:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
specific and uh agencies for Guardian
 
01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
Naval items as opposed to our system in
 
01:07:31.450 --> 01:07:31.460 align:start position:0%
this state where
 
01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:33.549 align:start position:0%
this state where
we

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:33.559 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:35.579 align:start position:0%
typically with this the typical
 
01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:37.980 align:start position:0%
informality of New Hampshire we have
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
Guardian items coming out of the
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
population but other states have a
 
01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
dedicated group of Guardian Adela items
 
01:07:46.549 --> 01:07:46.559 align:start position:0%
usually attorneys to serve as guardian
 
01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:49.079 align:start position:0%
of items sure okay thank you for that
 
01:07:51.230 --> 01:07:51.240 align:start position:0%
and then my second question so I know
 
01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:52.980 align:start position:0%
that specifically when you're working in
 
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:54.780 align:start position:0%
cases whether it be social work you know
 
01:07:56.750 --> 01:07:56.760 align:start position:0%
Victim Advocacy or whatever when you see
 
01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
a mass amount of cases eventually
 
01:08:00.890 --> 01:08:00.900 align:start position:0%
there's a part of you it's almost
 
01:08:03.770 --> 01:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
impossible not to become jaded or not to
 
01:08:05.329 --> 01:08:05.339 align:start position:0%
say oh I think I know what's going on
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
here because I've seen 100 cases is
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
there ongoing education for the Jal so
 
01:08:12.529 --> 01:08:12.539 align:start position:0%
that to kind of help them work through
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
that to get rid of those biases and
 
01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.230 align:start position:0%
that to get rid of those biases and
stuff

01:08:15.230 --> 01:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.370 align:start position:0%
stuff
yeah

01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:08:19.849 --> 01:08:19.859 align:start position:0%
um there there's first of all is ongoing
 
01:08:22.669 --> 01:08:22.679 align:start position:0%
educational requirements for for the
 
01:08:24.849 --> 01:08:24.859 align:start position:0%
guardian of items
 
01:08:28.150 --> 01:08:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh though
 
01:08:30.289 --> 01:08:30.299 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a very interesting
 
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
question because uh the one thing
 
01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.050 align:start position:0%
question because uh the one thing
uh

01:08:36.050 --> 01:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:38.990 --> 01:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
is uh and I likeness to judges because
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh you know judges they they put these
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
black robes on us as judges and I think
 
01:08:49.669 --> 01:08:49.679 align:start position:0%
to make us look smart and and infallible
 
01:08:51.349 --> 01:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
but judges are just as human as
 
01:08:53.809 --> 01:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
everybody else and they screw up and
 
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
make mistakes at times
 
01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:57.530 align:start position:0%
make mistakes at times
and

01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:00.410 --> 01:09:00.420 align:start position:0%
the same thing with Guardian items
 
01:09:01.809 --> 01:09:01.819 align:start position:0%
they're human
 
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
and so I think that they're subject to
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
all the
 
01:09:10.249 --> 01:09:10.259 align:start position:0%
human predispositions and and concerns
 
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
that everybody else is
 
01:09:17.329 --> 01:09:17.339 align:start position:0%
and so I think uh what happens is if I'm
 
01:09:21.289 --> 01:09:21.299 align:start position:0%
a judge and I'm uh and I see a guardian
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
Adel item that I think is predisposed in
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
a particular way
 
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
um then I'm not going to use that
 
01:09:32.990 --> 01:09:33.000 align:start position:0%
Guardian that light them uh I might not
 
01:09:35.150 --> 01:09:35.160 align:start position:0%
use them in a case where I think that
 
01:09:37.249 --> 01:09:37.259 align:start position:0%
that predisposition is going to have an
 
01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
effect at all
 
01:09:41.209 --> 01:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
uh you know there were some guardian of
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
items I won't use it or wouldn't use it
 
01:09:44.870 --> 01:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
all because I just don't think they have
 
01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
the skill or the ability to do it they
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
might qualify as a guardian and light
 
01:09:50.990 --> 01:09:51.000 align:start position:0%
them but they're not necessarily who I
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
think could do the job right
 
01:09:52.799 --> 01:09:54.050 align:start position:0%
think could do the job right
and

01:09:54.050 --> 01:09:54.060 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
so long and the short is
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
do I think that
 
01:10:01.970 --> 01:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
Guardian Lambs can make mistakes do I
 
01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:04.400 align:start position:0%
think that they're subject to
 
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
predispositions and prejudices like
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
everybody else yeah I think they are and
 
01:10:12.770 --> 01:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
I think that part of what a good judge
 
01:10:14.570 --> 01:10:14.580 align:start position:0%
does and part of the court system does
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
is sort that out to make sure that that
 
01:10:20.709 --> 01:10:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:23.149 --> 01:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
um we're here looking at the family
 
01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:31.370 align:start position:0%
um we're here looking at the family
court

01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
can you tell us what you see
 
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
may or may not be helpful in terms of
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
how the family court operates vis-a-vis
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
the judges being trained
 
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:51.540 align:start position:0%
um about
 
01:10:57.050 --> 01:10:57.060 align:start position:0%
the services of gal and uh and how they
 
01:10:58.490 --> 01:10:58.500 align:start position:0%
should proceed
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:10.970 --> 01:11:10.980 align:start position:0%
you know you don't have to answer yeah
 
01:11:14.330 --> 01:11:14.340 align:start position:0%
no I uh
 
01:11:16.729 --> 01:11:16.739 align:start position:0%
the chairman directs the witness to
 
01:11:16.739 --> 01:11:18.070 align:start position:0%
the chairman directs the witness to
answer

01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
answer
 
01:11:21.669 --> 01:11:21.679 align:start position:0%
no all right
 
01:11:25.490 --> 01:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
you know I uh
 
01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.830 align:start position:0%
you know I uh
um

01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:31.910 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:34.669 --> 01:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I can give a blanket answer
 
01:11:37.550 --> 01:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
to that really but
 
01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.610 align:start position:0%
to that really but
the

01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:48.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:11:48.050 --> 01:11:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:50.209 --> 01:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:11:50.219 --> 01:11:52.490 align:start position:0%
I think
yeah

01:11:52.490 --> 01:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:11:55.790 --> 01:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
that's fine yeah I want to give that
 
01:11:58.250 --> 01:11:58.260 align:start position:0%
some thought before I just speak
 
01:11:58.260 --> 01:11:58.970 align:start position:0%
some thought before I just speak
um

01:11:58.970 --> 01:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:01.270 --> 01:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
that's more than acceptable thank you
 
01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:04.260 align:start position:0%
and for the times when you Ponder this
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
what we are really looking at is
 
01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
suggestions and recommendations we're
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
not critiquing criticizing redoing we're
 
01:12:14.149 --> 01:12:14.159 align:start position:0%
just saying how do we make a good thing
 
01:12:16.490 --> 01:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
we'll stipulate the good thing better
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
yeah uh uh and I I think I can answer
 
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
the question now so along the short is I
 
01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
I think that the
 
01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.550 align:start position:0%
I think that the
uh

01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
that guiding that item should only be
 
01:12:32.689 --> 01:12:32.699 align:start position:0%
appointed when they're needed
 
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
there are many cases where judges can
 
01:12:37.370 --> 01:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
make decisions without having to have a
 
01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
guardian Adel item I think based on the
 
01:12:40.199 --> 01:12:41.209 align:start position:0%
guardian Adel item I think based on the
evidence

01:12:41.209 --> 01:12:41.219 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
01:12:41.219 --> 01:12:42.830 align:start position:0%
evidence
and

01:12:42.830 --> 01:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:12:45.770 --> 01:12:45.780 align:start position:0%
they when they are appointed they should
 
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
be appointed just to serve as a guardian
 
01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
as an item
 
01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
because lots of times
 
01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
I think judges have a tendency to want
 
01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:00.300 align:start position:0%
to utilize them to assist in parenting
 
01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:02.030 align:start position:0%
to utilize them to assist in parenting
where

01:13:02.030 --> 01:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:13:04.090 --> 01:13:04.100 align:start position:0%
I think they should be
 
01:13:07.370 --> 01:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
fact-finders make a recommendation but
 
01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:10.920 align:start position:0%
not to get involved in assisting with
 
01:13:13.970 --> 01:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
the parenting itself and I think that
 
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.130 align:start position:0%
the parenting itself and I think that
really

01:13:15.130 --> 01:13:15.140 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:13:17.689 --> 01:13:17.699 align:start position:0%
becomes problematic
 
01:13:17.699 --> 01:13:20.030 align:start position:0%
becomes problematic
and

01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:20.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:23.040 align:start position:0%
and this is just a matter of opinion so
 
01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure I'm speaking specifically
 
01:13:30.290 --> 01:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
from the board uh as a matter of opinion
 
01:13:32.689 --> 01:13:32.699 align:start position:0%
and other people have heard me say this
 
01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:35.100 align:start position:0%
but you know the the very first thing
 
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
you learn in law school and you're as a
 
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
1l and you take your legal process
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
course is judges wrote a the Court's
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
role is to decide cases in controversy
 
01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:50.930 align:start position:0%
role is to decide cases in controversy
and

01:13:50.930 --> 01:13:50.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:54.169 --> 01:13:54.179 align:start position:0%
the operative word there is
 
01:13:56.810 --> 01:13:56.820 align:start position:0%
to decide cases
 
01:14:00.530 --> 01:14:00.540 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to solve cases
 
01:14:03.410 --> 01:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
and if you understand the courts you
 
01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
know that and particularly in
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
contentious cases and in divorce cases
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
you're not going to solve cases and I
 
01:14:17.530 --> 01:14:17.540 align:start position:0%
think judges
 
01:14:20.270 --> 01:14:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh tend to
 
01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh when judges tend to want to solve
 
01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
cases instead of deciding cases that's
 
01:14:30.910 --> 01:14:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:32.510 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:14:36.350 --> 01:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
so long in the short is when you start
 
01:14:39.729 --> 01:14:39.739 align:start position:0%
using Guardian that items to go beyond
 
01:14:44.330 --> 01:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
deciding cases then I think
 
01:14:49.130 --> 01:14:49.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
your testimony this is
 
01:14:57.770 --> 01:14:57.780 align:start position:0%
great good stuff
 
01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:00.780 align:start position:0%
um you you mentioned that gals get
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
appointed when the financial needs are
 
01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.250 align:start position:0%
appointed when the financial needs are
met

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
met
 
01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:05.649 align:start position:0%
met
um

01:15:05.649 --> 01:15:05.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:08.510 --> 01:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
other than parents paying is there
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
another method
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
where the financial needs may be met so
 
01:15:15.649 --> 01:15:15.659 align:start position:0%
there isn't so it's it's uh parental pay
 
01:15:17.890 --> 01:15:17.900 align:start position:0%
and if I can follow up yeah
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
and and and that's uh interesting issue
 
01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:24.659 align:start position:0%
because uh
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
that sometimes that gets to be
 
01:15:30.370 --> 01:15:30.380 align:start position:0%
problematic in that uh one parent will
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
uh one parent will step up to pay and
 
01:15:35.090 --> 01:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
the other parent doesn't really
 
01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
necessarily want a Guardian that light
 
01:15:39.110 --> 01:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
them but one parent will step up to pay
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
and then the question is
 
01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
do you appoint a guardian that light him
 
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:55.870 --> 01:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
gonna be pairing from
 
01:16:00.649 --> 01:16:00.659 align:start position:0%
suspecting that uh do you do you sense
 
01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:03.480 align:start position:0%
where a guardian ad litem could lean
 
01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:06.780 align:start position:0%
towards the parent that's paying
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
I I mean is there any way of judging
 
01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:12.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not that
 
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
could be the case
 
01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:16.729 align:start position:0%
could be the case
uh

01:16:16.729 --> 01:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
don't uh
 
01:16:21.770 --> 01:16:21.780 align:start position:0%
do I think there's any circumstances
 
01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
where that could happen sure do I think
 
01:16:25.610 --> 01:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
there's a circumstance where that could
 
01:16:28.729 --> 01:16:28.739 align:start position:0%
happen I don't think so and I think if
 
01:16:30.770 --> 01:16:30.780 align:start position:0%
you have a judge that's responsible at
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
all they're going to make sure that
 
01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:35.940 align:start position:0%
there's not that type of predisposition
 
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
and uh one more one more uh with respect
 
01:16:41.450 --> 01:16:41.460 align:start position:0%
to uh both parents paying or one parent
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
paying uh what would you say is the
 
01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.490 align:start position:0%
paying uh what would you say is the
greater

01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:46.500 align:start position:0%
greater
 
01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:47.149 align:start position:0%
greater
um

01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
Financial need is it one parent or or
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
both parents pay
 
01:16:54.590 --> 01:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
that when when you say Financial need
 
01:16:54.600 --> 01:17:00.709 align:start position:0%
that when when you say Financial need
yeah

01:17:00.709 --> 01:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the answer to that I
 
01:17:04.790 --> 01:17:04.800 align:start position:0%
don't think okay I couldn't tell you
 
01:17:06.410 --> 01:17:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:17:10.729 --> 01:17:10.739 align:start position:0%
I I was a judge in Franklin so
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
um we didn't have many we didn't have
 
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
is there a case where it seems that one
 
01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
parent is greater of means and can pay
 
01:17:26.030 --> 01:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
and the other parent is not and might
 
01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
qualify for public funds so that the
 
01:17:30.830 --> 01:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
payment winds up balancing out but the
 
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
direction is different no public funds
 
01:17:35.209 --> 01:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
no public funds no matter how poor you
 
01:17:35.219 --> 01:17:35.930 align:start position:0%
no public funds no matter how poor you
are

01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:35.940 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
representative Smith I could just follow
 
01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:48.540 align:start position:0%
up sure that was a decision of this body
 
01:17:51.530 --> 01:17:51.540 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
 
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
changing in the budget uh changing the
 
01:17:57.709 --> 01:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
practice so that there were no public
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
funds available both the gal and that
 
01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:03.659 align:start position:0%
happened 15 years ago now well no not
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
15. yep yeah well around 2008 around the
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:24.229 --> 01:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
that's a hypothetical
 
01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for coming and making
 
01:18:28.490 --> 01:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
your presentation this is helpful thanks
 
01:18:31.010 --> 01:18:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:33.780 align:start position:0%

chairman
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
knowing the work of
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
of this committee and knowing how
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
difficult it is going to be
 
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
um I think we were all pleased that you
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
are here today in your capacity is being
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
on the board of gal is it possible that
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
in then over the next month or so you
 
01:19:03.169 --> 01:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
might consider coming
 
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:07.020 align:start position:0%
um in Your Capacity as a former judge or
 
01:19:09.350 --> 01:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
as the former chair of the Judiciary
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
Committee to talk about what we might
 
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
want to consider in terms of making the
 
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
family court as good as it could be
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to come anytime you ask
 
01:19:25.870 --> 01:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:19:29.290 --> 01:19:29.300 align:start position:0%
interestingly how my esteemed Vice chair
 
01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:31.800 align:start position:0%
just basically read from what I was
 
01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
going to say
 
01:19:35.630 --> 01:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
how about
 
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:37.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chair my eyes aren't good enough to
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
read what you've written
 
01:19:42.970 --> 01:19:42.980 align:start position:0%
so you weren't copying off my paper
 
01:19:47.169 --> 01:19:47.179 align:start position:0%
I love it when a plan comes together
 
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
now we're going to be walking slowly
 
01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
through this because remember what we
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
need from
 
01:19:59.450 --> 01:19:59.460 align:start position:0%
the folks in the audience
 
01:20:03.950 --> 01:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
is data that can be used by US in the
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
way we're going to evaluate it
 
01:20:11.330 --> 01:20:11.340 align:start position:0%
and that means specifics as a slice and
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
if you start to wander into talking too
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
broadly too generally about the case as
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
a whole
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm going to stop you and not
 
01:20:23.330 --> 01:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
because you don't have something to say
 
01:20:26.630 --> 01:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
but this isn't the Forum so with that in
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
mind uh first up Dana Albrecht would you
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
come up we have a pink card from you it
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't say time needed to speak
 
01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
um do we have our buzzers and sirens and
 
01:20:42.229 --> 01:20:42.239 align:start position:0%
if I told them at four minutes and 30
 
01:20:44.209 --> 01:20:44.219 align:start position:0%
seconds we have a most pleasing and
 
01:20:46.850 --> 01:20:46.860 align:start position:0%
comforting tone at five minutes it's an
 
01:20:49.070 --> 01:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
outrageously gross buzzer
 
01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.410 align:start position:0%
outrageously gross buzzer
so

01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's the sign yes
 
01:20:56.689 --> 01:20:56.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.610 --> 01:20:58.620 align:start position:0%
oh is that the comforting one or the
 
01:21:00.649 --> 01:21:00.659 align:start position:0%
obnoxious one okay don't don't don't do
 
01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
the obnoxious one we won't need it go
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
ahead sir thank you for the record Dana
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
Albrecht uh I'm gonna use my first 30
 
01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
seconds here to play for you 30 seconds
 
01:21:17.510 --> 01:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
of audio from the May 1st 2014 Hearing
 
01:21:21.770 --> 01:21:21.780 align:start position:0%
in Sobel B Sobel
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%

01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:29.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.330 --> 01:21:35.340 align:start position:0%
recording yes
 
01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh before the timer continues uh the
 
01:21:44.689 --> 01:21:44.699 align:start position:0%
attorney sorry representative Macbeth
 
01:21:47.090 --> 01:21:47.100 align:start position:0%
your question
 
01:21:49.370 --> 01:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
is uh yeah I do have a question I I just
 
01:21:52.130 --> 01:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
know that I believe that before the
 
01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
family court can be recorded it needs to
 
01:21:55.010 --> 01:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
be approved by the judge it has to be an
 
01:21:56.630 --> 01:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
order and so I'm just making sure that
 
01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:57.530 align:start position:0%
order and so I'm just making sure that
we're

01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
we're
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
listening to something that's lawfully
 
01:22:02.510 --> 01:22:02.520 align:start position:0%

01:22:09.410 --> 01:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
Petition of Union Leader 2002. okay I
 
01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
can't rule on that and I'm not going to
 
01:22:13.729 --> 01:22:13.739 align:start position:0%
um it's just we will take your word you
 
01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
may do this so chairman they are public
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
hearings but there are rules in place in
 
01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
the court regarding how they can be
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
recorded and I don't have a problem with
 
01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
listening to anything that's accurately
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:22:29.090 --> 01:22:29.100 align:start position:0%
I'm going to I'm going to ER on the side
 
01:22:33.790 --> 01:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.189 --> 01:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
let us know to the contrary
 
01:22:41.810 --> 01:22:41.820 align:start position:0%
um we will make changes accordingly
 
01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
um my concern about liability is not us
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
it's about the people bringing things to
 
01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.530 align:start position:0%
it's about the people bringing things to
us

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:23.990 --> 01:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
so what you just heard
 
01:23:26.750 --> 01:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
was a guardian of item Kathleen
 
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:29.480 align:start position:0%
sternenberg and former judge Julie
 
01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
introcasso uh stating on the record uh
 
01:23:37.970 --> 01:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
in this hearing May 1st 2014 that they
 
01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
are very good friends
 
01:23:42.950 --> 01:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
and I do assure the committee this was
 
01:23:45.709 --> 01:23:45.719 align:start position:0%
lawfully obtained uh through a request
 
01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
for the courts for recording and I have
 
01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
no desire to play the whole hearing for
 
01:23:53.390 --> 01:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
you that's the 30 second slice that's
 
01:23:56.330 --> 01:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
relevant thank you
 
01:24:00.350 --> 01:24:00.360 align:start position:0%
and to your point now and to my point is
 
01:24:03.530 --> 01:24:03.540 align:start position:0%
that spawned nine cases involving a
 
01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
in which uh uh mrtenberg practiced and
 
01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
actively participated in court cases
 
01:24:17.990 --> 01:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
before uh Julian tricasso that's my
 
01:24:19.090 --> 01:24:19.100 align:start position:0%
first point
 
01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:23.900 align:start position:0%
uh also to the point here on my computer
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
I have a 154-page PDF which I am not
 
01:24:30.590 --> 01:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
going to read to the committee no you're
 
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
not but it will decide chapter and verse
 
01:24:38.330 --> 01:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
uh so this is the first two for
 
01:24:41.890 --> 01:24:41.900 align:start position:0%
background this is the uh February 8th
 
01:24:47.390 --> 01:24:47.400 align:start position:0%
2021 deposition with exhibits taken of
 
01:24:50.570 --> 01:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
Miss intercostal as part of a misconduct
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
uh investigation
 
01:24:56.450 --> 01:24:56.460 align:start position:0%
uh so I would refer to the committee to
 
01:24:56.460 --> 01:24:59.090 align:start position:0%
uh so I would refer to the committee to
uh

01:24:59.090 --> 01:24:59.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
I'd say page 61 this is one of those
 
01:25:02.810 --> 01:25:02.820 align:start position:0%
depositions where you've got four per
 
01:25:04.790 --> 01:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
page uh chair is going to interrupt for
 
01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
a minute and you're using names which
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
um I would prefer you now to refer back
 
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
as title the titles and and the reason
 
01:25:17.689 --> 01:25:17.699 align:start position:0%
for that is we're looking at process and
 
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
not the individual granted the
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
individual did the process but I would
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
rather minimize the articulation of
 
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
names so you can say the guardian ad
 
01:25:29.570 --> 01:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
litem the judge the lawyer the
 
01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
plaintiff's lawyer the defendant's
 
01:25:32.689 --> 01:25:32.699 align:start position:0%
lawyer you can use those terms if you
 
01:25:34.010 --> 01:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
would please
 
01:25:34.020 --> 01:25:35.470 align:start position:0%
would please
okay

01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
uh I would just like to read 61 line 21
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
of this deposition
 
01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:46.250 align:start position:0%
of this deposition
uh

01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry their names here uh
 
01:25:52.450 --> 01:25:52.460 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:54.010 align:start position:0%
the question is
yeah

01:25:54.010 --> 01:25:54.020 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:25:58.189 --> 01:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
ah got it the question is from Philip
 
01:26:01.610 --> 01:26:01.620 align:start position:0%

him as such in the future
 
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay so Council for the judicial conduct
 
01:26:10.250 --> 01:26:10.260 align:start position:0%
committee asks
 
01:26:14.689 --> 01:26:14.699 align:start position:0%
uh former or at that time current judge
 
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:17.460 align:start position:0%
Julie interconto judge judge

was there any discussion at all with you
 
01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
uh for you and the parties is
 
01:26:36.590 --> 01:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
for the council that uh Guardian Ad
 
01:26:39.830 --> 01:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
Litem Kathleen sternenberg was on your
 
01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:41.540 align:start position:0%
conflicts list
 
01:26:46.010 --> 01:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
and the answer from Judge intercasso hey
 
01:26:48.169 --> 01:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
hey come on pay attention to me sorry
 
01:26:48.179 --> 01:26:49.490 align:start position:0%
hey come on pay attention to me sorry
titles

01:26:49.490 --> 01:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
titles
 
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
not names thank you continue
 
01:26:55.070 --> 01:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
the marital master has known that for
 
01:26:56.330 --> 01:26:56.340 align:start position:0%
seven years
 
01:26:58.669 --> 01:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
thank you so if we do the math on that
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
this is 2021 okay and that goes back to
 
01:27:05.629 --> 01:27:05.639 align:start position:0%
2014. so the mineral master has also
 
01:27:10.129 --> 01:27:10.139 align:start position:0%
known about this conflict since 2014.
 
01:27:13.370 --> 01:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
so the slice you're giving us
 
01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
is to the problem of
 
01:27:22.689 --> 01:27:22.699 align:start position:0%
conflicts conflicts and the allegation
 
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:26.280 align:start position:0%
regarding the conflict is that it would
 
01:27:31.090 --> 01:27:31.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.129 --> 01:27:34.139 align:start position:0%
uh the allegations is this likely was
 
01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
very profitable for the guardian litem
 
01:27:40.209 --> 01:27:40.219 align:start position:0%
over the course of these
 
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh nine cases
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
the allegation is parties from some of
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
these night cases May in the future
 
01:27:52.490 --> 01:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
provide different slices for you so you
 
01:27:54.830 --> 01:27:54.840 align:start position:0%
might wish that background
 
01:27:58.010 --> 01:27:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh the allegation would be that the
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
judge did not keep picking the guardian
 
01:28:03.770 --> 01:28:03.780 align:start position:0%
ad litem because the judge in the
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
judge's opinion saw that Guardian Ad
 
01:28:10.070 --> 01:28:10.080 align:start position:0%
Litem as an expert as per judge Gordon's
 
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
testimony to us but rather there was
 
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
some Financial benefit that would be
 
01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
gained by the guardian at lighthome
 
01:28:20.689 --> 01:28:20.699 align:start position:0%
irrespective of whether the guardian ad
 
01:28:22.970 --> 01:28:22.980 align:start position:0%
litem was qualified or not exactly
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's your assertion exactly I mean
 
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
that was a leading question I realized
 
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
but yeah exactly up here so yeah one
 
01:28:33.950 --> 01:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
that's helping us all here okay uh I'm
 
01:28:36.290 --> 01:28:36.300 align:start position:0%
not sure how we're doing on time we're
 
01:28:37.870 --> 01:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
doing all right okay
 
01:28:43.129 --> 01:28:43.139 align:start position:0%
uh so my second slice okay again from
 
01:28:48.410 --> 01:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
this document would be exhibit 17. of
 
01:28:51.310 --> 01:28:51.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:58.090 --> 01:28:58.100 align:start position:0%
uh in
 
01:29:03.709 --> 01:29:03.719 align:start position:0%

01:29:21.169 --> 01:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
which is one of these appointments in
 
01:29:24.410 --> 01:29:24.420 align:start position:0%
which the marital Master knowing of this
 
01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
conflict since 2014
 
01:29:29.930 --> 01:29:29.940 align:start position:0%

01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
guardian ad litem
 
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
which was then approved by the two
 
01:29:39.169 --> 01:29:39.179 align:start position:0%
the judge
 
01:29:41.689 --> 01:29:41.699 align:start position:0%
uh who was
 
01:29:43.790 --> 01:29:43.800 align:start position:0%
close friends as you heard of the audio
 
01:29:46.669 --> 01:29:46.679 align:start position:0%
of this Guardian lit item so it's the
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%

01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna hold you to it okay
 
01:30:45.770 --> 01:30:45.780 align:start position:0%
um representative Gordon said uh it was
 
01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:48.420 align:start position:0%
a point to for judges decide issues of
 
01:30:51.229 --> 01:30:51.239 align:start position:0%
controversy I would like to know when
 
01:30:54.490 --> 01:30:54.500 align:start position:0%
there was no controversy why sue espante
 
01:30:57.530 --> 01:30:57.540 align:start position:0%
my case has now been shipped to Michigan
 
01:31:00.470 --> 01:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
when I asked opposing counsel the judge
 
01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:02.340 align:start position:0%
to sign opposing council's proposed
 
01:31:06.290 --> 01:31:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:10.129 --> 01:31:10.139 align:start position:0%
your testimony and for the record I
 
01:31:12.649 --> 01:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
specifically picked Mr Albrecht to be
 
01:31:12.659 --> 01:31:13.669 align:start position:0%
specifically picked Mr Albrecht to be
first

01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
first
 
01:31:17.090 --> 01:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
because he's a regular participant in
 
01:31:20.350 --> 01:31:20.360 align:start position:0%
our children and family law committee
 
01:31:23.149 --> 01:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
hearings and
 
01:31:25.070 --> 01:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
um I figured if I could yell at anybody
 
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
it would be it would be somebody I know
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
oh you're welcome to yell at me well we
 
01:31:31.570 --> 01:31:31.580 align:start position:0%
do we we could use a little more of that
 
01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
style here yeah I thought you would be
 
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:36.229 align:start position:0%
style here yeah I thought you would be
one

01:31:36.229 --> 01:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:31:39.290 --> 01:31:39.300 align:start position:0%
um who could handle that representative
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
long question thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
so can you tell me what brought that
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
conversation to be of the judge and the
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
gal they're very good friends
 
01:31:55.129 --> 01:31:55.139 align:start position:0%
what there had to be a preface to I mean
 
01:31:57.169 --> 01:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
I think I don't think a judge would say
 
01:31:58.850 --> 01:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
oh there's Mary her and I are great
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
friends it it was there something that
 
01:32:03.169 --> 01:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
led to that
 
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
conversation between them uh that's
 
01:32:08.350 --> 01:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
actually the beginning of the transcript
 
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:10.400 align:start position:0%
uh and the audio
 
01:32:13.490 --> 01:32:13.500 align:start position:0%
uh you got a little thing before that so
 
01:32:15.229 --> 01:32:15.239 align:start position:0%
they're essentially letting the council
 
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
and the courtroom know that they're very
 
01:32:19.310 --> 01:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
good friends so in
 
01:32:21.649 --> 01:32:21.659 align:start position:0%
that case sort of people were informed
 
01:32:25.070 --> 01:32:25.080 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of these nine cases
 
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
not so much
 
01:32:30.169 --> 01:32:30.179 align:start position:0%
okay and uh chill up yeah follow up just
 
01:32:31.850 --> 01:32:31.860 align:start position:0%
for clarification the judge you're
 
01:32:34.129 --> 01:32:34.139 align:start position:0%
referring to is no longer a judge that's
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:40.070 --> 01:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:32:43.490 --> 01:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth thank you
 
01:32:44.530 --> 01:32:44.540 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for taking my question
 
01:32:47.090 --> 01:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
so uh just to follow up and give it the
 
01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
context uh the conversation that you
 
01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
played for us thank you
 
01:32:54.169 --> 01:32:54.179 align:start position:0%
um was that the um the judge the judge
 
01:32:56.149 --> 01:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
and the Gael trying to inform Council
 
01:32:58.970 --> 01:32:58.980 align:start position:0%
and ask if they reveal the conflict and
 
01:33:01.250 --> 01:33:01.260 align:start position:0%
then ask if if they should continue or
 
01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
if they wanted them to recluse
 
01:33:02.760 --> 01:33:04.209 align:start position:0%
if they wanted them to recluse
themselves

01:33:04.209 --> 01:33:04.219 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:33:06.470 --> 01:33:06.480 align:start position:0%
there really wasn't much of a
 
01:33:08.510 --> 01:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
conversation after that presumably if
 
01:33:10.310 --> 01:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
they did want to recuse or they would
 
01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
have had an opportunity to do so I'm
 
01:33:14.209 --> 01:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
welcome to provide the whole transcript
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
to the committee if you would like
 
01:33:19.910 --> 01:33:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh the point of that was to sort of
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
factually establish that there is was a
 
01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:23.930 align:start position:0%
factually establish that there is was a
conflict

01:33:23.930 --> 01:33:23.940 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
01:33:27.410 --> 01:33:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh I would accept the portion only the
 
01:33:29.209 --> 01:33:29.219 align:start position:0%
deal specifically with matters of
 
01:33:31.850 --> 01:33:31.860 align:start position:0%
recusal that apparently were not granted
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
exactly I would take that slice only not
 
01:33:37.250 --> 01:33:37.260 align:start position:0%
the rest of the trial please yeah okay
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
any further questions representative
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair is there
 
01:33:43.850 --> 01:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
any sort of requirement that the that
 
01:33:46.490 --> 01:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
there's a disclosure of a conflict or or
 
01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
a relationship between the parties uh
 
01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
the code of judicial conduct would
 
01:33:53.209 --> 01:33:53.219 align:start position:0%
require that unfortunately that didn't
 
01:33:55.729 --> 01:33:55.739 align:start position:0%
happen in these nine cases
 
01:33:57.290 --> 01:33:57.300 align:start position:0%
so if I could follow it happened and
 
01:33:59.590 --> 01:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
follow up one of those cases
 
01:34:03.410 --> 01:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
uh well yeah they were informed in in
 
01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:10.210 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:11.450 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:34:11.450 --> 01:34:11.460 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
measure of potential conflict was
 
01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:16.500 align:start position:0%
disclosed in cases two and following did
 
01:34:18.530 --> 01:34:18.540 align:start position:0%
I hear uh now
 
01:34:20.030 --> 01:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
in any of them
 
01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh no in fact that's actually what lad
 
01:34:26.030 --> 01:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
when and it was sort of discovered it
 
01:34:28.129 --> 01:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
came out in the union leader in October
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
and that sort of sparked a whole okay
 
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
so mandatory disclosure of potential
 
01:34:37.850 --> 01:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest was not stated by
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.450 --> 01:34:44.460 align:start position:0%
yeah that's correct over the course of
 
01:34:46.550 --> 01:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
these cases neither the judge nor the
 
01:34:49.070 --> 01:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
marital Master nor the guardian ad litem
 
01:34:51.590 --> 01:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
also all three of these individuals had
 
01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
a responsibility in all of these cases
 
01:34:56.330 --> 01:34:56.340 align:start position:0%
to disclose that would be a separate
 
01:34:56.340 --> 01:34:57.290 align:start position:0%
to disclose that would be a separate
file

01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
file
 
01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:01.500 align:start position:0%
I mean a separate issue I think
 
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you so much no
 
01:35:06.830 --> 01:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:15.649 --> 01:35:15.659 align:start position:0%
it sure recognizes Mr Robert tangway and
 
01:35:19.790 --> 01:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh you've kind of seen the form I don't
 
01:35:20.930 --> 01:35:20.940 align:start position:0%
know you as well so I'm not going to
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
yell as loud at you but that's kind of
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
the form that helps us get what we need
 
01:35:28.729 --> 01:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
and we try to keep names to a minimum uh
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
you may introduce a name at the
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
beginning and then refer by title
 
01:35:35.450 --> 01:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
because we're really looking for issues
 
01:35:37.669 --> 01:35:37.679 align:start position:0%
to fix rather than people
 
01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome my name is
 
01:35:41.390 --> 01:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
Robert tangway I'm a father of two
 
01:35:42.830 --> 01:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
children which I have not seen since
 
01:35:47.090 --> 01:35:47.100 align:start position:0%
December 1st 2022 in which fictitious
 
01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
and false domestic violence allegations
 
01:35:53.629 --> 01:35:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.030 --> 01:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
there was no claim of any physical or
 
01:35:58.450 --> 01:35:58.460 align:start position:0%
sexual violence there was no evidence
 
01:36:01.129 --> 01:36:01.139 align:start position:0%
presented at the hearing
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
it was conducted with judicial referee
 
01:36:08.810 --> 01:36:08.820 align:start position:0%
Joseph Maloney and that will be the only
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
time that I say that she was a Judicial
 
01:36:13.550 --> 01:36:13.560 align:start position:0%
referee that hearing was on December
 
01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:16.010 align:start position:0%
referee that hearing was on December
13th

01:36:16.010 --> 01:36:16.020 align:start position:0%
13th
 
01:36:19.010 --> 01:36:19.020 align:start position:0%
two thousand twenty two
 
01:36:21.890 --> 01:36:21.900 align:start position:0%
she issued her final orders on December
 
01:36:25.370 --> 01:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
14th while she presented false findings
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
of facts physically and mathematically
 
01:36:32.270 --> 01:36:32.280 align:start position:0%
and possible findings of fact to
 
01:36:34.970 --> 01:36:34.980 align:start position:0%
the Jew the the judge who signed off on
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
that I wrote an emergency notice of
 
01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:40.500 align:start position:0%
false findings of fact presented them to
 
01:36:43.490 --> 01:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
her where I spelled everything out
 
01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:45.530 align:start position:0%
her where I spelled everything out
and

01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:45.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:47.629 --> 01:36:47.639 align:start position:0%
said that there was no findings effect
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
no no basically just blew it off just to
 
01:36:53.450 --> 01:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
keep it simple I proceeded with three
 
01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:54.890 align:start position:0%
keep it simple I proceeded with three
more

01:36:54.890 --> 01:36:54.900 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:36:56.810 --> 01:36:56.820 align:start position:0%
and now we're at the Supreme Court right
 
01:36:56.820 --> 01:36:57.830 align:start position:0%
and now we're at the Supreme Court right
now

01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
and which I believe its Supreme Court
 
01:37:04.430 --> 01:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
rule 21 a is called
 
01:37:04.440 --> 01:37:06.830 align:start position:0%
rule 21 a is called
a

01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:06.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:37:08.930 --> 01:37:08.940 align:start position:0%
uh where where they're not supposed to
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
recuse they're supposed to disqualify
 
01:37:12.290 --> 01:37:12.300 align:start position:0%
themselves if they know they're supposed
 
01:37:15.169 --> 01:37:15.179 align:start position:0%
to go ahead and disqualify themselves
 
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
and what we have here in the state of
 
01:37:18.830 --> 01:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is the New Hampshire
 
01:37:20.870 --> 01:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
women's Bar Association which is not
 
01:37:23.450 --> 01:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
associated with the bar association yet
 
01:37:28.129 --> 01:37:28.139 align:start position:0%
what they do is they gerrymander the
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
lower courts specifically the circuit
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
courts the family courts and they say so
 
01:37:34.970 --> 01:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
on their website in which one of our
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
justices is a paid member of that Lobby
 
01:37:42.649 --> 01:37:42.659 align:start position:0%
and you're not supposed to have any
 
01:37:46.010 --> 01:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
effect or or consideration on Race
 
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
religion and gender
 
01:37:50.990 --> 01:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
um so that was those orders were on
 
01:37:52.689 --> 01:37:52.699 align:start position:0%
December 14
 
01:37:57.169 --> 01:37:57.179 align:start position:0%
2022 it has bled into with judge previt
 
01:37:59.450 --> 01:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
in the family matter because she filed
 
01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:00.169 align:start position:0%
in the family matter because she filed
the

01:38:00.169 --> 01:38:00.179 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
domestic violence
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
case against me to get strategic
 
01:38:09.770 --> 01:38:09.780 align:start position:0%
benefit in the family case when I filed
 
01:38:12.470 --> 01:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
a motion to order to have the court
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
order mediation which they have to in
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
the family Rules so you're going to want
 
01:38:18.830 --> 01:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
to look at the rules I'm not going to
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
submit any paper evidence but anyways
 
01:38:25.729 --> 01:38:25.739 align:start position:0%
the judge in the parenting case
 
01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:28.679 align:start position:0%
brought judicial notice that judicial
 
01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
notice was that I
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
committed a crime
 
01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:34.850 align:start position:0%
committed a crime
which

01:38:34.850 --> 01:38:34.860 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:38:37.910 --> 01:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
the crime was and he impeached me and in
 
01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
writing where he impeached me
 
01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:43.610 align:start position:0%
writing where he impeached me
for

01:38:43.610 --> 01:38:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:45.590 --> 01:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence
 
01:38:47.570 --> 01:38:47.580 align:start position:0%
false mathematically and physically
 
01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:50.149 align:start position:0%
false mathematically and physically
impossible

01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
01:38:52.850 --> 01:38:52.860 align:start position:0%
findings of fact
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
by a a so he impeached me and then he
 
01:38:57.590 --> 01:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
did this judicial notice and then the
 
01:38:58.850 --> 01:38:58.860 align:start position:0%
judicial notice I have obviously
 
01:39:01.310 --> 01:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
objected to it requires as part of that
 
01:39:01.320 --> 01:39:02.629 align:start position:0%
objected to it requires as part of that
rule

01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
rule
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
for one I didn't commit a crime I was
 
01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:06.420 align:start position:0%
never charged with the crime
 
01:39:10.610 --> 01:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
and if part of that rule is that
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
I can ask a mandatory hearing on that
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
judicial notice which he denied then
 
01:39:19.430 --> 01:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
at the end of April
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
he literally Broke My First Amendment
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
right to petition the court by kicking
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:33.530 --> 01:39:33.540 align:start position:0%
and and petition basically this court
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
the court system in New Hampshire as
 
01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
attested in the last meeting
 
01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
where the justices were actually here or
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
the uh the head Justice
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
it's not they're not following the rules
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
RSA 173b is unconstitutional
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire right of
 
01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:56.400 align:start position:0%

Witnesses against him face to face and
 
01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:17.940 align:start position:0%

01:40:34.850 --> 01:40:34.860 align:start position:0%
what you can do when you uh accuse
 
01:40:39.229 --> 01:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:41.090 --> 01:40:41.100 align:start position:0%
they have the right to counsel at the
 
01:40:43.729 --> 01:40:43.739 align:start position:0%
expense of the state if need is shown
 
01:40:45.490 --> 01:40:45.500 align:start position:0%
okay we'll ask you to wrap it up Sir
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
about 15 20 seconds so
 
01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
I guess the point of my testimony at
 
01:40:52.610 --> 01:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
this point is to show that I want you
 
01:40:54.530 --> 01:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
guys to be very hard on the justices
 
01:40:58.490 --> 01:40:58.500 align:start position:0%

01:41:00.830 --> 01:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
with custody out of state
 
01:41:03.050 --> 01:41:03.060 align:start position:0%

court rules that's the order that it
 
01:41:18.770 --> 01:41:18.780 align:start position:0%
goes and the the court has only
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
discretion of the court rules because if
 
01:41:24.110 --> 01:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
you look at all right we're going to
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%

01:41:59.330 --> 01:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you Mr
 
01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
tangway so I'm just trying to get the
 
01:42:05.050 --> 01:42:05.060 align:start position:0%
complaint is due process is that
 
01:42:07.250 --> 01:42:07.260 align:start position:0%
exactly what the the first gentleman
 
01:42:09.649 --> 01:42:09.659 align:start position:0%
spoke about conflict
 
01:42:12.410 --> 01:42:12.420 align:start position:0%
a conflict not just conflict but what
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
we're looking at is what what happened
 
01:42:16.609 --> 01:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
in this gentleman's case is it was in
 
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
the papers the judge actually
 
01:42:23.510 --> 01:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
white-outed papers for the gal she
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
Whited it out
 
01:42:26.689 --> 01:42:26.699 align:start position:0%
and that's why she's no longer a judge
 
01:42:26.699 --> 01:42:28.850 align:start position:0%
and that's why she's no longer a judge
so

01:42:28.850 --> 01:42:28.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:30.410 --> 01:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
the judge
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
wrote false statements
 
01:42:34.669 --> 01:42:34.679 align:start position:0%
mathematically and physically false
 
01:42:37.129 --> 01:42:37.139 align:start position:0%
statements and just said I don't have a
 
01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
lawyer by the way the plaintiff was
 
01:42:41.450 --> 01:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
represented with the lawyer and I filed
 
01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
the claim 633 colon 4 interference with
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
custody of class B felony with a 30-day
 
01:42:51.109 --> 01:42:51.119 align:start position:0%
written admission of it
 
01:42:52.790 --> 01:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
and she didn't hear it I didn't get a
 
01:42:54.649 --> 01:42:54.659 align:start position:0%
hearing we're not they're not people
 
01:42:57.530 --> 01:42:57.540 align:start position:0%
aren't getting hearings in courts on the
 
01:42:59.149 --> 01:42:59.159 align:start position:0%
family courts process thank you okay
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
yes representative guitar
 
01:43:15.169 --> 01:43:15.179 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:43:18.169 --> 01:43:18.179 align:start position:0%
for taking my question you referenced um
 
01:43:21.169 --> 01:43:21.179 align:start position:0%
I believe it was RSA 173b and stated you
 
01:43:23.090 --> 01:43:23.100 align:start position:0%
felt it was unconstitutional which part
 
01:43:25.550 --> 01:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
of that were you stating I'm I apologize
 
01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:27.350 align:start position:0%
of that were you stating I'm I apologize
so

01:43:27.350 --> 01:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
the reason and thank you for asking that
 
01:43:34.850 --> 01:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:39.050 --> 01:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
there is in order to be found have a
 
01:43:42.050 --> 01:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
protection order in 173b to be granted
 
01:43:44.810 --> 01:43:44.820 align:start position:0%
you must be accused you must have
 
01:43:46.850 --> 01:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
committed a crime
 
01:43:50.930 --> 01:43:50.940 align:start position:0%
so therefore the process is not as
 
01:43:54.470 --> 01:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
many judges wrote the process you're
 
01:43:55.910 --> 01:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to report a crime the police is
 
01:43:57.530 --> 01:43:57.540 align:start position:0%
supposed to investigate and rest that's
 
01:43:59.810 --> 01:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
simple and then you can add additional
 
01:44:01.669 --> 01:44:01.679 align:start position:0%
protection orders but what they're doing
 
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
is they're curtailing the system as a
 
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
shortcut and I believe this is
 
01:44:07.550 --> 01:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
specifically the women's Bar Association
 
01:44:09.470 --> 01:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
which if you go to their website and I
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
have that it has says that they're
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
working with women judges officials
 
01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
they're actually doing that it's the
 
01:44:20.330 --> 01:44:20.340 align:start position:0%
court curtail as a shortcut to any type
 
01:44:22.729 --> 01:44:22.739 align:start position:0%
of due process which is constitutionally
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
protected and to do so on offers of
 
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:27.480 align:start position:0%
proof which is against court rules you
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
cannot get a restraining order shall not
 
01:44:32.810 --> 01:44:32.820 align:start position:0%
be issued on Court rule uh on offers of
 
01:44:34.370 --> 01:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
proof so they're basically just the
 
01:44:36.770 --> 01:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
lawyers just testifying lying
 
01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:39.780 align:start position:0%
and uh saying whatever she has to say so
 
01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:41.639 align:start position:0%
that they can get protective orders and
 
01:44:42.830 --> 01:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
what they're doing is they're taking
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
away your right your Liberty to be with
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
your children the issue children they
 
01:44:49.129 --> 01:44:49.139 align:start position:0%
issue property they can issue uh
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
payments of money it's unconstitutional
 
01:44:52.490 --> 01:44:52.500 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
and the only way that it could be
 
01:44:56.030 --> 01:44:56.040 align:start position:0%
considered constitutional was is with
 
01:44:58.669 --> 01:44:58.679 align:start position:0%
the domestic courtroom protocol
 
01:45:00.709 --> 01:45:00.719 align:start position:0%
which I also have that
 
01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
um and that
 
01:45:04.070 --> 01:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
was not followed in this case and it's
 
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:10.609 --> 01:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
01:45:12.229 --> 01:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
sir thank you so much
 
01:45:18.410 --> 01:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:20.209 --> 01:45:20.219 align:start position:0%
and we're all figuring it out as we go
 
01:45:20.219 --> 01:45:22.490 align:start position:0%
and we're all figuring it out as we go
along

01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:23.689 --> 01:45:23.699 align:start position:0%
but you know what we're trying to do
 
01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:27.060 align:start position:0%
yeah so thanks uh the reason why I'm
 
01:45:29.090 --> 01:45:29.100 align:start position:0%
here today is is
 
01:45:31.010 --> 01:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
I guess so to put it into specifics
 
01:45:32.330 --> 01:45:32.340 align:start position:0%
there's probably a lot of things and
 
01:45:33.530 --> 01:45:33.540 align:start position:0%
I'll probably have to come back multiple
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
meetings but the big one is the uh the
 
01:45:40.430 --> 01:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
inherent bias of the court system to
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
give custody of the children to the
 
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:45.780 align:start position:0%
mother when it currently appears through
 
01:45:48.890 --> 01:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
U.S national statistics that actually is
 
01:45:51.890 --> 01:45:51.900 align:start position:0%
probably the worst case scenario for
 
01:45:51.900 --> 01:45:53.510 align:start position:0%
probably the worst case scenario for
children

01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:45:55.970 --> 01:45:55.980 align:start position:0%
giving children over to a single mother
 
01:45:59.570 --> 01:45:59.580 align:start position:0%
home has increased
 
01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
suicide rates increased Dropout rates
 
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
from school
 
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
just about every single statistic that
 
01:46:10.729 --> 01:46:10.739 align:start position:0%
we're looking to avoid in public
 
01:46:10.739 --> 01:46:13.250 align:start position:0%
we're looking to avoid in public
increases

01:46:13.250 --> 01:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
increases
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
when you give children
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
to to a single mother home
 
01:46:21.530 --> 01:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
I'm experiencing this personally through
 
01:46:23.810 --> 01:46:23.820 align:start position:0%
my own divorce situation
 
01:46:25.970 --> 01:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
but when I read this and and you look
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
into it
 
01:46:29.950 --> 01:46:29.960 align:start position:0%
and you try and get the stats to to
 
01:46:32.149 --> 01:46:32.159 align:start position:0%
confirm that through the state of New
 
01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:34.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they don't keep any stats on
 
01:46:35.870 --> 01:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
this stuff at all
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
they keep no stats on the outcomes of
 
01:46:38.400 --> 01:46:39.350 align:start position:0%
they keep no stats on the outcomes of
children

01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:46:40.850 --> 01:46:40.860 align:start position:0%
I can tell you when I go into the
 
01:46:43.609 --> 01:46:43.619 align:start position:0%
courtroom this certainly doesn't ask how
 
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:44.940 align:start position:0%
are your kids doing
 
01:46:46.850 --> 01:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
I've never I've as many times I've been
 
01:46:48.770 --> 01:46:48.780 align:start position:0%
in the courtroom probably a half a dozen
 
01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
times over seven and a half years still
 
01:46:55.010 --> 01:46:55.020 align:start position:0%
ongoing and not once the judge ever
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
asked how the kids are doing
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
this last go-around I had to convey to
 
01:47:00.050 --> 01:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
where that
 
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:02.040 align:start position:0%
all my kids at this point are adults and
 
01:47:03.470 --> 01:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
there's still a contention going on with
 
01:47:05.149 --> 01:47:05.159 align:start position:0%
child support
 
01:47:08.689 --> 01:47:08.699 align:start position:0%
that they're basically floundering
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
their mother is
 
01:47:13.010 --> 01:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
encouraging them to stay at home with
 
01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:16.020 align:start position:0%
her all the adult children mind you my
 
01:47:17.330 --> 01:47:17.340 align:start position:0%
kids are not
 
01:47:20.570 --> 01:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
engaging in their future if you will at
 
01:47:22.010 --> 01:47:22.020 align:start position:0%
least not to the extent you expect for
 
01:47:24.649 --> 01:47:24.659 align:start position:0%
the age that they're at
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
and that in general would be less likely
 
01:47:28.550 --> 01:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
to happen
 
01:47:31.250 --> 01:47:31.260 align:start position:0%
if there was a father involved which I
 
01:47:32.810 --> 01:47:32.820 align:start position:0%
was not allowed to be other than through
 
01:47:34.609 --> 01:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
visitation you literally become
 
01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
basically just a guest in your
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
children's lives
 
01:47:41.209 --> 01:47:41.219 align:start position:0%
that's the best you can expect
 
01:47:44.090 --> 01:47:44.100 align:start position:0%
you can't you can't offer anything of
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
any kind of substance a parent advice or
 
01:47:49.850 --> 01:47:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:51.770 --> 01:47:51.780 align:start position:0%
because you're basically just a guest in
 
01:47:52.850 --> 01:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
their life
 
01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
you don't get equal time with the kids
 
01:47:58.729 --> 01:47:58.739 align:start position:0%
by default even if there is no situation
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
where there is I mean it was it was
 
01:48:03.169 --> 01:48:03.179 align:start position:0%
presented when it's like in my example
 
01:48:06.590 --> 01:48:06.600 align:start position:0%
of my case where
 
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
my kid's mother
 
01:48:10.189 --> 01:48:10.199 align:start position:0%
basically went into the courtroom and
 
01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
said I'm afraid that was it
 
01:48:15.229 --> 01:48:15.239 align:start position:0%
that's all it took and that's what the
 
01:48:18.290 --> 01:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
judge put in the decree she also I had a
 
01:48:19.609 --> 01:48:19.619 align:start position:0%
communication with my oldest daughter
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
who at the time was an adult that she
 
01:48:24.530 --> 01:48:24.540 align:start position:0%
needed to get her together
 
01:48:28.609 --> 01:48:28.619 align:start position:0%
my ex used that that line as a form of
 
01:48:28.619 --> 01:48:31.729 align:start position:0%
my ex used that that line as a form of
abuse

01:48:31.729 --> 01:48:31.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:34.490 --> 01:48:34.500 align:start position:0%
and part of the decree why they took my
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:39.770 --> 01:48:39.780 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely ridiculous and the
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
national autistics are horrible
 
01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:44.820 align:start position:0%
absolutely horrible
 
01:48:47.330 --> 01:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
you look at just just the incarceration
 
01:48:50.570 --> 01:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
rates of single mother homes
 
01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:52.260 align:start position:0%
it's a nightmare
 
01:48:54.649 --> 01:48:54.659 align:start position:0%
yet we continue to assume that the best
 
01:48:58.250 --> 01:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
place for children is with their mother
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
and we don't keep stats on that we just
 
01:49:02.149 --> 01:49:02.159 align:start position:0%
assume it I've actually asked for
 
01:49:04.609 --> 01:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
requested information on that and you go
 
01:49:05.689 --> 01:49:05.699 align:start position:0%
through the court system and they
 
01:49:07.189 --> 01:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
literally tell you we don't keep those
 
01:49:07.199 --> 01:49:08.990 align:start position:0%
literally tell you we don't keep those
stats

01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
stats
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
we just assume that the best place is
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
for the mother and it's awful
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
and the outcomes the overall comes is
 
01:49:21.290 --> 01:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
disastrous for us as a civilization
 
01:49:23.450 --> 01:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
Mr Savoy are now starting to repeat it
 
01:49:25.250 --> 01:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
and could you take would you take some
 
01:49:26.770 --> 01:49:26.780 align:start position:0%
questions from us
 
01:49:30.050 --> 01:49:30.060 align:start position:0%
absolutely number one for me
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh you made an assertion that the
 
01:49:35.270 --> 01:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
national statistics say could you
 
01:49:38.330 --> 01:49:38.340 align:start position:0%
present documentation to this committee
 
01:49:40.609 --> 01:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
oh I would I would love to but but what
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
happens is is they keep the you can get
 
01:49:45.770 --> 01:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
those stats basically through uh news
 
01:49:48.470 --> 01:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
reports coming out of uh you know there
 
01:49:50.689 --> 01:49:50.699 align:start position:0%
are institutions that they will allow
 
01:49:52.250 --> 01:49:52.260 align:start position:0%
this information you have to basically
 
01:49:54.530 --> 01:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
be a research institution to get this
 
01:49:56.090 --> 01:49:56.100 align:start position:0%
information and they will allow that to
 
01:49:57.649 --> 01:49:57.659 align:start position:0%
now be disseminated to these news
 
01:49:59.629 --> 01:49:59.639 align:start position:0%
reporters or whatever after they've put
 
01:50:01.729 --> 01:50:01.739 align:start position:0%
it together okay since you know about it
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sure you read it yes and in
 
01:50:06.410 --> 01:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
that case I'd like a copy of it okay a
 
01:50:08.330 --> 01:50:08.340 align:start position:0%
second thing is it's actually quite easy
 
01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
you can go right onto Google because I'm
 
01:50:12.669 --> 01:50:12.679 align:start position:0%
underpaid and over business
 
01:50:14.689 --> 01:50:14.699 align:start position:0%
because you're trying to convince us
 
01:50:18.470 --> 01:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
could I ask my research uh staffer
 
01:50:21.649 --> 01:50:21.659 align:start position:0%
um I believe that there are states where
 
01:50:23.810 --> 01:50:23.820 align:start position:0%
it has been stated and I grant that's a
 
01:50:28.070 --> 01:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
broad term where co-parenting is the
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
expectation unless solid good reasons
 
01:50:34.669 --> 01:50:34.679 align:start position:0%
otherwise I would like to know that you
 
01:50:38.090 --> 01:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
know do us tell me some states also what
 
01:50:40.970 --> 01:50:40.980 align:start position:0%
is that determinant presently in New
 
01:50:43.129 --> 01:50:43.139 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what's considered best
 
01:50:46.609 --> 01:50:46.619 align:start position:0%
practices in New Hampshire
 
01:50:49.550 --> 01:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
um and and once again I would just
 
01:50:51.350 --> 01:50:51.360 align:start position:0%
suggest to you that the reason there
 
01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:53.580 align:start position:0%
were no statistics available in New
 
01:50:55.250 --> 01:50:55.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is almost no statistics
 
01:50:56.930 --> 01:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
available in New Hampshire for almost
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
anything because we are statistic phobia
 
01:51:01.430 --> 01:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
in this state and I can't run my deaf
 
01:51:02.930 --> 01:51:02.940 align:start position:0%
and hard of hearing committee as well as
 
01:51:06.169 --> 01:51:06.179 align:start position:0%
because nobody will how can you possibly
 
01:51:07.970 --> 01:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
do your job effectively if you don't
 
01:51:09.950 --> 01:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
have this kind of data thank you you're
 
01:51:12.470 --> 01:51:12.480 align:start position:0%
making my point any other question any
 
01:51:14.149 --> 01:51:14.159 align:start position:0%
questions from anybody up here
 
01:51:16.010 --> 01:51:16.020 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so you you
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned both your kids were taken away
 
01:51:22.609 --> 01:51:22.619 align:start position:0%
and you have visitation so which one I
 
01:51:24.770 --> 01:51:24.780 align:start position:0%
have four kids one was already an adult
 
01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
so there was three kids basically I you
 
01:51:28.370 --> 01:51:28.380 align:start position:0%
know I don't want to say taken away
 
01:51:30.530 --> 01:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
because I still had limited visitation
 
01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
not because of there was any finding of
 
01:51:35.030 --> 01:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
of abuse or anything like that although
 
01:51:37.010 --> 01:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
that is what she tried to claim and she
 
01:51:38.750 --> 01:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
certainly got you know me kicked out of
 
01:51:40.550 --> 01:51:40.560 align:start position:0%
the house I'd live out of my car for a
 
01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:41.750 align:start position:0%
the house I'd live out of my car for a
while

01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:51:43.609 --> 01:51:43.619 align:start position:0%
just so that she could get me out of the
 
01:51:45.169 --> 01:51:45.179 align:start position:0%
house which is which is the game they
 
01:51:47.450 --> 01:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
play they they basically that's that's
 
01:51:49.370 --> 01:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
how they work they set it up so that
 
01:51:51.590 --> 01:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
they you kick the father out of the home
 
01:51:54.169 --> 01:51:54.179 align:start position:0%
right now you have now you have custody
 
01:51:55.550 --> 01:51:55.560 align:start position:0%
of the children inherently you go
 
01:51:57.410 --> 01:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
through the whole separation process
 
01:52:01.070 --> 01:52:01.080 align:start position:0%
which is just awful and supposedly like
 
01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
in my case it was a um I forget what
 
01:52:06.649 --> 01:52:06.659 align:start position:0%
they call it but it's it's a um
 
01:52:08.930 --> 01:52:08.940 align:start position:0%
you know a non-contentious divorce kind
 
01:52:12.050 --> 01:52:12.060 align:start position:0%
of deal and so they go in supposedly the
 
01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
easier path if they do that you go in
 
01:52:16.189 --> 01:52:16.199 align:start position:0%
and they still instead of it being
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
non-contentious they you know my ex
 
01:52:20.390 --> 01:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
basically brought forward everything
 
01:52:23.330 --> 01:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
under the sun as if it was as if I was
 
01:52:25.250 --> 01:52:25.260 align:start position:0%
doing some kind of abuse link then there
 
01:52:26.810 --> 01:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
was never any finding in that eventually
 
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
the judge did give me what she said was
 
01:52:30.590 --> 01:52:30.600 align:start position:0%
equal custody which is not equal custody
 
01:52:32.810 --> 01:52:32.820 align:start position:0%
basically I got better than every other
 
01:52:34.570 --> 01:52:34.580 align:start position:0%
weekend which is what most dads get
 
01:52:37.609 --> 01:52:37.619 align:start position:0%
apparently I I got better than that I
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
actually was able to see my kids every
 
01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
weekend but in the overall time of your
 
01:52:42.770 --> 01:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
kids that are there in terms of their
 
01:52:44.030 --> 01:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
free time when they're not in school or
 
01:52:46.070 --> 01:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
whatever that it's not equal it's not
 
01:52:47.810 --> 01:52:47.820 align:start position:0%
like I got equal time I got to see him
 
01:52:49.850 --> 01:52:49.860 align:start position:0%
on the weekends and then the whole rest
 
01:52:51.410 --> 01:52:51.420 align:start position:0%
of the time it was
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
it was mom had him I use a saying that
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
all kinds of accusations were made
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
against you by your ex that were not
 
01:53:02.570 --> 01:53:02.580 align:start position:0%
investigated as to fact uh well they
 
01:53:04.370 --> 01:53:04.380 align:start position:0%
were they were only basically presented
 
01:53:05.990 --> 01:53:06.000 align:start position:0%
as hearsay so it was really known that
 
01:53:07.370 --> 01:53:07.380 align:start position:0%
there was the uh for the reason the
 
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
judge didn't feel that there was a need
 
01:53:11.270 --> 01:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
to do an investigation there was like no
 
01:53:12.830 --> 01:53:12.840 align:start position:0%
implementation of a guardium and light
 
01:53:18.109 --> 01:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
what they do is is that
 
01:53:22.490 --> 01:53:22.500 align:start position:0%
all it takes is the mother to say
 
01:53:24.649 --> 01:53:24.659 align:start position:0%
anything negative about the father they
 
01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
grant them the the ability to kick the
 
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:28.800 align:start position:0%
father out of the home in the best which
 
01:53:30.229 --> 01:53:30.239 align:start position:0%
into the best interest of the children
 
01:53:31.910 --> 01:53:31.920 align:start position:0%
right everything is claimed under the
 
01:53:33.050 --> 01:53:33.060 align:start position:0%
best interest of the children It
 
01:53:34.850 --> 01:53:34.860 align:start position:0%
ultimately comes down to you know the
 
01:53:36.470 --> 01:53:36.480 align:start position:0%
the they'll even tell you and it's even
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's even in the the circuit court rules
 
01:53:41.689 --> 01:53:41.699 align:start position:0%
that ultimately all none of this matters
 
01:53:43.910 --> 01:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
other than the best interests of the
 
01:53:45.770 --> 01:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
children and that's exactly what the
 
01:53:47.470 --> 01:53:47.480 align:start position:0%
judge uses in order for their outcomes
 
01:53:50.030 --> 01:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
they'll they'll state in the best
 
01:53:51.729 --> 01:53:51.739 align:start position:0%
instance of the children
 
01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
XYZ and that's how it works when we take
 
01:53:58.010 --> 01:53:58.020 align:start position:0%
another question here uh yeah uh
 
01:54:00.169 --> 01:54:00.179 align:start position:0%
representative Lanza
 
01:54:03.410 --> 01:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
so what I I would like to ask you thank
 
01:54:05.689 --> 01:54:05.699 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question is
 
01:54:05.699 --> 01:54:06.770 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question is
um

01:54:06.770 --> 01:54:06.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:09.169 --> 01:54:09.179 align:start position:0%
when was this heard
 
01:54:12.649 --> 01:54:12.659 align:start position:0%
who when was your case heard where was
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
it heard
 
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
so in my case
 
01:54:19.189 --> 01:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
um it was is uh Hillsborough County in
 
01:54:19.199 --> 01:54:21.169 align:start position:0%
um it was is uh Hillsborough County in
Goffstown

01:54:21.169 --> 01:54:21.179 align:start position:0%
Goffstown
 
01:54:23.930 --> 01:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
a Family Court division
 
01:54:26.689 --> 01:54:26.699 align:start position:0%
uh so it's been ongoing is still ongoing
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
and it's been going on for seven and a
 
01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
half years so we'd like to know the date
 
01:54:33.470 --> 01:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
when the allegations were made against
 
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
you I can get that to you I don't know
 
01:54:37.609 --> 01:54:37.619 align:start position:0%
if that would be helpful or filed so we
 
01:54:39.770 --> 01:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
can go back and look yeah it's not that
 
01:54:41.330 --> 01:54:41.340 align:start position:0%

I'll get you the you know the uh Court
 
01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:47.340 align:start position:0%

right and it's you just look at the
 
01:54:50.990 --> 01:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
divorce decree it's and the judge
 
01:54:53.030 --> 01:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
outlines the reason for
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
how she broke down who got the contract
 
01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
sister chills and all that stuff you
 
01:54:58.070 --> 01:54:58.080 align:start position:0%

middle of your question do you have
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%

thank you absolutely thank you
 
01:55:15.890 --> 01:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
representative anyone else represented
 
01:55:17.270 --> 01:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
to ball
 
01:55:20.030 --> 01:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson
 
01:55:22.010 --> 01:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
were you offered and thank you for
 
01:55:24.169 --> 01:55:24.179 align:start position:0%
coming and taking my question
 
01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
um were you offered any free guidance or
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
assistance through the courthouse When
 
01:55:31.010 --> 01:55:31.020 align:start position:0%
you entered the courthouse yeah that's
 
01:55:33.109 --> 01:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
that's a great question so you know in
 
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
order to get free Assistance or
 
01:55:36.350 --> 01:55:36.360 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
um you've got to meet a certain
 
01:55:38.510 --> 01:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
threshold you have to be under a certain
 
01:55:40.189 --> 01:55:40.199 align:start position:0%
threshold of income kind of kind of
 
01:55:42.649 --> 01:55:42.659 align:start position:0%
thing I did not fall into that mainly
 
01:55:46.189 --> 01:55:46.199 align:start position:0%
because uh I I have I have a good income
 
01:55:49.250 --> 01:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
I have a uh
 
01:55:51.109 --> 01:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
high value house and it's you know
 
01:55:52.970 --> 01:55:52.980 align:start position:0%
nearly paid off and I also have a good
 
01:55:54.770 --> 01:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
retirement account what I didn't have
 
01:55:56.689 --> 01:55:56.699 align:start position:0%
was direct access to you know available
 
01:55:56.699 --> 01:55:58.550 align:start position:0%
was direct access to you know available
cash

01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
cash
 
01:56:00.649 --> 01:56:00.659 align:start position:0%
my mistake I didn't I didn't know at the
 
01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
time that I should be saving up money
 
01:56:04.010 --> 01:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
for a divorce because it kind of I was
 
01:56:06.770 --> 01:56:06.780 align:start position:0%
blindsided by that so
 
01:56:09.410 --> 01:56:09.420 align:start position:0%
did you rep follow-up
 
01:56:12.290 --> 01:56:12.300 align:start position:0%
um thank you just to clarify so there
 
01:56:14.930 --> 01:56:14.940 align:start position:0%
was no one in the courthouse to help you
 
01:56:18.950 --> 01:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
fill out paperwork or how to address
 
01:56:27.729 --> 01:56:27.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:31.010 --> 01:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
I understood so I mean I was able to
 
01:56:33.050 --> 01:56:33.060 align:start position:0%
fill it out almost I mean in terms of
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
like an attorney or something like that
 
01:56:35.930 --> 01:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
they the judge tells you right up front
 
01:56:37.609 --> 01:56:37.619 align:start position:0%
you really should get an attorney
 
01:56:39.770 --> 01:56:39.780 align:start position:0%
and typically that's going to cost you
 
01:56:42.229 --> 01:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
12 000 up front that's what the judge
 
01:56:44.570 --> 01:56:44.580 align:start position:0%
told us and that's just to get the ball
 
01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
started with the attorney right I didn't
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
have twelve thousand dollars on hand so
 
01:56:51.290 --> 01:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
that wasn't happening and only that
 
01:56:53.810 --> 01:56:53.820 align:start position:0%
in talking to my peers going around and
 
01:56:55.129 --> 01:56:55.139 align:start position:0%
I talked to many of them and my
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
co-workers my peers and all that kind of
 
01:56:59.090 --> 01:56:59.100 align:start position:0%
stuff and the ones that did get the
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
their attorneys if you will
 
01:57:03.530 --> 01:57:03.540 align:start position:0%
they said that
 
01:57:07.129 --> 01:57:07.139 align:start position:0%
they like the fact that the attorneys
 
01:57:08.629 --> 01:57:08.639 align:start position:0%
kept them giving a certain amount of
 
01:57:10.790 --> 01:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
money to their exes
 
01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:12.229 align:start position:0%
money to their exes
but

01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:57:13.970 --> 01:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
almost all that money they would have
 
01:57:15.649 --> 01:57:15.659 align:start position:0%
given to their ex they wanted given to
 
01:57:17.810 --> 01:57:17.820 align:start position:0%
their attorney anyways and that happens
 
01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:20.340 align:start position:0%
100 of the time across the board so I
 
01:57:24.050 --> 01:57:24.060 align:start position:0%
said I came away you know
 
01:57:25.490 --> 01:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
there wasn't really a lot of benefit to
 
01:57:27.050 --> 01:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
having an attorney
 
01:57:29.450 --> 01:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
and it became clear to me that by
 
01:57:32.149 --> 01:57:32.159 align:start position:0%
default mom gets the kids anyways
 
01:57:34.129 --> 01:57:34.139 align:start position:0%
and I didn't really have a claim and I
 
01:57:36.649 --> 01:57:36.659 align:start position:0%
was you know as as a practicing
 
01:57:38.629 --> 01:57:38.639 align:start position:0%
Christian myself I wasn't going to be
 
01:57:40.850 --> 01:57:40.860 align:start position:0%
making claims against her falsehoods
 
01:57:42.950 --> 01:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
against my ex
 
01:57:45.169 --> 01:57:45.179 align:start position:0%
in order to try and try and somehow get
 
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
custody and and I I'm glad I did not do
 
01:57:50.450 --> 01:57:50.460 align:start position:0%
that because the whole goal between the
 
01:57:53.089 --> 01:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
attorneys is basically throw as much
 
01:57:55.370 --> 01:57:55.380 align:start position:0%
stuff against the wall and hopefully
 
01:57:57.709 --> 01:57:57.719 align:start position:0%
some of it sticks and when you're on the
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
receiving end of that let me tell you
 
01:58:02.209 --> 01:58:02.219 align:start position:0%
that sucks a lot and that's exactly what
 
01:58:04.729 --> 01:58:04.739 align:start position:0%
to do the her my ex's attorney she just
 
01:58:07.310 --> 01:58:07.320 align:start position:0%
threw as much stuff up there true or not
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
against the wall and you got and they so
 
01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:13.080 align:start position:0%
they her being the plaintiff she goes
 
01:58:16.129 --> 01:58:16.139 align:start position:0%
first the attorney for for my ex she
 
01:58:18.169 --> 01:58:18.179 align:start position:0%
went first she gets to throw all this
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
stuff up against the wall and you got to
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
sit there and try and go through and
 
01:58:22.129 --> 01:58:22.139 align:start position:0%
defend each one of them and if you don't
 
01:58:25.370 --> 01:58:25.380 align:start position:0%
defend against them effectively you're
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
guilty of that
 
01:58:29.149 --> 01:58:29.159 align:start position:0%
as you get in there and you basically
 
01:58:31.550 --> 01:58:31.560 align:start position:0%
have to prove your innocence thank you
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
um I'm hearing your um your ex-wife was
 
01:58:36.719 --> 01:58:37.970 align:start position:0%
um I'm hearing your um your ex-wife was
um

01:58:37.970 --> 01:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:41.570 --> 01:58:41.580 align:start position:0%
had counsel and you went uh per se
 
01:58:41.580 --> 01:58:43.250 align:start position:0%
had counsel and you went uh per se
correct

01:58:43.250 --> 01:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:58:45.229 --> 01:58:45.239 align:start position:0%
um which is an inherent disadvantage and
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
you're too rich to uh get something for
 
01:58:49.729 --> 01:58:49.739 align:start position:0%
free but you're too poor to be able to
 
01:58:52.070 --> 01:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
afford something that's right I fell
 
01:58:54.169 --> 01:58:54.179 align:start position:0%
into that window where it's there is
 
01:58:56.450 --> 01:58:56.460 align:start position:0%
something worth looking at okay any
 
01:58:59.209 --> 01:58:59.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
and seeing none and I think we got about
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
enough pink cards for the time remaining
 
01:59:05.270 --> 01:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
so thank you sir
 
01:59:07.070 --> 01:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:59:12.290 --> 01:59:12.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:14.330 --> 01:59:14.340 align:start position:0%
and I think you've seen How We Roll here
 
01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:15.780 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:59:20.689 --> 01:59:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:22.310 --> 01:59:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you chair special committee my
 
01:59:24.109 --> 01:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
name is Randall Collier
 
01:59:24.119 --> 01:59:25.609 align:start position:0%
name is Randall Collier
um

01:59:25.609 --> 01:59:25.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:27.169 --> 01:59:27.179 align:start position:0%
I like everything that's been said here
 
01:59:28.370 --> 01:59:28.380 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of fallacy there's
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
been a lot of misconceptions
 
01:59:32.810 --> 01:59:32.820 align:start position:0%
um there's been a lot of good questions
 
01:59:35.450 --> 01:59:35.460 align:start position:0%
um so I right now I have a 48 million
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
dollar suit in a Supreme Court
 
01:59:41.570 --> 01:59:41.580 align:start position:0%
through Belknap County Court
 
01:59:41.580 --> 01:59:42.530 align:start position:0%
through Belknap County Court
um

01:59:42.530 --> 01:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:45.709 --> 01:59:45.719 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Rights 24 violations due
 
01:59:47.089 --> 01:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
process I know I spoke in front of this
 
01:59:49.010 --> 01:59:49.020 align:start position:0%
committee before yep
 
01:59:49.020 --> 01:59:49.790 align:start position:0%
committee before yep
um

01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:59:51.290 --> 01:59:51.300 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of things that I
 
01:59:52.609 --> 01:59:52.619 align:start position:0%
brought to the Supreme Court's attention
 
01:59:54.290 --> 01:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people are obviously
 
01:59:55.669 --> 01:59:55.679 align:start position:0%
suffering at the hands of these family
 
01:59:55.679 --> 01:59:56.689 align:start position:0%
suffering at the hands of these family
courts

01:59:56.689 --> 01:59:56.699 align:start position:0%
courts
 
01:59:58.250 --> 01:59:58.260 align:start position:0%
first of all
 
02:00:00.530 --> 02:00:00.540 align:start position:0%
um when you go into family court and
 
02:00:02.330 --> 02:00:02.340 align:start position:0%
they give you a paper
 
02:00:02.340 --> 02:00:02.930 align:start position:0%
they give you a paper
um

02:00:02.930 --> 02:00:02.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:05.689 --> 02:00:05.699 align:start position:0%
say for criminal threatening or domestic
 
02:00:08.169 --> 02:00:08.179 align:start position:0%
violence once again
 
02:00:11.689 --> 02:00:11.699 align:start position:0%
allegations were unfounded
 
02:00:13.370 --> 02:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
um the court says that they gain
 
02:00:13.380 --> 02:00:14.629 align:start position:0%
um the court says that they gain
jurisdiction

02:00:14.629 --> 02:00:14.639 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction
 
02:00:17.510 --> 02:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
over the parties
 
02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
um this is on the 12413 order that's
 
02:00:22.370 --> 02:00:22.380 align:start position:0%
going on for 12 years
 
02:00:24.830 --> 02:00:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh the court says they found evidence by
 
02:00:26.570 --> 02:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
this order that it has jurisdiction over
 
02:00:28.729 --> 02:00:28.739 align:start position:0%
the parties and subject matter and the
 
02:00:30.770 --> 02:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
defendant upon service will be given
 
02:00:32.570 --> 02:00:32.580 align:start position:0%
reasonable notice and opportunity to be
 
02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:33.589 align:start position:0%
reasonable notice and opportunity to be
heard

02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:00:36.229 --> 02:00:36.239 align:start position:0%
I I hereby certify that I have read and
 
02:00:37.910 --> 02:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations and agreed to the extent
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
the mayoral Master judicial referee
 
02:00:41.089 --> 02:00:41.099 align:start position:0%
hearing officer has made factual
 
02:00:43.550 --> 02:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
findings and applied the correct legal
 
02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
standards and facts determined by the
 
02:00:48.070 --> 02:00:48.080 align:start position:0%
Maryland Master judicial referee
 
02:00:51.169 --> 02:00:51.179 align:start position:0%
signed by the Belknap County Judge
 
02:00:51.179 --> 02:00:53.990 align:start position:0%
signed by the Belknap County Judge
however

02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:00:56.810 --> 02:00:56.820 align:start position:0%
that's actually a illegal uh
 
02:00:59.450 --> 02:00:59.460 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional way to gain
 
02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the party's uh legally
 
02:01:04.070 --> 02:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
you need three elements uh subject
 
02:01:08.089 --> 02:01:08.099 align:start position:0%
matter person am and territorial so I
 
02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
guess a long time ago family courts are
 
02:01:12.050 --> 02:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
removed from superior court and now
 
02:01:13.850 --> 02:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
they're part of the equity court and not
 
02:01:15.530 --> 02:01:15.540 align:start position:0%
a criminal court
 
02:01:15.540 --> 02:01:16.609 align:start position:0%
a criminal court
so

02:01:16.609 --> 02:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:01:19.669 --> 02:01:19.679 align:start position:0%
these Family Court judges like to remove
 
02:01:21.470 --> 02:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
our constitutional rights to our
 
02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:22.669 align:start position:0%
our constitutional rights to our
children

02:01:22.669 --> 02:01:22.679 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:01:24.589 --> 02:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
um without actually a criminal hearing
 
02:01:27.410 --> 02:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
and then they deny access to evidence to
 
02:01:30.050 --> 02:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
defend against the judge's findings I
 
02:01:32.209 --> 02:01:32.219 align:start position:0%
want to bring special attention to you
 
02:01:34.250 --> 02:01:34.260 align:start position:0%
guys since you guys have this committee
 
02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:35.450 align:start position:0%
guys since you guys have this committee
up

02:01:35.450 --> 02:01:35.460 align:start position:0%
up
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
um okay we're going to need a specific
 
02:01:38.510 --> 02:01:38.520 align:start position:0%
because so far I've heard a very broad
 
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:40.020 align:start position:0%
generalization that I've heard about
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
1100 times since I got to the
 
02:01:44.570 --> 02:01:44.580 align:start position:0%
legislature seven years ago what I want
 
02:01:48.589 --> 02:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
is a specific example from you well
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
specific examples of equity Court judges
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
can't have subject matter jurisdiction
 
02:01:57.229 --> 02:01:57.239 align:start position:0%
over people okay because Equity core is
 
02:01:59.629 --> 02:01:59.639 align:start position:0%
finances and property only and the only
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
way in a constitutional republic as a as
 
02:02:04.970 --> 02:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
an American is through Criminal Court in
 
02:02:06.410 --> 02:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
a jury of your peers and be able to
 
02:02:08.270 --> 02:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
access evidence to defendant which we're
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
all I'm going to back you up because I I
 
02:02:12.050 --> 02:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
don't write as fast as you talk Equity
 
02:02:15.470 --> 02:02:15.480 align:start position:0%
Court your your allegation is that
 
02:02:18.290 --> 02:02:18.300 align:start position:0%
family court or Family Division of
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
should not be hearing these cases
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
correct they have no legal ability right
 
02:02:28.970 --> 02:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
so family court and will you provide us
 
02:02:31.129 --> 02:02:31.139 align:start position:0%
with paperwork that backs up what you
 
02:02:34.010 --> 02:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
believe 32 pages right here okay well
 
02:02:36.530 --> 02:02:36.540 align:start position:0%
that's why I have two clerks okay sorry
 
02:02:36.540 --> 02:02:37.910 align:start position:0%
that's why I have two clerks okay sorry
continue

02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
continue
 
02:02:40.250 --> 02:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
um so they they say they gain
 
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over the parties but they
 
02:02:43.129 --> 02:02:43.139 align:start position:0%
legally don't
 
02:02:44.629 --> 02:02:44.639 align:start position:0%
um secondarily
 
02:02:46.609 --> 02:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
um person am jurisdiction has to be met
 
02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:48.480 align:start position:0%
in order to take it rights away and
 
02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
that's actually being wanted for a crime
 
02:02:52.970 --> 02:02:52.980 align:start position:0%
um which means there's evidence of
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
Corpus still like die in three elements
 
02:02:56.450 --> 02:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
of an actual crime against somebody to
 
02:02:58.729 --> 02:02:58.739 align:start position:0%
have your parents removed or have your
 
02:03:00.370 --> 02:03:00.380 align:start position:0%
parental rights removed from your kids
 
02:03:02.990 --> 02:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
so this has been going on for 12 years
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
I've seen my son four years four times
 
02:03:09.290 --> 02:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
in 10 years for a total of six hours so
 
02:03:09.300 --> 02:03:10.609 align:start position:0%
in 10 years for a total of six hours so
um

02:03:10.609 --> 02:03:10.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:13.490 --> 02:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
the other allegation is not primarily I
 
02:03:16.189 --> 02:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
mean it's it's Downstream what they did
 
02:03:18.770 --> 02:03:18.780 align:start position:0%
your Chief allegation is they had no
 
02:03:20.410 --> 02:03:20.420 align:start position:0%
business to do this in the first place
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
irrespective of what their decision was
 
02:03:24.850 --> 02:03:24.860 align:start position:0%
it was the wrong venue constitutionally
 
02:03:27.169 --> 02:03:27.179 align:start position:0%
Not only was it the wrong venue but then
 
02:03:29.870 --> 02:03:29.880 align:start position:0%
they violated all the state statutes and
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
federal law in hearing the case so it's
 
02:03:34.370 --> 02:03:34.380 align:start position:0%
I love this phrase fruit of a poison
 
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
tree go on yeah so
 
02:03:39.290 --> 02:03:39.300 align:start position:0%
um I know representative long we spoke
 
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
last time uh and we I think it was
 
02:03:43.490 --> 02:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
regarding the troxible versus Granville
 
02:03:45.109 --> 02:03:45.119 align:start position:0%
case the parrot the parental alienation
 
02:03:46.669 --> 02:03:46.679 align:start position:0%
I think it was you
 
02:03:49.490 --> 02:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
um however uh since then uh New
 
02:03:51.530 --> 02:03:51.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court has also ruled
 
02:03:53.930 --> 02:03:53.940 align:start position:0%
uh in the Miller versus Todd case uh
 
02:03:55.609 --> 02:03:55.619 align:start position:0%
that false allegations is enough to
 
02:03:58.250 --> 02:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
overturn custody and and family court
 
02:04:00.050 --> 02:04:00.060 align:start position:0%
should have never granted uh primary
 
02:04:01.430 --> 02:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
custody to the mother on the false
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
allegations uh however uh New Jersey's
 
02:04:06.290 --> 02:04:06.300 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court just ruled two years ago
 
02:04:09.709 --> 02:04:09.719 align:start position:0%
and I want you guys all to
 
02:04:19.089 --> 02:04:19.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:21.530 --> 02:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
uh okay let's give it to the North
 
02:04:23.629 --> 02:04:23.639 align:start position:0%
Carolina Supreme Court
 
02:04:26.750 --> 02:04:26.760 align:start position:0%
um in 2000 uh
 
02:04:29.209 --> 02:04:29.219 align:start position:0%
gotta wrap it up okay uh North Carolina
 
02:04:31.370 --> 02:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
Court Supreme Court granted the father
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh 300 an hour for every hour that the
 
02:04:36.050 --> 02:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
family court took uh him away from his
 
02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
daughter he was granted 3.1 million and
 
02:04:40.370 --> 02:04:40.380 align:start position:0%
the dollars granted 1.5 uh New Jersey
 
02:04:43.790 --> 02:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court uh two years ago
 
02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:45.410 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court uh two years ago
just

02:04:45.410 --> 02:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:04:47.990 --> 02:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
put out an order and it said
 
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:49.790 align:start position:0%
put out an order and it said
um

02:04:49.790 --> 02:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:55.970 --> 02:04:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:02.270 --> 02:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
well the New Jersey Supreme Court said
 
02:05:05.930 --> 02:05:05.940 align:start position:0%
uh September 27 2021 they clearly
 
02:05:07.910 --> 02:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
explained how these family courts cannot
 
02:05:09.649 --> 02:05:09.659 align:start position:0%
lawfully shift the burden of proof to a
 
02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
parent to prove they did not commit the
 
02:05:15.229 --> 02:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
offense such as abuse in this case to uh
 
02:05:16.910 --> 02:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
justify infringing on the rights of
 
02:05:21.530 --> 02:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
Parental uh rights over their child so
 
02:05:23.149 --> 02:05:23.159 align:start position:0%
there's been multiple Supreme Court
 
02:05:25.189 --> 02:05:25.199 align:start position:0%
cases that have ruled that family courts
 
02:05:28.189 --> 02:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to take or give
 
02:05:30.589 --> 02:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
parental rights that's only through
 
02:05:33.649 --> 02:05:33.659 align:start position:0%
actual criminal process
 
02:05:33.659 --> 02:05:34.310 align:start position:0%
actual criminal process
um

02:05:34.310 --> 02:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:36.290 --> 02:05:36.300 align:start position:0%
so not not only is all these family
 
02:05:38.750 --> 02:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
courts trying to gain jurisdiction over
 
02:05:41.930 --> 02:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
the parties illegally they violate State
 
02:06:00.050 --> 02:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.550 --> 02:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:12.530 --> 02:06:12.540 align:start position:0%
I am a sajiel bear but I've been walking
 
02:06:14.689 --> 02:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
to watching too many hockey games lately
 
02:06:16.850 --> 02:06:16.860 align:start position:0%
is it Gilbert or Gilbert
 
02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:18.890 align:start position:0%
is it Gilbert or Gilbert
okay

02:06:18.890 --> 02:06:18.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:06:18.900 --> 02:06:28.209 align:start position:0%
okay
sir

02:06:28.209 --> 02:06:28.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:30.410 --> 02:06:30.420 align:start position:0%
all right you gotta hit it again I'll
 
02:06:32.089 --> 02:06:32.099 align:start position:0%
keep my hands off the button here thank
 
02:06:34.910 --> 02:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you uh chairman
 
02:06:37.250 --> 02:06:37.260 align:start position:0%
Pearson and committee I first want to
 
02:06:39.589 --> 02:06:39.599 align:start position:0%
follow up with uh some of what was
 
02:06:42.229 --> 02:06:42.239 align:start position:0%
already testified here today uh first
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
off with what representative ball
 
02:06:48.290 --> 02:06:48.300 align:start position:0%
recently just asked is if there was uh
 
02:06:50.750 --> 02:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
parties within the court system that
 
02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
could provide assistance with filing
 
02:06:55.490 --> 02:06:55.500 align:start position:0%
um what I have recognized over the last
 
02:06:57.709 --> 02:06:57.719 align:start position:0%
13 years of being in the Family Court
 
02:07:02.089 --> 02:07:02.099 align:start position:0%
division uh is that the clerks at least
 
02:07:03.550 --> 02:07:03.560 align:start position:0%
in the sixth district
 
02:07:08.390 --> 02:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
and also down in Cheshire County uh are
 
02:07:12.050 --> 02:07:12.060 align:start position:0%
very uh apprehensive of assisting filers
 
02:07:15.589 --> 02:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
with processing things
 
02:07:17.810 --> 02:07:17.820 align:start position:0%
um stating that it's a conflict of
 
02:07:21.890 --> 02:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
interest uh for them to assist with that
 
02:07:23.990 --> 02:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
um so I do feel that uh that's something
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
that should be addressed that Clerk
 
02:07:29.270 --> 02:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
should be obviously not particularly
 
02:07:31.609 --> 02:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
stating out what needs to be filed but I
 
02:07:34.070 --> 02:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
do need to state that you know they
 
02:07:35.810 --> 02:07:35.820 align:start position:0%
should be assisting people that are less
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
fortunate with understanding or having
 
02:07:41.750 --> 02:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
disabilities have that accessibility to
 
02:07:41.760 --> 02:07:43.450 align:start position:0%
disabilities have that accessibility to
file

02:07:43.450 --> 02:07:43.460 align:start position:0%
file
 
02:07:46.129 --> 02:07:46.139 align:start position:0%
moving forward I would like to follow up
 
02:07:50.649 --> 02:07:50.659 align:start position:0%
with Gordon Ness uh sorry Ned Gordon
 
02:07:54.290 --> 02:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
uh and with regards to the guardian
 
02:07:54.300 --> 02:07:55.669 align:start position:0%
uh and with regards to the guardian
items

02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
items
 
02:07:59.330 --> 02:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
um we in my 13 years in the family court
 
02:08:02.209 --> 02:08:02.219 align:start position:0%
I'm obviously a young gentleman uh on my
 
02:08:04.729 --> 02:08:04.739 align:start position:0%
children I was birthed when I was 17
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
years old
 
02:08:09.229 --> 02:08:09.239 align:start position:0%
um that being said we have had extensive
 
02:08:11.689 --> 02:08:11.699 align:start position:0%
I've had probably 15 different Garnett
 
02:08:14.930 --> 02:08:14.940 align:start position:0%
items over the 13 years uh some that
 
02:08:17.390 --> 02:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
were voluntarily recused some that were
 
02:08:19.729 --> 02:08:19.739 align:start position:0%
forcefully recused
 
02:08:22.490 --> 02:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
um I I do feel that the family courts do
 
02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead and over extend the processing
 
02:08:31.010 --> 02:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
of providing a Garnier item when they
 
02:08:32.450 --> 02:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
could be
 
02:08:34.250 --> 02:08:34.260 align:start position:0%
particularly piecing these pieces
 
02:08:35.870 --> 02:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
together just from the testimony from
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
the parties
 
02:08:40.310 --> 02:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
um and they are utilizing these Guardian
 
02:08:42.589 --> 02:08:42.599 align:start position:0%
items more as an investigative and
 
02:08:45.589 --> 02:08:45.599 align:start position:0%
Parental Guidance rather than
 
02:08:48.470 --> 02:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
you know actually conducting best
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
interest determinations
 
02:08:51.119 --> 02:08:51.890 align:start position:0%
interest determinations
um

02:08:51.890 --> 02:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:54.050 --> 02:08:54.060 align:start position:0%
following up with the division and this
 
02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
is my main point here that I wish to
 
02:08:58.910 --> 02:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
speak and I do wish to come back and
 
02:09:01.609 --> 02:09:01.619 align:start position:0%
speak further when I have a proper set
 
02:09:04.609 --> 02:09:04.619 align:start position:0%
of guidelines fourth so I can lay those
 
02:09:07.669 --> 02:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
grounds but following up with dcyf and
 
02:09:10.310 --> 02:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
Mr ribsum uh
 
02:09:13.609 --> 02:09:13.619 align:start position:0%
primarily what my testimony will be here
 
02:09:17.149 --> 02:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
today and in future sessions is I do
 
02:09:18.649 --> 02:09:18.659 align:start position:0%
believe and I believe that you're going
 
02:09:20.870 --> 02:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
to find out for many constituents as
 
02:09:23.810 --> 02:09:23.820 align:start position:0%
well as from the judges themselves that
 
02:09:26.750 --> 02:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
this Family Court division issue is
 
02:09:30.250 --> 02:09:30.260 align:start position:0%
primarily due to dcyf non-compliance
 
02:09:33.109 --> 02:09:33.119 align:start position:0%
with their own policies as well as with
 
02:09:38.330 --> 02:09:38.340 align:start position:0%
RSA 169 C and 170 g8ab
 
02:09:42.050 --> 02:09:42.060 align:start position:0%
what's the last reference 170 GAA
 
02:09:46.510 --> 02:09:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:50.209 --> 02:09:50.219 align:start position:0%
which is the records of the division and
 
02:09:51.550 --> 02:09:51.560 align:start position:0%
the court
 
02:09:55.189 --> 02:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
to follow up with that on that notion
 
02:09:59.450 --> 02:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
alone uh and I'm sure judge Gordon can
 
02:10:01.609 --> 02:10:01.619 align:start position:0%
follow up with this further is with Casa
 
02:10:05.270 --> 02:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
there is a very lack of oversight on
 
02:10:10.189 --> 02:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
Casa themselves there is a lack of admin
 
02:10:13.990 --> 02:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
rulings and there is a lack of uh
 
02:10:17.330 --> 02:10:17.340 align:start position:0%
statues for Casa
 
02:10:20.510 --> 02:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
um they're point blankly in the gal and
 
02:10:25.490 --> 02:10:25.500 align:start position:0%
under the 169 C guidelines is
 
02:10:27.770 --> 02:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
um portions that state that Casa's
 
02:10:31.370 --> 02:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
records are subject to 170 g8a but if
 
02:10:33.890 --> 02:10:33.900 align:start position:0%
you go through 170 g8a nothing regarding
 
02:10:36.169 --> 02:10:36.179 align:start position:0%
Casa is mentioned
 
02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
um so there is some uh statues that are
 
02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:45.320 align:start position:0%
missing uh definitions and guidance
 
02:10:48.530 --> 02:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
and what I've seen is a lot of attorneys
 
02:10:51.470 --> 02:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
and DC wife themselves do not understand
 
02:10:56.290 --> 02:10:56.300 align:start position:0%
what 170 g8a even in titles or entails
 
02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
personally with my experience in my
 
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
matter is ongoing I'm more than welcome
 
02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
to give the case number
 
02:11:02.760 --> 02:11:03.410 align:start position:0%
to give the case number
um

02:11:03.410 --> 02:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:07.550 --> 02:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
but we've been ordered for over a year
 
02:11:10.189 --> 02:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
now for dcyf to turn over all documents
 
02:11:12.910 --> 02:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
all third party documents including
 
02:11:16.490 --> 02:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
restricted access documents
 
02:11:19.970 --> 02:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
with that dcyf is refusing
 
02:11:22.250 --> 02:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
um to follow up into my next point which
 
02:11:24.589 --> 02:11:24.599 align:start position:0%
I will continue at a later time will be
 
02:11:27.950 --> 02:11:27.960 align:start position:0%
that I am currently being violated on my
 
02:11:30.830 --> 02:11:30.840 align:start position:0%
Fifth Amendment right dcyf has requested
 
02:11:33.250 --> 02:11:33.260 align:start position:0%
that I participate in post-conviction
 
02:11:36.589 --> 02:11:36.599 align:start position:0%
therapy and post-conviction therapy is
 
02:11:38.270 --> 02:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
not afforded to me because I'm not even
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
charged with a Criminal crime my case
 
02:11:42.530 --> 02:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
has been going on for three and a half
 
02:11:44.870 --> 02:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
years under the 169 C
 
02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:46.729 align:start position:0%
years under the 169 C
and

02:11:46.729 --> 02:11:46.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
okay good thank you we'll look forward
 
02:11:51.050 --> 02:11:51.060 align:start position:0%
to you coming back and if you have
 
02:11:53.390 --> 02:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
anything for us you can uh you know hand
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
it in send it to the clerk what have you
 
02:11:59.330 --> 02:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:02.450 --> 02:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
yeah yes Mr representative McMahon thank
 
02:12:04.729 --> 02:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman Mr Gilbert Just to be
 
02:12:07.010 --> 02:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
specific the uh directive that you
 
02:12:10.189 --> 02:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
provided here are specific to dcyf and
 
02:12:12.530 --> 02:12:12.540 align:start position:0%
not the family court is that correct no
 
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
they are Family Court uh rsas for abuse
 
02:12:22.629 --> 02:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:27.410 --> 02:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
there was non-compliance by the dcyf not
 
02:12:29.089 --> 02:12:29.099 align:start position:0%
stating there was not compliance or
 
02:12:31.189 --> 02:12:31.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate following the rules that's
 
02:12:35.209 --> 02:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
why we're here with the uh family court
 
02:12:37.250 --> 02:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
you clarified then what what's going
 
02:12:39.709 --> 02:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
down here with your case sure thing so
 
02:12:41.930 --> 02:12:41.940 align:start position:0%
obviously as I'm sure everybody is aware
 
02:12:44.629 --> 02:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
dcyf provides the proposed orders for
 
02:12:46.790 --> 02:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
the judge and the judge kind of just
 
02:12:48.709 --> 02:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
rubber stamps those orders in a sense
 
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
obviously we've had a lot of I have a
 
02:12:54.169 --> 02:12:54.179 align:start position:0%
three-page article from our judge that
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
contradicts what dcyf has claimed um
 
02:13:00.350 --> 02:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
but that being a side uh so basically
 
02:13:03.290 --> 02:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
with that dcyf is proposing these orders
 
02:13:05.390 --> 02:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
that are unconstitutional that do not
 
02:13:07.790 --> 02:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
even comply with their own policies do
 
02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
not comply with 169 C the judges are
 
02:13:13.609 --> 02:13:13.619 align:start position:0%
then you know unbeknownst to them you
 
02:13:15.770 --> 02:13:15.780 align:start position:0%
know a judge's I don't foresee is to
 
02:13:17.750 --> 02:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
know that you know post-conviction
 
02:13:21.350 --> 02:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
therapy is you know what it is in a
 
02:13:24.890 --> 02:13:24.900 align:start position:0%
sense uh under what dcyf is proposing
 
02:13:26.209 --> 02:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
um and obviously it would be a violation
 
02:13:27.890 --> 02:13:27.900 align:start position:0%
of the Fifth Amendment to require
 
02:13:29.810 --> 02:13:29.820 align:start position:0%
somebody to go ahead and provide
 
02:13:32.030 --> 02:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
post-conviction therapy when you're not
 
02:13:32.040 --> 02:13:34.370 align:start position:0%
post-conviction therapy when you're not
convicted

02:13:34.370 --> 02:13:34.380 align:start position:0%
convicted
 
02:13:35.990 --> 02:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much for that
 
02:13:39.770 --> 02:13:39.780 align:start position:0%
clarification anyone else
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you um Mr
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
chair I'm
 
02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to get a little more
 
02:13:48.589 --> 02:13:48.599 align:start position:0%
detail on you being forced to
 
02:13:50.810 --> 02:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
participate in post-conviction therapy
 
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
was that was that a court order that is
 
02:13:56.089 --> 02:13:56.099 align:start position:0%
part of the dispositional orders
 
02:13:58.550 --> 02:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
um for the court correct and if I could
 
02:14:01.850 --> 02:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up is that
 
02:14:04.490 --> 02:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
has their in your experience or
 
02:14:06.649 --> 02:14:06.659 align:start position:0%
experience has this been like a
 
02:14:08.330 --> 02:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
tradition of the court to do this or I
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
guess I'm wondering why why you were a
 
02:14:12.890 --> 02:14:12.900 align:start position:0%
point what the reason was for you to be
 
02:14:14.510 --> 02:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
appointed to this sure thing so
 
02:14:16.669 --> 02:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
obviously the Baseline is a 169 C which
 
02:14:19.010 --> 02:14:19.020 align:start position:0%
is abuse and neglect case uh we won't go
 
02:14:20.689 --> 02:14:20.699 align:start position:0%
into the specifics today
 
02:14:23.689 --> 02:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
um barring the requirements under 170
 
02:14:23.699 --> 02:14:25.189 align:start position:0%
um barring the requirements under 170
g8a

02:14:25.189 --> 02:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
g8a
 
02:14:28.129 --> 02:14:28.139 align:start position:0%
um that being said
 
02:14:30.890 --> 02:14:30.900 align:start position:0%
um so with this I in my research in my
 
02:14:32.810 --> 02:14:32.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh with the office of the
 
02:14:34.910 --> 02:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
child advocate who I hope will testify
 
02:14:37.550 --> 02:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
before this committee at some point
 
02:14:39.770 --> 02:14:39.780 align:start position:0%
um and I would welcome them to commit to
 
02:14:39.780 --> 02:14:41.629 align:start position:0%
um and I would welcome them to commit to
testifying

02:14:41.629 --> 02:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
02:14:45.229 --> 02:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
um that this is the first case that New
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has seen that there is a 169 C
 
02:14:51.530 --> 02:14:51.540 align:start position:0%
for this type of matter that does not
 
02:14:55.370 --> 02:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
have a criminal aspect to it
 
02:14:55.380 --> 02:14:56.330 align:start position:0%
have a criminal aspect to it
um

02:14:56.330 --> 02:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:00.470 --> 02:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
so with that uh we'll go along with my
 
02:15:03.290 --> 02:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
further testimony later on but uh the
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
division is prolonging these cases again
 
02:15:07.850 --> 02:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
this is three and a half years the
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
statutory limit for this type of case is
 
02:15:11.930 --> 02:15:11.940 align:start position:0%
12 months
 
02:15:14.149 --> 02:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
um we're going on three and a half years
 
02:15:18.109 --> 02:15:18.119 align:start position:0%
they're awaiting criminal aspect that is
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
never going to be afforded in the statue
 
02:15:22.189 --> 02:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
of limitations on criminal aspect is 40
 
02:15:22.199 --> 02:15:25.910 align:start position:0%
of limitations on criminal aspect is 40
years

02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:28.609 --> 02:15:28.619 align:start position:0%
representative Macbeth thank you very
 
02:15:31.250 --> 02:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
much thank you I just want to clarify so
 
02:15:34.910 --> 02:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
the 169 you're saying dcyf so they had a
 
02:15:36.770 --> 02:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
finding of abuse is that what you're
 
02:15:38.629 --> 02:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
saying and then but there was no
 
02:15:40.310 --> 02:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
criminal charges and then you're saying
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
the Court Family Court included that
 
02:15:46.430 --> 02:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
finding and kind of found you guilty or
 
02:15:48.770 --> 02:15:48.780 align:start position:0%
of a crime needing the therapy is that
 
02:15:51.169 --> 02:15:51.179 align:start position:0%
kind of how that fell so it's by the
 
02:15:52.729 --> 02:15:52.739 align:start position:0%
preponderance of an Evans which is a
 
02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
belief that something could possibly
 
02:15:57.649 --> 02:15:57.659 align:start position:0%
happen it is not a conviction it is not
 
02:16:00.530 --> 02:16:00.540 align:start position:0%
a finding of guilty it is a belief that
 
02:16:03.050 --> 02:16:03.060 align:start position:0%
by whatever evidence might have been
 
02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
offered there is a belief under a hint
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
of a fraction of whatever that may
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
pertain by the guidelines of the court
 
02:16:14.930 --> 02:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
it's 51 percent uh belief that something
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
possibly could happen
 
02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
are you asserting that what they're
 
02:16:22.129 --> 02:16:22.139 align:start position:0%
making you do should have only come out
 
02:16:23.870 --> 02:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
of a higher standard of evidence than
 
02:16:25.250 --> 02:16:25.260 align:start position:0%
they used
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
correct it's post-conviction therapy
 
02:16:32.150 --> 02:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:33.589 --> 02:16:33.599 align:start position:0%
thank you so much so much for Gilbert
 
02:16:36.290 --> 02:16:36.300 align:start position:0%
thank you and we'll see you soon
 
02:16:38.209 --> 02:16:38.219 align:start position:0%
and the last card we're going to use and
 
02:16:39.770 --> 02:16:39.780 align:start position:0%

02:16:41.750 --> 02:16:41.760 align:start position:0%

right
 
02:16:54.410 --> 02:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
no judge in my entire legal career
 
02:16:57.230 --> 02:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
attempted to say my name when they first
 
02:17:11.389 --> 02:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:11.399 --> 02:17:13.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:17:13.370 --> 02:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:17:16.190 --> 02:17:16.200 align:start position:0%
um start the clock
 
02:17:18.410 --> 02:17:18.420 align:start position:0%
today I'm talking about General stuff
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
and I'm actually surprised that uh
 
02:17:21.120 --> 02:17:22.610 align:start position:0%
and I'm actually surprised that uh
ribson

02:17:22.610 --> 02:17:22.620 align:start position:0%
ribson
 
02:17:25.429 --> 02:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
and former judge Gordon which is what I
 
02:17:27.830 --> 02:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
call him because I was an attorney
 
02:17:31.190 --> 02:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
um we're here testifying because uh
 
02:17:33.530 --> 02:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
about the gal
 
02:17:36.770 --> 02:17:36.780 align:start position:0%
and the dcyf piece of it because
 
02:17:39.169 --> 02:17:39.179 align:start position:0%
part of my
 
02:17:41.870 --> 02:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
written testimony and I only have about
 
02:17:43.969 --> 02:17:43.979 align:start position:0%
six pages of testimony the rest of it
 
02:17:46.250 --> 02:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
are exhibits that support it
 
02:17:48.349 --> 02:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
facts that you want
 
02:17:52.910 --> 02:17:52.920 align:start position:0%
was that ribsum ignored a right to know
 
02:17:56.330 --> 02:17:56.340 align:start position:0%
and uh judge king ignored it's diff it's
 
02:17:57.650 --> 02:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
a little different under the judicial
 
02:17:59.929 --> 02:17:59.939 align:start position:0%
it's a right to know under article eight
 
02:18:02.750 --> 02:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's not under 91a
 
02:18:06.049 --> 02:18:06.059 align:start position:0%
uh just didn't reply
 
02:18:06.059 --> 02:18:07.070 align:start position:0%
uh just didn't reply
um

02:18:07.070 --> 02:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:10.730 --> 02:18:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:13.969 --> 02:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
um one thing you and this is off the top
 
02:18:18.169 --> 02:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
of my head because of uh
 
02:18:20.870 --> 02:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
some testimony from
 
02:18:25.490 --> 02:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
judge Gordon uh casa
 
02:18:25.500 --> 02:18:27.169 align:start position:0%
judge Gordon uh casa
obviously

02:18:27.169 --> 02:18:27.179 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
02:18:29.629 --> 02:18:29.639 align:start position:0%
has Guardians ad litem
 
02:18:29.639 --> 02:18:30.650 align:start position:0%
has Guardians ad litem
in

02:18:30.650 --> 02:18:30.660 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:18:32.570 --> 02:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
the court
 
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
they also have a seat at the guardian ad
 
02:18:37.490 --> 02:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
litem ad litem board
 
02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:38.750 align:start position:0%
litem ad litem board
so

02:18:38.750 --> 02:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:18:42.410 --> 02:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
uh being part of the body that regulates
 
02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:44.270 align:start position:0%
uh being part of the body that regulates
yourself

02:18:44.270 --> 02:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
yourself
 
02:18:47.150 --> 02:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
pretty much guarantees that there aren't
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
going to be any uh discipline problems
 
02:18:53.750 --> 02:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
against you
 
02:18:55.730 --> 02:18:55.740 align:start position:0%
with that I don't know if I'll get
 
02:18:57.410 --> 02:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
through the rest of my five minutes but
 
02:18:59.750 --> 02:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
I'll I do have it written
 
02:19:02.270 --> 02:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh first of all I'm submitting this
 
02:19:05.509 --> 02:19:05.519 align:start position:0%
lengthy written testimony at the end
 
02:19:07.549 --> 02:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
I'm actually surprised I wrote down that
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
few lay people can explain in five
 
02:19:10.969 --> 02:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
minutes a laundry list of how they were
 
02:19:13.849 --> 02:19:13.859 align:start position:0%
wronged and they're doing pretty good
 
02:19:17.209 --> 02:19:17.219 align:start position:0%
some are knowledgeable some are not
 
02:19:17.219 --> 02:19:19.070 align:start position:0%
some are knowledgeable some are not
um

02:19:19.070 --> 02:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:22.310 --> 02:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
another thing the judges okay when you
 
02:19:25.310 --> 02:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
picked up and this is also in my written
 
02:19:26.810 --> 02:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
testimony when you move the Family
 
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
Matters out of Superior Court
 
02:19:30.770 --> 02:19:30.780 align:start position:0%
particularly divorce
 
02:19:32.990 --> 02:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
you moved it from a constitutionally
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
created Court
 
02:19:38.810 --> 02:19:38.820 align:start position:0%
to a statutorily created court and part
 
02:19:40.370 --> 02:19:40.380 align:start position:0%
of what I'm submitting you is the
 
02:19:43.429 --> 02:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case that says judges
 
02:19:46.910 --> 02:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
broad judicial Equity power ends at the
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
courtroom door in a statutorily created
 
02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
court so I all the judges and probably
 
02:19:57.230 --> 02:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
judge Gordon as well
 
02:20:00.310 --> 02:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
we're making some broad Equitable orders
 
02:20:03.590 --> 02:20:03.600 align:start position:0%
such as appointing a commissioner to
 
02:20:06.110 --> 02:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
sell a marital home which they didn't
 
02:20:08.630 --> 02:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
statutorily have the power to do that
 
02:20:12.050 --> 02:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
they they used to it was a very old
 
02:20:15.469 --> 02:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
common law uh right of judges and it
 
02:20:18.290 --> 02:20:18.300 align:start position:0%
could have happened in Superior Court
 
02:20:20.570 --> 02:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
um you know they order a parenting
 
02:20:23.330 --> 02:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
coordinators they all kinds of things
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
that they're making orders on that are
 
02:20:28.010 --> 02:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
flat out illegal and I don't have all
 
02:20:29.570 --> 02:20:29.580 align:start position:0%
the proof in this because otherwise you
 
02:20:31.610 --> 02:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
would have had a stack that high and I
 
02:20:33.170 --> 02:20:33.180 align:start position:0%
had one week to prepare this so you're
 
02:20:34.910 --> 02:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
going to get it a little at a time just
 
02:20:37.670 --> 02:20:37.680 align:start position:0%
the cliff notes right
 
02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:39.429 align:start position:0%
the cliff notes right
um

02:20:39.429 --> 02:20:39.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:42.710 --> 02:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
and the last thing I haven't uh okay
 
02:20:45.889 --> 02:20:45.899 align:start position:0%
also evidence that Gordon McDonald
 
02:20:48.410 --> 02:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
ordered a sign on every court room door
 
02:20:52.190 --> 02:20:52.200 align:start position:0%
in the state about this no recording
 
02:20:55.309 --> 02:20:55.319 align:start position:0%
without the permission of the judge and
 
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not about to ask any judge to
 
02:20:59.510 --> 02:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
exercise a constitutional right so I
 
02:21:01.370 --> 02:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
don't do that
 
02:21:01.380 --> 02:21:02.750 align:start position:0%
don't do that
um

02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:04.730 --> 02:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
he doesn't like me very much because I
 
02:21:07.010 --> 02:21:07.020 align:start position:0%
sent him an email about that ridiculous
 
02:21:07.020 --> 02:21:08.870 align:start position:0%
sent him an email about that ridiculous
order

02:21:08.870 --> 02:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
order
 
02:21:08.880 --> 02:21:11.750 align:start position:0%
order
um

02:21:11.750 --> 02:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:13.790 --> 02:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
the other thing is is statutorily
 
02:21:18.830 --> 02:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
they're the gal is allowed to recommend
 
02:21:21.490 --> 02:21:21.500 align:start position:0%
a therapist
 
02:21:24.590 --> 02:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
uh who the judge will then pick
 
02:21:26.570 --> 02:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
there's going to be later testimony on
 
02:21:28.490 --> 02:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
why it is such a bad idea for judges to
 
02:21:31.670 --> 02:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
pick their own Witnesses in cases and it
 
02:21:34.849 --> 02:21:34.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:37.610 --> 02:21:37.620 align:start position:0%
um and it it really violates people's
 
02:21:39.889 --> 02:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
rights you know I think you've already
 
02:21:41.510 --> 02:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
heard there's a pretty short list of
 
02:21:46.250 --> 02:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
gals there's a shorter list of
 
02:21:48.770 --> 02:21:48.780 align:start position:0%
psychologists that are willing to do
 
02:21:50.809 --> 02:21:50.819 align:start position:0%
these evaluations and the judges are
 
02:21:54.469 --> 02:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
also picking them
 
02:21:54.479 --> 02:21:56.870 align:start position:0%
also picking them
um

02:21:56.870 --> 02:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:59.030 --> 02:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
so anyway
 
02:22:02.150 --> 02:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
um you know they do things all the time
 
02:22:05.510 --> 02:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
like order mediation in the presence of
 
02:22:07.130 --> 02:22:07.140 align:start position:0%
domestic violence
 
02:22:11.570 --> 02:22:11.580 align:start position:0%
I I found the practice was widespread
 
02:22:11.580 --> 02:22:12.469 align:start position:0%
I I found the practice was widespread
um

02:22:12.469 --> 02:22:12.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:14.809 --> 02:22:14.819 align:start position:0%
so I have more they'll be it'll be in
 
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
writing and I'll turn it in
 
02:22:19.490 --> 02:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you so much any questions for the
 
02:22:19.500 --> 02:22:20.570 align:start position:0%
thank you so much any questions for the
counselor

02:22:20.570 --> 02:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
counselor
 
02:22:20.580 --> 02:22:24.130 align:start position:0%
counselor
ready

02:22:24.130 --> 02:22:24.140 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:28.010 --> 02:22:28.020 align:start position:0%
I would especially like to have more and
 
02:22:30.110 --> 02:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
I I don't have to I don't have I know I
 
02:22:32.270 --> 02:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
don't have to beg you for this uh on
 
02:22:34.969 --> 02:22:34.979 align:start position:0%
your assertion about moving when the
 
02:22:36.469 --> 02:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
family court moved from a
 
02:22:39.410 --> 02:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
constitutionally created Court to a
 
02:22:42.889 --> 02:22:42.899 align:start position:0%
statutory court that does not have the
 
02:22:46.070 --> 02:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
right to mandate things beyond the
 
02:22:49.490 --> 02:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
corridor I'd like to explore that so if
 
02:22:51.530 --> 02:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
you can give us proofs New Hampshire
 
02:22:53.809 --> 02:22:53.819 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court opinion is in here
 
02:22:57.170 --> 02:22:57.180 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions
 
02:23:01.550 --> 02:23:01.560 align:start position:0%
may I make one more Point nope
 
02:23:04.250 --> 02:23:04.260 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
and we are have come to the end of today
 
02:23:09.950 --> 02:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's a hearing
 
02:23:11.630 --> 02:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
was anybody on the committee has
 
02:23:13.250 --> 02:23:13.260 align:start position:0%
anything you'd like to
 
02:23:15.290 --> 02:23:15.300 align:start position:0%
input I think we've got a number of
 
02:23:17.349 --> 02:23:17.359 align:start position:0%
different kinds of things we might
 
02:23:19.790 --> 02:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
profitably explore there'll be more
 
02:23:22.670 --> 02:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
evidence and we're siloing maybe I
 
02:23:24.110 --> 02:23:24.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't use that word but we are
 
02:23:27.110 --> 02:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
vertically putting them into folders
 
02:23:30.050 --> 02:23:30.060 align:start position:0%
like oh yeah like those folders so that
 
02:23:32.030 --> 02:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
when somebody comes with something that
 
02:23:35.090 --> 02:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
goes to that point that evidence goes in
 
02:23:36.710 --> 02:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
there so one of these days when it's
 
02:23:38.990 --> 02:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
time to analyze we'll look at them
 
02:23:40.610 --> 02:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
folder at a time
 
02:23:45.110 --> 02:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
so representative um Alexander thank you
 
02:23:47.090 --> 02:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
and I I apologize because I did miss
 
02:23:48.710 --> 02:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
this organization meeting is your
 
02:23:51.230 --> 02:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
intention to do some like listening and
 
02:23:54.410 --> 02:23:54.420 align:start position:0%
then like a day of like talking about it
 
02:23:57.290 --> 02:23:57.300 align:start position:0%
amongst ourselves I want to do enough
 
02:24:01.250 --> 02:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
listening that we get a good sampling
 
02:24:03.230 --> 02:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
under each one of the topics from
 
02:24:05.270 --> 02:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
different people perfect and then maybe
 
02:24:07.309 --> 02:24:07.319 align:start position:0%
over the summer uh there'll be some
 
02:24:09.290 --> 02:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
homework assignments of some Brave
 
02:24:11.690 --> 02:24:11.700 align:start position:0%
volunteers will
 
02:24:11.700 --> 02:24:12.349 align:start position:0%
volunteers will
um

02:24:12.349 --> 02:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:15.950 --> 02:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
read the transcripts of the Court
 
02:24:19.130 --> 02:24:19.140 align:start position:0%
hearings that have been given to us just
 
02:24:22.490 --> 02:24:22.500 align:start position:0%
a slice why do we want to do that do we
 
02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
just believe what people say it's not a
 
02:24:26.330 --> 02:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
matter of that we just want to make sure
 
02:24:29.270 --> 02:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
from our perspective that it if anybody
 
02:24:32.809 --> 02:24:32.819 align:start position:0%
asks we've seen in the court French
 
02:24:35.330 --> 02:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
script what the person said was there I
 
02:24:37.090 --> 02:24:37.100 align:start position:0%
think everybody wants that
 
02:24:40.309 --> 02:24:40.319 align:start position:0%
then I suspect and I'll be talking a lot
 
02:24:42.530 --> 02:24:42.540 align:start position:0%
with my vice chair but there'll be some
 
02:24:44.450 --> 02:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
days when we will go through the
 
02:24:46.910 --> 02:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
different folders of topics and see what
 
02:24:48.889 --> 02:24:48.899 align:start position:0%
happens but we're kind of feeling our
 
02:24:50.990 --> 02:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
way along Madame Vice chair
 
02:24:55.490 --> 02:24:55.500 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um this is all one packet
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair would um
 
02:25:02.750 --> 02:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
you consider it appropriate to ask
 
02:25:05.630 --> 02:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
um OLS perhaps Mr Lambert or someone
 
02:25:09.770 --> 02:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
else to give us a brief
 
02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:11.170 align:start position:0%
else to give us a brief
um

02:25:11.170 --> 02:25:11.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:16.130 --> 02:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
explanation of the issue involving the
 
02:25:19.429 --> 02:25:19.439 align:start position:0%
difference between a constitutional and
 
02:25:21.889 --> 02:25:21.899 align:start position:0%
uh and a constitutionally established
