someone from the majority party in the
 

00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:07.510 align:start position:0%
someone from the majority party in the

00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:11.309 align:start position:0%
should appoint someone from the opposite
party<00:56:10.160><c> and</c><00:56:10.319><c> I</c><00:56:10.400><c> think</c><00:56:10.559><c> it's</c><00:56:10.680><c> important</c><00:56:11.039><c> to</c><00:56:11.160><c> have</c>

00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
party and I think it's important to have
 

00:56:11.319 --> 00:56:13.069 align:start position:0%
party and I think it's important to have
that<00:56:11.480><c> balance</c><00:56:11.839><c> because</c><00:56:12.039><c> in</c><00:56:12.160><c> the</c><00:56:12.319><c> past</c><00:56:12.960><c> that</c>

00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
that balance because in the past that
 

00:56:13.079 --> 00:56:14.390 align:start position:0%
that balance because in the past that
hasn't<00:56:13.359><c> always</c><00:56:13.599><c> been</c><00:56:13.760><c> the</c><00:56:13.880><c> case</c><00:56:14.079><c> we've</c><00:56:14.280><c> had</c>

00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
hasn't always been the case we've had
 

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.750 align:start position:0%
hasn't always been the case we've had
two<00:56:14.599><c> Democrat</c><00:56:15.000><c> members</c><00:56:15.720><c> and</c><00:56:15.880><c> no</c><00:56:16.160><c> Republicans</c>

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
two Democrat members and no Republicans
 

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:18.390 align:start position:0%
two Democrat members and no Republicans
there<00:56:17.160><c> so</c><00:56:17.400><c> having</c><00:56:17.599><c> that</c><00:56:17.760><c> balance</c><00:56:18.079><c> I</c><00:56:18.160><c> think</c><00:56:18.280><c> is</c>

00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
there so having that balance I think is
 

00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:23.910 align:start position:0%
there so having that balance I think is
incredibly<00:56:18.920><c> important</c>

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%

also pertaining to operating um outside
 

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:19.750 align:start position:0%
also pertaining to operating um outside
of<00:59:14.839><c> the</c><00:59:15.000><c> law</c><00:59:15.880><c> yes</c><00:59:16.680><c> so</c><00:59:17.520><c> I</c><00:59:17.720><c> think</c><00:59:18.319><c> that</c><00:59:18.839><c> this</c><00:59:19.640><c> um</c>

00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
of the law yes so I think that this um
 

00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.910 align:start position:0%
of the law yes so I think that this um
RSA<00:59:20.480><c> obviously</c><00:59:20.920><c> was</c><00:59:21.079><c> written</c><00:59:21.400><c> before</c><00:59:21.640><c> we</c><00:59:21.799><c> had</c>

online<00:59:22.880><c> school</c><00:59:23.880><c> and</c><00:59:24.000><c> so</c><00:59:24.160><c> I</c><00:59:24.240><c> think</c><00:59:24.359><c> we</c><00:59:24.480><c> need</c><00:59:24.839><c> to</c>

00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:25.000 align:start position:0%

01:05:17.599 --> 01:05:20.309 align:start position:0%
committee um so I think that if we wait
until<01:05:18.400><c> crossover</c><01:05:19.279><c> I</c><01:05:19.440><c> think</c><01:05:19.680><c> that</c><01:05:19.839><c> strips</c><01:05:20.200><c> us</c>

01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
