been filed um ready for lak um we've
 
00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
noticed that a lot of times um the
 
00:10:05.069 --> 00:10:05.079 align:start position:0%
reports were off
 
00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
topic um we're going to look at the
 
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:11.320 align:start position:0%
application process hoping to revamp
 
00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:15.399 align:start position:0%
that so uh there's a bigger pull to
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
choose from uh of members we're going to
 
00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:20.839 align:start position:0%
look at membership and um most
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
importantly um you know we've noticed
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
even in testimony that right now um the
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
committee is operating outside of the
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
law so we need to uh fix that and uh
 
00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
make sure we're following the
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
law um all right
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
so R popson um would you like to point
 
00:10:48.509 --> 00:10:48.519 align:start position:0%
out um some issues that you saw that uh
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
are right now off topic in regards to
 
00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:53.310 align:start position:0%
are right now off topic in regards to
the

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:53.320 align:start position:0%

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
so trying to find my paperwork well just
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
going off of the
 
00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
RSA um legislative youth advisory
 
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:08.360 align:start position:0%
council is established to examine issues
 
00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
of important to youth such as education
 
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
employment strategies to increase youth
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
participation in local and state
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
government safe environments for youth
 
00:11:19.949 --> 00:11:19.959 align:start position:0%
substance abuse I'm sorry maybe I don't
 
00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:22.600 align:start position:0%
need to go through all that but um I I
 
00:11:27.629 --> 00:11:27.639 align:start position:0%
didn't see uh I I saw a lot
 
00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
of folks focus on social
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
issues uh climate change which is not a
 
00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
problem um but I feel like what they're
 
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
tasked with is looking at um issues that
 
00:11:49.629 --> 00:11:49.639 align:start position:0%
we have statistics on poverty
 
00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
homelessness homelessness I can't say
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
that word today for um emotional and
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
physical health
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:11:59.509 align:start position:0%
physical health
um

00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
so anyway uh I kind of felt like they
 
00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
were off topic I didn't see a lot of
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
reports about that and I don't know if
 
00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
you have input on that Jody being a yeah
 
00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:12.720 align:start position:0%
I are these reports like prior reports
 
00:12:14.829 --> 00:12:14.839 align:start position:0%
that have been thank you for the
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
question do I have to say that no
 
00:12:16.959 --> 00:12:19.990 align:start position:0%
question do I have to say that no
committing

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
okay uh this is my first subcommittee
 
00:12:24.069 --> 00:12:24.079 align:start position:0%
foral Club committee so I don't know
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
thank you um I um I do know that in the
 
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
past that has been um an issue where um
 
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
there were um very partisan committees
 
00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
um this committee um and um has been
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
um um having a diverse amount of topics
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
like what you are talking about um to um
 
00:12:56.670 --> 00:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
research and
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
discuss um if if you may I can um
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
actually bring up on my phone the
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that um these guys are
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
working with now and I think that you'll
 
00:13:10.509 --> 00:13:10.519 align:start position:0%
realize that the topics have been
 
00:13:15.069 --> 00:13:15.079 align:start position:0%
expanded um I agree with you that it
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
really um going forward we need to
 
00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:23.720 align:start position:0%
really concentrate on um those types of
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
issues I so I was thinking of this list
 
00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:30.519 align:start position:0%
that I just found
 
00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
um they broke into interest groups
 
00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
climate action criminal justice
 
00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
education legislative Administration and
 
00:13:43.150 --> 00:13:43.160 align:start position:0%
social justice that to me seems outside
 
00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
of what the RSA indicates they should be
 
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:47.440 align:start position:0%
focused on so I don't know if everybody
 
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
opinion just like to point out to the
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
committee the very first sentence a
 
00:13:58.749 --> 00:13:58.759 align:start position:0%
legislative youth advisory council is a
 
00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
established to examine issues of
 
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:01.720 align:start position:0%
importance to
 
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
youth that's where there should be a
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
period Then There are
 
00:14:09.269 --> 00:14:09.279 align:start position:0%
examples the previous statement examine
 
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
issues of importance to youth opens the
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
door for everything under the sun the
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
others are simply examples it doesn't
 
00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
lock them into doing that so two years
 
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
from now there may be other things they
 
00:14:25.629 --> 00:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
want to talk about that are happening at
 
00:14:27.749 --> 00:14:27.759 align:start position:0%
that time in the world the way it's
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
written right now
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
they have that
 
00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
ability um they're not off topic they
 
00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
topics um Mr TBO I saw you raise your
 
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:56.749 --> 00:14:56.759 align:start position:0%
that um thank you madam chair and
 
00:14:59.030 --> 00:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um for the
 
00:15:00.509 --> 00:15:00.519 align:start position:0%
record my name is James TBO I'm the
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
Youth co-chair of the legislative youth
 
00:15:03.430 --> 00:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
advisory Council serving alongside
 
00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson so I just wanted
 
00:15:06.829 --> 00:15:06.839 align:start position:0%
to say first of all the reports that
 
00:15:08.629 --> 00:15:08.639 align:start position:0%
you're looking at are a couple years old
 
00:15:11.269 --> 00:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
those aren't are no longer are well we
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
call them subcommittees now they're no
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
longer interest groups um but those are
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
outdated we have several more this year
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
that are um and they're more but we're
 
00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199 align:start position:0%
we treat ourselves as nonpartisan we
 
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:23.240 align:start position:0%
don't like getting into partisan
 
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
politics but we also um try to focus
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
more on
 
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.560 align:start position:0%
um issues that are more unifying is and
 
00:15:34.389 --> 00:15:34.399 align:start position:0%
there's been a a really heavy Focus this
 
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
year on education policy and mental
 
00:15:39.150 --> 00:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
health as well and other issues of that
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
nature that are addressed in RSA 19 K1
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
so I I realize we've been outside of the
 
00:15:45.389 --> 00:15:45.399 align:start position:0%
statute in the past and that's something
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
that we've been working to
 
00:15:54.269 --> 00:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:56.360 align:start position:0%
course is there anyone else that would
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you we will make that uh note
 
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
there uh we'd like to talk about the
 
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:22.870 align:start position:0%
there uh we'd like to talk about the
application

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:27.509 align:start position:0%
application
process

00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
um how do we get our pool and how can we
 
00:16:36.269 --> 00:16:36.279 align:start position:0%
um do a better job at making sure that
 
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
uh we're getting a wide variety of
 
00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:44.639 align:start position:0%
applicants I think that um we have in um
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
in our bill um some additions that would
 
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
be very helpful um we um have asked um
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
for additional support from um either uh
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
staff Staffing from the the Senate side
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
or the house side um to help us develop
 
00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.150 align:start position:0%
or the house side um to help us develop
a

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:08.720 align:start position:0%
website to we've also
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
uh James has also had the idea of um
 
00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
making it the responsibility of the
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
Department of AD to disseminate
 
00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
information about the legislative
 
00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:24.160 align:start position:0%
advisory Council to all schools and um
 
00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
um be able to um provide an application
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
to all schools to spread the word I um
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
that it has been a challenge for us this
 
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
year um we've tried our best to um do
 
00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:38.669 align:start position:0%
year um we've tried our best to um do
that

00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
um there's work to be done and we think
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
um you know those two examples and maybe
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
James can elaborate on that would be
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful and being able to
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
provide a bigger app uh a bigger pool of
 
00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:56.919 align:start position:0%
applicants um we also um have a
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
challenge and you can talk about this if
 
00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
you are called upon James um of uh
 
00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
finding University students and we need
 
00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:11.240 align:start position:0%
to tap more into our um
 
00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
university clubs you know um
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
the university Democrats and University
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
Republicans um to have a better um pool
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
to choose from as well do you think it
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
would be worth um just making it High
 
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.110 align:start position:0%
would be worth um just making it High
School

00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
School
 
00:18:32.750 --> 00:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
I do think that it would
 
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:37.080 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to reduce the amount of
 
00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:38.470 align:start position:0%
be beneficial to reduce the amount of
University

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:38.480 align:start position:0%
University
 
00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
students uh however I do see
 
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
um that the University students do
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
provide a certain level of maturity and
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
experience that I think is of value to
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
the entire Council I think that I do
 
00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:00.720 align:start position:0%
think that it's not a good idea to
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
completely eliminate college students
 
00:19:06.149 --> 00:19:06.159 align:start position:0%
and I think the college students also um
 
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:09.159 align:start position:0%
feel um that it brings value to them
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
they're able to um bring um back the
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge and experience that they have
 
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
um gained through the council to their
 
00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
school communities um I think that's
 
00:19:25.549 --> 00:19:25.559 align:start position:0%
very valuable too I do agree though that
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
um we it's difficult number one to find
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
College um to fill all of the college
 
00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:36.440 align:start position:0%
spots and recruiting is difficult it's
 
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
you know it's not as easy as asking the
 
00:19:40.350 --> 00:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
doe to you know disseminate um
 
00:19:42.630 --> 00:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
information about it so I do agree and
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
so is the makeup um does it say how many
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
postsecondary and secondary students uh
 
00:19:56.149 --> 00:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
yes so you would want to um
 
00:19:59.310 --> 00:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
lower the postsecondary use I think so
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
and I think James might be able to
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
provide a little more info on that yes
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
James sure so as of right now there's
 
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
Provisions made for 12 secondary student
 
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:09.880 align:start position:0%
seats and seven um postsecondary student
 
00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
seats so um in the Amendments that I
 
00:20:15.270 --> 00:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
emailed to you all before the hearing um
 
00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
that would be reduced to four and we we
 
00:20:20.950 --> 00:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
do absolutely believe that they provide
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
extraordinary value but they are hard to
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
recruit for because um they just have a
 
00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
lot busier lives than um we do in high
 
00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:30.919 align:start position:0%
school but they do provide tremendous
 
00:20:33.789 --> 00:20:33.799 align:start position:0%
value so um today with us is Rebecca
 
00:20:36.149 --> 00:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
leak one of our members um who attends
 
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
College online with Liberty University
 
00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
and she um is actually a pre-law student
 
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
so she has a lot of experience in this
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
field already and she has a lot of
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
knowledge that she brings to the table
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
that we simply do not have as high
 
00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
schoolers um so that sort of resource is
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
incredibly valuable to us and to take
 
00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
that away I believe would be
 
00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
shortsighted and um most so I'm in
 
00:20:59.070 --> 00:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
communication with I believe five other
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
states legislative youth advisory
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
councils and that's actually a provision
 
00:21:03.909 --> 00:21:03.919 align:start position:0%
that I made in the bill is a mandate to
 
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:07.480 align:start position:0%
communicate with other states um but um
 
00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
in talking with them they
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
seem less focused and they seem to have
 
00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
less experience because they are mostly
 
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
High School groups they're I we are
 
00:21:18.950 --> 00:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
unique in that we are the only liac in
 
00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
the country that I'm aware of that has
 
00:21:22.510 --> 00:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
college students represented and I think
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's incredibly important especially
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
when addressing education
 
00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:28.909 align:start position:0%
when addressing education
issues

00:21:28.909 --> 00:21:28.919 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so if
 
00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960 align:start position:0%
there are no other legislative youth
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
advisory councils in the state who do
 
00:21:39.789 --> 00:21:39.799 align:start position:0%
you look to to communicate with you
 
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:42.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned just a sentence ago that you
 
00:21:44.909 --> 00:21:44.919 align:start position:0%
wanted to reach out to other groups in
 
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:47.480 align:start position:0%
the country a mandate did you say yeah
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
man um so there's a mandate in this bill
 
00:21:52.470 --> 00:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
so it's a as the statute currently reads
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
it says that we are tasked in our duties
 
00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:58.120 align:start position:0%
with communicating it says um it just
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
kind of says other committees it doesn't
 
00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
really clarify what that means okay but
 
00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:04.039 align:start position:0%
I've expanded that to say um hang on let
 
00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
me pull it up yeah so the current
 
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
language is communicate with other
 
00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:10.120 align:start position:0%
councils but I've expanded that to say
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
communicate with other councils and
 
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
committees including but not limited to
 
00:22:14.909 --> 00:22:14.919 align:start position:0%
House and Senate committees the State
 
00:22:16.789 --> 00:22:16.799 align:start position:0%
Board of Education the governor's youth
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
advisory Council on substance misuse and
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
prevention other New Hampshire youth
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
advisory councils as formed um and then
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
other State's youth advisory councils
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
and that would be RSA 19k three
 
00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:32.549 align:start position:0%
and that would be RSA 19k three
paragraph

00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
5 okay thank you of course want a
 
00:22:41.870 --> 00:22:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
that um I also saw that uh you were
 
00:22:46.909 --> 00:22:46.919 align:start position:0%
thinking of having the Department of
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
Education be the ones that do um like
 
00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:53.320 align:start position:0%
reaching out to Public Schools public
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
charter schools how do you plan to reach
 
00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:00.039 align:start position:0%
homeschool groups or private religious
 
00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
schools that's a very uh good point and
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
I would love to have some ideas from
 
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
you uh as far as the private schools for
 
00:23:23.789 --> 00:23:23.799 align:start position:0%
example Catholic schools and all that
 
00:23:23.799 --> 00:23:25.470 align:start position:0%
example Catholic schools and all that
they

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:23:28.549 --> 00:23:28.559 align:start position:0%
still technically come under the deal
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
so the doe when they send something out
 
00:23:34.269 --> 00:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
to uh uh public high schools they can
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
send it out at the same time to uh any
 
00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
of the private high schools that they're
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
that they monitor which is should be all
 
00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:42.720 align:start position:0%
of them the
 
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers there's something on the
 
00:23:48.630 --> 00:23:48.640 align:start position:0%
Internet where they're working back and
 
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
mistaken I I think you're right just
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
because um in my experience with um my
 
00:24:01.149 --> 00:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
children being in public Public School
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
homeschoolers um are um allowed to join
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
um extracurricular activities and sports
 
00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:11.440 align:start position:0%
so there has to be a way that
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
information is
 
00:24:15.390 --> 00:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
communicated um we would just have to
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
find that out for sure so that would
 
00:24:20.149 --> 00:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
probably all fall under the Department
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
of Education then okay yeah um the doe
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
also keeps track of homeschool students
 
00:24:31.110 --> 00:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
um they have to keep um The Homeschool
 
00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
parents have to file a letter of intent
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
and there has to be some goals met along
 
00:24:37.909 --> 00:24:37.919 align:start position:0%
the way so they actually would have
 
00:24:40.149 --> 00:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
access to I think to all students in New
 
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so did you have something say
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
James no okay yes right
 
00:24:50.070 --> 00:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
J back a few moments
 
00:24:53.669 --> 00:24:53.679 align:start position:0%
ago um you said you're having difficulty
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
getting college kids I don't know if you
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
know the answer to this I don't know if
 
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
anybody does is there a uh College young
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
Republicans and young Democrats at say
 
00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
UNH uh at uh Franklin Pierce uh any of
 
00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:14.480 align:start position:0%
the other colleges in the State uh sure
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
I do have connections with the New
 
00:25:17.549 --> 00:25:17.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Federation of college
 
00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
Republicans I I mean I tend to lean more
 
00:25:21.269 --> 00:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
conservative myself to be completely
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
transparent but I'm sure there are other
 
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:25.480 align:start position:0%
people on the council that have those
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
connections with the college Democrats
 
00:25:29.149 --> 00:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
as well and I would be happy to work
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
with both groups to try to get that out
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
reach out because I think it would be
 
00:25:34.149 --> 00:25:34.159 align:start position:0%
incredibly effective and successful to
 
00:25:34.159 --> 00:25:37.549 align:start position:0%
incredibly effective and successful to
do

00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
so what I'm thinking is if uh if those
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
entities were approached they could
 
00:25:49.669 --> 00:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
appoint somebody from their own group uh
 
00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
still go through the application process
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
and all that but they could appoint
 
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:55.640 align:start position:0%
somebody from their group as you know
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
we'd like this one to be on there and if
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
you you're proposing to go down to four
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
post-secondaries if you work to make
 
00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
sure that it is two and
 
00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
two from four different colleges or
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.510 --> 00:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
dandy I actually think that's an
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
interesting idea because I know um I
 
00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.480 align:start position:0%
reached out to the college Republicans
 
00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:24.399 align:start position:0%
and I think that you did too and did you
 
00:26:24.399 --> 00:26:25.710 align:start position:0%
and I think that you did too and did you
or

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:26:29.269 --> 00:26:29.279 align:start position:0%
did um and I mean they're great um and
 
00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
and and very nice people and um willing
 
00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
to um you know help out um but I think
 
00:26:39.870 --> 00:26:39.880 align:start position:0%
if there's buyin to that that they um
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
would be more willing to be like
 
00:26:43.669 --> 00:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
cooperative and in trying to find
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
applicants you know so thank you I think
 
00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
that's a good
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
suggestion yes James now would that mean
 
00:26:53.909 --> 00:26:53.919 align:start position:0%
um that every single College SE would
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
have to be filled by one of those two
 
00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
groups because um I I feel like there
 
00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
should be opportunity for because right
 
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
now it adds the provision or the the as
 
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
it's currently written in law it can be
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
anyone um for 15 to 22 who is either in
 
00:27:12.149 --> 00:27:12.159 align:start position:0%
college or um in the workforce if
 
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
they're in the workforce they can't be
 
00:27:15.909 --> 00:27:15.919 align:start position:0%
represented by college Republicans or
 
00:27:19.269 --> 00:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
college Democrats or college
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
yeah that's
 
00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.549 align:start position:0%
yeah that's
a

00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
yeah or like even career schools as well
 
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
because they they wouldn't have because
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
right now it says um RSA 19 K2 um
 
00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
postsecondary students or postsecondary
 
00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
youth May attend a two or four year New
 
00:27:45.710 --> 00:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire College University private
 
00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
postsecondary career school or other New
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire training or education program
 
00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:51.399 align:start position:0%
or be a member of the New Hampshire
 
00:27:53.669 --> 00:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
Workforce and we were looking to expand
 
00:27:55.509 --> 00:27:55.519 align:start position:0%
that further actually in the Amendments
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
that I sent out because we have students
 
00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:00.640 align:start position:0%
like Rebecca who attend online school
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
with a school that is technically not in
 
00:28:03.789 --> 00:28:03.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire College because she
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
attends with Liberty University which is
 
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
based out of Virginia so technically
 
00:28:09.149 --> 00:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
she's in like a legal gray area because
 
00:28:10.509 --> 00:28:10.519 align:start position:0%
she's a New Hampshire student because
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
she lives here but she doesn't attend a
 
00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire College to right so she
 
00:28:17.470 --> 00:28:17.480 align:start position:0%
right now you're currently operating
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
outside of the law so that's why it's
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
important to um exactly well we didn't
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
realize that at the time when she was
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
appointed by I believe speaker Packard
 
00:28:27.070 --> 00:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
um we only realize that after the fact
 
00:28:28.389 --> 00:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
right but that's why we're looking to
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.399 --> 00:29:03.549 align:start position:0%
 
absolutely

00:29:03.549 --> 00:29:03.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:16.350 --> 00:29:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:18.389 --> 00:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely good
 
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919 align:start position:0%
morning mson did you want to ask a
 
00:29:23.269 --> 00:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
question thank good morning I just
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to find out uh what brought you
 
00:29:27.430 --> 00:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
to the legislative youth advisory
 
00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
Council and um what has your experience
 
00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:31.960 align:start position:0%
been and do you have any recommendations
 
00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
as a college student um so I heard about
 
00:29:36.789 --> 00:29:36.799 align:start position:0%
lak from a friend of mine who he heard
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
about it from his State reps so um I
 
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
honestly almost didn't apply because I
 
00:29:45.669 --> 00:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
did read the statute and I like I'm not
 
00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:47.480 align:start position:0%
certain I actually fit into these
 
00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:49.399 align:start position:0%
categories but I went ahead and applied
 
00:29:55.070 --> 00:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
anyway and so was appointed um so not
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
sure what else here how's your
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
experience been it's been incredible uh
 
00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:02.120 align:start position:0%
I've learned so much and it's been great
 
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
to be able to see more deeply into how
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
our laws are um written and passed and
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
been able to have some sort of voice in
 
00:30:13.029 --> 00:30:13.039 align:start position:0%
that and also been able to meet so many
 
00:30:14.509 --> 00:30:14.519 align:start position:0%
other young people that I would have
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
never been able to meet and discuss
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:23.789 --> 00:30:23.799 align:start position:0%
them I had another question for you um
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
what what value do you believe the
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
college student perspective
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
provides um as James said I think uh
 
00:30:33.549 --> 00:30:33.559 align:start position:0%
college students are a little older so
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
they do have a little bit more hopefully
 
00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:37.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit more maturity um like you
 
00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
said I personally have drawn on my legal
 
00:30:43.830 --> 00:30:43.840 align:start position:0%
and governmental courses from college in
 
00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:47.840 align:start position:0%
my um work in lak looking at issues and
 
00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:52.360 align:start position:0%
discussing issues um so I I do think
 
00:30:54.669 --> 00:30:54.679 align:start position:0%
they add a good deal to the committee
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.909 --> 00:31:04.919 align:start position:0%
rep Nelson do you find that um you're
 
00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:07.720 align:start position:0%
unable to fill all the positions right
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
now or do you have so many applications
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
that a lot of them aren't even yes we we
 
00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:19.120 align:start position:0%
are um having difficulty um particularly
 
00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:21.480 align:start position:0%
again in the postsecondary
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
applicants so it's just that area uh
 
00:31:26.159 --> 00:31:29.389 align:start position:0%
applicants so it's just that area uh
James

00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:31.269 --> 00:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
sure I have a I have a spreadsheet of
 
00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:33.320 align:start position:0%
all of our vacancies and members as well
 
00:31:36.350 --> 00:31:36.360 align:start position:0%
as our applicants so for Reference last
 
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
year we had 41 applicants this year we
 
00:31:45.509 --> 00:31:45.519 align:start position:0%
had 12 12 and that was just enough to
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
fill all of our secondary vacancies
 
00:31:49.629 --> 00:31:49.639 align:start position:0%
because we had a lot of seniors leaving
 
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:52.120 align:start position:0%
last year as well as um students who
 
00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
kind of went MIA um and there was a
 
00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
provision in the in the law that says
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
after three meetings they or three
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
absences consecutively they are removed
 
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
from the council um so we removed them
 
00:32:04.909 --> 00:32:04.919 align:start position:0%
and replaced them with actual committed
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
members um and as of right now we
 
00:32:14.950 --> 00:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
have a um three postsecondary
 
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:19.240 align:start position:0%
vacancies and two secondary vacancies um
 
00:32:23.629 --> 00:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
and a couple of those or the
 
00:32:26.389 --> 00:32:26.399 align:start position:0%
postsecondary vacancy one of them um is
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
with the secretary State's office and
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
that issue has kind of cropped up um
 
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
because um his Deputy um informed us
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
that she would not appoint anyone to the
 
00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
council who did not go directly to the
 
00:32:41.549 --> 00:32:41.559 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office requesting
 
00:32:43.629 --> 00:32:43.639 align:start position:0%
appointment so anyone who applies
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
through our application that we send
 
00:32:47.629 --> 00:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
them because we solicit and then send
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
them out um because that's just the most
 
00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080 align:start position:0%
effective way to go about
 
00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:54.080 align:start position:0%
advertising um anyone we send she will
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
she said she will not appoint and so for
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
that that's why we wanted to have the
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
application process codified into law is
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
because then we have one application we
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
send out all the applications to all of
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
the app pointers they coordinate with
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
each other to make the appointments and
 
00:33:10.269 --> 00:33:10.279 align:start position:0%
then they just get sent out around the
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
same time and that will make it far more
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
effective and will prevent stuff like
 
00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:15.279 align:start position:0%
this from happening where we have
 
00:33:17.470 --> 00:33:17.480 align:start position:0%
vacancies that we literally can't fill
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
because they don't want to or they don't
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
know to go to the Secretary of State's
 
00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
office rather than um through our
 
00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:28.080 align:start position:0%
application that we already have
 
00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
do you think that it would be um better
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
system if there was the appointments
 
00:33:37.389 --> 00:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
coming from
 
00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:40.720 align:start position:0%
one uh like just say what if all the
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
appointments came from the speaker of
 
00:33:43.909 --> 00:33:43.919 align:start position:0%
the house yes I think that would be
 
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
great if there was one Central um
 
00:33:49.549 --> 00:33:49.559 align:start position:0%
appointing uh location or person point
 
00:33:54.830 --> 00:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
person uh to James credit um he um tried
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
to contact UM
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
somebody who was um one of The
 
00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:02.919 align:start position:0%
Originators of the bill to find out what
 
00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:06.360 align:start position:0%
the intent was um by having the
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
different um folks appoint um the people
 
00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
and and he was unable to get an answer
 
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
despite his repeated uh requests um so
 
00:34:19.869 --> 00:34:19.879 align:start position:0%
you know I I think that our intent
 
00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:23.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be to say we don't like your
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
help and we app we it's not that we
 
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
don't appreciate you but the process is
 
00:34:31.629 --> 00:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
very honorous and very um frustrating um
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
and James has done a very good T job of
 
00:34:38.190 --> 00:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
um keeping up and following up with the
 
00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:40.839 align:start position:0%
various folks that are who are the app
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
pointers um so but it's difficult and I
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
agree um having one Central um person do
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
it so all the applications would go to
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
the speaker and he would make the
 
00:34:56.589 --> 00:34:56.599 align:start position:0%
appointments and um I know that there
 
00:34:59.630 --> 00:34:59.640 align:start position:0%
was some concern that if the
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
appointments didn't come from different
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
bodies then maybe you wouldn't have the
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
access to say this to the senate or to
 
00:35:10.349 --> 00:35:10.359 align:start position:0%
the governors
 
00:35:12.589 --> 00:35:12.599 align:start position:0%
but if
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
um if just the Speaker of the House
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
handled the
 
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
appointments and you would still have
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
access to those other bodies through
 
00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:25.640 align:start position:0%
legislation that you're following yes
 
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
um yes yes yes um my
 
00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:32.310 align:start position:0%
um yes yes yes um my
only

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:32.320 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:36.040 align:start position:0%
concern uh and maybe we can address this
 
00:35:39.109 --> 00:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
um with an amendment is
 
00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
that our goal this year was to have a
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
almost as equal of a mix of um political
 
00:35:53.870 --> 00:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
ideologies as we could because our goal
 
00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
um one of our personal goals my personal
 
00:36:00.349 --> 00:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
goal goal and James also shares it is
 
00:36:03.870 --> 00:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
that we need to facilitate young people
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
to be able to get together and express
 
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
their own opinions and ideas and have
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
respect for other people's opinions and
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
ideas and uh I think that's very needed
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
right now in our um society and if we
 
00:36:25.150 --> 00:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
can encourage that in a healthy manner
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
with these young people I think I think
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
they'll be really great well-rounded
 
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
leaders I I'm confident all these I call
 
00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
them kids I'm sorry guys all these young
 
00:36:35.829 --> 00:36:35.839 align:start position:0%
people are going to be be really great
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
leaders so um that would be my only
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
concern about having one point person
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
you know um and in the application
 
00:36:46.349 --> 00:36:46.359 align:start position:0%
process versus an appointment process um
 
00:36:48.309 --> 00:36:48.319 align:start position:0%
you know we don't you know you can kind
 
00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
of like discern through you know their
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
extra curricular activities and um you
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
know an essay that they might write you
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
know where where they kind of lean you
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
know one way or another um it's it
 
00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't be um you know a deal
 
00:37:05.309 --> 00:37:05.319 align:start position:0%
breaker as to you know why we may or may
 
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
not you know think about appointing
 
00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
someone but that would be my concern um
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
you know if we have a speaker who wants
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
to have an entirely partisan I mean one
 
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
way or another I'm not picking on you
 
00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:21.800 align:start position:0%
know Republican or Democrat um group
 
00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:25.400 align:start position:0%
that that is not going to be
 
00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
um what the goal of lak should be I
 
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:31.960 align:start position:0%
guess is my sure and I would I would
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
agree with representative Nelson on all
 
00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:35.280 align:start position:0%
of those points and I would also say
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
that having multiple app
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
pointers reduces The Strain on each of
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
the appointer um because then they don't
 
00:37:44.349 --> 00:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
have to make all of these different
 
00:37:45.910 --> 00:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
appointments I mean the speaker of the
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
house I've been in communication with
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
his office trying to get a new
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
appointment made and it's been a couple
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
months now just because he's so busy I
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
mean he has like 400 commissions and
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
committees and councils to appoint to
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
it's a lot for just him so having it
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
split up also helps with that and I
 
00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
think that there is some value to having
 
00:38:07.309 --> 00:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
multiple app pointers and also the the
 
00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
partisan mix that can come with that
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
being you know four different people and
 
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
maybe four is too much but I think it
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
should be like at least maybe the
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
speaker and the Senate President or
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
something like that absolutely yes rep
 
00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
Nelson an idea just popped into my head
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
um maybe um in order to Aid um the
 
00:38:29.349 --> 00:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
speaker could be a um a nominating
 
00:38:34.190 --> 00:38:34.200 align:start position:0%
committee consisting of um one or two
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
people from um each side of the aisle
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
that could assist the speaker in
 
00:38:44.069 --> 00:38:44.079 align:start position:0%
recommending um
 
00:38:48.190 --> 00:38:48.200 align:start position:0%
applicants or as we're talking about
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
maybe having the youngest member of the
 
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
majority party the youngest member of
 
00:38:56.109 --> 00:38:56.119 align:start position:0%
the minority party um would they be able
 
00:38:58.990 --> 00:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
to ass oh yeah yeah yeah they could be
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
able to parse through that yeah rip tuny
 
00:39:04.829 --> 00:39:04.839 align:start position:0%
if you want to really keep it simple all
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
the applicants could be given a number
 
00:39:09.069 --> 00:39:09.079 align:start position:0%
as their application comes in those
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
numbers are put into a fishbowl and you
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
make it real
 
00:39:13.790 --> 00:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
quick and you
 
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
let uh make the
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
choices very very simple you will get
 
00:39:23.390 --> 00:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
maybe sometimes you will get a right
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
leaning viac sometimes you may get a
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
left leaning one but odds are you're
 
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
going to get a
 
00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
fairly midlin one I don't think that's
 
00:39:36.109 --> 00:39:36.119 align:start position:0%
very fair because it doesn't um it's not
 
00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
a merit-based system it's not a system
 
00:39:40.349 --> 00:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
that accounts for a student who may be
 
00:39:42.109 --> 00:39:42.119 align:start position:0%
very well experienced and have that sort
 
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
of already legislative experience that's
 
00:39:47.109 --> 00:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
going to contribute to membership on lak
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
and you might have some kids who are
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
just in it for the resumé building and
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
who don't actually care getting
 
00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
appointed and you're absolutely right
 
00:39:57.790 --> 00:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
and one thing to consider as a
 
00:40:00.109 --> 00:40:00.119 align:start position:0%
legislator that's exactly what your
 
00:40:03.630 --> 00:40:03.640 align:start position:0%
constituents will be from all over the
 
00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:06.200 align:start position:0%
place some will be interested some won't
 
00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
some will vote their pocket book some
 
00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.200 align:start position:0%
won't that's no offense that's the real
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
world that's the way it really is and
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
yes you may want all gung-ho people in
 
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:19.720 align:start position:0%
there at the beginning but you also want
 
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
the one that sits back every now and
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
then their light bulb goes off and they
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
pop up with a very good idea fair enough
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.550 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:40:46.069 --> 00:40:46.079 align:start position:0%
um oh yes did you
 
00:40:48.990 --> 00:40:49.000 align:start position:0%
have so
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
um representative McDonald and
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative Williams did you have
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
anything any input on any of these
 
00:41:01.109 --> 00:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.790 --> 00:41:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:10.030 --> 00:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
work uh not particularly although I'd
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
say I think it might be a good idea to
 
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
have one appointer just because I think
 
00:41:17.790 --> 00:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
that might streamline the process um and
 
00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
you know with the appointment system as
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
it is right now there could be and is a
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
Republican Senate President a republican
 
00:41:26.829 --> 00:41:26.839 align:start position:0%
governor and a Republican Speaker of the
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
House who you know might want to appoint
 
00:41:31.309 --> 00:41:31.319 align:start position:0%
I mean so I think that concern exists
 
00:41:33.069 --> 00:41:33.079 align:start position:0%
whether or not there's one appointer or
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
multiple app pointers um I met Jessica I
 
00:41:39.750 --> 00:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
came into this thinking you know oh we
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
should have less postsecondary people on
 
00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
the committee but after talking to
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
Rebecca excuse me um I do feel that
 
00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
postsecondary people have a place on the
 
00:41:55.589 --> 00:41:55.599 align:start position:0%
committee and and are uh you know could
 
00:41:58.190 --> 00:41:58.200 align:start position:0%
help the committee in an interesting way
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
um I guess it's just how we Outreach to
 
00:42:04.630 --> 00:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
to the schools and and get people to
 
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
want to be involved so I i' I'd add you
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
know getting
 
00:42:12.309 --> 00:42:12.319 align:start position:0%
people having the council do meetings at
 
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
the different schools or getting people
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
like Valerie and I to go there or
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
something like that and talk about uh
 
00:42:20.190 --> 00:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
lak and and what it could do you know
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
just sort of advertising L and trying to
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
get people to to know what it is and
 
00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:27.960 align:start position:0%
want to do it
 
00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:29.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Valerie
 
00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:32.839 align:start position:0%
McDonald Rockingham 25 for the record
 
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
and I would have to agree with a lot of
 
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:36.520 align:start position:0%
what my colleagues said I think it is
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
important that the nominations come from
 
00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:42.319 align:start position:0%
a central place so it can be streamlined
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
I know there was a mention as a website
 
00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
and the website could explain exactly
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
where prospective applicants need to go
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's the speaker or another
 
00:42:53.309 --> 00:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
nominating body I also think there is a
 
00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
value in the postsecondary members as
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
one of the members here today has stated
 
00:43:00.309 --> 00:43:00.319 align:start position:0%
their own value and what they contribute
 
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
as a college student and that uh is
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
unique to New Hampshire as for my
 
00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that the other legislative
 
00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
youth advisory councils in other states
 
00:43:12.270 --> 00:43:12.280 align:start position:0%
are limited to just high school students
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire has benefited from not
 
00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:16.559 align:start position:0%
having that limitation as far as I am
 
00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
aware and as for the idea of the
 
00:43:20.710 --> 00:43:20.720 align:start position:0%
nominating committee to make that
 
00:43:22.870 --> 00:43:22.880 align:start position:0%
bipartisan I think that there is some
 
00:43:25.109 --> 00:43:25.119 align:start position:0%
value in that idea as well because as
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative wheer mentioned there is
 
00:43:29.549 --> 00:43:29.559 align:start position:0%
right now a partisan balance in
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
leadership and to ensure that this is
 
00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
not a partisan group because the
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
intention is to Encompass all youth
 
00:43:38.750 --> 00:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
viewpoints to really be reflective of
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
the younger generation that we need to
 
00:43:43.510 --> 00:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
not have that partisan split so if there
 
00:43:45.309 --> 00:43:45.319 align:start position:0%
were to be a nominating committee
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps with younger legislators I think
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
we would be both open to that idea and
 
00:43:53.870 --> 00:43:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking for our
 
00:43:58.109 --> 00:43:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:00.430 --> 00:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
hello I just have a couple questions for
 
00:44:03.150 --> 00:44:03.160 align:start position:0%
you and before we get started I
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
just I'm just incredibly impressed by
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
the two of you when you speak at the
 
00:44:09.870 --> 00:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
well you are always so
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
thoughtful and um thank you for serving
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
because when I was your age the last
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
thing that I was interested in was what
 
00:44:22.109 --> 00:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
you are doing and I really I mean I I
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
think you guys are fabulous so I wanted
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
to say that first of all um I do think
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
the idea of having
 
00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
um young uh representatives from uh you
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
know one from each side is of value
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
certainly um I know myself um coming in
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
as a freshman when I was in my
 
00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.150 align:start position:0%
as a freshman when I was in my
50s

00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
50s
 
00:44:52.349 --> 00:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
um with all of my life experience it was
 
00:44:55.349 --> 00:44:55.359 align:start position:0%
still very overwhelming to be a freshman
 
00:44:59.430 --> 00:44:59.440 align:start position:0%
so I want this to be a I want it to be a
 
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
positive experience for um the
 
00:45:05.150 --> 00:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
legislative co-chairs as well as the
 
00:45:07.390 --> 00:45:07.400 align:start position:0%
youth um who are participating in this
 
00:45:11.230 --> 00:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
Council so um wondering um what your
 
00:45:14.910 --> 00:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
thoughts would be on how um how the
 
00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.230 align:start position:0%
thoughts would be on how um how the
youth

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
youth
 
00:45:19.309 --> 00:45:19.319 align:start position:0%
co-chairs uh the legislative co-chairs
 
00:45:22.750 --> 00:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
um what your thoughts on managing your
 
00:45:27.390 --> 00:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
time um and what um support do you think
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
would be valuable to be provided to you
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
co-chairs thank you for the question
 
00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson and I think it is
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
valuable I know I for one certainly
 
00:45:47.309 --> 00:45:47.319 align:start position:0%
learn from my more experienced
 
00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
colleagues every day when I am in the
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
chamber and to perhaps have someone such
 
00:45:55.109 --> 00:45:55.119 align:start position:0%
as yourself as the legislative co-chair
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
in addition to to the two younger
 
00:45:59.549 --> 00:45:59.559 align:start position:0%
members could be an idea yeah that's
 
00:46:01.069 --> 00:46:01.079 align:start position:0%
something that we did discuss having
 
00:46:03.270 --> 00:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
like a tri chair yeah position with the
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
two youngest and uh like a more seasoned
 
00:46:08.829 --> 00:46:08.839 align:start position:0%
legislator like U like almost like an
 
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:12.720 align:start position:0%
advisory role yeah yeah I think that's
 
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
sounds great absolutely yeah I just add
 
00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:17.960 align:start position:0%
I think it'd be a good thing for the
 
00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:19.559 align:start position:0%
young legislators Valerie and I were
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
talking in the representative McDonald
 
00:46:24.910 --> 00:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
and I were talking in the hall um about
 
00:46:27.030 --> 00:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
experience and how you know if you're a
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
young legislator a freshman you don't
 
00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:31.000 align:start position:0%
often get the chance to chair a
 
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
committee or or even one of those
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittees you know representative
 
00:46:37.549 --> 00:46:37.559 align:start position:0%
McDonald and I are uh we are on busy
 
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:38.839 align:start position:0%
committees that get a lot of
 
00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:40.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and work sessions and
 
00:46:41.829 --> 00:46:41.839 align:start position:0%
stuff like
 
00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
that as freshman as young freshman we
 
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
don't always get picked to be the chair
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
of those subcommittees and I think that
 
00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:51.400 align:start position:0%
chairing a subcommittee for a freshman
 
00:46:53.870 --> 00:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
and I've talked to representative Manion
 
00:46:56.069 --> 00:46:56.079 align:start position:0%
and other people about this um that's an
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
important educational piece to sort of
 
00:47:00.710 --> 00:47:00.720 align:start position:0%
understanding the legislative process
 
00:47:03.430 --> 00:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
and knowing how to hold respect as a
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
chair and and and do those things so I
 
00:47:07.349 --> 00:47:07.359 align:start position:0%
think it could be definitely beneficial
 
00:47:08.790 --> 00:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
for the younger members of the
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
legislature just as a system in general
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
to to offer them uh the chance to chair
 
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
the lak committee and and get them some
 
00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:18.880 align:start position:0%
experience and involved in the
 
00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
legislature more so than than the two of
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
us already are very good point thank you
 
00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:27.710 align:start position:0%
us already are very good point thank you
you

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um one
 
00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:34.440 align:start position:0%
in uh one of the Amendments that's been
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
proposed it would be not a freshman it
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
would be a sophomore so somebody at
 
00:47:41.829 --> 00:47:41.839 align:start position:0%
least in their second term
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
and do you feel you need it would be
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
better to have a TR chair or should
 
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
there just be somebody who's been uh in
 
00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:53.670 align:start position:0%
there just be somebody who's been uh in
the

00:47:53.670 --> 00:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
house uh for let's say they're on a
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
fourth term or a fifth term as the
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
advisor the one who will know uh all the
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
ways of various Bill moves and what
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
moves you can't make and what routs
 
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
you've got to be to be the advisor and
 
00:48:14.349 --> 00:48:14.359 align:start position:0%
should that person be a voting member or
 
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
member uh you know I think it having an
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
older member as an advisory member would
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
be a good thing and and just because uh
 
00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:29.960 align:start position:0%
it is the liac I think it would be a
 
00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:31.480 align:start position:0%
good thing to have them as an advisory
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
member just to make sure things stay on
 
00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:35.960 align:start position:0%
track that we comply with the RSA as
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's set out um and sort of leaving it
 
00:48:42.270 --> 00:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
to the young people to uh participate in
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
the committee itself but having that
 
00:48:46.549 --> 00:48:46.559 align:start position:0%
sort of crutch there as a fourth or
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:54.470 --> 00:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
on you rip nting Wong did you have
 
00:48:57.069 --> 00:48:57.079 align:start position:0%
anything to add
 
00:48:59.670 --> 00:48:59.680 align:start position:0%
um not necessarily um I just saw that
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
the two youngest members would be on
 
00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:02.760 align:start position:0%
there and I was a little nervous just
 
00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
because um you know you're leading a new
 
00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:06.549 align:start position:0%
because um you know you're leading a new
group

00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
of people to like through the process
 
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
you might not necessarily know what it
 
00:49:13.470 --> 00:49:13.480 align:start position:0%
is you two are incredibly knowledgeable
 
00:49:15.309 --> 00:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
but I'm afraid of like the next class
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
you know like eventually you're going to
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
get someone who might not be as
 
00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable or not as willing to go up
 
00:49:21.069 --> 00:49:21.079 align:start position:0%
to the well to figure out what the
 
00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:23.680 align:start position:0%
process is um so that was the only thing
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
that made me nervous but well I I think
 
00:49:29.430 --> 00:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
if I could in response to that that's
 
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
that's kind of my idea around having us
 
00:49:33.990 --> 00:49:34.000 align:start position:0%
as chairs because you know like you said
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
we are are involved with the process
 
00:49:37.990 --> 00:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
we're on two busy committees so we get
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
sort we've been thrown into the fire um
 
00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
but as some you know not every younger
 
00:49:45.309 --> 00:49:45.319 align:start position:0%
member might be thrown into the fire
 
00:49:47.309 --> 00:49:47.319 align:start position:0%
they might be a working member someone
 
00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
like that who just sort of is on fishing
 
00:49:51.549 --> 00:49:51.559 align:start position:0%
game doesn't participate as much I think
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
this could be a good thing for them if
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
they were to be that you know younger
 
00:49:58.109 --> 00:49:58.119 align:start position:0%
freshman because then it sort of gets
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
them involved in the process gets them
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
you know they don't have to go up to the
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
well but they can still speak as chair
 
00:50:05.710 --> 00:50:05.720 align:start position:0%
they can understand the process of I
 
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
think it would level out their anxieties
 
00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:10.559 align:start position:0%
about being a representative a little
 
00:50:11.870 --> 00:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
bit more if they were able to chair a
 
00:50:14.589 --> 00:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
committee like lak that dealt with those
 
00:50:16.150 --> 00:50:16.160 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
issues yeah and I definitely understand
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
the benefit to that member but I'm like
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
afraid of what the members of the
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee will have to do
 
00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.559 align:start position:0%
not necessarily deal with but if they
 
00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:31.280 align:start position:0%
don't know when like how a committee
 
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:34.520 align:start position:0%
goes because they're just the first
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
time I think was just my concern but I'm
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with it either way I'm not
 
00:50:42.990 --> 00:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
gonna say no just pointing it out I do
 
00:50:44.549 --> 00:50:44.559 align:start position:0%
think that you have a valid point that
 
00:50:47.190 --> 00:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
was one thing that I had been uh also um
 
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
um what happens if the youngest people
 
00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:56.240 align:start position:0%
um don't want to do it
 
00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:58.799 align:start position:0%
right and if they feel forced to do it
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
um is there a way out you know of that
 
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
um if I
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
may perhaps in the statutory language it
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
could say the youngest member or their
 
00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:13.079 align:start position:0%
design and that would leave it open if
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
the member was not willing to at least
 
00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:17.559 align:start position:0%
from my experience I was unaware that I
 
00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
was the youngest member prior to
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
assuming the role so I I could picture
 
00:51:25.549 --> 00:51:25.559 align:start position:0%
that there would be the next youngest
 
00:51:28.109 --> 00:51:28.119 align:start position:0%
member thrown into that not realizing
 
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
they have another Duty and they may not
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
be wanting to or unprepared to and in
 
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:35.160 align:start position:0%
that case could be a designate I think
 
00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:37.160 align:start position:0%
the youngest member or should be the
 
00:51:38.910 --> 00:51:38.920 align:start position:0%
first choice and then if they're
 
00:51:40.829 --> 00:51:40.839 align:start position:0%
unavailable maybe another person is
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
appointed in the statute could explain
 
00:51:43.789 --> 00:51:43.799 align:start position:0%
that as
 
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
well or make it the youngest member
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
accept versus the youngest member
 
00:51:54.990 --> 00:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
designate it be youngest me member
 
00:51:57.069 --> 00:51:57.079 align:start position:0%
willing to accept that would be it but
 
00:52:00.309 --> 00:52:00.319 align:start position:0%
as far as the other question that
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh you asked concerning the
 
00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh if we didn't have these
 
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
two on as the
 
00:52:14.549 --> 00:52:14.559 align:start position:0%
sophomores um that would be the uh role
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
then for the advisor to fill in and
 
00:52:21.230 --> 00:52:21.240 align:start position:0%
guide to folks that let's say just
 
00:52:24.270 --> 00:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
weren't up to this bar they were at a
 
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
slightly lower one to uh take over and
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
uh handle things until two co-chairs at
 
00:52:34.829 --> 00:52:34.839 align:start position:0%
that time started to step
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
up and that's the idea of the TR chair
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
right well not so much Tri TR chair
 
00:52:50.309 --> 00:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.240 --> 00:53:00.270 align:start position:0%
 
mentor

00:53:00.270 --> 00:53:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.670 --> 00:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
anything else on this subject yes I just
 
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to um ask and what people's
 
00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
thoughts were and also give my input on
 
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
I know that
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
um there has been um discussion about um
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
do we think that a sen the Senate member
 
00:53:21.510 --> 00:53:21.520 align:start position:0%
the non- voting Senate member is of
 
00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
value or not of value to this committee
 
00:53:29.549 --> 00:53:29.559 align:start position:0%
um I would suggest having a senate
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
member be also in an in an advisory role
 
00:53:35.750 --> 00:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
I know that one we have spoken as a
 
00:53:39.950 --> 00:53:39.960 align:start position:0%
group we find Value in having a senator
 
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
be in an advisory type of role because
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
the young people are very interested in
 
00:53:48.230 --> 00:53:48.240 align:start position:0%
Senate bills as well as house bills and
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
that person is a valuable source of
 
00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
information on the bills and when
 
00:53:55.750 --> 00:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to be heard and
 
00:53:58.789 --> 00:53:58.799 align:start position:0%
um so without that piece I think that
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
this group is um going to be missing an
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
important piece of the pie of
 
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
understanding and being able to provide
 
00:54:13.589 --> 00:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
process I fully agree with that and
 
00:54:20.710 --> 00:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
especially since you seem to have now a
 
00:54:25.750 --> 00:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh Senator that is very interested in it
 
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
if you can keep that
 
00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
individual if if that individual would
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
volunteer for the next uh two years that
 
00:54:36.630 --> 00:54:36.640 align:start position:0%
would be uh good but yes a senator
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
should be on
 
00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
it and I don't think the Senate
 
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
President needs to appoint somebody
 
00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:44.990 align:start position:0%
President needs to appoint somebody
other

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
than the Senate member but they don't
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
have to appoint the kids pardon me but
 
00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:54.200 align:start position:0%
anybody between 14 and 22 I have
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
grandchildren that age age they're kids
 
00:54:56.559 --> 00:54:57.510 align:start position:0%
grandchildren that age age they're kids
I'm

00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:55:00.870 --> 00:55:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:03.160 align:start position:0%
offense um
 
00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
I I have I just have to say this is um I
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
really enjoy the time spent with this
 
00:55:12.190 --> 00:55:12.200 align:start position:0%
Senator because we're both hockey moms
 
00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
and there's
 
00:55:18.670 --> 00:55:18.680 align:start position:0%
a a kinship with another hockey mom that
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's it's hard to find so anyway she's
 
00:55:23.549 --> 00:55:23.559 align:start position:0%
great I really and and I think she's
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
she's a very warm individual
 
00:55:28.029 --> 00:55:28.039 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:55:30.870 --> 00:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
she's uh also a Democrat so I think it's
 
00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:33.400 align:start position:0%
a good U mix between the two of us you
 
00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:35.549 align:start position:0%
a good U mix between the two of us you
know

00:55:35.549 --> 00:55:35.559 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
so great um is there anything else that
 
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
you two would like to
 
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
add no for your thank thank you um James
 
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
speak sure I just wanted to follow up on
 
00:55:54.309 --> 00:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
what representative Nelson just said
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
regarding the part of cens ship aspect
 
00:55:58.190 --> 00:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
um that's something that I included in
 
00:55:59.870 --> 00:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
my amendments is that I think there
 
00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
should be if we have it appointed from
 
00:56:04.750 --> 00:56:04.760 align:start position:0%
the house um the speaker should appoint
 
00:56:06.230 --> 00:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
someone from the majority party in the
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
house and then the Senate President
 
00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
should appoint someone from the opposite
 
00:56:11.309 --> 00:56:11.319 align:start position:0%
party and I think it's important to have
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
that balance because in the past that
 
00:56:14.390 --> 00:56:14.400 align:start position:0%
hasn't always been the case we've had
 
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
two Democrat members and no Republicans
 
00:56:18.390 --> 00:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
there so having that balance I think is
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.870 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:56:25.870 --> 00:56:25.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
question for you you said earlier in
 
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:30.950 align:start position:0%
question for you you said earlier in
your

00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:34.640 align:start position:0%
testimony that uh you've got vacancies
 
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
right now that you haven't been able to
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
fill yet in your Amendment you're
 
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
looking to expand the
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
size of the commission yes um so I can
 
00:56:51.069 --> 00:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
question I got for you basically is do
 
00:56:51.079 --> 00:56:51.990 align:start position:0%
question I got for you basically is do
you

00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:56:58.029 --> 00:56:58.039 align:start position:0%
need that size 2 to to uh 20 what uh uh
 
00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
for the younger folks 20 of them uh or
 
00:57:03.349 --> 00:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
could you've got what I think he said
 
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
four vacancies would 16 work would there
 
00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
be enough people in your opinion for the
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
discussion to be worthwhile so I will
 
00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
say that we have applicants for those
 
00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:15.760 align:start position:0%
positions we're just working through the
 
00:57:17.430 --> 00:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
process to get them appointed again
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
session is happening so it's a a lot a
 
00:57:22.750 --> 00:57:22.760 align:start position:0%
much longer timeline than was pre
 
00:57:26.349 --> 00:57:26.359 align:start position:0%
session um but um in terms of expanding
 
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
the size of the council we are and we
 
00:57:30.589 --> 00:57:30.599 align:start position:0%
aren't so we're not adding any new
 
00:57:33.150 --> 00:57:33.160 align:start position:0%
voting members we're adding one member
 
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
from the governor's youth advisory
 
00:57:36.029 --> 00:57:36.039 align:start position:0%
Council on substance misuse and
 
00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:38.160 align:start position:0%
prevention to act as a liaison between
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
the two councils because they are they
 
00:57:42.029 --> 00:57:42.039 align:start position:0%
work a lot more with the executive
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
branch they don't have the legislative
 
00:57:45.150 --> 00:57:45.160 align:start position:0%
experience that we do so they would Ben
 
00:57:48.029 --> 00:57:48.039 align:start position:0%
and I serve on both councils so I know
 
00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:49.160 align:start position:0%
that they would benefit from the
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
experience that lak can provide and I
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
know that lak would provide or would
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
benefit from a lot of the knowled and
 
00:57:56.829 --> 00:57:56.839 align:start position:0%
experience on the issue of substance
 
00:57:58.630 --> 00:57:58.640 align:start position:0%
misuse and prevention that the
 
00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
governor's Council can provide so that's
 
00:58:02.589 --> 00:58:02.599 align:start position:0%
more just to ensure that the two
 
00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
councils can communicate with each other
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
and in my amendment I also included um
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
it says any youth advisory Council
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
established by executive order in case
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
um whoever the next Governor is decides
 
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:16.280 align:start position:0%
to abolish that Council but may create a
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
new one so it provides that that option
 
00:58:21.069 --> 00:58:21.079 align:start position:0%
in that that future
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
proofing excuse
 
00:58:27.470 --> 00:58:27.480 align:start position:0%
me okay and the liais on that should be
 
00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:29.559 align:start position:0%
an appointment by the governor since
 
00:58:33.190 --> 00:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
it's his Council he should do that one
 
00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:36.440 align:start position:0%
appointment yes and that's um and it
 
00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
also says elected by the membership of
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
the council so the governor's Council
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
can select their own design but then the
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.119 --> 00:58:51.589 align:start position:0%
 
y

00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:54.390 --> 00:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
can hi it's a little off top well it's
 
00:58:57.069 --> 00:58:57.079 align:start position:0%
on on topic but it's a little off topic
 
00:58:59.309 --> 00:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
to exactly what we're speaking about but
 
00:59:03.109 --> 00:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
um would it be okay if we just um spoke
 
00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
again about um the college applicants
 
00:59:08.510 --> 00:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
there are two things that I wanted to
 
00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
address about that and it also um it's
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
also pertaining to operating um outside
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
of the law yes so I think that this um
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
RSA obviously was written before we had
 
00:59:24.990 --> 00:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
online school and so I think we need to
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
make a change um that says you know that
 
00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
reflects what Rebecca's situation is you
 
00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
know a New Hampshire
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
resident um going to school you know
 
00:59:42.150 --> 00:59:42.160 align:start position:0%
being a um I I think the intent was that
 
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.240 align:start position:0%
that the kids are here right so they're
 
00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:49.400 align:start position:0%
not going to be um a student at
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
Georgetown and only coming here for two
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
or three meetings right so I think that
 
00:59:55.230 --> 00:59:55.240 align:start position:0%
was the intent if
 
00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.069 align:start position:0%
was the intent if
you

00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:59:59.470 --> 00:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
know of of the originate original
 
01:00:04.029 --> 01:00:04.039 align:start position:0%
language so we have um I think that we
 
01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
should um rewrite the language a little
 
01:00:10.710 --> 01:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
bit to um make somebody in Rebecca's
 
01:00:14.150 --> 01:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
legal agreed that should be done but
 
01:00:22.829 --> 01:00:22.839 align:start position:0%
don't limited to that uh day students uh
 
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
I've got no idea how many colleges might
 
01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
be close to the Vermont New Hampshire
 
01:00:29.589 --> 01:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts New Hampshire Maine New
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire border but if there are days
 
01:00:34.109 --> 01:00:34.119 align:start position:0%
students that cross over go to school
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
there but are home basically every night
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
they should be able to do it just as
 
01:00:42.270 --> 01:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
much as the online uh students can
 
01:00:44.069 --> 01:00:44.079 align:start position:0%
because they're still basically still
 
01:00:45.630 --> 01:00:45.640 align:start position:0%
living here in the state I think we have
 
01:00:47.589 --> 01:00:47.599 align:start position:0%
a residency requirement they have to be
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
residents of New Hampshire yeah that's
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
what I was
 
01:00:54.990 --> 01:00:55.000 align:start position:0%
wondering resident res yeah just as just
 
01:00:56.190 --> 01:00:56.200 align:start position:0%
as long as they're residents of New
 
01:00:58.789 --> 01:00:58.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they can be taking courses
 
01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:01.640 align:start position:0%
online or over the Border yeah yeah I
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
agree yes thank you I think that's a
 
01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:05.610 align:start position:0%
really good point and then also
 
01:01:05.610 --> 01:01:08.710 align:start position:0%
really good point and then also

01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't remember so it wasn't that
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
important so so in the amendment
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
language I wrote I wrote um youth
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%

okay and um James thank you for um you
 
01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:20.680 align:start position:0%
know as we know um we received this um
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
bill from OSS that came in a way that we
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
are not used to um work work with and
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
James actually did
 
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:31.480 align:start position:0%
um did bold and italicize um additions
 
01:02:33.670 --> 01:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
and I really appreciate the hard work
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
that he did um to do that that's made it
 
01:02:38.789 --> 01:02:38.799 align:start position:0%
easier for me and I I've been working
 
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:41.920 align:start position:0%
with this bill so I imagine that it's
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
really difficult for you guys to discern
 
01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
what's what's new and what's not so
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah could I just um go into
 
01:02:52.470 --> 01:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
this topic real quick I'd like to know
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
um how you identify the lsrs and the
 
01:02:58.870 --> 01:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
bills of interest um does the whole
 
01:03:02.109 --> 01:03:02.119 align:start position:0%
committee look you know look over the
 
01:03:04.829 --> 01:03:04.839 align:start position:0%
lsrs and and see which ones are of
 
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
interest to your Council or how do you
 
01:03:10.589 --> 01:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
go about doing that sure yeah that's
 
01:03:13.109 --> 01:03:13.119 align:start position:0%
something that we do um do we go through
 
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
once the lsrs come out we go through the
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
list and we just add them to a
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet and then we just start
 
01:03:19.029 --> 01:03:19.039 align:start position:0%
following them from there we reach out
 
01:03:20.789 --> 01:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
to sponsors try to get information on
 
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
them as the lsrs come out um but we also
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
and then of course we determine if we
 
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
want to continue to pursue those bills
 
01:03:31.109 --> 01:03:31.119 align:start position:0%
after the bill text has been released um
 
01:03:32.710 --> 01:03:32.720 align:start position:0%
because you know an LSR title doesn't
 
01:03:37.829 --> 01:03:37.839 align:start position:0%
exactly tell you that much um um but so
 
01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
like we identify okay these are the
 
01:03:41.069 --> 01:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
issues of Interest this is what we're
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
going to establish our subcommittees
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
around based on you know where the
 
01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:47.640 align:start position:0%
clusters of topics are and then we
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
determine once the bill text comes out
 
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
okay these are the Bills we're actually
 
01:03:53.190 --> 01:03:53.200 align:start position:0%
going to pursue and so the LSR just kind
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
of give us a good idea of what our
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
starting point for the year is going to
 
01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
be yes I think it's also important to
 
01:04:03.190 --> 01:04:03.200 align:start position:0%
point out that um each individual on the
 
01:04:05.069 --> 01:04:05.079 align:start position:0%
council has a say and what they are
 
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
interested in so um it's not just one or
 
01:04:11.269 --> 01:04:11.279 align:start position:0%
two people in the group deciding um each
 
01:04:14.230 --> 01:04:14.240 align:start position:0%
person gives input on um lsrs and then
 
01:04:17.150 --> 01:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
bills that they want to um investigate
 
01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:19.160 align:start position:0%
more um so every person on the committee
 
01:04:21.950 --> 01:04:21.960 align:start position:0%
has a say on what they're um researching
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:30.630 --> 01:04:30.640 align:start position:0%
okay um is there any Merit to um just
 
01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
doing a broad sweep over L lsrs and then
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
delve more deeply into them after they
 
01:04:39.430 --> 01:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
go to the second Branch like because a
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
lot of times bills go through one body
 
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:46.960 align:start position:0%
and they never make it past crossover is
 
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
there any Merit in just looking at
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
things broadly and then really delving
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
into them when they get to the second
 
01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:56.240 align:start position:0%
body uh I don't think so I think one of
 
01:04:58.349 --> 01:04:58.359 align:start position:0%
the things that we focus a lot on in lak
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
is making recommendations to the
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
Committees on whether or not we think a
 
01:05:05.789 --> 01:05:05.799 align:start position:0%
bill should be OTP or itl and ideally I
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
mean the um you know in theory the they
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
there that should have some Merit and I
 
01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
think there's absolutely Merit to the
 
01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:14.480 align:start position:0%
experience of testifying before a
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
committee um so I think that if we wait
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
until crossover I think that strips us
 
01:05:23.549 --> 01:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
of a lot of what we can do from January
 
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:25.640 align:start position:0%
to like April ail which is like nearly
 
01:05:28.109 --> 01:05:28.119 align:start position:0%
half our Council year so I don't I don't
 
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
think there's any Merit to that to be
 
01:05:33.630 --> 01:05:33.640 align:start position:0%
honest with you thank you thank you
 
01:05:36.029 --> 01:05:36.039 align:start position:0%
yeah so can you tell me what your
 
01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
process is to decide what bills to
 
01:05:43.230 --> 01:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
testify on do you guys take a vote on
 
01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
particular bills and who decides who
 
01:05:48.349 --> 01:05:48.359 align:start position:0%
speaks on a bill sure I can walk you
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
through that um so one um at the
 
01:05:52.750 --> 01:05:52.760 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year we selected all of
 
01:05:55.549 --> 01:05:55.559 align:start position:0%
the lsrs we were interested in and then
 
01:05:57.549 --> 01:05:57.559 align:start position:0%
um we created subcommittees and those
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittees meet over Zoom um we
 
01:06:01.630 --> 01:06:01.640 align:start position:0%
discuss what bills that we like or
 
01:06:03.349 --> 01:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
dislike and then those subcommittees
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
vote on um whether or not we want to
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
recommend those bills OTP or itl and
 
01:06:10.109 --> 01:06:10.119 align:start position:0%
then those recommendations get drafted
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
by someone in the subcommittee and then
 
01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
brought to the entire Council we vote on
 
01:06:17.510 --> 01:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
the recommendation and if the
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
recommendation passes then whoever
 
01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:23.359 align:start position:0%
authors that um statement can um choose
 
01:06:25.589 --> 01:06:25.599 align:start position:0%
to testify if they want to um and that
 
01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
of course depends on their own schedule
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
and if not we can always send someone
 
01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:30.680 align:start position:0%
else who might be interested but they
 
01:06:32.349 --> 01:06:32.359 align:start position:0%
don't have to testify and if not we just
 
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:34.200 align:start position:0%
send the statement to the committee
 
01:06:36.510 --> 01:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
chair and the members of the committee
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
um and um if the or or if the statement
 
01:06:42.589 --> 01:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
fails we then redraft a new one based on
 
01:06:45.390 --> 01:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
whatever motion is made in its
 
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
place that um how would you decide say
 
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
you have a split committee is everything
 
01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
that you testify on a unanimous decision
 
01:06:57.870 --> 01:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
ision or um if it's you've got you know
 
01:07:00.430 --> 01:07:00.440 align:start position:0%
so if it's split um the minority can
 
01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240 align:start position:0%
choose to write a Minority Report which
 
01:07:05.390 --> 01:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
will be sent along with the um committee
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
statement or the council statement um
 
01:07:08.870 --> 01:07:08.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have to but they can choose
 
01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
to so if they choose not to then the um
 
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
then it goes to the committee without
 
01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
um just ask this because it's really
 
01:07:29.870 --> 01:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
so I saw the testimony come in I also
 
01:07:33.069 --> 01:07:33.079 align:start position:0%
saw in the statements um a a committee
 
01:07:37.510 --> 01:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
report or a Minority Report um with your
 
01:07:39.990 --> 01:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
testimony if there was a Minority Report
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
would it have come in with that um to
 
01:07:46.109 --> 01:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
the to the committee which HB 1080 the
 
01:07:47.470 --> 01:07:47.480 align:start position:0%
statement on that I don't remember which
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
particular bill it was but I did see a
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
Minority Report and I'm wondering so
 
01:07:54.269 --> 01:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
what does the committee at the house get
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
does it get both of those saw testimony
 
01:07:59.710 --> 01:07:59.720 align:start position:0%
it should get it should get both um
 
01:08:01.069 --> 01:08:01.079 align:start position:0%
granted what you have in front of you
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
like I said is older so and that was at
 
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
a time when the council was more
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
ideologically skewed and I was not in
 
01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
leadership at the time so I do not know
 
01:08:12.510 --> 01:08:12.520 align:start position:0%
I do not know exactly what they were
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
sending to the
 
01:08:17.630 --> 01:08:17.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:21.269 --> 01:08:21.279 align:start position:0%
course this question is basically to the
 
01:08:25.749 --> 01:08:25.759 align:start position:0%
committee are we drafting an arm sa to
 
01:08:30.590 --> 01:08:30.600 align:start position:0%
figure out how to get the people onto it
 
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
um if there should be any
 
01:08:35.950 --> 01:08:35.960 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh what their duties
 
01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
are or are we going to try to
 
01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
micromanage it and tell them this is how
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
you will operate because that I don't
 
01:08:45.950 --> 01:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
think we should do we shouldn't tell
 
01:08:47.269 --> 01:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
them how to
 
01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
operate that's what the adviser the
 
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:53.560 align:start position:0%
mentor should be somewhat guiding but it
 
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
actually actually should be the younger
 
01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
folks figuring out how the system works
 
01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
and what the rules are and then proceed
 
01:09:07.789 --> 01:09:07.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
statute taken yes I agree um the intent
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
of our
 
01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
amendment was really to create a
 
01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
framework and a guideline to pass the
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
torch to the next advisory Council um so
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
there's a consistency and you know we
 
01:09:28.950 --> 01:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
like we talked about um quite frankly
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
there was a breakdown in the council and
 
01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
we really um we really had to have a
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
period of rebuilding so it it's
 
01:09:41.950 --> 01:09:41.960 align:start position:0%
important to us to like we said have
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
this certain
 
01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
framework um
 
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
to set the next Council up for Success
 
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
um but I 100% agree with you that's the
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
way that it is run now um and I would
 
01:09:56.669 --> 01:09:56.679 align:start position:0%
like to have it continued that way too
 
01:09:59.310 --> 01:09:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
your yes and to that point I think it is
 
01:10:04.350 --> 01:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely the first two it's about
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
application and it's about creating a
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
new structure because there is there are
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
new additions to it um that I think are
 
01:10:13.189 --> 01:10:13.199 align:start position:0%
very important such as and especially in
 
01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:15.280 align:start position:0%
the Amendments that I drafted providing
 
01:10:17.229 --> 01:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
high school credit for um High School
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
members allowing for or saying
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
explicitly that the legislative co-chair
 
01:10:24.750 --> 01:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
will draft um letter of excusal so those
 
01:10:26.470 --> 01:10:26.480 align:start position:0%
absences don't count against the student
 
01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
to encourage them to come um staff
 
01:10:30.510 --> 01:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
assistance from the Speaker of The
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
house's office or the president of the
 
01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
Senate um to you know set up video
 
01:10:38.229 --> 01:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
conferencing or um meeting scheduling or
 
01:10:39.910 --> 01:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
a website as representative Nelson
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
alluded to earlier um members of lak on
 
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education many other
 
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
states have um students on their state
 
01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
boards of Education New Hampshire does
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
not at the moment even though we have a
 
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:53.400 align:start position:0%
statutory requirement for students to be
 
01:10:55.390 --> 01:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
on all the local school boards so this
 
01:10:57.790 --> 01:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
would be a very easy way to integrate
 
01:11:00.910 --> 01:11:00.920 align:start position:0%
students onto the State Board of Ed um
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
and um as well as adding structure in
 
01:11:05.070 --> 01:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
other ways like explaining what our
 
01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
annual seminar is supposed to be by
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
saying it includes a tour of the state
 
01:11:11.430 --> 01:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
house and guidelines on the uh on
 
01:11:12.910 --> 01:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
parliamentary procedure that sort of
 
01:11:16.510 --> 01:11:16.520 align:start position:0%
thing and explaining um the subcommittee
 
01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
process in legislation um so that they
 
01:11:22.430 --> 01:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
they um future committees know what to
 
01:11:25.630 --> 01:11:25.640 align:start position:0%
do um and so this is really a bill
 
01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
that's just meant to make future chairs
 
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
lives easier future members lives easier
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
and it has the support of the council as
 
01:11:35.550 --> 01:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
it currently stands as well and that's
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.310 --> 01:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
Nelson student members on local school
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
boards are you saying that's in this one
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
now or that's currently law that there
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
have to be oh yeah that's current law
 
01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
that was passed I believe last year the
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
year before
 
01:11:57.229 --> 01:11:57.239 align:start position:0%
um um but yes so every local school
 
01:11:59.550 --> 01:11:59.560 align:start position:0%
board must have a student member and
 
01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
that but so this would all this adds is
 
01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:04.520 align:start position:0%
says that two lak members would serve as
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
student representatives to the State
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
Board of head is that an
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
elected um member or is an a an advisory
 
01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:15.080 align:start position:0%
member because I won't tell you the
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
youngest person on our school board but
 
01:12:22.229 --> 01:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
they're definitely not in high school so
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
so that in that case
 
01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
um um just uh I our student
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
um member on the school board obviously
 
01:12:36.070 --> 01:12:36.080 align:start position:0%
is a non- voting member they are
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
appointed by no their school no so no
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay so this is actually something I've
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
been researching because I'm drafting a
 
01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:46.840 align:start position:0%
bill on this exact topic right now um
 
01:12:47.910 --> 01:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
because you know this is what I do with
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
my free
 
01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
time um so yeah shocker I know um but
 
01:12:57.350 --> 01:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
but no um so as it it's currently
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
written student um government
 
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
organizations are are supposed to be the
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
ones to draft the rules for um students
 
01:13:08.950 --> 01:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
to elect their student member so but
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately that is very inconsistent
 
01:13:14.830 --> 01:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
among districts because they just um
 
01:13:16.189 --> 01:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
don't really care enough they're not
 
01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
aware of it and the fact that your
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
school board does not have a student
 
01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
member means that they are currently in
 
01:13:22.790 --> 01:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
violation of Statute because they're
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
probably just not that it's statutory um
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
so it is supposed to be an elected
 
01:13:31.030 --> 01:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
member from the um by the students and
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be um a non- voting
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
well since you're knowledgeable on this
 
01:13:41.229 --> 01:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
okay non-
 
01:13:41.239 --> 01:13:43.030 align:start position:0%
okay non-
voting

01:13:43.030 --> 01:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
voting
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
non-pb in or out non-public out yeah so
 
01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
it um okay yeah so anything excluded
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
okay yeah um I can give you the statute
 
01:14:04.830 --> 01:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
or the the RSA real quick I have it up
 
01:14:09.669 --> 01:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
um hang on um somewhere I've
 
01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
been RSA
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.070 align:start position:0%
 
f

01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
f
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
of course I have a question um on the
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
change you made for age requirements yes
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh it currently is um 15 but you want to
 
01:14:38.669 --> 01:14:38.679 align:start position:0%
bring it down to 14 why is that um there
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
are a lot of um freshman and younger
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
sophomores in high school that would be
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
interested in lak but are currently
 
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
excluded so this would widen the net a
 
01:14:47.790 --> 01:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
little bit and it would give them an
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get involved at a younger
 
01:14:51.510 --> 01:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
age and I think that's an incredibly
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
good thing if they want to
 
01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.229 align:start position:0%
good thing if they want to
thank

01:14:56.229 --> 01:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:14:58.750 --> 01:14:58.760 align:start position:0%
you question not necessarily for you
 
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
James but for
 
01:15:03.270 --> 01:15:03.280 align:start position:0%
us you wanted educ you suggested
 
01:15:06.189 --> 01:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
education credits for being on
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
liac I don't think that's within our
 
01:15:11.070 --> 01:15:11.080 align:start position:0%
purview I think that has to come out of
 
01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
doe not telling them you must give
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
credits you can consider it if you think
 
01:15:19.390 --> 01:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
it fills a
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
bill so um how it's current so how I
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
draft the amendment is it says the
 
01:15:25.910 --> 01:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
office of the commissioner of Education
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
shall develop a framework to allow for
 
01:15:30.070 --> 01:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
membership on the council or any other
 
01:15:31.629 --> 01:15:31.639 align:start position:0%
youth advisory Council under the state
 
01:15:33.310 --> 01:15:33.320 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to be considered for
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
high school credit and volunteer hours
 
01:15:36.990 --> 01:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
in public public charter and private
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
secondary schools including fulfillment
 
01:15:40.510 --> 01:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
of deific education graduation
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
requirement so it says it would just
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
develop a framework to allow for that to
 
01:15:45.390 --> 01:15:45.400 align:start position:0%
happen that does not mean that the
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
schools necessarily have to adopt it
 
01:15:51.149 --> 01:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:57.709 --> 01:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
try are there any other
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
additional information you'd want us
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
to talk about today so as representative
 
01:16:22.350 --> 01:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
Tierney pointed out that as the
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
Amendments I wrote are currently written
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
I did include sophomore members because
 
01:16:26.430 --> 01:16:26.440 align:start position:0%
that there was a concern about that
 
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
experience piece but we can I I would
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
honestly after hearing Representatives
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
wheeler and McDonald speak I would
 
01:16:35.070 --> 01:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
encourage striking that and making it
 
01:16:36.629 --> 01:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
just the youngest members or the
 
01:16:38.669 --> 01:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
youngest willing members um I think that
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
makes a lot of a lot more sense um and I
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
would also say that having the um third
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
advisory member as I also have in this
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
on in these amendments as I was thinking
 
01:16:54.270 --> 01:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
about would be very Val valuable um
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
Senate member absolutely critical um I
 
01:16:58.990 --> 01:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
would not support striking that and I
 
01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
would also point out just so everyone is
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
aware because I feel like there was a
 
01:17:04.510 --> 01:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit of confusion earlier
 
01:17:06.149 --> 01:17:06.159 align:start position:0%
the legislative members do not hold a
 
01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
vote on lak except currently with
 
01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson serving as the
 
01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
legislative co-chair she holds a vote um
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
and this is in our rules this isn't in
 
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
statute she holds a vote only when
 
01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:19.040 align:start position:0%
there's a tie so she can be a tiebreaker
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
and that's what we would um and that's
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
something that we all voted to approve
 
01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
um in our because it says in the statute
 
01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:27.719 align:start position:0%
that we can't establish our own rules
 
01:17:30.189 --> 01:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
beyond the statute okay so the advisor
 
01:17:33.189 --> 01:17:33.199 align:start position:0%
is the one that breaks the the
 
01:17:36.910 --> 01:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
tie you're remember yep okay y so she's
 
01:17:38.350 --> 01:17:38.360 align:start position:0%
the legislative co-chair serving
 
01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
alongside me as Youth co-chair and how I
 
01:17:43.229 --> 01:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
currently have it written in this
 
01:17:47.430 --> 01:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
version of the bill is the majority the
 
01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
youngest um member from the majority
 
01:17:52.750 --> 01:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
party would get the tiebreaking vote um
 
01:17:55.669 --> 01:17:55.679 align:start position:0%
okay yeah all
 
01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
right okay now I'm having a more senior
 
01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
moment than you uh I've got to remember
 
01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
what the heck I wanted to bring up I
 
01:18:07.430 --> 01:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
disagreed with one of the things you
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:16.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.709 align:start position:0%
um
okay

01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:20.950 --> 01:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
um let
 
01:18:24.189 --> 01:18:24.199 align:start position:0%
me oh yeah I would also point out that
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
in both versions of the bill both the
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
amended version and what's currently
 
01:18:29.229 --> 01:18:29.239 align:start position:0%
introduced if there are not enough
 
01:18:30.510 --> 01:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
applications to fill either the
 
01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
secondary or postsecondary vacancies
 
01:18:36.229 --> 01:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
then um they can be then members can be
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
appointed regardless of their
 
01:18:40.189 --> 01:18:40.199 align:start position:0%
post-secondary or secondary
 
01:18:42.430 --> 01:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
status okay
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
Tony can you repeat not what you just
 
01:18:47.030 --> 01:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
said but what you said in your previous
 
01:18:48.870 --> 01:18:48.880 align:start position:0%
statement just at the beginning because
 
01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's where I had the regarding the
 
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
voting power of of the legislative
 
01:18:58.830 --> 01:18:58.840 align:start position:0%
members no it was uh that last statement
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
beforehand I know it was right at the
 
01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:03.040 align:start position:0%
beginning of it too I said that I
 
01:19:04.189 --> 01:19:04.199 align:start position:0%
believe I said that representative
 
01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
Nelson holds a tiebreaking vote in the
 
01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
case of a tie earlier much earlier it's
 
01:19:12.510 --> 01:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
generous of you to assume that my memory
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
is that good earlier we were talking
 
01:19:18.110 --> 01:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
about dropping the age from 15 to 14 I
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
think that that was the immediate last
 
01:19:21.830 --> 01:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
thing I
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:32.149 --> 01:19:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.629 --> 01:19:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:59.229 align:start position:0%
 
wow

01:19:59.229 --> 01:19:59.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:04.510 --> 01:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's how it goes isn't it um
 
01:20:07.830 --> 01:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
um but I oh yeah there there is one
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
section so it says um the officers shall
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
make appointments that Foster Geographic
 
01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
and socioeconomic diversity that's how
 
01:20:16.030 --> 01:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
the statute currently reads we struck
 
01:20:17.790 --> 01:20:17.800 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic and replaced it with
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
ideological um because you know we can
 
01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
measure ideological diversity a lot
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
easier that we can measure socioeconomic
 
01:20:26.189 --> 01:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
diversity right we don't ask people what
 
01:20:29.229 --> 01:20:29.239 align:start position:0%
their parents incomes are yeah it was
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
weird that that was there in the first
 
01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:33.560 align:start position:0%
place one thing I'd like to add in there
 
01:20:37.030 --> 01:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
is that a member must come as long as
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
there are applicants from each
 
01:20:42.830 --> 01:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
County yeah so we there should be and
 
01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
that should be in the statute so that
 
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:46.440 align:start position:0%
they can't all be no I no offense to
 
01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
anybody that's south of The Notches
 
01:20:52.669 --> 01:20:52.679 align:start position:0%
but uh other than when the secret
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State said hey there's
 
01:20:57.910 --> 01:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
nobody from the North Country yeah no I
 
01:20:59.390 --> 01:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
I totally agree and I think there
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely needs to be Geographic
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
diversity in statute and it's I mean it
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
says it but clarifying that language a
 
01:21:07.910 --> 01:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
bit more but um I think the big issue is
 
01:21:09.310 --> 01:21:09.320 align:start position:0%
finding those members and that's where
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
we're struggling right now so I believe
 
01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
it was representative wheeler who
 
01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned it earlier um the idea of
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
having um meetings outside of the State
 
01:21:21.390 --> 01:21:21.400 align:start position:0%
House outside of the lob and trying to
 
01:21:23.550 --> 01:21:23.560 align:start position:0%
like take it on the road if you and have
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
meetings in other places and that's
 
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
something that we are trying to do for
 
01:21:29.430 --> 01:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
the rest of this Council year so next
 
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:31.320 align:start position:0%
month we're trying to have a public
 
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
forum on mental health education and
 
01:21:36.149 --> 01:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
suicide prevention in schools we're
 
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
looking at Pinkerton Academy or St
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
hansam college for that um but we're
 
01:21:43.310 --> 01:21:43.320 align:start position:0%
also looking um in the future you know
 
01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
April May June July having more of those
 
01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
more North
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
facing uh as we don't have a budget that
 
01:21:54.990 --> 01:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
is one of our challenges um one of our
 
01:21:58.510 --> 01:21:58.520 align:start position:0%
um College folks looked into um UNH
 
01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
donating a room for that purpose and
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
they wanted to charge us
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
$800 so um that is one of our challenges
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
um we certainly um aren't focusing on um
 
01:22:11.910 --> 01:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
having a location in Southern New
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um but um we're looking for a
 
01:22:17.470 --> 01:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
place that will actually donate room
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
um suggest talk to Plymouth State yeah
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
I've and also talk to uh
 
01:22:32.350 --> 01:22:32.360 align:start position:0%
wmcc up in Berlin White Mountains
 
01:22:32.360 --> 01:22:33.390 align:start position:0%
wmcc up in Berlin White Mountains
Community

01:22:33.390 --> 01:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
Community
 
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
College they might they have done it and
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
if they
 
01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
don't you might want to ask I don't know
 
01:22:44.669 --> 01:22:44.679 align:start position:0%
how many folks you get that normally
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
attend your things but I do know that
 
01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
um the selectman's meeting room
 
01:22:56.550 --> 01:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
Groveton has a capacity of 88
 
01:23:00.550 --> 01:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
people okay uh there's a $25 fee but all
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
selectman uh to wave that and uh it
 
01:23:12.310 --> 01:23:12.320 align:start position:0%
generally is done if there's a
 
01:23:17.629 --> 01:23:17.639 align:start position:0%
legitimate reason um but uh Lancaster uh
 
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
theirs I believe can hold way more than
 
01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
that uh if you get CL groups that are in
 
01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
the 200 range I believe their U meeting
 
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
room is also a theater that they use um
 
01:23:32.709 --> 01:23:32.719 align:start position:0%
you might be able to ask them and that
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
moves it into where North country folks
 
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
will uh
 
01:23:40.470 --> 01:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
come visit and talk yeah absolutely we'd
 
01:23:43.629 --> 01:23:43.639 align:start position:0%
love that and we are trying to get but
 
01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
you could use those type places also
 
01:23:48.149 --> 01:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
throughout the state yeah and you're
 
01:23:51.709 --> 01:23:51.719 align:start position:0%
liable to find that they might be free
 
01:23:54.110 --> 01:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
yeah that that is incredibly helpful
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you so much because that is
 
01:23:56.669 --> 01:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
something we've been struggling with
 
01:23:58.070 --> 01:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
trying to find places to hold these
 
01:24:00.149 --> 01:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
meetings because when we hold them at
 
01:24:02.430 --> 01:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
the L we get nobody and that's not good
 
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
for our Outreach so being able to hold
 
01:24:06.629 --> 01:24:06.639 align:start position:0%
this in other places trying to get more
 
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
parts of the state would be incredibly
 
01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
valuable for us um and so yeah I have
 
01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:15.080 align:start position:0%
been in touch with PSU um but we our
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
original thought was UNH and they they
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
want to charge us $800 plus um
 
01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
facilities fees Plus Insurance um which
 
01:24:24.189 --> 01:24:24.199 align:start position:0%
is surprising because I mean granted
 
01:24:25.350 --> 01:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
this was 10 years ago but we actually
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
did host lak meetings at UNH and there
 
01:24:32.590 --> 01:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
was a point um in our like I don't know
 
01:24:34.189 --> 01:24:34.199 align:start position:0%
when it was repealed but there was rsa1
 
01:24:34.199 --> 01:24:35.229 align:start position:0%
when it was repealed but there was rsa1
19

01:24:35.229 --> 01:24:35.239 align:start position:0%
19
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
K5 that said that we had a bank account
 
01:24:39.590 --> 01:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
and we could accept donations and I
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
imagine it was for that purpose um to
 
01:24:45.629 --> 01:24:45.639 align:start position:0%
rent out rooms or what have you but that
 
01:24:48.189 --> 01:24:48.199 align:start position:0%
got repealed I tried um communicating
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
with one of the original sponsors of the
 
01:24:52.510 --> 01:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
lak bill as representative Nelson said
 
01:24:54.189 --> 01:24:54.199 align:start position:0%
and I could not get in touch with her to
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
find out exactly why that was
 
01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
um question
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
if if this committee for example were to
 
01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
have a meeting elsewhere or fishing game
 
01:25:11.629 --> 01:25:11.639 align:start position:0%
let's say uh where they went somewhere
 
01:25:16.790 --> 01:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
else um are they covered by insurance if
 
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
they you know from the state I don't
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
believe that they can so
 
01:25:25.350 --> 01:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
um because all of our is that right our
 
01:25:33.109 --> 01:25:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:33.119 --> 01:25:34.709 align:start position:0%
 
be

01:25:34.709 --> 01:25:34.719 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
here Finance
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
committe hearings in different locations
 
01:25:44.990 --> 01:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the state with the goal of you know
 
01:25:47.990 --> 01:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
making it moreable to folks who live up
 
01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
north or whatever it's been in years
 
01:25:53.109 --> 01:25:53.119 align:start position:0%
past we been
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
redistricting the redistricting
 
01:26:01.390 --> 01:26:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:05.470 --> 01:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
comms yeah I I I belong to the um
 
01:26:07.109 --> 01:26:07.119 align:start position:0%
special committee on child care and we
 
01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
had road trips um we had one in
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh we had one in Hampton and
 
01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
another one up
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.199 --> 01:26:24.390 align:start position:0%
 
that's

01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:25.629 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:26:25.629 --> 01:26:25.639 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:26:29.070 --> 01:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
mean the type of insurance
 
01:26:31.990 --> 01:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
that is the
 
01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:35.679 align:start position:0%
liability for the build like that not
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:53.709 --> 01:26:53.719 align:start position:0%
state so I will say that the reason that
 
01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:56.360 align:start position:0%
UNH wanted us to get the insurance um
 
01:26:57.790 --> 01:26:57.800 align:start position:0%
was because we will have high schoolers
 
01:26:59.310 --> 01:26:59.320 align:start position:0%
present and I think it was individual
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
liability insurance I'm not 100% certain
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
on that but it I I was told by our
 
01:27:06.350 --> 01:27:06.360 align:start position:0%
member who was looking into that that it
 
01:27:07.669 --> 01:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
was specifically because high schoolers
 
01:27:10.470 --> 01:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
were going to be present thank
 
01:27:13.629 --> 01:27:13.639 align:start position:0%
you okay we're coming uh to 11:30 are
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
there any other additional comments that
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh anybody would like to
 
01:27:24.430 --> 01:27:24.440 align:start position:0%
add no okay um so I'm going to close the
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.119 --> 01:27:54.119 align:start position:0%
