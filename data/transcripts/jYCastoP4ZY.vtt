thank
 
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
you so the report is is meant to be
 
00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
responsive to um the statute's directive
 
00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 align:start position:0%
to um give a picture of the number of
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
claims filed the number of claims
 
00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
resolved the kinds of abuse that um is
 
00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
both filed as a claim and also resolved
 
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 align:start position:0%
um so if there's specific questions on
 
00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
the numbers I can address that um I can
 
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
also give you a sense we're about to
 
00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
close quarter 4 I can give you a sensus
 
00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 align:start position:0%
to what a couple of numbers that we're
 
00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
that you may be interested in at at the
 
00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
close we didn't get anything in writing
 
00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
so if you'd spill out the numbers a bit
 
00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 align:start position:0%
okay four quarter four or four quarter
 
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
three four how many cases filed how many
 
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
have been settled okay how much money
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
has been U
 
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
promised and if I may since we're
 
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
presenting the quarter 3 report I think
 
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
it would be appropriate to report those
 
00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
numbers sure yep
 
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
okay so uh the number and total claim
 
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
amount for filed claims the total fil
 
00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 align:start position:0%
claims for quarter 3 was 180 claims
 
00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 align:start position:0%
filed um there was a as a picture for
 
00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 align:start position:0%
quarter 1 there was 38 claims filed um
 
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
and for quarter three to give you a
 
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
picture there was excuse me 88 claims
 
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 align:start position:0%
volume in terms of the nature of abuse
 
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 align:start position:0%
of Cl
 
00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 align:start position:0%
claims um from those 180 claims there
 
00:05:35.749 --> 00:05:35.759 align:start position:0%
are claims that F that allege both
 
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse and physical abuse 138 of
 
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
the 180 claims represent that
 
00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 align:start position:0%
category some of the claims um claim Cy
 
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
sexual abuse
 
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
only 26 um is the is the number for the
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
180 and some of the claims allege
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
physical abuse only um and that is 16
 
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
and we do um
 
00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:03.319 align:start position:0%
so far see a a smaller portion that are
 
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
only in terms of the pending claims in
 
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
other words the ones that have not been
 
00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
resolved yet um at the close of quarter
 
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
3 148 claims out of the 180 were still
 
00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:22.759 align:start position:0%
pending in the process there's a number
 
00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:24.919 align:start position:0%
of steps that the claims processing
 
00:06:29.629 --> 00:06:29.639 align:start position:0%
involves so it does take uh careful uh
 
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
managing and shepherding through those
 
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
steps in order to get to resolution and
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
there's two ways of of resolving as you
 
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
know one is through the Attorney
 
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
General's office um by way of mutual
 
00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
agreement with the parties um or should
 
00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 align:start position:0%
the parties uh seek a resolution
 
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 align:start position:0%
proceeding with the administrator that's
 
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
another opportunity for resolution by
 
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.390 align:start position:0%
 
decision

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:03.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
so from the 180 claims that were pending
 
00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of quarter
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
3 29 of them were
 
00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
resolved 28 of those 29 were resolved
 
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
through mutual agreement with the
 
00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:18.400 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office one uh was
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
resolved by the administrator by the
 
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
close of quarter three of course that
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
that number is different now that were a
 
00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:30.110 align:start position:0%
 
three

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:07:32.309 --> 00:07:32.319 align:start position:0%
for the settled amounts those resolved
 
00:07:36.469 --> 00:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
amounts 13 milon
 
00:07:36.479 --> 00:07:39.189 align:start position:0%
amounts 13 milon
390,000

00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
390,000
 
00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:41.670 align:start position:0%
390,000
and

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:41.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:44.749 --> 00:07:44.759 align:start position:0%
$625 um were represents the resolved
 
00:07:47.309 --> 00:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
amount and that's for both those
 
00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
resolves through the Attorney General's
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
office and the one at that point that
 
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
been resolved through the administrator
 
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
the report does give the breakdown of
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
those two numbers if you're interested
 
00:07:58.950 --> 00:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
would you like me to give that just that
 
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.430 align:start position:0%
would you like me to give that just that
difference

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
difference
 
00:08:03.029 --> 00:08:03.039 align:start position:0%
so that report is forthcoming that
 
00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
report is on our on our website and it
 
00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:06.759 align:start position:0%
was provided
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
oh to the committee all right he's
 
00:08:12.749 --> 00:08:12.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
yep so the report does give a
 
00:08:18.749 --> 00:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
comparison because the resolved amount
 
00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily going to be the claim
 
00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:26.280 align:start position:0%
amount for some claims it will be um for
 
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
some claims it will be something less so
 
00:08:30.749 --> 00:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
so to give you a picture of that the
 
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.269 --> 00:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
comparison out of the 29 that were
 
00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:41.519 align:start position:0%
resolved the claim amount was in excess
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
of 20
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
million but the resolved amount was 13
 
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
million so you can see that there's a
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
difference between and that's aggregate
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
numbers obviously so so that just gives
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
you a picture that claim amount does
 
00:08:57.389 --> 00:08:57.399 align:start position:0%
always mean that that is the amount that
 
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:05.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
so the report also gives a
 
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:11.720 align:start position:0%
picture for those claims that have been
 
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:16.160 align:start position:0%
resolved what kinds of abuse was
 
00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
resolved so of those 29 claims 17
 
00:09:22.069 --> 00:09:22.079 align:start position:0%
involved resolution for both sexual
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
abuse and physical abuse
 
00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
claims seven of them were sexual abuse
 
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
only claims and five of them were
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:40.040 align:start position:0%
claims the report also goes on to give a
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
picture of other ways that claims leave
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
the process some are withdrawn as an
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
example so at the end of quarter three
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:59.389 --> 00:09:59.399 align:start position:0%
process um the report gives a dollar
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
amount that relates to those claims that
 
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
now were were they withdrew in order to
 
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:14.680 align:start position:0%
file to go to court or in order to just
 
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:15.880 align:start position:0%
negate the
 
00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
claim um when when a claimant withdraws
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
from the process at that point the
 
00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:24.279 align:start position:0%
administrator does not have a picture as
 
00:10:25.829 --> 00:10:25.839 align:start position:0%
to whether they're going to continue to
 
00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:29.839 align:start position:0%
pursue in court or not and some claims
 
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:32.600 align:start position:0%
if they withdraw it doesn't necessarily
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
mean that they have litigation pending
 
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
at the time so of all the claims that
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
are filed with us initially we do track
 
00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:42.200 align:start position:0%
those that have related litigation
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
pending and therefore have to have a
 
00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:46.639 align:start position:0%
stay put in the
 
00:10:49.269 --> 00:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
court versus there are quite a few
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
claims that come into the process that
 
00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
have no litigation pending at all so if
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
they withdraw if there's pending
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
litigation they can choose to pursue it
 
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
um if they don't have Penny litigation
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
they could bring it but that's not
 
00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:04.760 align:start position:0%
something that the administrator's
 
00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:06.399 align:start position:0%
office is involved
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
in I would just add I believe in both of
 
00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:11.920 align:start position:0%
those cases the withdrawal happened
 
00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:14.800 align:start position:0%
before um any decision had been made on
 
00:11:17.230 --> 00:11:17.240 align:start position:0%
the claim so we don't know that they
 
00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
withdrew because they were dissatisfied
 
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
they simply decided not to participate
 
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
anymore maybe they didn't
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
have a strong memory or maybe they
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
weren't able to provide do we ask them
 
00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
to provide dates or anything that can be
 
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
verified dates of the claimed abuse yes
 
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
yes so the um claim packet itself when a
 
00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
claim comes into the system um there are
 
00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
dates that are and locations and kinds
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
of abuse that are um in the claim packet
 
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
itself it can be verified as to whether
 
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
that person and the other person they
 
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
claim abuse them were in fact present at
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
that site at that
 
00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:02.440 align:start position:0%
time if the if the um claimant withdrew
 
00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:05.800 align:start position:0%
their claim um it would depend on when
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
they withdrew it as to whether or not
 
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
that verification process actually
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
occurred um if it's an early on
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
withdrawal before the Attorney General's
 
00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
office has done its
 
00:12:19.230 --> 00:12:19.240 align:start position:0%
evaluation um then there really the
 
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
verification process wouldn't have
 
00:12:24.350 --> 00:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
begun but if the claim proceeded to the
 
00:12:27.269 --> 00:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
attorney general's position then I'll
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
let the Attorney General's office speak
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
for them elves as to what kind of
 
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
verification or what that would mean for
 
00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
verification yeah than thank you for the
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
question representative um I I if I
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
understand what you're asking you're
 
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
wanting to be sure we're able based on
 
00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
the information we're receiving from
 
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
claimants to at least verify that they
 
00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:48.399 align:start position:0%
were at uh a state facility and that the
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
people that they claim to have abused
 
00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
them were also working at that State
 
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
Facility um if that's the question then
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
I think the answer to that question is
 
00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
yes in almost all cases we are able to
 
00:13:02.069 --> 00:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
um either look through the facilities
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
records um or other we have other means
 
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
of looking at records to verify
 
00:13:08.829 --> 00:13:08.839 align:start position:0%
employment there are occasionally cases
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
where we are not able to conclusively
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
establish um particularly the employment
 
00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
because a claimant won't remember
 
00:13:20.269 --> 00:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
someone's full name so we might get a
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
claim where they just say I don't
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
remember the CO's name but I remember
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
what they looked like right in those
 
00:13:27.629 --> 00:13:27.639 align:start position:0%
cases we're not able to pull employment
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
records but to the extent that we have
 
00:13:31.949 --> 00:13:31.959 align:start position:0%
the information we are looking at trying
 
00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
to verify those kind of hard facts when
 
00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
we get them thank you those are some
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
I've had in mind for a while to ask sure
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
members representative
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
leean thank you Mr chairman and thanks
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
for taking my question not sure which
 
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
Jennifer I would direct this to but if I
 
00:13:58.030 --> 00:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
recall we set aside aund million to
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
handle these claims and I see in your
 
00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:04.480 align:start position:0%
report uh thus far it's about
 
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:08.360 align:start position:0%
175 million that the claims
 
00:14:10.829 --> 00:14:10.839 align:start position:0%
filed is there sufficient funds with
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
that 100 million do you anticipate
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
settlement going over that hundred
 
00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:17.959 align:start position:0%
million or the need to come back for
 
00:14:20.430 --> 00:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
additional funding or is it too early to
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
ask that
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
question in some senses it's too early
 
00:14:28.829 --> 00:14:28.839 align:start position:0%
to know uh the $171 million that you see
 
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
the report represents we just simply
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
totaled everything that had been asked
 
00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:35.600 align:start position:0%
for through the end of quarter three the
 
00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
actual awards are much less but I think
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
if you do the basic math of the number
 
00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:43.680 align:start position:0%
of potential claimants that exist and
 
00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
use the average price that we are
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
settling or the average uh uh award that
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
we are making um for claimants um it is
 
00:14:53.829 --> 00:14:53.839 align:start position:0%
likely that the $100 million is not
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
going to be sufficient if we want to
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
resolve all of the claims through the
 
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.189 align:start position:0%
resolve all of the claims through the
fund

00:14:59.189 --> 00:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
chairman did you want continue
 
00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:12.680 align:start position:0%
Q was oh continue what with Q4 numbers
 
00:15:15.749 --> 00:15:15.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
well she can give me the numbers yes so
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
there there were further numbers to
 
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
come so we'll be Prov providing a report
 
00:15:29.189 --> 00:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
every quarter um where almost through
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
with quarter four so that report will
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
come in mid January and if you um if you
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
are thinking in terms of um the cost uh
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
the for the state I can report just um
 
00:15:46.590 --> 00:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
anecdotally that we're now uh in the
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
realm of having
 
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
resolved probably North of 60 claims um
 
00:15:57.629 --> 00:15:57.639 align:start position:0%
for quarter 4 um and that the the amount
 
00:15:58.990 --> 00:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
that will have been paid out of the fund
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
by the end of the the quarter I'm
 
00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
estimating is going to be about twice
 
00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
what it was at the end of quarter three
 
00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
now as the payments that have been
 
00:16:10.430 --> 00:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
structured so
 
00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:13.800 align:start position:0%
far how many of them will go beyond the
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
end of this fiscal year this fiscal
 
00:16:20.749 --> 00:16:20.759 align:start position:0%
bium would you say go beyond what I'm
 
00:16:22.629 --> 00:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what you mean so this this
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
B Anyan will go till um June of of
 
00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.629 align:start position:0%
B Anyan will go till um June of of
25

00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
25
 
00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:32.120 align:start position:0%
are some of these payments structured to
 
00:16:34.949 --> 00:16:34.959 align:start position:0%
go beyond that date so the 100 million
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
is within this bium I see so if they go
 
00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
beyond this
 
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:42.040 align:start position:0%
bium then we may be able to do a new
 
00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:44.560 align:start position:0%
budget and a new a new
 
00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839 align:start position:0%
appropriation I understand thank you I
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
think it is likely that some payments
 
00:16:52.829 --> 00:16:52.839 align:start position:0%
will go beyond the end of this bium the
 
00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
date by which claimants have to apply
 
00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
for compensation from the fund is the
 
00:17:01.189 --> 00:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
end of the calendar year of 2024 so a
 
00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:03.560 align:start position:0%
claim that came in in December of 2024
 
00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
would work its way through the process
 
00:17:07.669 --> 00:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
and potentially be resolved in the
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
second or third or even the fourth
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
quarter of 2025 so um assuming that the
 
00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:14.919 align:start position:0%
process continues then I think that that
 
00:17:20.029 --> 00:17:20.039 align:start position:0%
there would be um potentially uh some uh
 
00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:22.240 align:start position:0%
Financial contributions in the next by
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
anym as well you have an estimate of
 
00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:27.799 align:start position:0%
when the 100 million will be expended
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
will it be with within this
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
pum I do not we could look at that and
 
00:17:36.110 --> 00:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
and let you know um as committee that's
 
00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:38.440 align:start position:0%
information we need whether we need to
 
00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:42.039 align:start position:0%
go look at other funds to transfer money
 
00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:44.720 align:start position:0%
or whether we worry about the next
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
budget yeah I I think it would be
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
appropriate for us to address that for
 
00:17:50.270 --> 00:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
you in the next quarterly
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
report thank you very much thank
 
00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.630 align:start position:0%

representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
date as you just went through them for
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
Q3 in terms of the uh total claims filed
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth right down the
 
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:09.909 align:start position:0%
and so on and so forth right down the
list

00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
um do I all of those specific numbers I
 
00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
do not we have I have a couple of
 
00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:19.240 align:start position:0%
pictures that I could give you okay so
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
the couple of pictures I just went and
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
looked at our docket this morning um and
 
00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
our um so from the present of where my
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
roet is updated because that takes time
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
in and of itself um we
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:41.669 --> 00:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
notes the number of claims in quarter 4
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
as new claims that came in in quarter 4
 
00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
is is north of
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
65 um so we have the rest of quarter
 
00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:52.760 align:start position:0%
four to live and also I need to look at
 
00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:54.360 align:start position:0%
my inbox to see how many more are
 
00:18:57.630 --> 00:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
sitting there now um and then the other
 
00:18:59.310 --> 00:18:59.320 align:start position:0%
number I took a look at just to give a
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
quick picture is the number of
 
00:19:05.789 --> 00:19:05.799 align:start position:0%
resolution proceedings um um so we have
 
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
about again North is 60 Resolution
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
proceedings um that have been selected
 
00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
by claimants that need to get uh some
 
00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
are scheduled and happening and we have
 
00:19:18.909 --> 00:19:18.919 align:start position:0%
um award or no award letters going out
 
00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
um and some need to be scheduled um into
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh early
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
2024 um in order to go through the
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
resolution proceeding process with the
 
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:30.270 align:start position:0%
resolution proceeding process with the
administrator

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:31.799 align:start position:0%
could you just clarify what you meant so
 
00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
are I understand that you've made or the
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
U system has made offers to 60 claimants
 
00:19:40.909 --> 00:19:40.919 align:start position:0%
and you're waiting to hear the what what
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
did that mean what you okay um
 
00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
so I took a look at the numbers of how
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
many of the claims have selected a
 
00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
resolution proceeding as the Avenue for
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
resolution and at this point we have a
 
00:20:04.149 --> 00:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
little more than 60 claimants have asked
 
00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
to have their claim resolved in front of
 
00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:08.720 align:start position:0%
the administrator that number does not
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
represent the amount of award or no
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
award letters it's simply the pending
 
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
there is a portion of those that have
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
been resolved by the administrator and
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
that will be reported in the quarterly
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
report that shows how many and how much
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
including whether it's an award letter
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
or no award
 
00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:29.990 align:start position:0%
or no award
letter

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
letter
 
00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:32.200 align:start position:0%
and and lastly when you when you before
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
I started asking these questions you
 
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned the I think this what you said
 
00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
the resolve claims amount is now about
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
double what it was before so does that
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
mean around $26 million did you is that
 
00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:43.720 align:start position:0%
what you stated yep I think that's
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
correct thank you very
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
writing to your original
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
a note which related to the jsr the jrc
 
00:23:35.549 --> 00:23:35.559 align:start position:0%
not being qualified and I'm my first
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
question is was it ever qualified to
 
00:23:40.990 --> 00:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
receive funds in other words to any
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
process good morning Nathan white Chief
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer with the Department of
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I'm going to
 
00:23:55.430 --> 00:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
have Chris selo speak to the the history
 
00:23:58.230 --> 00:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
here a little bit good morning Chris S
 
00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner um in
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
2016 um the department was in
 
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
discussions with CMS and at that point
 
00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
in time um there was an understanding um
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
that certain situations could be covered
 
00:24:17.549 --> 00:24:17.559 align:start position:0%
um at jrc and then later in about I
 
00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:21.240 align:start position:0%
think it was um 2022 we were notified
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
that that was no longer the
 
00:24:26.789 --> 00:24:26.799 align:start position:0%
interpretation further
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
questions okay so if I understand
 
00:24:30.630 --> 00:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
correctly because also you indicated in
 
00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:32.919 align:start position:0%
this thing that Not only was it against
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
the law for federal it was also against
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
state law as well at that point or at
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
some point yeah yes in
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%

00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
head um RSA
 
00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
171a um there was there's a section of
 
00:24:51.789 --> 00:24:51.799 align:start position:0%
it that says we have to comply with the
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
settings rule through CMS and that
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
actually came in effect in March 17th 20
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
23 right so based on that it sounds like
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
you were we the state was legally paying
 
00:25:06.269 --> 00:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
for the services for a period of time
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
and then at some point in time it became
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
illegal to do that and then the Supreme
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
Court ruled that they ordered the
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
payment regardless and I'm just
 
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
wondering in that you didn't really go
 
00:25:16.830 --> 00:25:16.840 align:start position:0%
into the ruling but in that ruling did
 
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
it State their reasons that they
 
00:25:20.830 --> 00:25:20.840 align:start position:0%
basically said you have to make the
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
payments even though state law says you
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
don't have to make the payments we're in
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
AC of litigation on that um ruling right
 
00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
now so that was a preliminary ruling so
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
we're still working through that but is
 
00:25:35.149 --> 00:25:35.159 align:start position:0%
that ruling available that preliminary
 
00:25:37.389 --> 00:25:37.399 align:start position:0%
ruling yes we can provide that to you
 
00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:39.799 align:start position:0%
thank you that'd be
 
00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:42.200 align:start position:0%
great that it for
 
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
me Senator alisandra thank you Mr
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
chairman first of all thanks very much
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
for for coming it it is a a little uh
 
00:25:53.269 --> 00:25:53.279 align:start position:0%
convoluted here but we were a we were
 
00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.120 align:start position:0%
ordered to pay court audited to pay so
 
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
and and our recourse is we are we are uh
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
questioning that at this point in time
 
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:04.360 align:start position:0%
and we're back in
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
court correct okay and and and uh who's
 
00:26:11.149 --> 00:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
representing us the department or do we
 
00:26:14.669 --> 00:26:14.679 align:start position:0%
have outside council department of
 
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
chair further questions from the
 
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
committee move the item sen Senator gray
 
00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
moves the item Senator dallesandro
 
00:26:31.389 --> 00:26:31.399 align:start position:0%
seconds it so even though they're still
 
00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
in court this um vote authorizes them
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
900,000 if they need it if they don't
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
they won't but that's what they need the
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
authority to go forward everyone
 
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
understand the situation all in favor of
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:12.600 align:start position:0%

see you commissioner aren't you
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
occupying that space at the present time
 
00:27:31.750 --> 00:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
yes so uh my question is what do you
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
need new furniture for if if you're
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
already occupying the space and you have
 
00:27:39.430 --> 00:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
furniture from your previous location
 
00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:41.559 align:start position:0%
that you could move over there yeah
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I appreciate
 
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
that um so we are occupying that space
 
00:27:47.789 --> 00:27:47.799 align:start position:0%
we have not been occupying the space
 
00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
that we will be moving into um over the
 
00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
past year Granite State College which
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
has now merged with University of New
 
00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has been slowly moving out of
 
00:27:59.110 --> 00:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
space uh several months ago they moved
 
00:28:01.149 --> 00:28:01.159 align:start position:0%
out of some of the space that was
 
00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
occupied um and so then we will be
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
moving our people into that space um
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
within the Granite State College the
 
00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:09.799 align:start position:0%
furniture that they had there so for the
 
00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:11.240 align:start position:0%
most part we've acquired all of the
 
00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:13.880 align:start position:0%
Furnishings as well um but they had
 
00:28:16.269 --> 00:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
certain areas that were more like Lounge
 
00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
areas uh that were not necessarily
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
conducive to kind of a high density
 
00:28:24.029 --> 00:28:24.039 align:start position:0%
office space so we allowed them to take
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
the lounge type furniture and we are
 
00:28:30.149 --> 00:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
cubicles okay further question but but
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
we bought we're buying the building so
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
so are we allowing them to take the
 
00:28:40.590 --> 00:28:40.600 align:start position:0%
equipment out of the out of the building
 
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
that we're purchasing mean we're paying
 
00:28:45.789 --> 00:28:45.799 align:start position:0%
7 million do for that
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
building uh and and it seems to me a
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
we're paying 7 billion for it we're
 
00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
buying it B we're already occupying it
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
and paying rent uh to uh the community
 
00:28:57.509 --> 00:28:57.519 align:start position:0%
college system or whoever at at this
 
00:29:00.070 --> 00:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
point in time and we're allowing them to
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
take furniture out of out of our
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
building so the price that we're paying
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
for the facility is
 
00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:08.519 align:start position:0%
$6,750 th000 which includes all of the
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
Furnishing so about $7 million just to
 
00:29:13.710 --> 00:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
be precise um and we have retained all
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
of the Furnishings that are usable uh
 
00:29:18.029 --> 00:29:18.039 align:start position:0%
what we want to do is we want to make
 
00:29:21.149 --> 00:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
sure that we have a uh a density that is
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
consistent with a normal corporate
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
environment as opposed to you know a
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
student lounge which is what this space
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
occupies and so we did need to acquire
 
00:29:31.149 --> 00:29:31.159 align:start position:0%
some Furnishings for part of that
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
building I mean I can tell you even now
 
00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
we don't occupy all of that building
 
00:29:37.149 --> 00:29:37.159 align:start position:0%
there are three external tenants in that
 
00:29:39.389 --> 00:29:39.399 align:start position:0%
building uh those tenants will be moved
 
00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:41.240 align:start position:0%
out once the sale is closed and they get
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
a 90-day notification and they'll be
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
moving out and then we will be moving
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
spaces F further question F the question
 
00:29:56.070 --> 00:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
so how many people do you have there now
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
and how many additional people will you
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
be moving over and where were those
 
00:30:02.269 --> 00:30:02.279 align:start position:0%
people though so I don't have all of the
 
00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
numbers in terms of the people in terms
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
of the exact count but right now I have
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
some people who are in Walker building
 
00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:10.519 align:start position:0%
that will be moving over as we occupy
 
00:30:10.519 --> 00:30:12.830 align:start position:0%
that will be moving over as we occupy
this

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%

Bea I believe someone from the senate
 
00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:26.799 align:start position:0%
had a question on this I believe that I
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
believe that the questions were coming
 
00:31:31.389 --> 00:31:31.399 align:start position:0%
from uh senator berell who was not able
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
to be here today I think that uh
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
centered around uh how we decide which
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
people who go on trade missions are
 
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
funded through certain funds and how we
 
00:31:46.269 --> 00:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
decide that people aren't being funded
 
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
um because she was uh one of the ones
 
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
who uh went on a trade Mission uh and U
 
00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
that brought up the question so with
 
00:31:57.470 --> 00:31:57.480 align:start position:0%
that as a lead in I'll turn it back over
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner it sounds like a
 
00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240 align:start position:0%
question who decides who gets funded and
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
who who does not get funded and do they
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
know this before they go well I I don't
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
know the specifics of this particular
 
00:32:13.389 --> 00:32:13.399 align:start position:0%
request that was apparently made but as
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
it relates to that trip to Poland there
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
were two companies that were eligible to
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
receive funding under the federal step
 
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
program that we administer and those
 
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
companies did receive some funds uh to
 
00:32:29.549 --> 00:32:29.559 align:start position:0%
alleviate the cost of of attending the
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
on the trade Mission there are questions
 
00:32:31.679 --> 00:32:32.430 align:start position:0%
on the trade Mission there are questions
of

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:32.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
Eligibility uh that are directly related
 
00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
to the program that we administer that
 
00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:40.600 align:start position:0%
uh the individuals and the companies
 
00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:42.799 align:start position:0%
that are paid are are that are eligible
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
for this are employers or staff that um
 
00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:50.919 align:start position:0%
assist in that regard uh and represent
 
00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:53.960 align:start position:0%
the state on our
 
00:32:56.669 --> 00:32:56.679 align:start position:0%
behalf so I guess without specifics we
 
00:32:58.509 --> 00:32:58.519 align:start position:0%
don't know know the answer it would be
 
00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
hard for me to say specifically I do
 
00:33:02.909 --> 00:33:02.919 align:start position:0%
know and because I in response to the
 
00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:04.519 align:start position:0%
question that we received I did talk
 
00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
with our staff and I I we we we are not
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
aware of any denial that we made to
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
anyone for that trip so uh if that's not
 
00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:18.279 align:start position:0%
the case I would have to know more about
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
that further Senator gray um what would
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
be the consequences of uh tabling this
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
until the January meeting is there an
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
immediate need for the passage of this
 
00:33:33.549 --> 00:33:33.559 align:start position:0%
or uh it's a great question Senator this
 
00:33:35.389 --> 00:33:35.399 align:start position:0%
is funding for the next round of the
 
00:33:37.629 --> 00:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
step program as it pertains to the trip
 
00:33:39.149 --> 00:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
in question that was from the previous
 
00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:41.559 align:start position:0%
round so this funding has nothing to do
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
with with that particular Mission and I
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
will just add for clarification sake
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
this funding is federal funding that has
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
specific requirements that the money has
 
00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:52.120 align:start position:0%
to go to eligible businesses not um
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
indiv elected leaders or individuals in
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
the public it's specifically for
 
00:33:59.629 --> 00:33:59.639 align:start position:0%
designated um staff um in the program
 
00:34:01.629 --> 00:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
and the businesses that are eligible and
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
apply so they would in fact know ahead
 
00:34:05.549 --> 00:34:05.559 align:start position:0%
of a trip whether they receive funding
 
00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:06.799 align:start position:0%
for it because they submit an
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
application let me repeat the question
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
yeah okay what would be the effect of
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
postponing this until the January
 
00:34:18.950 --> 00:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
meeting the effect would be uh any delay
 
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
in ongoing funding for this program the
 
00:34:24.030 --> 00:34:24.040 align:start position:0%
step 10 program which is prior to the
 
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
Step 11 that we're seeking authorization
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
for now is a effectively out of funding
 
00:34:30.629 --> 00:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh so any ongoing applications or
 
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
incoming applications over the next
 
00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
month would likely be delayed if there
 
00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960 align:start position:0%
are any trade shows or exports or
 
00:34:38.430 --> 00:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
related research that companies are
 
00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
trying to engage in with this funding
 
00:34:43.270 --> 00:34:43.280 align:start position:0%
there may be a delay for
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
them but we don't know of any at this
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
time that there would be a problem with
 
00:34:51.310 --> 00:34:51.320 align:start position:0%
delaying this until January
 
00:34:53.869 --> 00:34:53.879 align:start position:0%
meeting I can't specifically think of a
 
00:34:55.230 --> 00:34:55.240 align:start position:0%
business that would be directly impacted
 
00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
over the next month but I can certainly
 
00:34:59.109 --> 00:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
check with our staff which is not
 
00:35:01.230 --> 00:35:01.240 align:start position:0%
helpful in this particular moment um
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%
other than to say we get regular
 
00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
applications um in this until January Mr
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
chairman I do have a question before the
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
tabling motion if and I would be happy
 
00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
before I accept the tabling motion uh
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
sen representative Lehman has a question
 
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and I would
 
00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
certainly would second that motion after
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
my question but
 
00:35:26.190 --> 00:35:26.200 align:start position:0%
uh there you mention in here out ofate
 
00:35:29.270 --> 00:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
travel for like $8,600 and it says it
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
would enable between six and eight
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
people to participate that doesn't sound
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
like enough money to me to go to the UK
 
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
and put people up and the travel
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
expenses where did that figure of the
 
00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
$8600 come from that's a great question
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative so the um 8600 came from
 
00:35:48.310 --> 00:35:48.320 align:start position:0%
the initial application for the federal
 
00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:49.880 align:start position:0%
funding itself and it relates to the
 
00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
farm bur um trade show in the UK and
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
that will enable six to eight businesses
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to attend a booth that the
 
00:35:59.150 --> 00:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
state would run so those costs are
 
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
related to travel and the booth costs as
 
00:36:05.910 --> 00:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
well um and some funding for businesses
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
themselves to attend but that's a
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
percentage of their cost correct it's
 
00:36:12.230 --> 00:36:12.240 align:start position:0%
not their not the entire cost correct
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
yesk thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:36:17.829 --> 00:36:17.839 align:start position:0%
when you approve a business do you put a
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
limit on how many people they could take
 
00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:21.560 align:start position:0%
the whole company or they could take
 
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
three or they could take two is there a
 
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
is there a limit on how many they can
 
00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:27.560 align:start position:0%
take there's a limit on how much funding
 
00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
they would receive so it depends on the
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
in um information in their application
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
so in the existing program the step 10
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
there is a limit per project or trip of
 
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:40.440 align:start position:0%
$6,500 and that that only covers up to
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
80% of the cost so the company has to
 
00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:45.319 align:start position:0%
submit at least um or commit at least
 
00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
20% of the cost to the trip
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
itself thank you Senator gray repeat my
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
motion to table to January
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
second motion a second to table further
 
00:37:02.589 --> 00:37:02.599 align:start position:0%
dis and that's a non-debatable um motion
 
00:37:06.150 --> 00:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
all in favor of tabling say I I oppose
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
no that is table until our next meeting
 
00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.349 align:start position:0%
no that is table until our next meeting
thank

00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
