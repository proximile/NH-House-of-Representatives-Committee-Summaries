Replacements uh I don't think so it
 
00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
being 1 to 1:00 we'll call the finance
 
00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:04.439 align:start position:0%
committee meeting to order the first
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
item on the agenda is a hearing on House
 
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
Bill 619 619 and I'll call upon the
 
00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:14.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Abel thank you
 
00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chair um and members of the
 
00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
Karen Eble I repre I represent mayac
 
00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 align:start position:0%
district 7 which is New London and
 
00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 align:start position:0%
Newbury and I'm also here in my capacity
 
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 align:start position:0%
as chair of the state stakeholder group
 
00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
The solid waste working group so um this
 
00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 align:start position:0%
bill uh supports the appropriation of uh
 
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 align:start position:0%
a million dollars into the solid waste
 
00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
management fund you may recall in the
 
00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
last budget the um the state the
 
00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
legislature saw fit to fund this program
 
00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 align:start position:0%
um the house actually supported putting
 
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 align:start position:0%
$2 million into the fund ultimately it
 
00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 align:start position:0%
was cut to a million which is where it
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
stands um and it's a matching grant
 
00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 align:start position:0%
program for municipalities and for
 
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
businesses to uh do work in uh waste
 
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
aversion the other thing that we did in
 
00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 align:start position:0%
the last uh budget was to revise the
 
00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
language so that 50% % of the um of the
 
00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation would be prioritized for
 
00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
food waste
 
00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 align:start position:0%
diversion um so one thing just to I mean
 
00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:42.759 align:start position:0%
there's several things that we can talk
 
00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
about but you know uh a couple of years
 
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
ago we um did adopt after a a 20year
 
00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
Hiatus a new Solid Waste Management plan
 
00:05:57.029 --> 00:05:57.039 align:start position:0%
and as a state we also adopted new Solid
 
00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 align:start position:0%
Waste diversion goals we're trying to do
 
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
25% by weight diversion of solid waste
 
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
into landfills by 2030 and 45% by
 
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 align:start position:0%
2050 so food waste and one of the
 
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 align:start position:0%
reasons that we prioritized it um in in
 
00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 align:start position:0%
the last budget um is it constitutes
 
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
between 25 and 30% of all weight that
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
goes into landfills now we all know that
 
00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 align:start position:0%
landfills are a big topic around here
 
00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 align:start position:0%
and um a new landfill isn't a popular
 
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
Prospect with either the governor or
 
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
vast numbers of our citizens and we also
 
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
know that Dees has said that from a
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
regional standpoint there may be a lack
 
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 align:start position:0%
of capacity but there certainly isn't
 
00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 align:start position:0%
one in New Hampshire so we should try to
 
00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
continue to preserve our uh landfill
 
00:06:52.749 --> 00:06:52.759 align:start position:0%
capacity through waste diversion and
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that this um
 
00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
fund would help promote so as I noted um
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
our towns are really uh struggling with
 
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
trying to keep up on with all the
 
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
challenges presented by Waste Management
 
00:07:11.869 --> 00:07:11.879 align:start position:0%
it can be expensive and helping towns
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
and cities through this grant program is
 
00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
a great way to kick Kickstart food waste
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
diversion and other recycling activities
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
and it'll help to uh promote our planned
 
00:07:27.469 --> 00:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
goals um it also is a is a business
 
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
promoter because there's a lot lot of
 
00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
businesses that from local farms and I
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
think you all did get some testimony
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
from a local farmer who um is trying to
 
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
help with compost it's a great source of
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
income to them and they can turn it into
 
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:47.560 align:start position:0%
aable soil so our local farms are
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
interested in um assistance there are
 
00:07:54.029 --> 00:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
smaller food waste collectors and
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
composters uh and then we can also try
 
00:07:59.189 --> 00:07:59.199 align:start position:0%
to help to get food to food banks and
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
come companies uh that that have
 
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.230 align:start position:0%
come companies uh that that have
anerobic

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
anerobic
 
00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh divest I mean
 
00:08:10.469 --> 00:08:10.479 align:start position:0%
digestors so um I guess that is sort of
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
a a summary I wanted to say it's
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
interesting um New London actually my
 
00:08:21.029 --> 00:08:21.039 align:start position:0%
town did a in have a uh composting
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
program they started about a year and a
 
00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
half ago and I got the numbers from them
 
00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
and if you can believe it 172 families
 
00:08:31.629 --> 00:08:31.639 align:start position:0%
participate in the program and we
 
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:35.560 align:start position:0%
diverted 32 tons of food waste from the
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
landfill in 2024 so that helps with
 
00:08:42.389 --> 00:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
tipping fees that also helps with um
 
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
Trucking I was talking to the public
 
00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120 align:start position:0%
works guy this morning it's like $700 a
 
00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480 align:start position:0%
load to uh to take all the trash up
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
there and I guess the last uh one last
 
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:57.160 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is that we know from
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
all our discussions about past
 
00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.040 align:start position:0%
um last time uh landfills not only do
 
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:06.760 align:start position:0%
they sit there pretty much forever but
 
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
they also kick off a lot of leee
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
hundreds of millions of gallons leee
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
contains pasas and any number of other
 
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
uh terrible substances so the less that
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
we can put into landfills um it's all
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
good um I think that's it so i' uh be
 
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any question questions
 
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:33.240 align:start position:0%
about the about the fund I know that
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of uh people in the state
 
00:09:39.069 --> 00:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
that are excited about the prospect of
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
getting some grant funding um I think I
 
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to speak for the department
 
00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
but the department is certainly
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
interested in helping with waste
 
00:09:51.069 --> 00:09:51.079 align:start position:0%
diversion um and it's really important
 
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:55.720 align:start position:0%
for our state to do that so um I'd happy
 
00:09:58.550 --> 00:09:58.560 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any uh any
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
questions thank you any questions from
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
the committee representative
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
lean thank you Mr chairman uh good
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon representative
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
evil so I was just quickly scanning
 
00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
your uh letter that you gave us this
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
afternoon and I see that our tonnage
 
00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
rates or the charges that are being
 
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:26.240 align:start position:0%
charged to the hallers are pretty
 
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
minimal I guess for the State of New
 
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire versus if you look at at Rhode
 
00:10:33.949 --> 00:10:33.959 align:start position:0%
Island and Connecticut Vermont and I you
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you're looking for about
 
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
a million dollars are there other
 
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
creative ways to raise money like having
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
a tipping fee for instance at these
 
00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
facilities where the state would get you
 
00:10:46.949 --> 00:10:46.959 align:start position:0%
know $5 or $10 per ton or would that
 
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
work sure well thank you for the
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
question um representative
 
00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
Lehman we actually um I I chaired a
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
study committee about 5 years ago and we
 
00:10:59.710 --> 00:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
talked quite a bit about this and we
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
talked about the about funding issues
 
00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:04.519 align:start position:0%
and we all know with diminished uh
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
General funds um we do have to be more
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
creative about things I think I should
 
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:15.720 align:start position:0%
just say at the start so people
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
understand we we have about two million
 
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:21.240 align:start position:0%
tons of trash that goes into landfills
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
every year and about half of that is
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
from out of state so and a huge portion
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
of that is from Massachusetts so you
 
00:11:31.389 --> 00:11:31.399 align:start position:0%
know hear a lot about not massing up New
 
00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:33.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well that's one way of massing
 
00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:36.279 align:start position:0%
up New Hampshire right there um and of
 
00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
course when you have the landfills it
 
00:11:41.829 --> 00:11:41.839 align:start position:0%
really is a forever kind of problem once
 
00:11:45.949 --> 00:11:45.959 align:start position:0%
it's here it's here and many states in
 
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
fact I would say a good majority of
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
States actually have a search charge
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
that they add on to tipping fees so like
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
if somebody pays $60 a ton to deposit uh
 
00:12:02.670 --> 00:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
uh a ton of landfill to put a ton into a
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
landfill there could be a dollar sear
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
charge on that there could be a $2
 
00:12:10.949 --> 00:12:10.959 align:start position:0%
search charge on that um and that sech
 
00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
charge in many states is actually used
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
to help fund recycling efforts um really
 
00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
the the solid waste management fund idea
 
00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
was not uh my creation uh that is
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
actually something that's used in many
 
00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
many states and it's used by these sear
 
00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
charges I did um or it's funded by these
 
00:12:34.949 --> 00:12:34.959 align:start position:0%
sear charges I did give you some
 
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
information um in the
 
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
testimony um we don't charge a sirar
 
00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:45.800 align:start position:0%
charge and we rely on General funds for
 
00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:48.519 align:start position:0%
all for our Solid Waste activities and I
 
00:12:51.069 --> 00:12:51.079 align:start position:0%
looked at other states just recently
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
Iowa actually charges
 
00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:56.360 align:start position:0%
$425 a ton and it's been doing that
 
00:12:59.550 --> 00:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
since the 80s North Carolina charged is
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
$2 Ohio charges $475 and Vermont has
 
00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
charged $6 a ton since the dawn of time
 
00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:10.240 align:start position:0%
so or maybe a little less than that so
 
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
just as a general matter if you think
 
00:13:17.550 --> 00:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
about it and if we want to do good work
 
00:13:20.189 --> 00:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
with our Solid Waste if we don't want to
 
00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
have more landfills if we think that out
 
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
of state trash should maybe contribute
 
00:13:28.189 --> 00:13:28.199 align:start position:0%
to some of the issues that we have here
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
by um by having their trash then one
 
00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
alternative to funding a fund like this
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
is to at least talk about or or consider
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
this idea of a of a search charge and
 
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
I'd be um I'd be happy to talk to the
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
division uh more about that I I do want
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
to say that in 2021 we had a report the
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
average cost per ton for municipal waste
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts to landfill is $122
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
um in Vermont the average was 116 in
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island it was 100 and New
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is 60 to 80 so even though our
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
costs are much lower than area landfills
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
um in the Northeast
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
region it's lower and plus we don't
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
charge a sarch charge at all so um I
 
00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question and I think when
 
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:27.320 align:start position:0%
you're in a revenue situation like we
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
are lots of things should be at the
 
00:14:32.110 --> 00:14:32.120 align:start position:0%
table on the table and we can be
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
creative about it representative McGuire
 
00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
for a question and then representative
 
00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
Cal thank you Mr chairman how many tons
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
per year are we talking about here well
 
00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
I just happen to have the
 
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
statistic um the last the best
 
00:14:52.749 --> 00:14:52.759 align:start position:0%
information that we have is uh
 
00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519 align:start position:0%
1,923 th000 total coming into the uh
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
total in the state 1.1 million ion in
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
state and we had about
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
825,000 out of state in tonnage and that
 
00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
was as of the biannual report that was
 
00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
um that was prepared by the department
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
um for as I say for 2022 I did double
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
check uh with the Department actually an
 
00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:22.680 align:start position:0%
hour ago to see if we had more updated
 
00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:24.720 align:start position:0%
numbers and they thought that it was
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
about the same the out of state may have
 
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:29.480 align:start position:0%
dropped just a little bit but that
 
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
that's basically the number so if you if
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
you think about it depending on the sech
 
00:15:39.030 --> 00:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
charge um you know you could generate a
 
00:15:41.949 --> 00:15:41.959 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of money and as I
 
00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:44.920 align:start position:0%
say uh that's the way an awful lot of
 
00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
States handle this thank you
 
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
representative camell for a question
 
00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:51.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um and thank you
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
representative for taking the question
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
um currently how much money is in the
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
fund and to date has any of the funding
 
00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
has any other the money been used to uh
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
start the
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
initiative um thank you for the question
 
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:08.600 align:start position:0%
representative uh director whim is here
 
00:16:12.509 --> 00:16:12.519 align:start position:0%
but um I will say unfortunately uh due
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
to uh processing time through the
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
Personnel department they weren't able
 
00:16:22.269 --> 00:16:22.279 align:start position:0%
to uh get the position listed really
 
00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:24.680 align:start position:0%
promptly um and so they're still in the
 
00:16:28.509 --> 00:16:28.519 align:start position:0%
rul making process for the grant program
 
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:30.560 align:start position:0%
um they hope to have that done in the
 
00:16:32.389 --> 00:16:32.399 align:start position:0%
next several months and then they can
 
00:16:35.269 --> 00:16:35.279 align:start position:0%
start working on the Grant I think
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
though that the amount of money that's
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
in it is about $900,000
 
00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:42.319 align:start position:0%
because part of the money was used to
 
00:16:44.189 --> 00:16:44.199 align:start position:0%
defay the
 
00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
employee yep representative Edwards for
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
a question uh thank you Mr chair I I
 
00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:53.160 align:start position:0%
have a question on both ends of of the
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
of the middle of this um the first one
 
00:16:59.790 --> 00:16:59.800 align:start position:0%
is I'm I'm trying to understand um
 
00:17:03.750 --> 00:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
what it is going to be um expected of
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
families uh and I assume this isn't just
 
00:17:09.990 --> 00:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
commercial food because 172 families
 
00:17:13.390 --> 00:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
were involved do does a is a family
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
expected to take any uh food waste that
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
they have dump it into a special
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
container keep the com container
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
segregated like we used to with aluminum
 
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
cans and then take the food waste in
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
that canister and dump it into something
 
00:17:33.909 --> 00:17:33.919 align:start position:0%
at the dump how how what does that
 
00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:37.440 align:start position:0%
process look like inside a family home
 
00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
okay um well I remember doing it with my
 
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
with my German parents when I was
 
00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:45.440 align:start position:0%
growing up here my mother always had a
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
separate thing just for garbage or for
 
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
TR you know um food waste uh and that's
 
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
the way it is now so I I just want to
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
make sure from your from your question
 
00:17:58.430 --> 00:17:58.440 align:start position:0%
um there's no requirement that that
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
people do this in New London it's an
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
optional thing and that's the way it is
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
in in most towns so um yeah I mean I
 
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
participate in the program the town
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
provided a bucket uh five gallon bucket
 
00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
I just have it there um in in my kitchen
 
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
not too close to where I cook and uh and
 
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:25.480 align:start position:0%
I fill it up and when it's full I just
 
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
take it over to the transfer station
 
00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:30.919 align:start position:0%
we've got totes there big totes you dump
 
00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
the dump the food waste in there and
 
00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
then once a week a a small growing
 
00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
compost company called renewal compost
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
comes up and picks it up and takes it to
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
a farm in near your area Mr chair I'm
 
00:18:48.350 --> 00:18:48.360 align:start position:0%
forgetting the name of it and they and
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
they compost it so that's what it looks
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
like for a family and um you know part
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
of the startup fee in New London for
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
instance is they bought the buckets that
 
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
they gave to people people all right may
 
00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:03.400 align:start position:0%
I have a follow question okay so so my
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
dogs are my recycle system so they also
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
wash my plates before I put them into
 
00:19:10.909 --> 00:19:10.919 align:start position:0%
the dishwasher just to gross everyone
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
out but um on the back end of this it
 
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
sounds like you already have there is an
 
00:19:18.549 --> 00:19:18.559 align:start position:0%
example of compost companies and I'm
 
00:19:21.029 --> 00:19:21.039 align:start position:0%
just wondering uh why we aren't
 
00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:24.400 align:start position:0%
converting those contracts into uh money
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
to pay for this program the the this
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
waste does have some value to it and I
 
00:19:31.909 --> 00:19:31.919 align:start position:0%
just want to know if we've thought
 
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
through what the state needs to do in
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
order to to to recognize the revenue
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
that could be associated with selling
 
00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.070 align:start position:0%
that could be associated with selling
that

00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:19:46.549 --> 00:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
waste I I think um for the most part
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
they're just farmers and they're using
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
it to augment their soil I mean I don't
 
00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:54.320 align:start position:0%
think anybody is making Megabucks on
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
this I think and then for an anerobic
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
digestor it's a waste energy thing I'm
 
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
not sure I think
 
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
the I think that you would find that
 
00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
there's not whole lot of money to be
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
raised there it would make more sense
 
00:20:14.669 --> 00:20:14.679 align:start position:0%
that we consider uh a dollar or two per
 
00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:18.320 align:start position:0%
ton on the trash that's lingering in our
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh land here mountains Hills and Dales
 
00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559 align:start position:0%
forever thank you where are the
 
00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:27.880 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
representative r thank you very much Mr
 
00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative eel
 
00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
so following on representative Edwards
 
00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:38.919 align:start position:0%
line of questioning um the savings would
 
00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
really lie with the municipality because
 
00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:42.280 align:start position:0%
they would be
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
saving the cost of tonnage from the
 
00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:47.320 align:start position:0%
diversion is that correct that would be
 
00:20:50.789 --> 00:20:50.799 align:start position:0%
the goal yes and is followup Mr chair
 
00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:52.640 align:start position:0%
would there would there be anything to
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
preclude a municipality from um
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
generating Revenue let's say from a food
 
00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.430 align:start position:0%
generating Revenue let's say from a food
compost

00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
compost
 
00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
if if this let's say a town gets a grant
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
like this they're going to save on the
 
00:21:08.029 --> 00:21:08.039 align:start position:0%
um diversion but could they also lower
 
00:21:10.830 --> 00:21:10.840 align:start position:0%
their property taxes by creating a
 
00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
revenue stream of compost that may be um
 
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:16.960 align:start position:0%
produced through a project it's
 
00:21:19.149 --> 00:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
conceivable that they could I I think in
 
00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:22.600 align:start position:0%
marac you have is it you have composting
 
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:26.360 align:start position:0%
we get free that's sludge I mean I I I
 
00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
think the bottom line is here not to
 
00:21:32.190 --> 00:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
look at the compost as a revenue
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
generator but to understand that by
 
00:21:38.149 --> 00:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
diverting the food waste and also I mean
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
this can apply to to programs to do
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
better with
 
00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
recycling um the idea is to not be
 
00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:49.480 align:start position:0%
landfilling it to retain our capacity
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
and to do something better with our
 
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
trash I mean from my standpoint that's
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
about as yany a thing as a person could
 
00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:00.310 align:start position:0%
about as yany a thing as a person could
do

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
further from the
 
00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
committee Mr chairman repres Naval Linko
 
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
uh Rich alanco chesher 9 uh I have a
 
00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
question that the 900,000 what the
 
00:22:16.149 --> 00:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
estimate of a million bucks is based on
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
how how much you're going to expend
 
00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:20.360 align:start position:0%
annually or what period of time is this
 
00:22:22.029 --> 00:22:22.039 align:start position:0%
supposed to cover I know there are
 
00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
startup costs which I assume the
 
00:22:25.279 --> 00:22:26.510 align:start position:0%
startup costs which I assume the
$900,000

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
$900,000
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
that's currently in the fund
 
00:22:31.590 --> 00:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
goes a long way toward covering and then
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
there's some estimates of uh how how far
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
you expect the million bucks to go in
 
00:22:39.669 --> 00:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
terms of the number of uh so what is the
 
00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
the million bucks based
 
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
on uh it was uh not based on a lot like
 
00:22:49.909 --> 00:22:49.919 align:start position:0%
a lot of Appropriations for a grant
 
00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
program you put money into it in the
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
hopes that it's used to do the things
 
00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
you want it to do but I think it's
 
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
really difficult ult to estimate how
 
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
long a million dollars would last I mean
 
00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
we could you could ask the department
 
00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
this this question but I mean I know in
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
my own town they needed a new bailer so
 
00:23:14.789 --> 00:23:14.799 align:start position:0%
they could bail their aluminum cans you
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
know some people and that way if they
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
could bail more they could hold more and
 
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
then they could save on shipping because
 
00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:24.679 align:start position:0%
they weren't shipping it all at the same
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
time I mean for a compost program it C
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
could cost $500 to get it going I mean
 
00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
it kind of depends on what the grant
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
requests are that come in so it's I mean
 
00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
I I wouldn't see this as a program where
 
00:23:41.909 --> 00:23:41.919 align:start position:0%
somebody was going to come come in and
 
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
ask for
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
$250,000 at least that's not my
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
conception of it my conception of it is
 
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
to help small businesses grow and to
 
00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.630 align:start position:0%
to help small businesses grow and to
help

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
municipalities a follow-up question
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
please so in the town in your to
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
you said they went out and bought the
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
bins and what was the approximate cost
 
00:24:08.590 --> 00:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
no idea I mean it wasn't a lot it wasn't
 
00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:12.039 align:start position:0%
a lot um but you
 
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
know they they took a poll in the town
 
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
people were super excited to do uh
 
00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
composting the selectman looked at it
 
00:24:22.549 --> 00:24:22.559 align:start position:0%
they put some seed money into it we have
 
00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:25.240 align:start position:0%
a contract and you know as I said we've
 
00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:28.840 align:start position:0%
already diverted 32 tons of tra crash in
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
a year which is kind of
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
amazing well thank you thank you for the
 
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
answer representative Maguire thank you
 
00:24:41.389 --> 00:24:41.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you uh what fraction
 
00:24:44.350 --> 00:24:44.360 align:start position:0%
of the tonnage is from New
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I thought that I had
 
00:24:49.149 --> 00:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned that number so I didn't do the
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
exact calculation but we've got 1.9 to I
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
mean we've got we got the LBA here maybe
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
she can do the number um no I'm kidding
 
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
it's uh we we have uh
 
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
1.92 3 million total we've got
 
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
1.1 in state and we have 8
 
00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
820,000 out of state but that was 2022
 
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
that's the best I can do for you
 
00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:22.200 align:start position:0%
thank there's no further question thank
 
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:23.960 align:start position:0%
you very much your testimony everybody
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
note that we have a written copy passed
 
00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.669 align:start position:0%
note that we have a written copy passed
out

00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
next we'll call on uh Brody Dees from
 
00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.389 align:start position:0%
next we'll call on uh Brody Dees from
the

00:25:34.389 --> 00:25:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
nhma Welcome to the finance committee
 
00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you to
 
00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
the committee for taking my testimony
 
00:25:43.389 --> 00:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
today um uh my name is berie desay for
 
00:25:46.149 --> 00:25:46.159 align:start position:0%
the record I recog I I um represent the
 
00:25:47.789 --> 00:25:47.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Municipal Association I'm
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
here today to talk trash with all of you
 
00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
sorry I had to in yeah I know sorry guys
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
um so the goal of this bill is to help
 
00:26:03.430 --> 00:26:03.440 align:start position:0%
um municipalities fund
 
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
um the support and the initiatives for
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
local programs that will Pro that will
 
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
promote sustainable efficient and
 
00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
affordable um food and other organic
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
waste disposal um the ultimate goal will
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
be limiting the amount of tonnage of
 
00:26:18.630 --> 00:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
waste disposal that goes through whether
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
it's private or public landfills
 
00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately um these landfills are funded
 
00:26:26.029 --> 00:26:26.039 align:start position:0%
through tipping fees or other fee
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
schedules and any you know if you're in
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
municip it any difference in what they
 
00:26:32.350 --> 00:26:32.360 align:start position:0%
can't fund through their fee schedules
 
00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
will ultimately be funded by the
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer so in many ways we
 
00:26:37.470 --> 00:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
view this as priming the pump not just
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
for initial property tax relief for
 
00:26:41.549 --> 00:26:41.559 align:start position:0%
small programs that will uh create
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
better waste disposal practices more
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
sustainable waste disposal practices But
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
ultimately help local um governments
 
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
create better practices that will create
 
00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
cost savings longterm down the road so
 
00:26:55.750 --> 00:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
it's kind of thinking you know a uh an
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
ounce of cure today will save a uh a
 
00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
pound of cure tomorrow um or I should
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
say an ounce of prevention today
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
prevents a pound of cure tomorrow um
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
there are municipalities are interested
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
in using these funds as the
 
00:27:10.190 --> 00:27:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned you know it's
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
taking some time to hire someone to
 
00:27:14.269 --> 00:27:14.279 align:start position:0%
administer to the grant program which we
 
00:27:15.549 --> 00:27:15.559 align:start position:0%
understand in this labor market that can
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
be difficult but the interest is
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
certainly there New London is one
 
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:20.200 align:start position:0%
example but there are other
 
00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:22.200 align:start position:0%
municipalities um and we can do a poll
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
of our membership to get more specifics
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
but we know there are other
 
00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:27.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities that have you know not
 
00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
just express interest to us but I assume
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
also express interest to some of you on
 
00:27:33.549 --> 00:27:33.559 align:start position:0%
the finance committee um about this
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
program so um with that I'll take any
 
00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:40.039 align:start position:0%
questions um I only know so much about
 
00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
the waste disposal practices in our
 
00:27:44.549 --> 00:27:44.559 align:start position:0%
state so I'm willing to to try to answer
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
anything here and if there's anything I
 
00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:47.480 align:start position:0%
can't but the committee needs the
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
information I'll do some research on the
 
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
back end and get back to you guys thank
 
00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.470 --> 00:27:58.480 align:start position:0%
members seeing none thank you very much
 
00:28:01.909 --> 00:28:01.919 align:start position:0%
we'll next call on Reagan banet and he
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
has passed out a a written she has
 
00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:08.519 align:start position:0%
passed out a written U sheet of her
 
00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:11.360 align:start position:0%
testimony so you can follow it along
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you thank you thank you Mr
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee my name
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
is Reagan biset I'm the executive
 
00:28:19.950 --> 00:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
director of the Northeast resource
 
00:28:23.789 --> 00:28:23.799 align:start position:0%
recovery Association we are a nonprofit
 
00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
whose membership includes 90% of the
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
communities here in New Hampshire so
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
most to the communities represented uh
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
in this room and we help communities
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
with recycling composting and waste
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
reduction uh one of the things we do is
 
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
we actually help communities when they
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
have recycling that uh is ready to get
 
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
sent to a company to be recycled we
 
00:28:47.230 --> 00:28:47.240 align:start position:0%
actually help make that connection um we
 
00:28:48.909 --> 00:28:48.919 align:start position:0%
also provide a lot of education and
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
technical assistance to municipalities
 
00:28:54.029 --> 00:28:54.039 align:start position:0%
to support their programs and so one of
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
the things we do is work with
 
00:28:57.149 --> 00:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
communities on composting and food race
 
00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440 align:start position:0%
reduction and I can share that at our
 
00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
annual conference that we hold each year
 
00:29:05.789 --> 00:29:05.799 align:start position:0%
that brings about 300 people together
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
mostly from New Hampshire
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
municipalities last year at our postc
 
00:29:13.149 --> 00:29:13.159 align:start position:0%
conference survey the number one topic
 
00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:14.760 align:start position:0%
that communities wanted to learn more
 
00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:17.200 align:start position:0%
about at this year's conference was food
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
waste and composting and that was a bit
 
00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
of a surprise to us but I can say that
 
00:29:23.149 --> 00:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
anecdotally we hear quite a bit from
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
communities that they're interested in
 
00:29:27.509 --> 00:29:27.519 align:start position:0%
ways that they can reduce their food
 
00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
waste and reduce the food waste that
 
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
we're sending to landfills so as you
 
00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:34.519 align:start position:0%
heard from representative eel uh when we
 
00:29:36.549 --> 00:29:36.559 align:start position:0%
look at the waste that we are disposing
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
of in New Hampshire we know from
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
National numbers that approximately 24%
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
of that waste coming from municipalities
 
00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:46.919 align:start position:0%
and businesses is actually food waste so
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
it's a very significant component of the
 
00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:51.799 align:start position:0%
trash that we're disposing of and in the
 
00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:55.120 align:start position:0%
Northeast our municipalities are paying
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
more for disposal of trash compared to
 
00:29:59.950 --> 00:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
many other regions in the country in the
 
00:30:02.789 --> 00:30:02.799 align:start position:0%
continental US so it's it's a rather
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
expensive uh cost for our communities to
 
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
dispose of their trash so opportunities
 
00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:10.919 align:start position:0%
to divert food waste provides the
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
potential to reduce costs for our
 
00:30:16.029 --> 00:30:16.039 align:start position:0%
municipalities um specifically I wanted
 
00:30:20.029 --> 00:30:20.039 align:start position:0%
to highlight that uh the city of Lebanon
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
they started a pilot program to help
 
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:25.000 align:start position:0%
their residents take their food waste
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
and have it composted on site uh a few
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
years ago and what they found is that
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
during that pilot program the city had
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh about a 30%
 
00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
savings uh from composting that material
 
00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:41.320 align:start position:0%
on site instead of disposing of it in
 
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:43.640 align:start position:0%
the landfill that the city
 
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:46.600 align:start position:0%
operates now our organization put
 
00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
together a map for the entire State of
 
00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.519 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire showing all of the
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities that we're aware of that
 
00:30:54.110 --> 00:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
currently offer opportunities to
 
00:30:56.909 --> 00:30:56.919 align:start position:0%
Residents to compost or otherwise manage
 
00:30:59.389 --> 00:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
their food waste aside from disposal and
 
00:31:01.269 --> 00:31:01.279 align:start position:0%
we also have on that map all the
 
00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
businesses private businesses and Farms
 
00:31:05.710 --> 00:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
that we're aware of that provide those
 
00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:08.200 align:start position:0%
services and right now in terms of the
 
00:31:09.669 --> 00:31:09.679 align:start position:0%
communities that are participating it's
 
00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
about less than two dozen and in terms
 
00:31:14.470 --> 00:31:14.480 align:start position:0%
of the businesses we're aware of that
 
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:16.360 align:start position:0%
provide services in New Hampshire for
 
00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
communities to compost or otherwise
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
manage their food waste it's under two
 
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
dozen so there's maybe eight farms uh
 
00:31:28.389 --> 00:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 businesses so really there's a
 
00:31:33.710 --> 00:31:33.720 align:start position:0%
real opportunity to uh increase business
 
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
opportunities for Farms or other private
 
00:31:38.710 --> 00:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
businesses that would like to help
 
00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
communities reduce their food waste and
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
manage their food waste in a different
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
way um because when you look at that map
 
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of big holes right now so
 
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
you know our organization doesn't take a
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
position on bills as a matter of policy
 
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
but I hope that this testimony is
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
helpful to you all as you consider uh
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
how this bill uh might impact our
 
00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
communities here in New Hampshire so I'm
 
00:32:01.789 --> 00:32:01.799 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you might
 
00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
have questions from the
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
committee representative Edwards uh
 
00:32:09.389 --> 00:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Miss
 
00:32:13.990 --> 00:32:14.000 align:start position:0%
biset for taking the question I I um be
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
because we're A legislature we we end up
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
uh continuously looking at State driven
 
00:32:23.269 --> 00:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
Solutions and I'm just curious in your
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
experience or general awareness has
 
00:32:28.909 --> 00:32:28.919 align:start position:0%
another approach an alternative been
 
00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:32.360 align:start position:0%
tried anywhere where uh an effective
 
00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:35.559 align:start position:0%
public relations um effort is put
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
together to share with the public the
 
00:32:42.310 --> 00:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
facts around waste to encourage uh at
 
00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.669 align:start position:0%
facts around waste to encourage uh at
home

00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
home
 
00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:47.360 align:start position:0%
composting has there been efforts to get
 
00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
individuals involved in solving this
 
00:32:52.629 --> 00:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
problem instead of just going to a a
 
00:32:52.639 --> 00:32:54.190 align:start position:0%
problem instead of just going to a a
collective

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
collective
 
00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
solution certainly yes I mean both with
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
managing food waste in recycling um
 
00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
individual public education is always an
 
00:33:04.230 --> 00:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
important component of trying to spread
 
00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.029 align:start position:0%
important component of trying to spread
that

00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:07.430 --> 00:33:07.440 align:start position:0%
message I think what's challenging is at
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
the same time expecting individuals to
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
um each be managing their own food waste
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
in this instance um you know it's asking
 
00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of people and so it is easier and
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
more convenient for residents if their
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
municipality or say a local business is
 
00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:27.559 align:start position:0%
able to offer services for them you know
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
not everyone wants to compost in their
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
backyard um I used to compost in my own
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
backyard and eventually I was quite lazy
 
00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
about it and uh didn't turn the pile
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
enough and eventually you know some
 
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240 align:start position:0%
unpleasant odors came out and I found
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
that it was easier for me to work with a
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
local business that would haul away my
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
food scraps um but I think it's a lot to
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
expect individuals to go out and seek
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
out those resources on their own and so
 
00:33:53.549 --> 00:33:53.559 align:start position:0%
one of the benefits of knowing if your
 
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
community has that opportunity for you
 
00:33:56.549 --> 00:33:56.559 align:start position:0%
and you know your residents are
 
00:33:58.230 --> 00:33:58.240 align:start position:0%
participating it just makes it easy
 
00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
but yes absolutely education is always
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
an important component and you know can
 
00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
only have so much
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
success further from the committee nink
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Miss Des
 
00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:15.800 align:start position:0%
I have a it's not on the topic of waste
 
00:34:18.589 --> 00:34:18.599 align:start position:0%
food but it is on the general topic of U
 
00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
Solid Waste Management uh can you tell
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
us I mean My Town recently uh decided
 
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
not to recycle Plastics M and can you
 
00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
tell us what percentage of plastics
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
actually get
 
00:34:36.349 --> 00:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
recycled yes thank you for the question
 
00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer that so there's a
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
lot of confusion around Plastics
 
00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:43.760 align:start position:0%
understandably um again public education
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
can only go so far and there is some
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
misinformation sometimes so one thing
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
I'd like to start by saying is that if
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
you're if you are recycling Plastics or
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
any other material that your your town
 
00:34:59.790 --> 00:34:59.800 align:start position:0%
or say your business business says can
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
be put in your recycling bin you can
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
have a very high confidence that that's
 
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
being recycled now you might have heard
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
a number thrown around that only six or
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
seven or 8% of all Plastics are recycled
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
what that refers to is all the plastic
 
00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
that's ever been produced so that
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
includes the plastic in this microphone
 
00:35:23.150 --> 00:35:23.160 align:start position:0%
that includes the plastic on the
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
dashboard of your car that's all
 
00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
Plastics what that doesn't mean is that
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
only N9 or six or 7% of the plastic that
 
00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
you put in your recycling bin is is
 
00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
recycled so um I always let people know
 
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:38.200 align:start position:0%
recycle what your community says can be
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
accepted and you can be very confident
 
00:35:41.670 --> 00:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
that that is being
 
00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:43.190 align:start position:0%
that that is being
recycled

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
recycled
 
00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:45.280 align:start position:0%
did thank
 
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
you further from the
 
00:35:50.390 --> 00:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none we'll next call on
 
00:35:53.670 --> 00:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
director whimet from thank you the uh
 
00:35:55.910 --> 00:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
the Hampshire Department of
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
Services what I say Services security
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
have thank you for the correction thank
 
00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:14.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair we like to think we provide
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
some security as
 
00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:20.240 align:start position:0%
well uh good afternoon for the record my
 
00:36:22.030 --> 00:36:22.040 align:start position:0%
name is Mike whimet I service director
 
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.560 align:start position:0%
of the waste management division for New
 
00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:25.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees I'm joined today by
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
Michael Nor who heads up our materials
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
management education and planning
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
section and is uh very much engaged on
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
our work to advance food waste diversion
 
00:36:37.109 --> 00:36:37.119 align:start position:0%
um the the agency is not taking a
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but we do want to
 
00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
make ourselves available to committee
 
00:36:42.829 --> 00:36:42.839 align:start position:0%
for any questions you might have and I'd
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
just like to make a few remarks uh
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
keying off on some of the things that
 
00:36:49.309 --> 00:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
have been said already um indeed we're
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
working in Earnest on uh uh working on
 
00:36:54.270 --> 00:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
ruem to establish a grant program for
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
the solid waste management fund we
 
00:36:58.589 --> 00:36:58.599 align:start position:0%
anticipate great interest in that grant
 
00:37:00.670 --> 00:37:00.680 align:start position:0%
program um on the on the part of
 
00:37:02.510 --> 00:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities because really
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities for most people are kind
 
00:37:06.309 --> 00:37:06.319 align:start position:0%
of where it's at with respect to their
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
household Waste Management they either
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
have a municipality that arranges for
 
00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
curbside pickup and disposal of their
 
00:37:14.230 --> 00:37:14.240 align:start position:0%
waste or they have a municipality that
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
operates a transfer station where they
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
go every week to take their trash and
 
00:37:20.309 --> 00:37:20.319 align:start position:0%
recyclables so we expect them to be a
 
00:37:22.349 --> 00:37:22.359 align:start position:0%
key uh recipients of some of the grants
 
00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:24.520 align:start position:0%
that we would expect to make we also
 
00:37:26.829 --> 00:37:26.839 align:start position:0%
anticipate that um private entities and
 
00:37:29.109 --> 00:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
farmers and others who have already
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
established compost programs who or who
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
wish to start them um will come to this
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
Grand program to try to would either if
 
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
they already have a Compost Facility
 
00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
they would try to you know make some
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
Capital Investments to advance the
 
00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
amount of capacity that they have to to
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
treat compost um and also uh new
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
startups that want to start and and we
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
really I mean the whole purpose of the
 
00:37:52.190 --> 00:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
food wasteband for the large generators
 
00:37:55.309 --> 00:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
of food waste was to try to incentivize
 
00:37:57.829 --> 00:37:57.839 align:start position:0%
um the development of a network of
 
00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
facilities um of different types and
 
00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
different technologies that could manage
 
00:38:04.270 --> 00:38:04.280 align:start position:0%
food waste we also anticipate that one
 
00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:07.160 align:start position:0%
or more anerobic digestor outfits might
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
come in looking for some matching money
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
to advance that technology and and
 
00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
provide that service to particularly for
 
00:38:15.270 --> 00:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
that's an actually a very good
 
00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
technology can work really well for
 
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
single stream types sort of a very
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
reliable kind of food waste which might
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
become from a manufacturer or from a
 
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
grocery store or something like that and
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
then um we also anticipate that some of
 
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
the uh entities that are subject to the
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
food waste band these are the folks who
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
generate more than a ton per week of
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
food waste um may come to us saying we
 
00:38:40.030 --> 00:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
could use some assistance in developing
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
or or capitalizing certain you know
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for managing go trans
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
transitioning from disposing of our food
 
00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
waste in the dumpster to collecting it
 
00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
in some fashion and then transporting it
 
00:38:53.589 --> 00:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
to a facility that can uh that can
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
divert it from disposal so um with that
 
00:38:58.550 --> 00:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
there was also some talk about education
 
00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
and we certainly um you know we we've
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
been working very hard to advance our
 
00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:04.720 align:start position:0%
website and the amount of Outreach that
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
we do we work very closely with a solid
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
waste working group as the chair as the
 
00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor has indicated um to uh look at
 
00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
uh really advancing our education and
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
Outreach I would note that you know um
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
the the hard part about using solely
 
00:39:22.630 --> 00:39:22.640 align:start position:0%
education or Outreach to try to advance
 
00:39:25.349 --> 00:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
a new way to manage waste is that it's
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
really hard to get more convenient then
 
00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:29.200 align:start position:0%
everything you generate you just throw
 
00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:30.640 align:start position:0%
in the trash and somebody picks it up
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
and makes it go away that's really hard
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
to compete with so um that's one of the
 
00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
reasons the food wasteband was
 
00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:39.079 align:start position:0%
implemented because it is really hard to
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
convince people that it's you know
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
there's anything easier than just
 
00:39:44.710 --> 00:39:44.720 align:start position:0%
throwing it away and because they don't
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
see necessarily the impacts of that or
 
00:39:49.349 --> 00:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
even necessarily directly the the cost
 
00:39:51.589 --> 00:39:51.599 align:start position:0%
impacts um there sometimes need to be
 
00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
some kind of incentivization the solid
 
00:39:55.829 --> 00:39:55.839 align:start position:0%
waste management fund the food waste
 
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
band provides sort of incentivization to
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
say okay if you're a big generator and
 
00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
you've got access to a facility near you
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
that can handle this in a way that isn't
 
00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
landfill disposal then we're going to
 
00:40:08.069 --> 00:40:08.079 align:start position:0%
expect you to Avail yourself of that
 
00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:10.440 align:start position:0%
kind of service um that's one way to
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
incentivize it but the other way is to
 
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
provide these matching grants to help
 
00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
defay the costs of the initial Capital
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
cost of developing these facilities and
 
00:40:21.069 --> 00:40:21.079 align:start position:0%
that's what we envision the grants that
 
00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:23.440 align:start position:0%
will be making um under this program to
 
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
to really help help to to accomplish and
 
00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
with that I I open it to
 
00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:31.480 align:start position:0%
questions representative Maguire thank
 
00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
00:40:36.030 --> 00:40:36.040 align:start position:0%
Winson um we heard that the fund
 
00:40:39.510 --> 00:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
currently has $900,000 is that correct
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
and when do you expect to make the first
 
00:40:43.309 --> 00:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
grant that's right we we're working in
 
00:40:45.309 --> 00:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
Earnest on rule making we we we don't do
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
much without rule making first and so
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
we're working on rule making we expect
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
that to happen over the next several
 
00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:52.760 align:start position:0%
months and certainly conservatively
 
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
speaking we would expect that by
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
calendar year end we'd be in a position
 
00:40:58.829 --> 00:40:58.839 align:start position:0%
to start a iing and soliciting Grant
 
00:41:02.589 --> 00:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
program representative
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
priest thank you Mr chairman for take
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that there was a food
 
00:41:16.829 --> 00:41:16.839 align:start position:0%
waste ban in the state that's correct
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
that just became effective this month
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
actually and uh essentially for
 
00:41:23.349 --> 00:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
generators of food waste who generate
 
00:41:26.910 --> 00:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
more than one ton per week of food waste
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh if they have access to a facility
 
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
within 25 miles of their facility that
 
00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:35.800 align:start position:0%
can process that food waste and accept
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
it in a manner other than landfill
 
00:41:40.150 --> 00:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
disposal then they're banned from from
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
disposing of that food waste in a
 
00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:44.319 align:start position:0%
landfill now has to be said this is a
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
brand new program we're really working
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
on education and Outreach we're not out
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
there we don't have cops out there
 
00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:52.079 align:start position:0%
looking to bust somebody because they
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
disposed of their food waste we're
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
working right now on doing a food waste
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
study to understand understand that
 
00:41:59.710 --> 00:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
Universe better and then we'll spend a
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
lot of time trying to get out and
 
00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
educating those folks on how they can
 
00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
comply with the ban okay fur as a
 
00:42:10.270 --> 00:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
follow-up question um does the
 
00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
have kind of an overreach goal of how
 
00:42:21.150 --> 00:42:21.160 align:start position:0%
much waste they're wanting to divert by
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
what year and and how are we getting
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
closer to that goal sure great great
 
00:42:29.549 --> 00:42:29.559 align:start position:0%
question we we do we have a legislative
 
00:42:31.630 --> 00:42:31.640 align:start position:0%
directive actually that there's a a goal
 
00:42:34.109 --> 00:42:34.119 align:start position:0%
was established by the legislature to
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of waste that is
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
disposed of in landfills or incinerators
 
00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:43.480 align:start position:0%
um by 25% by the year 2030 and then by
 
00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
45% by the year 2050 that's what's in
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
the statute right now and um we're
 
00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:50.960 align:start position:0%
working towards that the I have to say
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group which is
 
00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
chaired by this build sponsor has been
 
00:42:57.549 --> 00:42:57.559 align:start position:0%
you know have meeting monthly really now
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
for a couple of years to really try to
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
advance the kind of policy and programs
 
00:43:04.589 --> 00:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
that will help us achieve that uh ways
 
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
that we we do hope to do that the food
 
00:43:07.870 --> 00:43:07.880 align:start position:0%
waste band is actually a great one
 
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
because it just so happens that uh at
 
00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:13.880 align:start position:0%
least probably around 25% of the weight
 
00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
of of the tonnage of of waste that is
 
00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
disposed of in a landfill is is is
 
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
identified as likely being organic or
 
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
food waste so if we can make significant
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
progress on that piece that gets us a
 
00:43:28.390 --> 00:43:28.400 align:start position:0%
long way to that goal
 
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:31.960 align:start position:0%
goal I'm okay one more question um and
 
00:43:35.069 --> 00:43:35.079 align:start position:0%
again what I've been hearing is that
 
00:43:37.589 --> 00:43:37.599 align:start position:0%
with this food waste
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
recycling uh that's being proposed um
 
00:43:42.870 --> 00:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
and the food waste
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
band 25% of
 
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
the of the total tonnage could be
 
00:43:52.109 --> 00:43:52.119 align:start position:0%
diverted and could be reused is that
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
correct uh I think you know I don't
 
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
think that the food waste B alone going
 
00:43:59.910 --> 00:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
to achieve that we we've got other U you
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
know work that we're doing we're trying
 
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
to advance even simple recycling um in
 
00:44:07.349 --> 00:44:07.359 align:start position:0%
terms of uh you know the the solid waste
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
management fund is not just for food
 
00:44:12.270 --> 00:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
waste grants it's for Grants to do for
 
00:44:14.069 --> 00:44:14.079 align:start position:0%
anybody that's going to advance a
 
00:44:17.230 --> 00:44:17.240 align:start position:0%
technology or a facility or provide um
 
00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
something that's going to move the
 
00:44:21.069 --> 00:44:21.079 align:start position:0%
needle on reducing the amount of overall
 
00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:23.960 align:start position:0%
waste that we dispose of so as the chair
 
00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
as as the sponsor of the bill mentioned
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
if uh if someone comes in and wants a
 
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
small grant to get a baor because it'll
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of a certain type of
 
00:44:34.109 --> 00:44:34.119 align:start position:0%
plastic or aluminum that they can
 
00:44:36.510 --> 00:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
recycle that's a great fit and then we
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
can make a grant for that they can get
 
00:44:40.390 --> 00:44:40.400 align:start position:0%
that and uh you know anything on the way
 
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
on up to an anerobic digestion facility
 
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to have you know a
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
significant in investment of capital
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
that wants some assistance to to uh to
 
00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:51.400 align:start position:0%
to try to set up something like that for
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
food waste so it it really runs the
 
00:44:55.150 --> 00:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
gamut of the waste types and we're going
 
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
to be trying to attack it on all fronts
 
00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards for a
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
question uh uh thank you uh Mr shair I I
 
00:45:06.870 --> 00:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
I I heard in your testimony that um uh
 
00:45:09.630 --> 00:45:09.640 align:start position:0%
education alone won't move the needle
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
much at least that's my interpretation
 
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
and part of your testimony as as
 
00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
somebody who consumes a lot of media I
 
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:19.480 align:start position:0%
don't believe I have ever seen a public
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
relations piece uh encouraging uh
 
00:45:25.790 --> 00:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
families to take care of their own food
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
waste issues and
 
00:45:30.069 --> 00:45:30.079 align:start position:0%
so so I guess I have a a two-part
 
00:45:32.829 --> 00:45:32.839 align:start position:0%
question in here is you know uh are you
 
00:45:35.710 --> 00:45:35.720 align:start position:0%
aware of any communities anywhere in the
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
country that have tried to get the
 
00:45:41.710 --> 00:45:41.720 align:start position:0%
public more directly involved in
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
self-sufficiency uh and and uh if if if
 
00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
you thought about it how much would it
 
00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:52.280 align:start position:0%
cost for us to do a test pilot on um a a
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
public relations campaign in lie of uh
 
00:45:59.470 --> 00:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
grants to build more government
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
infrastructure that that's a great
 
00:46:02.950 --> 00:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
question and I please don't take my
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
remarks to suggest that education isn't
 
00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:06.760 align:start position:0%
important to us at the department it
 
00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
very much is and we spend a lot of time
 
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
and effort uh advancing that I think
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's both and really in this
 
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
case um as far as um there certainly
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
have we our ability in the department um
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
to spend a lot of time in resources on
 
00:46:23.549 --> 00:46:23.559 align:start position:0%
Outreach has been somewhat limited
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
because for many years our program was
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
very resource deficient
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
and um we have only recently um in the
 
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
last few years gotten a hand a couple of
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
staff that can work full-time on this
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
and they have done some great things we
 
00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:38.599 align:start position:0%
have a website that's really helpful now
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
that can help instruct people on what
 
00:46:42.870 --> 00:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
they can do with any type any any any
 
00:46:44.589 --> 00:46:44.599 align:start position:0%
number of types of ways for recycling
 
00:46:47.069 --> 00:46:47.079 align:start position:0%
and what have you I'm certainly I I
 
00:46:48.829 --> 00:46:48.839 align:start position:0%
don't have any specific examples but I'm
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
sure that there are other states that
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
have done exactly what you said where
 
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
they where they have um Outreach to help
 
00:46:57.230 --> 00:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
people encourage people to home compost
 
00:46:59.549 --> 00:46:59.559 align:start position:0%
a longtime home composter I live in a
 
00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
setting where it it makes sense to do
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
that if I lived here in town my
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
neighbors might not appreciate it very
 
00:47:06.589 --> 00:47:06.599 align:start position:0%
much but where I live I can do it and it
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
works great and that as a first instance
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
it I I compost my own food scraps and it
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
advances my own garden so it works great
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
for me but for many people um who who
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
either aren't interested in that or or
 
00:47:21.309 --> 00:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
don't have the setting for it um
 
00:47:24.309 --> 00:47:24.319 align:start position:0%
disposing of food waste um in a way that
 
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:26.200 align:start position:0%
gets it to a facility where it can be
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
composted even though it's not in their
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.150 --> 00:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
goal represent
 
00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
lean thank you Mr chairman and nice to
 
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:41.079 align:start position:0%
see you Mike a question on Sear charges
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
would the department support assessing a
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
search charge per ton of
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
waste I'm not in a position to say what
 
00:47:50.950 --> 00:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
our position would be at this point um I
 
00:47:52.349 --> 00:47:52.359 align:start position:0%
can tell you that that is something we
 
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
have explored over over time over
 
00:47:56.829 --> 00:47:56.839 align:start position:0%
several years and as you know it takes
 
00:47:59.589 --> 00:47:59.599 align:start position:0%
takes a certain set of circumstances
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
where there's support for that both at
 
00:48:03.549 --> 00:48:03.559 align:start position:0%
the legislative level and the governor's
 
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
level um and but certainly it's
 
00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
something we're willing to work with the
 
00:48:09.510 --> 00:48:09.520 align:start position:0%
committee on it it's it's easy math
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
right representative e is absolutely
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
correct it's about 2 million tons of
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
waste that are disposed of uh in
 
00:48:17.910 --> 00:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
landfills or in our one waste energy
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
facility each year and so every dollar
 
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
of a SE charge would likely raise $2
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
million so that you know those kinds of
 
00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:29.760 align:start position:0%
revenues could really uh pay for what
 
00:48:31.710 --> 00:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
currently is a general funded program
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
our our you know for argument sake let's
 
00:48:36.990 --> 00:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
say a $2 tipping fee a s charge that
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
could provide $4 million which would
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
essentially cover all the operating
 
00:48:43.549 --> 00:48:43.559 align:start position:0%
costs of our Solid Waste program and
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
leave ample funds to make annual grants
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
for advancing waste reduction thank you
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman represent
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
Daniels thank you Mr chairman how many
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
pro processing facilities exist in
 
00:48:59.510 --> 00:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh you mean processing for
 
00:49:01.630 --> 00:49:01.640 align:start position:0%
food waste yes I don't sure I know the
 
00:49:03.470 --> 00:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
answer Mike Mike might more likely know
 
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
the answer so we we currently have 10
 
00:49:08.470 --> 00:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
operating permitted composting
 
00:49:10.950 --> 00:49:10.960 align:start position:0%
facilities in the state those are the
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
the facilities that are permitted to
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
accept food waste for composting okay
 
00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh followup followup
 
00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:20.720 align:start position:0%
um with the
 
00:49:23.309 --> 00:49:23.319 align:start position:0%
budgets I from what I've seen throughout
 
00:49:28.150 --> 00:49:28.160 align:start position:0%
the state really tight this year uh what
 
00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:29.920 align:start position:0%
makes you think the priorities are going
 
00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:34.400 align:start position:0%
to be given to Solid Waste uh reduction
 
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
as opposed to uh increasing Road the the
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
quality of the roads and plowing and uh
 
00:49:42.670 --> 00:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
other things that towns and
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities need to take care of I
 
00:49:47.069 --> 00:49:47.079 align:start position:0%
don't honestly know where the priorities
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
will be um you know our job here in the
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
waste division is to um Implement our
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
programs to the best of our ability it's
 
00:49:55.549 --> 00:49:55.559 align:start position:0%
up to the legislature to decide where
 
00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
the funding priorities will
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
go one final final so I guess the the
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
root of my question is if we took this
 
00:50:03.599 --> 00:50:04.789 align:start position:0%
root of my question is if we took this
million

00:50:04.789 --> 00:50:04.799 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:50:07.710 --> 00:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
dollars what are the chances that people
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
are going to be going after the
 
00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:13.480 align:start position:0%
grants oh I think that as opposed to the
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
other priorities that they need to take
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
take care of because it is a 50/50 Grant
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
sure we have very close working
 
00:50:21.789 --> 00:50:21.799 align:start position:0%
relationship with our municipalities
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
I'll take them as an example because I
 
00:50:24.789 --> 00:50:24.799 align:start position:0%
think they would be kind of our first
 
00:50:27.150 --> 00:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
inline customers for these grants
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
um they work very hard they they're very
 
00:50:30.789 --> 00:50:30.799 align:start position:0%
aware of the costs that are associated
 
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
with their management of waste and I you
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
know I wouldn't expect them to
 
00:50:36.750 --> 00:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily frivolously want to go
 
00:50:38.670 --> 00:50:38.680 align:start position:0%
Advance a program that on balance was
 
00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
going to cost them more money than than
 
00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
it than it saved them but for the
 
00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
reasons I think you heard from the other
 
00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
Witnesses um a small investment such as
 
00:50:49.789 --> 00:50:49.799 align:start position:0%
a Bor for example um Can often pay for
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
itself quite quickly um because of the
 
00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
increase revenues from collecting
 
00:50:57.309 --> 00:50:57.319 align:start position:0%
recyclables um
 
00:50:59.589 --> 00:50:59.599 align:start position:0%
uh advancing making small investment in
 
00:51:01.470 --> 00:51:01.480 align:start position:0%
a composting program at the municipal
 
00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
level could save uh you know essentially
 
00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
you know representative eil talked about
 
00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:11.480 align:start position:0%
the $60 to $80 a ton uh rate that uh you
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
know was reported to exist in New
 
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I actually think those numbers
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
might be a little dated I'm hearing
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
higher numbers now and the new contracts
 
00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
that are being executed between
 
00:51:22.230 --> 00:51:22.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities and waste haulers are
 
00:51:24.829 --> 00:51:24.839 align:start position:0%
much closer to the $100 a ton level um
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
so when you think about it that that way
 
00:51:29.270 --> 00:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
if a municip even a small municipality
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
can avoid 10 tons of uh of uh of food
 
00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:35.559 align:start position:0%
waste going into their dumpster and
 
00:51:38.030 --> 00:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
hauled off to the landfill that's $1,000
 
00:51:40.829 --> 00:51:40.839 align:start position:0%
savings right there so um I think that
 
00:51:42.309 --> 00:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
there will be great interest in that
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
even in and maybe even because we having
 
00:51:48.549 --> 00:51:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
times representative R thank you Mr
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you Mr whsa it's nice to
 
00:51:55.950 --> 00:51:55.960 align:start position:0%
see you again um aside from the savings
 
00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:57.030 align:start position:0%
see you again um aside from the savings
on

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:57.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
property taxes that people spend you
 
00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
know when to operate a transfer station
 
00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:05.480 align:start position:0%
or a landfill in their town and um and
 
00:52:07.950 --> 00:52:07.960 align:start position:0%
also the fact that diverting
 
00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:10.760 align:start position:0%
waste provides a longer lifespan for
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
that landfill are there any other
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
benefits to keeping food waste out of a
 
00:52:18.030 --> 00:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
landfill there are um you know one of
 
00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
the the managing a landfill is a complex
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
activity and one of the things that
 
00:52:24.349 --> 00:52:24.359 align:start position:0%
makes it complex is that landfills
 
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
generate landfill gas which is primar
 
00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
methane and um the reason that they
 
00:52:31.230 --> 00:52:31.240 align:start position:0%
generate gas is because when you put
 
00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
waste in a landfill the organic material
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
like food waste and organic waste um
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
eventually you know consume all the
 
00:52:40.789 --> 00:52:40.799 align:start position:0%
oxygen in their degradation they create
 
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
an anerobic environment and then at that
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
point all the degradation that happens
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
converts that food waste or or other
 
00:52:50.109 --> 00:52:50.119 align:start position:0%
organic waste to methane and so that
 
00:52:52.470 --> 00:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
methane then needs to be collected uh
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
and we work really hard to make sure our
 
00:52:55.789 --> 00:52:55.799 align:start position:0%
landfills have systems for collecting
 
00:52:57.670 --> 00:52:57.680 align:start position:0%
and flaring or burning that gas for
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
energy recovery in some cases but the
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
reality is is that even the best run
 
00:53:03.789 --> 00:53:03.799 align:start position:0%
landfill is going to have some
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
significant fugitive emissions of
 
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
methane and methane is a is a greenhouse
 
00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:10.280 align:start position:0%
gas it's a it contributes to climate
 
00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:13.240 align:start position:0%
change so it's uh anything we can do to
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of organic loading in
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
our landfills will tend to reduce the
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
significantly the amount of methane
 
00:53:22.069 --> 00:53:22.079 align:start position:0%
that's generated by those landfills can
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
I can I add on to that that also an
 
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:26.200 align:start position:0%
issue of concern to the legislature of
 
00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
late has been leech a and organic waste
 
00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
in in landfills contributes to leech a
 
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
because it contains moisture and as that
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
organic waste breaks down it releases
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
that moisture which then filters out as
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
leachate so it's another way to uh look
 
00:53:42.630 --> 00:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
at the benefits of of removing food
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
waste from
 
00:53:47.589 --> 00:53:47.599 align:start position:0%
landfills home home composting isn't too
 
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
bad I've been doing it for 50 years you
 
00:53:52.829 --> 00:53:52.839 align:start position:0%
do need a shredder and I've had the same
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
Shredder for 30 years and I break up a
 
00:53:57.549 --> 00:53:57.559 align:start position:0%
big pile of leaves covered over it with
 
00:54:01.109 --> 00:54:01.119 align:start position:0%
a with a tarp two three times a week I
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
take my bucket of garbage and throw in a
 
00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:06.920 align:start position:0%
start up the machine throw in a armful
 
00:54:10.109 --> 00:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
of leaves throw in the garbage behind it
 
00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
I separate the meat and the and the uh
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
bone scraps and they disappear from the
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
raccoons and the and the fox and the
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
crows and the only problem it's been
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
lately is the uh turkeys come and tear
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
the tear it apart looking for worms and
 
00:54:31.230 --> 00:54:31.240 align:start position:0%
spread it out more than I'd like but
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
I've always had a good amount of
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
fertilizer and been doing it for 50
 
00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
years anything
 
00:54:40.349 --> 00:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
else represent McGuire thank you Mr
 
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:42.640 align:start position:0%
chairman do you know what the Tipping
 
00:54:45.270 --> 00:54:45.280 align:start position:0%
fees and search charges if any are in
 
00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
the state of
 
00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:49.799 align:start position:0%
Maine um I can't say I know the specific
 
00:54:51.789 --> 00:54:51.799 align:start position:0%
numbers but that question is difficult
 
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:53.400 align:start position:0%
even in New Hampshire it's hard for me
 
00:54:55.549 --> 00:54:55.559 align:start position:0%
to say because everybody who has a
 
00:54:58.349 --> 00:54:58.359 align:start position:0%
contract with a waste huler disposer has
 
00:55:00.630 --> 00:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
their price and it's based on it's
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
Market based it's based on the amount
 
00:55:04.589 --> 00:55:04.599 align:start position:0%
it's based on a whole bunch of things so
 
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's hard to say my my understanding is
 
00:55:08.990 --> 00:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
that those rates are probably in line
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
with what we're seeing in New
 
00:55:13.829 --> 00:55:13.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if if the question was about
 
00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:16.839 align:start position:0%
sear charges that are paid on top of
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
tipping fees we can get you that
 
00:55:20.349 --> 00:55:20.359 align:start position:0%
information we have that information for
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
the state of main I just don't have it
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
on hand thank you if you give it to the
 
00:55:26.470 --> 00:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
LBA they'll be able to distribute it to
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
okay and and presumably that would give
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
you tonnage and other
 
00:55:34.710 --> 00:55:34.720 align:start position:0%
information because you would know x per
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
ton plus total you know thank you all
 
00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:40.559 align:start position:0%
right we've got another bill we got to
 
00:55:45.029 --> 00:55:45.039 align:start position:0%
move on to um the plan is that 619 will
 
00:55:48.069 --> 00:55:48.079 align:start position:0%
go to division one and they will
 
00:55:51.549 --> 00:55:51.559 align:start position:0%
be and they will be uh working on it for
 
00:55:54.270 --> 00:55:54.280 align:start position:0%
exing I plan an exec session on the
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
bills that have been uh
 
00:55:59.589 --> 00:55:59.599 align:start position:0%
done through division one for next what
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
did I say Tuesday at 1 10 Tuesday at 10
 
00:56:05.510 --> 00:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
Tuesday at 10 o'clock next Tuesday at 10
 
00:56:08.029 --> 00:56:08.039 align:start position:0%
o'clock we'll have an exact session on
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
probably four or five bills yeah I think
 
00:56:11.789 --> 00:56:11.799 align:start position:0%
it'll take two minutes because they're
 
00:56:15.109 --> 00:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
all retained right so well we need to be
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
here anyway all right we'll close the
 
00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:21.240 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 619 as I say it's
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
going to division one for further I have
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
a a blue sheet with only signed by Brody
 
00:56:32.150 --> 00:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
Dees but I also have um the house remote
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
testified bill has 49 people in support
 
00:56:39.430 --> 00:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
three opposed one neutral so those will
 
00:56:42.230 --> 00:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
go in the record as well uh it seems to
 
00:56:45.069 --> 00:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
be a well supported Bill and we'll get
 
00:56:49.710 --> 00:56:49.720 align:start position:0%
ready now for next to uh House Bill 519
 
00:56:54.309 --> 00:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.829 --> 00:56:56.839 align:start position:0%
three Amendment as
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%

00:57:35.670 --> 00:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
non- gerine amendment to HB 519 the
 
00:57:38.589 --> 00:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
Senate uh the speaker uh approved this
 
00:57:42.309 --> 00:57:42.319 align:start position:0%
as a non- gerine Amendment um for some
 
00:57:42.319 --> 00:57:43.109 align:start position:0%
as a non- gerine Amendment um for some
some

00:57:43.109 --> 00:57:43.119 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:57:46.349 --> 00:57:46.359 align:start position:0%
background uh the this committee uh
 
00:57:50.510 --> 00:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
heard HB 519 referred it to division 3
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
division 3 uh had testimony on the
 
00:57:58.870 --> 00:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
28th um uh that this bill is a a good
 
00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
bill it recognizes Waypoint as a vital
 
00:58:06.670 --> 00:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
service provider for homeless services
 
00:58:10.309 --> 00:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
for uh 18 to 24 year olds it's kind of a
 
00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
unique service in the state something
 
00:58:16.109 --> 00:58:16.119 align:start position:0%
that the governor wanted but didn't get
 
00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
it into the budget uh DHHS wanted it but
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
didn't get in in the budget so uh
 
00:58:24.710 --> 00:58:24.720 align:start position:0%
representative walner and others uh did
 
00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.029 align:start position:0%
representative walner and others uh did
519

00:58:27.029 --> 00:58:27.039 align:start position:0%
519
 
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh it's like I said it's a good bill on
 
00:58:36.150 --> 00:58:36.160 align:start position:0%
the 28th of of um January um uh at the
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
50 minute and 50c Mark I made a
 
00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
commitment to uh the people who run
 
00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
Waypoint that the language of
 
00:58:48.430 --> 00:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
519 was going to be protected we were
 
00:58:50.710 --> 00:58:50.720 align:start position:0%
going to move the language of
 
00:58:54.950 --> 00:58:54.960 align:start position:0%
519 into the budget but I did not commit
 
00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
to a dollar amount I just said you know
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
we don't know how much money we're going
 
00:59:01.470 --> 00:59:01.480 align:start position:0%
to have but I'm not going to lose your
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
language that that's on the record uh in
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh in U on the from the 28th so what I'm
 
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
proposing to do today is to take
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
59 um and take this uh non- gerain
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh and have this non jurain
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
Amendment tweaked a little bit so that
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
it becomes a replace all it it's it's
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
not quite a replace all right now this
 
00:59:32.589 --> 00:59:32.599 align:start position:0%
amendment uh would become an additional
 
00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
section and and so I'm I'm I'm I'm
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
recommending we replace all uh with a
 
00:59:41.069 --> 00:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
new section and this new section is to
 
00:59:44.990 --> 00:59:45.000 align:start position:0%
amend current statute which is RSA
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
151 by adding a section that says that
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
the violation of the patient Bill of
 
00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
Rights the Department of Health and
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
Human Services shall not contract with
 
01:00:00.910 --> 01:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
any Hospital found in violation of any
 
01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:05.920 align:start position:0%
section of RSA 151 colon 21 the patients
 
01:00:09.029 --> 01:00:09.039 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights so in a way this is not
 
01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
new policy the patient Bill of Rights
 
01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
has been debated and it is in statute um
 
01:00:17.309 --> 01:00:17.319 align:start position:0%
the issue gets to be one of uh helping
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
to encourage uh our hospitals to comply
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
with the patient Bill of Rights there's
 
01:00:26.549 --> 01:00:26.559 align:start position:0%
been a rather spectacular case
 
01:00:27.990 --> 01:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh that's been that we've been made
 
01:00:31.309 --> 01:00:31.319 align:start position:0%
aware of and um so we we've had
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
Advocates come and ask that we do a
 
01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:37.880 align:start position:0%
little bit more to take the existing
 
01:00:40.870 --> 01:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
policy of the state and try to do what
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
we can to encourage the hospitals to
 
01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
cooperate with um our legislative intent
 
01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:51.880 align:start position:0%
to have the patient Bill of Rights uh
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
respected so so that's what this non-
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
gerain amendment would do again I I
 
01:00:59.829 --> 01:00:59.839 align:start position:0%
propose a tweak to it to make it a
 
01:01:04.710 --> 01:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
replace all use 519 as the carrier have
 
01:01:08.789 --> 01:01:08.799 align:start position:0%
us execut next week if if we like it
 
01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:10.760 align:start position:0%
enough to send it to the house I'd like
 
01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
to have the house take a position on it
 
01:01:16.470 --> 01:01:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's why uh I I I want to get it to
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
the house floor so that it's not some
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
Finance um in in the
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
darkness sticking it in it's a it's a
 
01:01:27.549 --> 01:01:27.559 align:start position:0%
position of the house if we do it that
 
01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
way I'll take any
 
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
questions representative tki thank you
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you representative for
 
01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:38.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question um can you please
 
01:01:40.510 --> 01:01:40.520 align:start position:0%
share how many hospitals actually
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
contract with the
 
01:01:46.349 --> 01:01:46.359 align:start position:0%
state any that do in the future would be
 
01:01:49.109 --> 01:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
subjected to this law so regardless of
 
01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:51.240 align:start position:0%
what the number is today this is a
 
01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:53.640 align:start position:0%
future oriented Bill and any future
 
01:01:56.029 --> 01:01:56.039 align:start position:0%
contracts with any Hospital would need
 
01:01:59.589 --> 01:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
to comply I think we have on the order
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
of um of Mr Bradley is here I I think we
 
01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
have on the order of about 23 hospitals
 
01:02:09.349 --> 01:02:09.359 align:start position:0%
of varying sizes throughout the state
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
but he can he can provide a better
 
01:02:15.630 --> 01:02:15.640 align:start position:0%
number than that PA I think anytime
 
01:02:18.829 --> 01:02:18.839 align:start position:0%
there's a Medicare Medicare patient and
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
half the money is coming from the state
 
01:02:23.829 --> 01:02:23.839 align:start position:0%
so virtually anybody that has Medicare
 
01:02:28.150 --> 01:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
I was just trying to determine how many
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
uh what it would en Encompass in terms
 
01:02:35.269 --> 01:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
of the the scope of this so may I just
 
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
have a a followup follow thank you I
 
01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate it um I know that the the
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
case that you just alluded to and didn't
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
go into detail about um but is there um
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
any record of how many violations of the
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights has occurred or
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
is this just um an attempt at that one
 
01:02:58.910 --> 01:02:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:01.549 --> 01:03:01.559 align:start position:0%
what was exposed was an anecdotal
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
example of a grotesque failure to
 
01:03:06.910 --> 01:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
respect the Bill of Rights where
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
potentially life-saving uh Health Care
 
01:03:12.349 --> 01:03:12.359 align:start position:0%
intervention was being denied because
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
the person refused the covid shot it was
 
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
it wasn't just an incident it was an
 
01:03:20.630 --> 01:03:20.640 align:start position:0%
extremely serious and bizarre incident
 
01:03:23.349 --> 01:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
in my view and and it's clearly a
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
violation of the Bill of Rights where
 
01:03:28.510 --> 01:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
it's says vaccine status should not be
 
01:03:32.470 --> 01:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
affected now anecdotally i' I've heard
 
01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:34.240 align:start position:0%
that there are other cases that are
 
01:03:38.349 --> 01:03:38.359 align:start position:0%
having similar problems because uh the
 
01:03:38.359 --> 01:03:39.549 align:start position:0%
having similar problems because uh the
the

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:03:39.559 --> 01:03:41.710 align:start position:0%
the
offending

01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
offending
 
01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
hospital changed their policy enough to
 
01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
let non-id people get services but any
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
other other vaccines that they thought
 
01:03:55.990 --> 01:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
were necessary or mandatory uh was still
 
01:04:02.150 --> 01:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
the cost for denial of U of care and um
 
01:04:04.269 --> 01:04:04.279 align:start position:0%
I I haven't had an opportunity to
 
01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
corroborate those anecdotal examples
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
beyond the the one that made the news
 
01:04:11.950 --> 01:04:11.960 align:start position:0%
that required our speaker to get
 
01:04:14.029 --> 01:04:14.039 align:start position:0%
personally involved and the AG to get
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
personally involved but uh but what this
 
01:04:20.349 --> 01:04:20.359 align:start position:0%
would do is just make it really clear to
 
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
everyone involved that the legislature
 
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
and the governor uh approved approved
 
01:04:28.670 --> 01:04:28.680 align:start position:0%
the patient Bill of Rights and we did it
 
01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:31.160 align:start position:0%
because we wanted it to be followed and
 
01:04:34.349 --> 01:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
this isn't a new requirement it's an
 
01:04:37.029 --> 01:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
existing requirement just please comply
 
01:04:39.190 --> 01:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
with a patient Bill of Rights in in
 
01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:43.640 align:start position:0%
terms of scope I it explicitly limited
 
01:04:46.109 --> 01:04:46.119 align:start position:0%
it to the hospitals and not every health
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
care provider I did that because I
 
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:51.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate that there is a regulatory
 
01:04:54.309 --> 01:04:54.319 align:start position:0%
burden involved here and I and I wanted
 
01:04:57.029 --> 01:04:57.039 align:start position:0%
to do a light touch on the regulatory
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
burden and so by establishing a beach
 
01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:02.720 align:start position:0%
head with the hospitals I hope that it
 
01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:05.160 align:start position:0%
sets an example for other health
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
providers to just voluntarily comply
 
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:10.200 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire law thank can I have
 
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
one last final thank you I appreciate
 
01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
you um pointing that out which was sort
 
01:05:16.870 --> 01:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
of related to my first question on on
 
01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:19.760 align:start position:0%
the language of just hospitals um I am
 
01:05:21.390 --> 01:05:21.400 align:start position:0%
concerned however on the underlying bill
 
01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
you and I spoke briefly about it before
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
this hearing um the amendment as drafted
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
that as you said does keep the original
 
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
language in there um I am concerned
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
about the um the Waypoint situation and
 
01:05:35.309 --> 01:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
keeping that forward facing to the
 
01:05:37.269 --> 01:05:37.279 align:start position:0%
public um and now you're saying you want
 
01:05:40.710 --> 01:05:40.720 align:start position:0%
to do a complete um redraft to remove
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
that section um don't you think that
 
01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
this might be a better vehicle uh to go
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
as amendment to House belill 2 why do we
 
01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
need to um put the Waypoint bill in
 
01:05:55.109 --> 01:05:55.119 align:start position:0%
Jeopardy well you got a couple different
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
issues there and they're both perfectly
 
01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:01.119 align:start position:0%
valid in my view one you and I share the
 
01:06:04.029 --> 01:06:04.039 align:start position:0%
U emphasis on doing something to help
 
01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:07.880 align:start position:0%
Waypoint there's no air between us in
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
terms of making sure that we consider
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
the language that's in 519 and to
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
migrate it into House Bill 2 I've
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
already been instructed um the division
 
01:06:21.589 --> 01:06:21.599 align:start position:0%
3 LBA to make sure that that happens and
 
01:06:22.950 --> 01:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
it's one of the things I'm going to
 
01:06:27.029 --> 01:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
follow up on um if if if we followed
 
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
typical mechanics we would be retaining
 
01:06:35.309 --> 01:06:35.319 align:start position:0%
519 in any case if we were to retain it
 
01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
it loses its public visibility so there
 
01:06:41.029 --> 01:06:41.039 align:start position:0%
isn't really an advantage to keeping it
 
01:06:43.910 --> 01:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
in 519 if we're going to retain 519
 
01:06:46.829 --> 01:06:46.839 align:start position:0%
anyways because it loses its public
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
awareness until the beginning of next
 
01:06:53.269 --> 01:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
term so so I think by the beginning of
 
01:06:56.950 --> 01:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
next term we'll have put this into hb2
 
01:06:59.549 --> 01:06:59.559 align:start position:0%
will have discussed it we'll have fought
 
01:07:01.789 --> 01:07:01.799 align:start position:0%
very hard to try to find some money for
 
01:07:04.029 --> 01:07:04.039 align:start position:0%
it because it's 500,000 a year and new
 
01:07:07.269 --> 01:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
money so it's a big ask but I want us to
 
01:07:11.309 --> 01:07:11.319 align:start position:0%
look for it so so we share the concern
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
about protecting a uh Waypoint in terms
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
of visibility and and and concern by the
 
01:07:21.269 --> 01:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
legislature the reason I want to have
 
01:07:24.349 --> 01:07:24.359 align:start position:0%
this non- gerine amendment go to the
 
01:07:29.269 --> 01:07:29.279 align:start position:0%
house floor is because um I think well
 
01:07:32.349 --> 01:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
one I'm guessing but I think it'll pass
 
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
the house and when it passes the house
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
then we will have a very clear statement
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
to reinforce the existing public law
 
01:07:42.589 --> 01:07:42.599 align:start position:0%
that the patient Bill of Rights is
 
01:07:44.789 --> 01:07:44.799 align:start position:0%
important to us and then therefore it
 
01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
should be important to our health care
 
01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:52.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you Mr chairman repres
 
01:07:58.750 --> 01:07:58.760 align:start position:0%
Stringham for Mr Edwards um the patient
 
01:08:00.870 --> 01:08:00.880 align:start position:0%
Bill rights representative Edwards I
 
01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
worked hard for that title thank you uh
 
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh introducing this
 
01:08:07.510 --> 01:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
amendment the patient Bill of Rights is
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
already law and included as you said as
 
01:08:12.269 --> 01:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
RSA 151
 
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:15.480 align:start position:0%
218 um I think you would agree that
 
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
hospitals are one of the most heavily
 
01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:19.520 align:start position:0%
regulated businesses in the country they
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
have to comply with countless
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
regulations dealing with Public Safety
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
worker safety Finance requirements hi
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
Hippa Patient Bill rights many many
 
01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
other things with the unev unenviable
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
task of establishing guidelines that
 
01:08:37.229 --> 01:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
take into com uh often take into account
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
competing priorities of for example
 
01:08:42.269 --> 01:08:42.279 align:start position:0%
protecting worker safety and patient
 
01:08:45.349 --> 01:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
safety uh I I've certainly been to
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth hospital I've seen Patient
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights posted in the elevator
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
before it sounds like one thing happened
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
to one patient that there was a
 
01:08:55.630 --> 01:08:55.640 align:start position:0%
disagreement which is going to happen
 
01:08:58.829 --> 01:08:58.839 align:start position:0%
happen uh which you described as serious
 
01:09:01.229 --> 01:09:01.239 align:start position:0%
but can you explain why we really should
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
amend a bill that we all support um with
 
01:09:08.590 --> 01:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
with uh this issue here um that is
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
already covered in RSA uh 151 21 which I
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
know our hospitals all take seriously uh
 
01:09:19.590 --> 01:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
with a non- gerain uh U and by implying
 
01:09:22.189 --> 01:09:22.199 align:start position:0%
that we're going to threaten Dartmouth
 
01:09:25.950 --> 01:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
hospital with or one hospital by taking
 
01:09:28.749 --> 01:09:28.759 align:start position:0%
Contracting is voluntary there's no
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
threat it's just saying if you want to
 
01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:32.679 align:start position:0%
do business with the state you'll comply
 
01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
with state law that's not a threat is it
 
01:09:38.669 --> 01:09:38.679 align:start position:0%
representative did you mean to say that
 
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
well the I I what I think what I think
 
01:09:44.110 --> 01:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
this implies is I mean they are under
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
contract they're already agreed to uh
 
01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
apply with a patient Bill of Rights and
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
all other laws would you agree with that
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
no and I apologize for interrupting you
 
01:09:58.350 --> 01:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
no we're not here to debate uh and so
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
the the Takeaway on to me on your
 
01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
question is um you know I agree
 
01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals are heavily regulated and have
 
01:10:11.950 --> 01:10:11.960 align:start position:0%
a huge compliance function uh as you
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
pointed out they're already aware of the
 
01:10:15.390 --> 01:10:15.400 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights if they're
 
01:10:18.149 --> 01:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
posting it in the elevator so so we're
 
01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
we're not really expecting them to do
 
01:10:22.149 --> 01:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
anything that they're not doing but I
 
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
would just point out that this in this
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
particular instance this Hospital put a
 
01:10:29.149 --> 01:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of Senior Management
 
01:10:33.270 --> 01:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
effort into denying a patient their
 
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
rights under the patient Bill of Rights
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
and so I'm not asking them to do
 
01:10:40.830 --> 01:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
anything but what you're suggesting is
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
to take the patient Bill a right
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
seriously so I think we're actually in
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
agreement on
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much all
 
01:10:53.630 --> 01:10:53.640 align:start position:0%
right further questions from committee
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
representative R thank thank you Mr
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
chair um I have a couple questions um
 
01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:00.520 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for taking my
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
question um why did you select this bill
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
specifically to attach a non-gain
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to great question and because
 
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
uh like Willie Sutton said I rob banks
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
because that's where the money is th
 
01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
this bill was the only Bill in division
 
01:11:20.669 --> 01:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
3 that I had any control over so when
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
you only have one option you exercise
 
01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:25.880 align:start position:0%
that option
 
01:11:29.590 --> 01:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
so so that's that's why 519 got picked
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
and because in division 3 it was
 
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
universally accepted that we want to
 
01:11:39.270 --> 01:11:39.280 align:start position:0%
take 519 language and put it into hb2 we
 
01:11:42.669 --> 01:11:42.679 align:start position:0%
already had decided that the the utility
 
01:11:42.679 --> 01:11:43.510 align:start position:0%
already had decided that the the utility
of

01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
hb19 given that the alternative was to
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
retain it it had near zero utility as a
 
01:11:53.310 --> 01:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
retained bill so I'm giving it a reason
 
01:11:56.350 --> 01:11:56.360 align:start position:0%
a purpose a repurpose for life
 
01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
okay follow up um but what value is
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
there in 519 with just a language um
 
01:12:08.310 --> 01:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
isn't its value in the
 
01:12:11.189 --> 01:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation uh we would have to debate
 
01:12:11.199 --> 01:12:12.470 align:start position:0%
appropriation uh we would have to debate
the

01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:14.470 --> 01:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
money we're going to have to debate the
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
money and the and the division three
 
01:12:18.149 --> 01:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
deliberations around the budget in any
 
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
case nothing is different this you know
 
01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:23.960 align:start position:0%
taking 519 as a shell and and putting
 
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
the non- gerain amendment and it doesn't
 
01:12:27.950 --> 01:12:27.960 align:start position:0%
change any of the work we're already
 
01:12:29.870 --> 01:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
committed to doing we're going to take
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
the the the language put it into hb2
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to go through our our our
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
budget cycle where we look at all the
 
01:12:39.270 --> 01:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
Departments we're going to look the fact
 
01:12:40.629 --> 01:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
that they're going to ask us for more
 
01:12:42.270 --> 01:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
money than we have and we're going to
 
01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
try to find money for Waypoint all of
 
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:48.280 align:start position:0%
that's going to happen 519 is irrelevant
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
at this this point okay and then just
 
01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
one more um in in the language in your
 
01:12:55.629 --> 01:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative you mentioned
 
01:12:58.030 --> 01:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
that um Department of Health and Human
 
01:13:00.149 --> 01:13:00.159 align:start position:0%
Services shall not contract with any
 
01:13:02.510 --> 01:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
Hospital found in violation does that
 
01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
apply to every single contract that a
 
01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:07.159 align:start position:0%
hospital may have with the state I I
 
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
don't I don't I'm not up on every
 
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
boilerplate uh piece of language there
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
is on our DHHS contracts but if you're
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
familiar with Contracting there's
 
01:13:18.510 --> 01:13:18.520 align:start position:0%
typically you know a statement of work
 
01:13:21.149 --> 01:13:21.159 align:start position:0%
that comes in and so sort of the section
 
01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:23.440 align:start position:0%
c of it where it's Unique to that
 
01:13:26.229 --> 01:13:26.239 align:start position:0%
contract and then there are an endless
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
Gob of pages of boilerplate and I don't
 
01:13:32.590 --> 01:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
know what it goes into the boiler plate
 
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
but I think once um DHHS adopted this
 
01:13:38.750 --> 01:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
language and stuck it in the boiler
 
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
plate there'd be no additional
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
administrative overhead to doing it or
 
01:13:46.830 --> 01:13:46.840 align:start position:0%
maintaining it was that your question um
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
I don't think it was no not really I I
 
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:52.600 align:start position:0%
it was what I wanted to say though
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
yeah um no I no I I really wanted to get
 
01:13:59.950 --> 01:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
to the fact that you know we're putting
 
01:14:03.430 --> 01:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
every single contract at stake with
 
01:14:05.590 --> 01:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals and we don't even know what
 
01:14:07.830 --> 01:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
the extent of those are and I I guess
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm asking what is the total amount
 
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:15.760 align:start position:0%
of risk in losing services to the state
 
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
that we currently contract with
 
01:14:21.189 --> 01:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
hospitals I mean if there was instead of
 
01:14:22.830 --> 01:14:22.840 align:start position:0%
let's say going to a hospital and say
 
01:14:24.629 --> 01:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
you violated the the patient Bill of
 
01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
Rights you need to reverse the decision
 
01:14:30.189 --> 01:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
um that would be the most
 
01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
straightforward easiest least expensive
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
solution to a
 
01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:37.320 align:start position:0%
problem but I'm I'm wondering have you
 
01:14:39.629 --> 01:14:39.639 align:start position:0%
done any assessment as to what the
 
01:14:42.870 --> 01:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
exposure is in losing those Hospital
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
Services if a hospital is found to be
 
01:14:46.830 --> 01:14:46.840 align:start position:0%
invit I don't think we're going to lose
 
01:14:49.270 --> 01:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
Services I it's already state law that
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
we have a patient Bill of Rights the
 
01:14:53.270 --> 01:14:53.280 align:start position:0%
expectation is already that the hospital
 
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
should comply there should there should
 
01:14:58.870 --> 01:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
be no threat of a discontinuity and and
 
01:15:00.629 --> 01:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
a service relationship because it's
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
already in the law you know so so what
 
01:15:07.590 --> 01:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
has been was lacking was the an an
 
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
efficient enforcement capability that
 
01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
caused um there to be sort of this
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
public effort to get some media
 
01:15:18.470 --> 01:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
attention on it to to pull in the
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house to pull in the
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
governor to pull in the AG you know all
 
01:15:28.590 --> 01:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
this extra arrial you know work to to to
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
get a simple voluntary compliance thing
 
01:15:35.229 --> 01:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
voluntarily complied with so so I I I I
 
01:15:37.430 --> 01:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
do think there's a need for the bill
 
01:15:40.430 --> 01:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
because I think it's valuable for us to
 
01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:41.310 align:start position:0%
because I think it's valuable for us to
to

01:15:41.310 --> 01:15:41.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:44.110 --> 01:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
reate uh to the hospitals not to every
 
01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
health care provider but just to The
 
01:15:49.149 --> 01:15:49.159 align:start position:0%
Limited hospitals um that we were
 
01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
serious when we passed the patient Bill
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
of Rights we weren't just kidding around
 
01:15:56.070 --> 01:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
we really expected before we prolong any
 
01:15:57.669 --> 01:15:57.679 align:start position:0%
there are people from the hospital that
 
01:15:59.629 --> 01:15:59.639 align:start position:0%
are going to come up and people from the
 
01:16:01.430 --> 01:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
hospital Association and people from
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth hospital so yeah and by the
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
way we'll talk about it again when we
 
01:16:08.229 --> 01:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
EXA yeah so we don't need to beat this
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
to death so so Mr Speaker what I'll
 
01:16:12.510 --> 01:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
commit to is if it doesn't come up the
 
01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:14.280 align:start position:0%
answer doesn't come up the
 
01:16:16.750 --> 01:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
representative asks a good question of
 
01:16:19.350 --> 01:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
about how many contracts with how many
 
01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
uh hospitals might be affected by
 
01:16:24.270 --> 01:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
including this in the boilerplate we'll
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
hope to find it that out from the
 
01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
hospital Association so well or DHHS I
 
01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
just ask Mr White you know to tell me
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
yeah further forther
 
01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none did you have any
 
01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.390 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none did you have any
representative

01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:39.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
muray yes I did thank you Mr chair if I
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
can just take a few seconds um can you
 
01:16:45.870 --> 01:16:45.880 align:start position:0%
address enforcement though because I'm
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
hearing about if there's a violation and
 
01:16:50.070 --> 01:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious if there's a violation
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
do all these contracts disappear or do
 
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
we say well you'll have well we'll make
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
they'll be gone they'll be good until
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
the next year and then you're not going
 
01:16:59.709 --> 01:16:59.719 align:start position:0%
to get them what if there's a violation
 
01:17:01.590 --> 01:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
and the violation is corrected I'm a
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
little concerned about enforcement and
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
is there a bill bat that's going to say
 
01:17:07.470 --> 01:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
oh violation contracts are null and
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
voids we keep in mind that the hope and
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
the intent is just to stimulate the
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
voluntary compliance that we expected
 
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
when we put this in the patient Bill of
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
Rights into law to begin with and what
 
01:17:22.990 --> 01:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
the bill says is that DHHS shall not
 
01:17:25.189 --> 01:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
contract with any hospital it doesn't
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
have further language to say We'll void
 
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
any contract that becomes uh knowing it
 
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
it it it's it's a future oriented
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
looking thing and my hope my intent is
 
01:17:41.510 --> 01:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
that um uh there will never be any more
 
01:17:44.229 --> 01:17:44.239 align:start position:0%
enforcement than just uh putting in
 
01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:46.639 align:start position:0%
there this is part of our contract
 
01:17:46.639 --> 01:17:47.870 align:start position:0%
there this is part of our contract
please

01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:17:50.350 --> 01:17:50.360 align:start position:0%
comply further yeah just thank you I
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
think you sort of made my point and that
 
01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
since there is no enforcement we have no
 
01:17:57.229 --> 01:17:57.239 align:start position:0%
idea what the Fallout of this bill would
 
01:18:00.669 --> 01:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
be if there is a violation so thank
 
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
you I think I I think I answered that
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
we're expecting voluntary compliance and
 
01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
that as part of a Contracting process
 
01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
DHHS would have a language that the that
 
01:18:14.910 --> 01:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
the hospital would voluntarily sign off
 
01:18:17.910 --> 01:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
on obligating them to comply with state
 
01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
law it's not that's not very
 
01:18:25.510 --> 01:18:25.520 align:start position:0%
uh that's not a big reach to ask him to
 
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.709 --> 01:18:31.719 align:start position:0%
law all right seeing nothing further
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
we'll see if Melissa BLC is she in the
 
01:18:39.669 --> 01:18:39.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:39.679 --> 01:18:42.910 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chair members of
 
01:18:47.149 --> 01:18:47.159 align:start position:0%
the committee I'm Melissa blasic I'm
 
01:18:49.629 --> 01:18:49.639 align:start position:0%
here representing rebuild NH I just
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to give a little background to
 
01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
the story um I was contacted the day
 
01:18:55.550 --> 01:18:55.560 align:start position:0%
after Christmas
 
01:18:57.470 --> 01:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
by Miss Shannon
 
01:19:00.830 --> 01:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
Buttermore and um sorry I'm very short
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
okay um and she was being denied a
 
01:19:05.990 --> 01:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
kidney transplant by Dartmouth Hitchcock
 
01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
Medical Center for not receiving the
 
01:19:11.470 --> 01:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccine now she had already
 
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
complied with their other vaccine
 
01:19:17.110 --> 01:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
requirements which was to get the hepb
 
01:19:21.629 --> 01:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
series and the yearly influenza vaccine
 
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
but she did not want to get the covid-19
 
01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:27.830 align:start position:0%
but she did not want to get the covid-19
vaccine

01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:31.560 align:start position:0%
um we notified lobbyists for Dartmouth
 
01:19:34.950 --> 01:19:34.960 align:start position:0%
Hitchcock and um the hospital
 
01:19:39.149 --> 01:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
Association about this and really kind
 
01:19:41.910 --> 01:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
of got nowhere um I was one of the
 
01:19:44.510 --> 01:19:44.520 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors of this bill that added this
 
01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
section to the patient Bill of Rights in
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
2022 it passed unanimously through both
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
Chambers um so 425 people were very
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
clear what they were intending which was
 
01:20:01.310 --> 01:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
that no patient be denied any medical
 
01:20:05.110 --> 01:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
treatment for not getting any vaccine it
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
was not specific to the covid vaccine so
 
01:20:11.310 --> 01:20:11.320 align:start position:0%
yes it took an entire PR
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
campaign uh to get any type of
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
satisfaction for Miss
 
01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
Buttermore um and she they did remove
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
their covid-19 requirement for kidney
 
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
transplants and so she can move forward
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
and get the treatment that she needs
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
however this is not some isolated
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
incident this is their
 
01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:33.800 align:start position:0%
policy and the other I still have not
 
01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
gotten satisfaction of seeing a policy
 
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
out of Dartmouth Hitchcock that says
 
01:20:39.590 --> 01:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
that they've removed all of their
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine requirements and there are a lot
 
01:20:44.350 --> 01:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
of patients who are still being denied
 
01:20:46.790 --> 01:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
transplants for not getting other
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
vaccines now miss Buttermore was a rare
 
01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
breed not many people are Fighters and
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
that's just a reality most people are
 
01:20:55.790 --> 01:20:55.800 align:start position:0%
not willing willing to file a lawsuit
 
01:20:58.149 --> 01:20:58.159 align:start position:0%
like she was most people are not willing
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
to go public and have an entire PR
 
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:03.719 align:start position:0%
campaign like she was most of these
 
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
people are sick and they will just go to
 
01:21:08.750 --> 01:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
another state and get the transplant
 
01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
that they need from another hospital and
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
move on with their lives and I don't
 
01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
blame them okay but that doesn't change
 
01:21:18.629 --> 01:21:18.639 align:start position:0%
the fact that the hospital has a WID
 
01:21:20.830 --> 01:21:20.840 align:start position:0%
spread policy and that they have denied
 
01:21:24.669 --> 01:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
many people this care so the question
 
01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
kept being asked how many contracts how
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
many hospitals will this affect well I
 
01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:32.040 align:start position:0%
my hope is zero because my hope is that
 
01:21:35.229 --> 01:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
every single hospital is following the
 
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights but when you have
 
01:21:42.910 --> 01:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
to fight so hard for your rights by
 
01:21:45.189 --> 01:21:45.199 align:start position:0%
going through an entire PR campaign
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
lawyering up finding people to pay for
 
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
that lawsuit do those rights really
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
exist and the re reality was that we
 
01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
really did not get a lot of satisfaction
 
01:21:58.270 --> 01:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
until we got the elected politicians on
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
board because there just wasn't
 
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement enough from in my opinion um
 
01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and so you know just
 
01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:09.880 align:start position:0%
last week the executive Council tabled a
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth contract because they still
 
01:22:14.950 --> 01:22:14.960 align:start position:0%
have not gotten full satisfaction that
 
01:22:17.870 --> 01:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
they are in full compliance with the law
 
01:22:20.990 --> 01:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
and so I think what this amendment could
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
do is once again provide a little bit
 
01:22:27.629 --> 01:22:27.639 align:start position:0%
more enforcement through the legislative
 
01:22:31.709 --> 01:22:31.719 align:start position:0%
body um that ultimately truly was what
 
01:22:34.189 --> 01:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
got satisfaction for Miss
 
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
Buttermore um unfortunately it was not
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
law enforcement so um I want to thank
 
01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for pursuing this
 
01:22:43.750 --> 01:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
and um I'll take any
 
01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
questions questions miss
 
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
blazik seeing none thank you for your
 
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:55.470 --> 01:22:55.480 align:start position:0%
Championship okay now we get a chance
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
for Dartmouth to respond Matthew hood is
 
01:23:04.310 --> 01:23:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:06.510 --> 01:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
Health thank you for
 
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
coming thank you Mr chairman members of
 
01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record my name is
 
01:23:12.629 --> 01:23:12.639 align:start position:0%
Matthew Hood vice president of
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
government relations at Dartmouth
 
01:23:18.510 --> 01:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
Health uh and I'm here obviously to uh
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
speak to the questions and some of the
 
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
concerns that the amendment raises from
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
our perspective
 
01:23:28.149 --> 01:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
um one of them you've heard a fair
 
01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
amount already talk about enforcement
 
01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
and nothing in the amendment would
 
01:23:37.669 --> 01:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
change the current enforcement mechanism
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
which is the sole jurisdiction is with
 
01:23:43.830 --> 01:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
the Superior Court um and that's a real
 
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
reasonable topic for conversation about
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
who and what agency might be the best to
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
navigate this space for example the
 
01:23:52.350 --> 01:23:52.360 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights has a number of
 
01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:54.639 align:start position:0%
different Provisions some pertain to
 
01:23:54.639 --> 01:23:55.830 align:start position:0%
different Provisions some pertain to
financial

01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:23:58.590 --> 01:23:58.600 align:start position:0%
matters uh and delegating that that
 
01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
authority to help uh a patient navigate
 
01:24:02.990 --> 01:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
financial matters to the institution
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
would that be the Attorney General's
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
Office of Consumer Protection for
 
01:24:08.990 --> 01:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
example might be implicated in resolving
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
that type of issue um there are issues
 
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
sorry just going to look at my notes for
 
01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:16.510 align:start position:0%
sorry just going to look at my notes for
a

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
moment uh there there are requirements
 
01:24:22.030 --> 01:24:22.040 align:start position:0%
in the patient Bill of Rights about lure
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
of level of the provider um
 
01:24:27.709 --> 01:24:27.719 align:start position:0%
but presumably the oplc doesn't have a
 
01:24:30.229 --> 01:24:30.239 align:start position:0%
role in enforcement of the Bill of
 
01:24:32.669 --> 01:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
Rights there are also Provisions about
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
denial of care based on age sex sexual
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
orientation race Etc but I'm presuming
 
01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
that the um commission for human rights
 
01:24:43.229 --> 01:24:43.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a role in enforcement in
 
01:24:46.790 --> 01:24:46.800 align:start position:0%
this uh I could go on insurance Network
 
01:24:48.990 --> 01:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
plans Etc department of insurance
 
01:24:51.750 --> 01:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a role so the question that
 
01:24:53.470 --> 01:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
this that's been raised about
 
01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement is is if someone feels that
 
01:24:58.229 --> 01:24:58.239 align:start position:0%
the patient Bill of Rights has been
 
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
violated what are they going to do um
 
01:25:04.629 --> 01:25:04.639 align:start position:0%
and under the bill under the patient
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights even as it would be
 
01:25:07.229 --> 01:25:07.239 align:start position:0%
amended they'd still have to go to the
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
Superior Court to prove a violation um
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that's what this body
 
01:25:15.790 --> 01:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
is desirous of I think it's desirous of
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
quicker resolution of Patient Bill of
 
01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.189 align:start position:0%
quicker resolution of Patient Bill of
Rights

01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
Rights
 
01:25:22.990 --> 01:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
violations um so that's the first piece
 
01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:24.440 align:start position:0%
the second piece that I'd like to raise
 
01:25:26.910 --> 01:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
is the idea of individual versus
 
01:25:31.629 --> 01:25:31.639 align:start position:0%
facility liability um so you could have
 
01:25:31.639 --> 01:25:32.430 align:start position:0%
facility liability um so you could have
an

01:25:32.430 --> 01:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:25:35.590 --> 01:25:35.600 align:start position:0%
act I'll give a hypothetical situation
 
01:25:37.470 --> 01:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
you have a new employee who's doing
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
intake one of the requirements I think
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
it's the first requirement of the
 
01:25:42.390 --> 01:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights is that patients
 
01:25:44.550 --> 01:25:44.560 align:start position:0%
are given notice of their rights and
 
01:25:46.229 --> 01:25:46.239 align:start position:0%
responsibilities uh under the patient
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights and the processes for
 
01:25:51.830 --> 01:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
navigating disputes they're under um
 
01:25:53.950 --> 01:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
they have to be they have to be given
 
01:25:56.189 --> 01:25:56.199 align:start position:0%
those and sign an acknowledgement that
 
01:25:59.470 --> 01:25:59.480 align:start position:0%
they have been given those conceivably
 
01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
you could see a situation where the
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
person administers all of the
 
01:26:06.870 --> 01:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
information but neglects to take a
 
01:26:09.550 --> 01:26:09.560 align:start position:0%
signature that's a violation of the
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights presumably every
 
01:26:13.950 --> 01:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
piece of the patient Bill of Rights is
 
01:26:17.790 --> 01:26:17.800 align:start position:0%
in there for a reason and has import um
 
01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:19.800 align:start position:0%
but that employee wouldn't be fired
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
presumably they would be there would be
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
like corrective action you'd say here
 
01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
this is what we tried to do this is what
 
01:26:26.669 --> 01:26:26.679 align:start position:0%
we're required to do Under the patient
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
Bill of
 
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:30.280 align:start position:0%
Rights but there's a there's not that
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
type of opportunity for remedy in the
 
01:26:35.189 --> 01:26:35.199 align:start position:0%
situation under the under the current
 
01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:37.119 align:start position:0%
posture of the patient Bill of Rights
 
01:26:39.790 --> 01:26:39.800 align:start position:0%
when there's a violation by the facility
 
01:26:41.910 --> 01:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
I get agency I get employee liability
 
01:26:44.510 --> 01:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
for the acts employer liability for the
 
01:26:46.189 --> 01:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
acts of the employee I just wanted to
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
point out that the one would hope that
 
01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
there would be a different venue and
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity to correct alleged
 
01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
violations of the patient Bill Bill of
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
Rights my final question for this
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
committee has to do with scope and
 
01:27:01.910 --> 01:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
people have raised that a number of
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
times I can't excuse me I can't tell you
 
01:27:07.790 --> 01:27:07.800 align:start position:0%
the number of contracts that Dartmouth
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
Health has with the state never mind all
 
01:27:12.390 --> 01:27:12.400 align:start position:0%
of the facilities in the state I'm sure
 
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
we could find that out from the
 
01:27:15.830 --> 01:27:15.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and services or
 
01:27:19.629 --> 01:27:19.639 align:start position:0%
elsewise um however for me it pertains
 
01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
to what is this what is the
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
applicability is it literally everything
 
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
and so if it's if it's contracts like
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
were in front of the executive Council
 
01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
recently is it contracts to provide
 
01:27:30.629 --> 01:27:30.639 align:start position:0%
Clinical Services at New Hampshire
 
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
hospital is it Medicaid contracts in
 
01:27:36.270 --> 01:27:36.280 align:start position:0%
which case the the termination of those
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
contracts for a violation without an
 
01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
opportunity to address that violation
 
01:27:46.270 --> 01:27:46.280 align:start position:0%
would be the 30 the 36,000 Medicaid
 
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:48.320 align:start position:0%
patients that Dartmouth Health serves
 
01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
would presumably have to go elsewhere
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
not get that service and
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
so um I'm not that that provides the
 
01:27:57.430 --> 01:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
remedy that that the person who is
 
01:27:59.030 --> 01:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
alleging a violation of the patient Bill
 
01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:01.119 align:start position:0%
of Rights I'm not sure that that
 
01:28:02.830 --> 01:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
provides the type of address that they
 
01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:28:07.870 --> 01:28:07.880 align:start position:0%
seeking I'll stop there I suspect I'll
 
01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
be I'm happy to answer questions so I'll
 
01:28:13.149 --> 01:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
suspect that uh I'll have that
 
01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:15.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity representative lean for a
 
01:28:17.790 --> 01:28:17.800 align:start position:0%
question then representative
 
01:28:20.109 --> 01:28:20.119 align:start position:0%
Naval thank you Mr chairman it's been a
 
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
long time since I've seen you when you
 
01:28:24.590 --> 01:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
sat uh on the other side of the Street
 
01:28:27.550 --> 01:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
here but thanks for taking my question I
 
01:28:29.669 --> 01:28:29.679 align:start position:0%
guess I I'm a little concerned that your
 
01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
testimonies seem to be more worried
 
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
about enforcement than following the
 
01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
bill of patient rights I maybe I'm wrong
 
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
in that assumption but uh it seems like
 
01:28:42.990 --> 01:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
the argument should be that the hospital
 
01:28:44.550 --> 01:28:44.560 align:start position:0%
will do everything they can to follow
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
the patient Bill of Rights and I and I
 
01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
appreciate the question slash um
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
reiteration having ad libed it I
 
01:28:53.470 --> 01:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
neglected to include that in the very
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
part of very opening part of my uh
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
comments which would be we take very
 
01:28:59.550 --> 01:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
seriously the patient Bill of Rights and
 
01:29:00.669 --> 01:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
wanting to make sure that there are
 
01:29:03.189 --> 01:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
violations of the patient Bill of Rights
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
I I I um so I apologize for not saying
 
01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:07.470 align:start position:0%
I I I um so I apologize for not saying
that

01:29:07.470 --> 01:29:07.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
upfront thank you thank you Mr
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
chairman further
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:29:17.229 --> 01:29:17.239 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking the question
 
01:29:20.629 --> 01:29:20.639 align:start position:0%
does does uh Dartmouth Hitchcock have
 
01:29:24.830 --> 01:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
Prima fashi any written policies that
 
01:29:27.189 --> 01:29:27.199 align:start position:0%
are at directly at odds with the
 
01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
patients Bill of
 
01:29:33.669 --> 01:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
Rights so there has been um
 
01:29:35.790 --> 01:29:35.800 align:start position:0%
communication between the the Attorney
 
01:29:38.430 --> 01:29:38.440 align:start position:0%
General's office and the office of
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
general counsel at Dartmouth Health to
 
01:29:43.229 --> 01:29:43.239 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not there are
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
policies in place that violate the
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights um and I I feel
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's important to take this moment to
 
01:29:52.629 --> 01:29:52.639 align:start position:0%
make a
 
01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:55.199 align:start position:0%
distinction between
 
01:29:59.910 --> 01:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
a policy that required covid vaccination
 
01:30:02.030 --> 01:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
in order to have a procedure which has
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
been reversed that policy has been
 
01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:05.629 align:start position:0%
been reversed that policy has been
reversed

01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
reversed
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
acknowledged um and a violation of the
 
01:30:10.270 --> 01:30:10.280 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights which relevant
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
section provides that a patient can't be
 
01:30:16.030 --> 01:30:16.040 align:start position:0%
denied Services solely on the solely on
 
01:30:19.149 --> 01:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
the basis of vaccination status the
 
01:30:21.870 --> 01:30:21.880 align:start position:0%
healthcare delivery is a fairly complex
 
01:30:23.990 --> 01:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
communication between patient and
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
provider and there could be lots of
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
reasons why um vaccinations would be
 
01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:31.080 align:start position:0%
encouraged now strongly encouraged but
 
01:30:33.270 --> 01:30:33.280 align:start position:0%
not required but there could be other
 
01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
pieces that would impact the decision to
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
proceed with a care course of treatment
 
01:30:38.239 --> 01:30:39.470 align:start position:0%
proceed with a care course of treatment
or

01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:30:43.109 --> 01:30:43.119 align:start position:0%
not followup yeah a quick followup I I
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
think if I heard previous testimony uh
 
01:30:51.270 --> 01:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
today uh indicated that uh uh they they
 
01:30:53.270 --> 01:30:53.280 align:start position:0%
hadn't changed the PO the change it with
 
01:30:55.270 --> 01:30:55.280 align:start position:0%
regard to co which I think you've made
 
01:30:57.550 --> 01:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
pretty clear but hadn't changed it with
 
01:31:00.870 --> 01:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
regard to uh other other vaccines is
 
01:31:02.870 --> 01:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
that a correct was that a
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
correct i' I'd take issue with that
 
01:31:06.910 --> 01:31:06.920 align:start position:0%
obser with that conclusion and I would
 
01:31:08.950 --> 01:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
say that our office of General Council
 
01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:12.679 align:start position:0%
has done a fairly comprehensive um
 
01:31:15.109 --> 01:31:15.119 align:start position:0%
review with the clinical teams and other
 
01:31:16.669 --> 01:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
people in the hospital to determine that
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
there not are no vac or no vaccination
 
01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
policies um that are
 
01:31:24.910 --> 01:31:24.920 align:start position:0%
mandatory okay whether it's Co or
 
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise all right thank thank you for
 
01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:29.270 align:start position:0%
otherwise all right thank thank you for
that

01:31:29.270 --> 01:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:32.709 --> 01:31:32.719 align:start position:0%
clarification further questions from the
 
01:31:36.189 --> 01:31:36.199 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none n representative
 
01:31:39.109 --> 01:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
camell thank you Mr chair um I have to
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
disagree with that I was a kidney
 
01:31:44.350 --> 01:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
transplant patient still I still am up
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
at Dartmouth Hitchcock and in order to
 
01:31:49.030 --> 01:31:49.040 align:start position:0%
get the kidney transplant I had to take
 
01:31:51.590 --> 01:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
a multitude of vaccinations some of
 
01:31:53.310 --> 01:31:53.320 align:start position:0%
which I didn't want to take but I had to
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
take them so unless you've reversed that
 
01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
policy in the last couple of months the
 
01:32:00.430 --> 01:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
the statement you just made I don't
 
01:32:02.669 --> 01:32:02.679 align:start position:0%
believe would you like to readdress that
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
statement I I would I stand by the
 
01:32:09.270 --> 01:32:09.280 align:start position:0%
statement which is with with respect
 
01:32:11.910 --> 01:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
to the reever there was a reversal of
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
the policy that required a covid
 
01:32:17.189 --> 01:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
vaccination a thorough review of policy
 
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
has been done between the our senior
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
leadership and clinical teams to that I
 
01:32:25.030 --> 01:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
can clear clearly state that there is
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
not a policy of of requirement for care
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
for any vaccine do we encourage vaccines
 
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:34.280 align:start position:0%
absolutely do we strongly encourage
 
01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:39.070 align:start position:0%
absolutely do we strongly encourage
vaccines

01:32:39.070 --> 01:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.149 --> 01:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
absolutely further from the
 
01:32:44.910 --> 01:32:44.920 align:start position:0%
committee thank you for your testimony
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
we'll next hear from Ben Bradley New
 
01:32:58.510 --> 01:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:00.189 --> 01:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Ben
 
01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
Bradley I'm the vice president of state
 
01:33:06.030 --> 01:33:06.040 align:start position:0%
government relations for the New
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Hospital Association we
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
represent all 26 hospitals uh acute care
 
01:33:12.629 --> 01:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
hospitals in New Hampshire as well as
 
01:33:15.709 --> 01:33:15.719 align:start position:0%
all specialty hospitals um we do have
 
01:33:18.030 --> 01:33:18.040 align:start position:0%
concerns about the proposed non-main
 
01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:20.229 align:start position:0%
concerns about the proposed non-main
amendment

01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:33:22.550 --> 01:33:22.560 align:start position:0%
102h uh and particularly as it relates
 
01:33:24.270 --> 01:33:24.280 align:start position:0%
to the implementation of
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
intention excuse
 
01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
me following Matthew's comments I would
 
01:33:31.030 --> 01:33:31.040 align:start position:0%
Echo his comments about supporting the
 
01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights and his questions
 
01:33:36.030 --> 01:33:36.040 align:start position:0%
about enforcement and wonder if uh
 
01:33:37.830 --> 01:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement should be reviewed
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
collaboratively uh it's unclear how a VI
 
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
under this bill under this amendment
 
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
it's unclear how a violation triggers
 
01:33:46.430 --> 01:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
the prohibition for the Department to
 
01:33:49.109 --> 01:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
contract is there an opportunity for
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
corrective action before uh it gets
 
01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
triggered um and I guess we would
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
question how does prohibiting the
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:34:00.070 --> 01:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
from Contracting with the hospital in
 
01:34:02.350 --> 01:34:02.360 align:start position:0%
violation of the patient Bill of Rights
 
01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:05.239 align:start position:0%
help ensure that those patient rights
 
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
are restored in those
 
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
circumstances additionally if no other
 
01:34:13.830 --> 01:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
entity in the state is capable of
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
fulfilling uh that contract um then what
 
01:34:20.310 --> 01:34:20.320 align:start position:0%
happens to those Services um I can't
 
01:34:23.709 --> 01:34:23.719 align:start position:0%
give a broad picture of all the contract
 
01:34:26.709 --> 01:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
TR s that the state has with our members
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you things like uh
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
services at New Hampshire hospital
 
01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:34.360 align:start position:0%
services at Hamstead Hospital the
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
doorways program that I believe seven of
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
our members uh operate and serve the
 
01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
communities with um all those are
 
01:34:44.870 --> 01:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
programs that are contracted with the
 
01:34:45.990 --> 01:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if those contracts are
 
01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
eliminated and somebody isn't able to um
 
01:34:55.149 --> 01:34:55.159 align:start position:0%
uh support them in some other way if
 
01:34:56.910 --> 01:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
there wasn't a capability from somebody
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
in state would the state of New
 
01:35:01.229 --> 01:35:01.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire be looking for a contract
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
entity from out of state and how does
 
01:35:06.910 --> 01:35:06.920 align:start position:0%
that contracted entity comply with New
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Patient Bill of Rights when
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
they're an out of state entity that's
 
01:35:12.430 --> 01:35:12.440 align:start position:0%
not licensed in New
 
01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:14.070 align:start position:0%
not licensed in New
Hampshire

01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
um so uh for these reasons uh we we
 
01:35:19.709 --> 01:35:19.719 align:start position:0%
can't support the non-gain amendment uh
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to take questions as best
 
01:35:24.149 --> 01:35:24.159 align:start position:0%
I can thank you question
 
01:35:26.350 --> 01:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
committee represent
 
01:35:30.310 --> 01:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
string so has any Hospital uh to your
 
01:35:33.030 --> 01:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge been found of any violation of
 
01:35:36.390 --> 01:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
any section of RSA
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
15121 you including any you know single
 
01:35:42.149 --> 01:35:42.159 align:start position:0%
of that fairly long Patient Bill of
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
Rights not that I'm aware
 
01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:48.119 align:start position:0%
of followup follow up if they if they
 
01:35:50.390 --> 01:35:50.400 align:start position:0%
were going to be found in violation who
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
would have who would have done that how
 
01:35:53.790 --> 01:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
would have that been brought up and how
 
01:35:56.270 --> 01:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
would it be adjudicated uh based on
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
current law to your experience yeah I'm
 
01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
not a legal expert so I I can't really
 
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
speak to that because I don't know the
 
01:36:05.709 --> 01:36:05.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement mechanism uh other than what
 
01:36:07.390 --> 01:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
Matthew had previously stated which was
 
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
suit represent tki for a question thank
 
01:36:16.990 --> 01:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for taking my
 
01:36:20.270 --> 01:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
question so you alluded to one of my
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
questions previously but I just want to
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
make sure that I'm understanding so we
 
01:36:27.590 --> 01:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
heard um that Dartmouth has 36,000
 
01:36:29.229 --> 01:36:29.239 align:start position:0%
Medicaid patients we know they have
 
01:36:30.709 --> 01:36:30.719 align:start position:0%
contracts with New Hampshire hospital
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
Hamstead Hospital Etc would you say that
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
if um Dartmouth but or if any of the
 
01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:38.679 align:start position:0%
other um hospitals that are providers in
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
the state um found that they were in
 
01:36:44.270 --> 01:36:44.280 align:start position:0%
violation which would trigger we're not
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
sure what the enforcement would be but
 
01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:48.520 align:start position:0%
and I was we were told that it's not
 
01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
backwards looking but forwards looking
 
01:36:53.109 --> 01:36:53.119 align:start position:0%
but let's just say um a contract was
 
01:36:55.149 --> 01:36:55.159 align:start position:0%
nullified would you say that that could
 
01:36:57.790 --> 01:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
Implement a possible healthare crisis in
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
a region of the state based on um the
 
01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
services that a hospital provides I
 
01:37:06.950 --> 01:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
think that's to be determined um if you
 
01:37:09.310 --> 01:37:09.320 align:start position:0%
look back at the applications for
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
various contracts with the Department of
 
01:37:13.390 --> 01:37:13.400 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I think an
 
01:37:16.109 --> 01:37:16.119 align:start position:0%
indicator may be how many entities
 
01:37:18.149 --> 01:37:18.159 align:start position:0%
actually applied for those contracts and
 
01:37:21.030 --> 01:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
bid for those contracts if there was one
 
01:37:23.790 --> 01:37:23.800 align:start position:0%
entity that happened to be one Hospital
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
that it bid for those contracts I'd be
 
01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
concerned that there wasn't a backup
 
01:37:30.870 --> 01:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
plan and that may be an indicator from
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
the historic applications for those
 
01:37:36.629 --> 01:37:36.639 align:start position:0%
contracts if that makes sense so if you
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
look back on who's bid for various
 
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:41.360 align:start position:0%
contracts with the state and you see
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
that only one entity has bid for that
 
01:37:45.430 --> 01:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
because that one entity is the only
 
01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
entity in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
that is capable of meeting the
 
01:37:52.350 --> 01:37:52.360 align:start position:0%
expectations of that contract it would
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
be concerning to to completely eliminate
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
it um it may be one I guess what I would
 
01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
also say is process is really what I'm
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
questioning is how is this determined
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
how is this
 
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
enforced um uh is there a
 
01:38:13.589 --> 01:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
remediation uh process where you could
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
have a corrective action to prevent an
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
entity from losing a contract with the
 
01:38:20.270 --> 01:38:20.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire now if it's
 
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:23.800 align:start position:0%
forward-looking then I assume which is a
 
01:38:26.189 --> 01:38:26.199 align:start position:0%
little bit unclear to me uh but if it is
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
forward-looking you would assume that
 
01:38:31.149 --> 01:38:31.159 align:start position:0%
all contracts that currently exists are
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
grandfathered despite the intent here of
 
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.040 align:start position:0%
saying you you can no longer contract so
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
all those contracts are now
 
01:38:42.189 --> 01:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
grandfathered and if there's a patient
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh Bill of Rights violation then this
 
01:38:48.070 --> 01:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
would not be triggered so I'm just
 
01:38:51.350 --> 01:38:51.360 align:start position:0%
trying to make sense of how this plays
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
out in practical
 
01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:56.440 align:start position:0%
reality I understand the intention here
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
is to hold hospitals accountable I just
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
wonder if there's a a measured approach
 
01:39:03.070 --> 01:39:03.080 align:start position:0%
that doesn't prevent hospitals from
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
serving the communities quick follow
 
01:39:07.350 --> 01:39:07.360 align:start position:0%
that need their services thank you for
 
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
that perspective um but looking at the
 
01:39:12.750 --> 01:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
language we don't have specific language
 
01:39:14.470 --> 01:39:14.480 align:start position:0%
that says anything's grandfathered and
 
01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
it's only forward-looking or anything
 
01:39:17.709 --> 01:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
like that as far as you can read not
 
01:39:19.950 --> 01:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
that I can read no and and here's the
 
01:39:22.149 --> 01:39:22.159 align:start position:0%
thing I mean we're willing to you know
 
01:39:23.910 --> 01:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
look at this and make sure members are
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
in compliance I think the Department of
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services May provide
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
some perspective on when they hear
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
complaints or how how this all plays out
 
01:39:34.550 --> 01:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
but um do have some outstanding concerns
 
01:39:37.629 --> 01:39:37.639 align:start position:0%
with this Bill thank
 
01:39:37.639 --> 01:39:39.310 align:start position:0%
with this Bill thank
you

01:39:39.310 --> 01:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
representative SE seaworth and then
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
representative Naval Len thank you Mr
 
01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:45.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for your
 
01:39:47.149 --> 01:39:47.159 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you represent are you
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
aware of in existing
 
01:39:54.390 --> 01:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
contracts is there Lang language within
 
01:39:57.510 --> 01:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
them that requires compliance with state
 
01:39:59.870 --> 01:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
law as a condition of of the contract
 
01:40:01.950 --> 01:40:01.960 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a very good question and I
 
01:40:03.390 --> 01:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
would yield to the Department of Health
 
01:40:05.189 --> 01:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
and Human Services as to whether that's
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
a required expectation in their
 
01:40:09.149 --> 01:40:09.159 align:start position:0%
contracts and how they would handle a
 
01:40:11.629 --> 01:40:11.639 align:start position:0%
violation of that provision of their
 
01:40:15.669 --> 01:40:15.679 align:start position:0%
contracts thank you representative Neno
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
Neno aleno um thank you for taking the
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
questions so if I understand you uh
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
correctly and I and and I probably might
 
01:40:26.669 --> 01:40:26.679 align:start position:0%
agree to some extent that they're a
 
01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:30.639 align:start position:0%
process your focus was on process issues
 
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
so my question is would uh your
 
01:40:36.430 --> 01:40:36.440 align:start position:0%
organization be willing to work with the
 
01:40:39.790 --> 01:40:39.800 align:start position:0%
committee to uh sort out the process
 
01:40:42.629 --> 01:40:42.639 align:start position:0%
questions really you know may not be a
 
01:40:44.589 --> 01:40:44.599 align:start position:0%
simple matter but most contracts I think
 
01:40:47.070 --> 01:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
contain some of the issues that was were
 
01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
raised by representative Murray and
 
01:40:53.550 --> 01:40:53.560 align:start position:0%
those are eminently fixable is is this
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
something that you'd be you know beyond
 
01:40:57.709 --> 01:40:57.719 align:start position:0%
the process questions would be willing
 
01:40:59.229 --> 01:40:59.239 align:start position:0%
to work with the committee to sort out
 
01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
the process questions and would that be
 
01:41:04.350 --> 01:41:04.360 align:start position:0%
uh uh make this acceptable yeah I'm
 
01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:06.440 align:start position:0%
always available to work with the
 
01:41:08.870 --> 01:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
committee I think what this what
 
01:41:11.390 --> 01:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
addressed that is accountability and I I
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
would agree that some you know there are
 
01:41:14.589 --> 01:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
certain issues that are raised by other
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
members of the committee that are
 
01:41:18.750 --> 01:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
processed related questions and and
 
01:41:22.390 --> 01:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
language questions and I'm assuming uh
 
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:24.840 align:start position:0%
those could be sorted out in a manner
 
01:41:26.589 --> 01:41:26.599 align:start position:0%
that's consistent with what basic
 
01:41:26.599 --> 01:41:28.750 align:start position:0%
that's consistent with what basic
contract

01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
contract
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
law I I I'd be happy to share any
 
01:41:33.589 --> 01:41:33.599 align:start position:0%
perspective and get feedback from our
 
01:41:37.510 --> 01:41:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative representative priest
 
01:41:41.709 --> 01:41:41.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:41:46.589 --> 01:41:46.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I'm concerned
 
01:41:50.510 --> 01:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
about the unintended consequences of
 
01:41:53.910 --> 01:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment to the healthc care
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
providers and those who are getting the
 
01:42:03.310 --> 01:42:03.320 align:start position:0%
services um and I would love to see some
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
quick analysis of how many contracts are
 
01:42:10.350 --> 01:42:10.360 align:start position:0%
out there how many people are served
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
what if we took a drastic approach and
 
01:42:16.950 --> 01:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
said you have to live this by the letter
 
01:42:20.669 --> 01:42:20.679 align:start position:0%
of the law and there are no um
 
01:42:25.189 --> 01:42:25.199 align:start position:0%
remediation or no process on this like
 
01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
like we're seeing now with the executive
 
01:42:31.270 --> 01:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
Council by not awarding contracts I mean
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
I would like to know what the impacts
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
are going to be to this state and to the
 
01:42:40.390 --> 01:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
people who are needing these Services is
 
01:42:43.229 --> 01:42:43.239 align:start position:0%
that something that you could look at so
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
I would just respond a couple ways thank
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
you representative for the question the
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
first is um I think as stated by others
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
who have provided testimony the hope is
 
01:42:55.709 --> 01:42:55.719 align:start position:0%
that this wouldn't have to
 
01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
be a measure that gets triggered and we
 
01:43:02.189 --> 01:43:02.199 align:start position:0%
are committed to our members are
 
01:43:04.910 --> 01:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
committed to the patient Bill of Rights
 
01:43:06.910 --> 01:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
however we do have to look at the as you
 
01:43:09.350 --> 01:43:09.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned the consequences that are
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
intentionally laid out in this non-gain
 
01:43:16.149 --> 01:43:16.159 align:start position:0%
amendment should those circumstances
 
01:43:18.790 --> 01:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
trigger a Prohibition for the Department
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services not to
 
01:43:23.550 --> 01:43:23.560 align:start position:0%
contract not be allowed to contract cont
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
with the hospital to provide
 
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
services um with respect to my
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
involvement in reviewing the um the Imp
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
the potential impact the hypothetical
 
01:43:37.390 --> 01:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
impact of this bill I'm available and
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
would be happy to work with the
 
01:43:41.589 --> 01:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
committee or anybody else however I also
 
01:43:43.990 --> 01:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
think that you could go to the source of
 
01:43:45.669 --> 01:43:45.679 align:start position:0%
these contracts which is the Department
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services to get a
 
01:43:50.470 --> 01:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
full understanding and accounting of
 
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
what contracts they have with Hospital
 
01:43:56.910 --> 01:43:56.920 align:start position:0%
licensed under RSA
 
01:43:59.550 --> 01:43:59.560 align:start position:0%
151 thank
 
01:44:02.550 --> 01:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
you all right I see I have a card here
 
01:44:05.310 --> 01:44:05.320 align:start position:0%
from somebody that deals with DHHS
 
01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
contracts and maybe they can answer some
 
01:44:09.070 --> 01:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
of your questions if there's no further
 
01:44:11.709 --> 01:44:11.719 align:start position:0%
questions for this witness thank you Mr
 
01:44:15.709 --> 01:44:15.719 align:start position:0%
chair thank you so we'll call on Robert
 
01:44:19.390 --> 01:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
Moore says he's representing DHHS
 
01:44:21.470 --> 01:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
contracts thank you for coming and
 
01:44:23.669 --> 01:44:23.679 align:start position:0%
helping us out
 
01:44:25.229 --> 01:44:25.239 align:start position:0%
yeah good afternoon for the record
 
01:44:26.950 --> 01:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
Robert Moore I'm the contracts director
 
01:44:28.189 --> 01:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Health and Human
 
01:44:30.149 --> 01:44:30.159 align:start position:0%
Services um first the Department's not
 
01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
taking a position on this bill but I did
 
01:44:34.030 --> 01:44:34.040 align:start position:0%
want to attempt to answer some of the
 
01:44:36.390 --> 01:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
questions that came up earlier um namely
 
01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:38.199 align:start position:0%
around the number of contracts that the
 
01:44:39.790 --> 01:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
department currently has with hospitals
 
01:44:41.270 --> 01:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
and this is just a rough count we can
 
01:44:43.390 --> 01:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
get you a complete list of these
 
01:44:46.109 --> 01:44:46.119 align:start position:0%
contracts um later we have somewhere
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
between um 23 to 24 active contracts
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
with six to7 hospitals and as referenced
 
01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
earlier those includes some of our
 
01:44:55.629 --> 01:44:55.639 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric Services and neurology
 
01:44:57.790 --> 01:44:57.800 align:start position:0%
services at New Hampshire hospital um
 
01:44:59.790 --> 01:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
Regional public health networks a wide
 
01:45:01.950 --> 01:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
range of services with various hospitals
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:08.159 align:start position:0%
state questions for this
 
01:45:11.109 --> 01:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
witness representative
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
PRI thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:45:18.350 --> 01:45:18.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions of those 2324
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
contracts how many people are being
 
01:45:24.350 --> 01:45:24.360 align:start position:0%
served and how many people would lose
 
01:45:27.709 --> 01:45:27.719 align:start position:0%
this service if suddenly somebody
 
01:45:30.510 --> 01:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
claimed that you were not in compliance
 
01:45:33.310 --> 01:45:33.320 align:start position:0%
and therefore the contract would be void
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
it really varies greatly by the contract
 
01:45:37.070 --> 01:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
I don't have those numbers uh with me
 
01:45:38.830 --> 01:45:38.840 align:start position:0%
today but I can C we can certainly pull
 
01:45:42.189 --> 01:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
those numbers together thank
 
01:45:44.750 --> 01:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
you representative rung for a question
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
then represent thank you Mr chair um and
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mren for taking my question um
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
I I actually have two you said that DHHS
 
01:45:58.550 --> 01:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
has 23 to 24 contracts with 67
 
01:46:01.310 --> 01:46:01.320 align:start position:0%
hospitals excuse me 6 to7 Hospital six
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
to S I'm sorry okay so I'm assuming most
 
01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the hospitals in New Hampshire don't
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
have any contracts with DHHS so this
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't impact them um in terms of the
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
actual so I want to make a distinction
 
01:46:16.830 --> 01:46:16.840 align:start position:0%
between you know Medicaid providers
 
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
providing Medicaid services and then the
 
01:46:19.709 --> 01:46:19.719 align:start position:0%
hospitals that we're actively
 
01:46:21.510 --> 01:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
Contracting with so that would be a
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
minority of the hospital 6 to seven
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals oh okay and followup Mr chair
 
01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
um what um are there other dep
 
01:46:33.030 --> 01:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
departments that you're aware of in or
 
01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
other other areas of the state of state
 
01:46:37.390 --> 01:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
government that provide contracts to
 
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals besides DHHS I believe there
 
01:46:43.189 --> 01:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
would be other agencies that um may have
 
01:46:44.669 --> 01:46:44.679 align:start position:0%
contracts with hospitals off the top of
 
01:46:46.750 --> 01:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
my head I couldn't cite those um but we
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
could look into that as well okay thank
 
01:46:52.270 --> 01:46:52.280 align:start position:0%
you representative Ms for a question
 
01:46:54.750 --> 01:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr whoa thank you Mr chair and
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question um
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
those those 23 or 24 contracts that you
 
01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned do they do they have language
 
01:47:06.189 --> 01:47:06.199 align:start position:0%
in those contracts right now that
 
01:47:09.229 --> 01:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
addresses um uh that includes a
 
01:47:11.629 --> 01:47:11.639 align:start position:0%
requirement to be in compliance with the
 
01:47:13.589 --> 01:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
patient Bill of Rights and does it and
 
01:47:15.990 --> 01:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
and are there enforcement mechanisms in
 
01:47:18.390 --> 01:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
those in that contract as well yes so
 
01:47:21.390 --> 01:47:21.400 align:start position:0%
all state contracts um have uh what's
 
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
called a form p37 so those are standard
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
terms and conditions of all state
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
contracts the department of health uses
 
01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
those there's a provision in there that
 
01:47:32.470 --> 01:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
contractors are agreeing to um comply
 
01:47:35.390 --> 01:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
with all applicable state federal local
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
laws and regulations um should a
 
01:47:39.990 --> 01:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
contractor be in violation with that
 
01:47:41.950 --> 01:47:41.960 align:start position:0%
provision uh we would consider that an
 
01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:44.800 align:start position:0%
event an event of default um and there
 
01:47:47.070 --> 01:47:47.080 align:start position:0%
are also uh corrective action steps that
 
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
we would take to work with the
 
01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
contractor to remedy it remedy that um
 
01:47:51.910 --> 01:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
that are articulated in the contract as
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
well a quick so quick followup um so
 
01:47:59.189 --> 01:47:59.199 align:start position:0%
given that that language already exists
 
01:48:02.109 --> 01:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
it it to me it sounds like the intent of
 
01:48:03.950 --> 01:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment is already addressed in
 
01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:06.639 align:start position:0%
the existing contracts that we have
 
01:48:09.669 --> 01:48:09.679 align:start position:0%
would that be a fair statement um I I
 
01:48:11.790 --> 01:48:11.800 align:start position:0%
think I would defer to this committee uh
 
01:48:13.390 --> 01:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
to to make that assessment as I said the
 
01:48:14.669 --> 01:48:14.679 align:start position:0%
Department's not taking a position on
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
that but um there are I can say there
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
are um requirements within all of our
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
contracts that all contractors have to
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
comply with state law um and there are
 
01:48:24.709 --> 01:48:24.719 align:start position:0%
steps outlined in those contracts that
 
01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
we we would take to work with that
 
01:48:27.629 --> 01:48:27.639 align:start position:0%
contractor to remedy that should they
 
01:48:30.189 --> 01:48:30.199 align:start position:0%
not remedy um those those events of
 
01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:33.080 align:start position:0%
default uh within the period um as
 
01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
required by the department um we would
 
01:48:37.030 --> 01:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
take steps to then uh potentially
 
01:48:39.950 --> 01:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:43.629 --> 01:48:43.639 align:start position:0%
contract further questions who was first
 
01:48:47.310 --> 01:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
here restive Campell thank you Mr chair
 
01:48:51.030 --> 01:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
so just um question in this particular
 
01:48:52.990 --> 01:48:53.000 align:start position:0%
case that just occurred recently with
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
tcock did HHS take any corrective action
 
01:48:57.629 --> 01:48:57.639 align:start position:0%
to help that
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
patient um I as the contract director I
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
wasn't involved in that that's that's
 
01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
not within my purview um I my
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
understanding is the Department of
 
01:49:08.510 --> 01:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
Justice was working closely with um
 
01:49:11.310 --> 01:49:11.320 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth to uh remedy that um but we
 
01:49:12.510 --> 01:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
could I could certainly take that back
 
01:49:15.390 --> 01:49:15.400 align:start position:0%
to the team the focuses on that and get
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
you those details followup yes thank you
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
for the followup so it doesn't seem like
 
01:49:23.629 --> 01:49:23.639 align:start position:0%
the system's working you just you know
 
01:49:27.629 --> 01:49:27.639 align:start position:0%
you laid out a very nice um process of
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
how it's supposed to work when there's a
 
01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
violation and HHS has those contracts
 
01:49:36.030 --> 01:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
why wasn't HHS involved before you had
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
to go to the Department of Justice I I
 
01:49:41.229 --> 01:49:41.239 align:start position:0%
can't again I can't speak to D Justice
 
01:49:42.589 --> 01:49:42.599 align:start position:0%
involvement because that's not within
 
01:49:44.470 --> 01:49:44.480 align:start position:0%
the purview of the contracts Bureau in
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
terms of what steps or what um
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
involvement the department had up to
 
01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:49.430 align:start position:0%
involvement the department had up to
that

01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:49:51.950 --> 01:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
point representative tki for thank you
 
01:49:53.790 --> 01:49:53.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh thank you for taking my
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
question um you spoke specifically about
 
01:49:59.510 --> 01:49:59.520 align:start position:0%
um six to seven hospitals that currently
 
01:50:01.109 --> 01:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
have contracts with the state that's
 
01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
correct but previously in this hearing
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
um we were discussing um and it was
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
referred to the fact that every hospital
 
01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
that takes Medicaid patients have a
 
01:50:13.589 --> 01:50:13.599 align:start position:0%
contract with the state so based on that
 
01:50:15.350 --> 01:50:15.360 align:start position:0%
information I'm trying to figure out how
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
this amendment the language of this
 
01:50:19.149 --> 01:50:19.159 align:start position:0%
amendment actually applies if you
 
01:50:21.310 --> 01:50:21.320 align:start position:0%
believe that this would apply to every
 
01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
single hospital that takes medic a
 
01:50:25.149 --> 01:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
patients or do you think that it's
 
01:50:28.669 --> 01:50:28.679 align:start position:0%
written to just mean an additional
 
01:50:31.629 --> 01:50:31.639 align:start position:0%
contract that a hospital has with the
 
01:50:34.430 --> 01:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
state perhaps Hamstead hospital or other
 
01:50:38.669 --> 01:50:38.679 align:start position:0%
services um I would take this to mean um
 
01:50:40.910 --> 01:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
hospitals that we actively have a
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
contract with which are again a
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
distinction made between those hospitals
 
01:50:46.669 --> 01:50:46.679 align:start position:0%
we contract with and then those
 
01:50:49.830 --> 01:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:52.069 --> 01:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
providers okay so there we I would not
 
01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
consider those be contractors um in
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
terms of contractors that sign hospitals
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
that sign our p37 contract okay that's
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
what I thought thank
 
01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:03.800 align:start position:0%
you represent hack and Phillips thank
 
01:51:05.430 --> 01:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr Mo for
 
01:51:07.589 --> 01:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
taking my question um just to follow
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
along the lines of my colleague's
 
01:51:12.510 --> 01:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
earlier question about the actual uh
 
01:51:14.910 --> 01:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
language in current existing contracts
 
01:51:18.669 --> 01:51:18.679 align:start position:0%
um I I'm assuming that these contracts
 
01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
also have kind of standard waiver notice
 
01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
and acceleration Clauses as
 
01:51:27.149 --> 01:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
well um can you can you explain a little
 
01:51:29.350 --> 01:51:29.360 align:start position:0%
more what you mean exactly by your
 
01:51:31.950 --> 01:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
interpretation default upon a default
 
01:51:35.390 --> 01:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
that the state would have the option to
 
01:51:38.069 --> 01:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
to wave additional notice and to
 
01:51:40.350 --> 01:51:40.360 align:start position:0%
accelerate you know their remedies
 
01:51:41.709 --> 01:51:41.719 align:start position:0%
essentially yeah there are a number of
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
steps we can take up up until um one
 
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:47.360 align:start position:0%
notice of of the event of default um
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
articulating what the corrective action
 
01:51:50.990 --> 01:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
is the cure period in order to remedy
 
01:51:52.750 --> 01:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
that corrective action all the way up to
 
01:51:54.510 --> 01:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
termination should should that be
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
necessary great thank you further
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
questions representative Rong thank you
 
01:52:04.669 --> 01:52:04.679 align:start position:0%
Mr chair it just came to my mind that in
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
the language of the amendment it says
 
01:52:08.790 --> 01:52:08.800 align:start position:0%
the department shall not contract with
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
any Hospital found in violation so do
 
01:52:13.510 --> 01:52:13.520 align:start position:0%
you take that to mean that the
 
01:52:14.950 --> 01:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
department would never be able to
 
01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
contract with that hospital again if
 
01:52:18.950 --> 01:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
they were found in violation because it
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
says shall not
 
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
contract um I think so that question
 
01:52:24.990 --> 01:52:25.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's a great question thank you
 
01:52:28.149 --> 01:52:28.159 align:start position:0%
for the question um I I guess I would
 
01:52:29.910 --> 01:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
defer to the committee in terms of how
 
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
that's been interpreted um I think that
 
01:52:33.589 --> 01:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
question's been raised in terms of
 
01:52:37.470 --> 01:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
seeking Clarity on that um so we I mean
 
01:52:39.310 --> 01:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sort of here to Monitor and and
 
01:52:40.950 --> 01:52:40.960 align:start position:0%
better understand how how the department
 
01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:43.360 align:start position:0%
could comply with this as written thank
 
01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:44.750 align:start position:0%
could comply with this as written thank
you

01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:52:47.430 --> 01:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
yeah anything further for the
 
01:52:50.229 --> 01:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
witness seeing none thank you for your
 
01:52:53.430 --> 01:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you
 
01:52:55.069 --> 01:52:55.079 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else that would like to
 
01:52:58.990 --> 01:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
testify on this either 519 or the
 
01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:01.390 align:start position:0%
testify on this either 519 or the
proposed

01:53:01.390 --> 01:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%

sheet the uh remote people that have
 
01:53:16.109 --> 01:53:16.119 align:start position:0%
have signed in um for the house bill
 
01:53:18.990 --> 01:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
519 it doesn't say for the amendment it
 
01:53:22.669 --> 01:53:22.679 align:start position:0%
says supported by 35 opposed by three
 
01:53:25.709 --> 01:53:25.719 align:start position:0%
neutral for zero so we have some input
 
01:53:29.229 --> 01:53:29.239 align:start position:0%
on this we have some input from our
 
01:53:31.709 --> 01:53:31.719 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and this will be again
 
01:53:35.629 --> 01:53:35.639 align:start position:0%
discussed next Tuesday at time did I say

01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:13.629 --> 01:54:13.639 align:start position:0%
Edwards his uh urgency to me before this
 
01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:15.440 align:start position:0%
thing was he wanted it to get to the
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
house as soon as possible so that there
 
01:54:21.390 --> 01:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
would be a vote on the amendment so the
 
01:54:25.270 --> 01:54:25.280 align:start position:0%
amendment basically replaces
 
01:54:28.149 --> 01:54:28.159 align:start position:0%
519 well we would have to re he it
 
01:54:30.669 --> 01:54:30.679 align:start position:0%
actually doesn't so I just wondering if
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
we were going to have a work session or
 
01:54:33.430 --> 01:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
not but you're stating that we're not
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
having a work session he he didn't
 
01:54:38.470 --> 01:54:38.480 align:start position:0%
indicate to me prior to this that he
 
01:54:40.149 --> 01:54:40.159 align:start position:0%
planned a work session I told him we
 
01:54:42.109 --> 01:54:42.119 align:start position:0%
were having an exact session do you want
 
01:54:44.189 --> 01:54:44.199 align:start position:0%
it to be on it yes I want it to get
 
01:54:47.310 --> 01:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
before the house as soon as possible
 
01:54:50.950 --> 01:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
so that's that's where we sit we will we
 
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
will be exacting tomorrow
 
01:54:56.589 --> 01:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
as I said next next week
 
01:54:59.790 --> 01:54:59.800 align:start position:0%
so that's when we'll have further
 
01:55:02.750 --> 01:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
discussion on it I believe may be
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
lengthy but because of trying to stick
 
01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:08.840 align:start position:0%
with what the division one division 3
 
01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
chair gave me as his plan and now he's
 
01:55:16.390 --> 01:55:16.400 align:start position:0%
not here to make any further comment so
 
01:55:18.669 --> 01:55:18.679 align:start position:0%
with what we agreed to earlier that's
 
01:55:21.910 --> 01:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
what it was thank you for your attention
 
01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:23.229 align:start position:0%
what it was thank you for your attention
okay

01:55:23.229 --> 01:55:23.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:55:26.350 --> 01:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
so um let's see we don't have any you
 
01:55:28.589 --> 01:55:28.599 align:start position:0%
have any division chairs here to tell us
 
01:55:31.390 --> 01:55:31.400 align:start position:0%
anything for the rest of the week I
 
01:55:34.510 --> 01:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
guess not so I think probably Division
 
01:55:36.109 --> 01:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
division one's probably going to keep
 
01:55:40.149 --> 01:55:40.159 align:start position:0%
meeting representative priest uh point
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
of clarification Mr chairman um division
 
01:55:46.470 --> 01:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
three has not taken a position on the
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
bill we've discussed it but we have not
 
01:55:52.390 --> 01:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
taken a formal position and we have
 
01:55:55.229 --> 01:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
again we have not discussed this
 
01:55:58.270 --> 01:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
amendment I agree with you but this was
 
01:56:00.910 --> 01:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
the uh I did not have the impression
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
that you this was the first time you've
 
01:56:03.119 --> 01:56:04.350 align:start position:0%
that you this was the first time you've
seen

01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:56:07.629 --> 01:56:07.639 align:start position:0%
it it is in fact I'm sorry about that
 
01:56:10.270 --> 01:56:10.280 align:start position:0%
but the discussions I had with the chair
 
01:56:12.750 --> 01:56:12.760 align:start position:0%
division 3 said I want to get this to
 
01:56:14.270 --> 01:56:14.280 align:start position:0%
the house as soon as
 
01:56:17.709 --> 01:56:17.719 align:start position:0%
possible um it replaces the bill but I'm
 
01:56:19.830 --> 01:56:19.840 align:start position:0%
still taking care of Waypoint within the
 
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:22.320 align:start position:0%
body of the budget which is something
 
01:56:24.510 --> 01:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
we've done before and normally you'll
 
01:56:26.030 --> 01:56:26.040 align:start position:0%
see most of the bills that we' come
 
01:56:31.629 --> 01:56:31.639 align:start position:0%
before us will be um retained and then
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
we'll do our best to Endeavor to put
 
01:56:36.950 --> 01:56:36.960 align:start position:0%
them in the budget bill and the people
 
01:56:38.709 --> 01:56:38.719 align:start position:0%
that have those bills will come before
 
01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:40.719 align:start position:0%
us when we make the presentation say hey
 
01:56:42.589 --> 01:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
what happened to my bill we'll say yes
 
01:56:45.830 --> 01:56:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's been Incorporated and then since we
 
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
do retain them some decision has to be
 
01:56:51.069 --> 01:56:51.079 align:start position:0%
made this next fall so normally we come
 
01:56:53.109 --> 01:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
before we bring all those retain bills
 
01:56:55.709 --> 01:56:55.719 align:start position:0%
before us we go down the list this has
 
01:56:57.030 --> 01:56:57.040 align:start position:0%
been included this has been included
 
01:56:58.069 --> 01:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
this has been included this has been
 
01:56:59.870 --> 01:56:59.880 align:start position:0%
included this was not included because
 
01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
we didn't agree to it and and we do away
 
01:57:04.470 --> 01:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
with all the bills that we've retained
 
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
at that point because we've done some
 
01:57:08.229 --> 01:57:08.239 align:start position:0%
action with them within the budget
 
01:57:10.149 --> 01:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
that's the traditional way we do it I'm
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
sorry that this seems to be hastened I
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
had thought from his discussion with me
 
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:17.560 align:start position:0%
that perhaps those of you on division
 
01:57:20.189 --> 01:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
three had had some discussion on it I
 
01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
apologize but that's so far what I've
 
01:57:25.390 --> 01:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
scheduled for it if he decides to have a
 
01:57:27.950 --> 01:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
work session in the interim I'll have
 
01:57:30.550 --> 01:57:30.560 align:start position:0%
him contact you as we've got a week can
 
01:57:32.310 --> 01:57:32.320 align:start position:0%
I just ask a quick clarification so that
 
01:57:34.069 --> 01:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
means that it'll come to full Finance
 
01:57:36.069 --> 01:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
without a recommendation from division
 
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
three that's
 
01:57:41.189 --> 01:57:41.199 align:start position:0%
process-wise Mr Ripple or that is what
 
01:57:43.030 --> 01:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
would happen I just briefly talked to
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards a few minutes ago
 
01:57:46.069 --> 01:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
he said there will probably be a
 
01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
division 3 work session on this before
 
01:57:50.310 --> 01:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
the full Finance meeting so I'll I'll
 
01:57:51.870 --> 01:57:51.880 align:start position:0%
confirm with him and try to schedule
 
01:57:54.669 --> 01:57:54.679 align:start position:0%
something maybe for this Friday very
 
01:57:57.350 --> 01:57:57.360 align:start position:0%
good all right so that's that's the
 
01:58:00.709 --> 01:58:00.719 align:start position:0%
latest we have thank you so possibly be
 
01:58:06.790 --> 01:58:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:09.390 --> 01:58:09.400 align:start position:0%
Friday so anything further come before
 
01:58:11.790 --> 01:58:11.800 align:start position:0%
us I don't know if there's uh probably
 
01:58:13.470 --> 01:58:13.480 align:start position:0%
division one meets
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow Vice chair does anybody anybody
 
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
know in division one no we don't we
 
01:58:21.550 --> 01:58:21.560 align:start position:0%
don't meet you're not meeting all right
 
01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:23.109 align:start position:0%
don't meet you're not meeting all right
so

01:58:23.109 --> 01:58:23.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:25.950 --> 01:58:25.960 align:start position:0%
we'll see everybody Thursday Mr chair I
 
01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
have a question about
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
Friday do we have any estimate for how
 
01:58:32.910 --> 01:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
long the presentation will be on Friday
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
afternoon give me the question again uh
 
01:58:36.589 --> 01:58:36.599 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering about Friday
 
01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon with the governor um do we
 
01:58:41.310 --> 01:58:41.320 align:start position:0%
have any idea or estimate of how long
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
the unless he shared it with with Mr
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
Ripple he didn't share anything with me
 
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:53.679 align:start position:0%
Friday I've got FIS on Friday this will
 
01:58:58.589 --> 01:58:58.599 align:start position:0%
be in this this room at 11:00 for fiscal
 
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
and then I have down division one at
 
01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:03.589 align:start position:0%
and then I have down division one at
1:15

01:59:03.589 --> 01:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
1:15
 
01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
okay representative Edwards we have a
 
01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
lot of questions about the fact that
 
01:59:11.550 --> 01:59:11.560 align:start position:0%
your your division members would like to
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
see a work session on this
 
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
bill I I I'm I I think we can work
 
01:59:20.229 --> 01:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
session this bill um I I didn't think
 
01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
this was controversial um I'm surprised
 
01:59:26.550 --> 01:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
that it is as controversial as it is but
 
01:59:30.350 --> 01:59:30.360 align:start position:0%
um rather than ask you to put it on to
 
01:59:35.109 --> 01:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
exact next week I'll work with my LBA Mr
 
01:59:38.589 --> 01:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
Ripple to to do a routine scheduling so
 
01:59:42.750 --> 01:59:42.760 align:start position:0%
division 3 has another work
 
01:59:47.189 --> 01:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
session um before we bring it back uh I
 
01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't know if you would want
 
01:59:50.910 --> 01:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
to just take it straight into an exec
 
01:59:53.149 --> 01:59:53.159 align:start position:0%
after division three does one more work
 
01:59:55.149 --> 01:59:55.159 align:start position:0%
session on it or not I I I think it
 
01:59:57.390 --> 01:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
should be ready people will either know
 
01:59:59.990 --> 02:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
yes or no at that
 
02:00:04.350 --> 02:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
point okay Friday is available um not
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
this room pretty much because let's see
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
what we got here and then it's always
 
02:00:12.149 --> 02:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
the calendaring issue we're early enough
 
02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
to get it into the calendar yes you if
 
02:00:17.149 --> 02:00:17.159 align:start position:0%
you want to hold a meeting this Friday
 
02:00:19.470 --> 02:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
and so you could uh execute out in full
 
02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
Finance next week we could try to make
 
02:00:22.830 --> 02:00:22.840 align:start position:0%
something work
 
02:00:25.030 --> 02:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
uh and it would get in the calendar um
 
02:00:26.669 --> 02:00:26.679 align:start position:0%
the limitation on Friday is the governor
 
02:00:28.310 --> 02:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
does present to the full finance
 
02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
committee at 2:30 but we could try to do
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
something before
 
02:00:35.870 --> 02:00:35.880 align:start position:0%
that Y and we're hoping to have a a
 
02:00:40.629 --> 02:00:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:45.950 --> 02:00:45.960 align:start position:0%
Friday okay so um the Republicans were
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
no we're trying to caucus as a full
 
02:00:50.990 --> 02:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee on one at 1:00 right correct
 
02:00:53.629 --> 02:00:53.639 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
then try in the
 
02:00:58.910 --> 02:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
morning can the morning of the 14th I'm
 
02:01:02.069 --> 02:01:02.079 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at division three people for
 
02:01:04.790 --> 02:01:04.800 align:start position:0%
work session is it is that when fiscal
 
02:01:07.149 --> 02:01:07.159 align:start position:0%
meets I just wanted to get clarity on
 
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
the process because there would not be a
 
02:01:11.229 --> 02:01:11.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation from our division going
 
02:01:13.390 --> 02:01:13.400 align:start position:0%
into the exec session on Tuesday which
 
02:01:14.910 --> 02:01:14.920 align:start position:0%
is why I was asking about the work
 
02:01:16.950 --> 02:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
session and since we haven't seen the
 
02:01:19.189 --> 02:01:19.199 align:start position:0%
final amendment I I I think that's a
 
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%

02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
the only member missing so far
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
okay I appreciate your texting thank
 
02:02:12.470 --> 02:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair can I try again to ask my
 
02:02:14.910 --> 02:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
question about the 2:30 meeting with the
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
governor here in Finance on Friday do we
 
02:02:19.910 --> 02:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
have an estimate for the amount of time
 
02:02:22.149 --> 02:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
that her office plans to present present
 
02:02:24.990 --> 02:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
to us we don't thank you and normally
 
02:02:27.149 --> 02:02:27.159 align:start position:0%
it's it's the governor will be here a
 
02:02:30.149 --> 02:02:30.159 align:start position:0%
short time maybe half an hour and then
 
02:02:32.189 --> 02:02:32.199 align:start position:0%
would leave the uh budget director here
 
02:02:33.990 --> 02:02:34.000 align:start position:0%
to answer questions for as long as it
 
02:02:37.629 --> 02:02:37.639 align:start position:0%
takes so um that's generally the way
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
we've been doing it and I don't know how
 
02:02:43.629 --> 02:02:43.639 align:start position:0%
lengthy that my guess would be they'd
 
02:02:45.430 --> 02:02:45.440 align:start position:0%
all get tired of it in an hour an hour
 
02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%

I know some of you had to run out to do
 
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
a committee or a a bill presentation and
 
02:04:26.030 --> 02:04:26.040 align:start position:0%

02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
goes and uh you know I I appreciate that
 
02:04:31.430 --> 02:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
you're all want to be very thoroughly
 
02:04:34.629 --> 02:04:34.639 align:start position:0%
involved in this because this is tricky
 
02:04:36.149 --> 02:04:36.159 align:start position:0%
we didn't really get any straight
 
02:04:38.430 --> 02:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
answers about this contract stuff did we
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
anybodys hear it well we got this we got
 
02:04:44.149 --> 02:04:44.159 align:start position:0%
of that maybe this maybe that and Jose
 
02:04:46.910 --> 02:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
has personal experience that he was
 
02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
forced to take the
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%
shot to get his treatment so you know
 
02:04:53.830 --> 02:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
obviously they were kind of overlooking
 
02:04:56.669 --> 02:04:56.679 align:start position:0%
this and and also distressed by the fact
 
02:04:59.270 --> 02:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
that covid we're now hearing more and
 
02:05:02.390 --> 02:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
more negatives about it and you know and
 
02:05:04.030 --> 02:05:04.040 align:start position:0%
and it's not being pushed as much as it
 
02:05:06.790 --> 02:05:06.800 align:start position:0%
was because they admitted it wasn't a
 
02:05:10.189 --> 02:05:10.199 align:start position:0%
vaccine it did not it did not prevent as
 
02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
a vaccine
 
02:05:14.750 --> 02:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
should and people that are getting the
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh the boosters I don't think it's
 
02:05:19.470 --> 02:05:19.480 align:start position:0%
helping much either but yes sir may I
 
02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
comment on that sir I I think the health
 
02:05:24.390 --> 02:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
Community uh to to include the folks at
 
02:05:28.069 --> 02:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
the CDC still call it a vaccine and I've
 
02:05:31.069 --> 02:05:31.079 align:start position:0%
talked to them about they re the damage
 
02:05:34.189 --> 02:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
they've done to the word vaccine um and
 
02:05:36.149 --> 02:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
they understand that but they they they
 
02:05:37.910 --> 02:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
still considered a
 
02:05:42.830 --> 02:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:46.109 --> 02:05:46.119 align:start position:0%
