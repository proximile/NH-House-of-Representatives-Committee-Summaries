00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.500
Try it again with the mic on.

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:18.000
It being 930, I'm going to call the subcommittee work session for Senate Bill 282 to order.

6
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.500
And would you like to, Representative Marsh?

7
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:29.000
Yes, I would move that we recommend to the full committee adoption of Amendment 1596H.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I second.

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Okay.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And any discussion?

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The discussion is this accomplishes what we decided on Friday, and there are really no changes in it.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And we've heard from...

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Go.

14
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm not too worried about it.

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and we've heard from those who worked with us on the amendment that it is acceptable.

16
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Okay.

17
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I guess I'll call the roll for this.

18
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.500
So this is for the adoption of Amendment 2022-1596-H to Senate Bill 282.

19
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.500
Representative Marsh?

20
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.500
Yes.

21
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.500
Representative Grota?

22
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.500
Yes.

23
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.000
And the chair votes yes.

24
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Okay.

25
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.500
So that's three to zero.

26
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.000
And anybody want to make another motion?

27
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I move that Senate bill 282 ought to pass with amendment 1596 H and we've discussed it sufficiently.

28
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
I'll second that one.

29
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Do you want to speak to your motion?

30
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I think we've discussed it sufficiently.

31
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Okay.

32
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.500
In that case, I'll call the roll.

33
00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.500
Representative Marsh?

34
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.500
Yes.

35
00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.500
Representative Grota?

36
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.500
Yes.

37
00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.000
And the chair votes yes.

38
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
That's 3-2.

39
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And the motion passes.

40
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:18.000
So I'm going to, unless there's anything else, I'll close the subcommittee work session on Senate Bill 282 Thank you.

41
00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Thank you.

42
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Thank you.

43
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
.
