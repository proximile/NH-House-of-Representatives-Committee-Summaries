00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
week couple of notes um from this m
 
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
morning's meeting with the speaker
 
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 align:start position:0%
before we get
 
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.709 align:start position:0%
before we get
started

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 align:start position:0%
started
 
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
um first of all it's the use of
 
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
computers and uh and cell phones during
 
00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
committee uh and from the three or the
 
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
two committee meetings we've had I think
 
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're doing pretty well with that
 
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
biggest thing is to re that we need to
 
00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 align:start position:0%
treat people giving testimony with
 
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
respect and dignity and so therefore
 
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
don't let it be a distraction but I
 
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
understand that certain things happen
 
00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 align:start position:0%
and people take notes and do research I
 
00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
got all that uh so please just continue
 
00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
to do what you're doing and and not make
 
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
it a
 
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.670 align:start position:0%
it a
distraction

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
distraction
 
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
um the other thing from this morning is
 
00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 align:start position:0%
on parking and so if you have an
 
00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 align:start position:0%
assigned parking spot like whether it's
 
00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's down in the parking lot or if it's
 
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
along the the road you'll know that you
 
00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 align:start position:0%
have it along the road if you don't know
 
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 align:start position:0%
you have it then you don't and so a bag
 
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
a bag over a a uh a meter is not your
 
00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
spot unless you've been assigned that
 
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 align:start position:0%
spot it's for people that are whether
 
00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
they're disabled or or whatever reason
 
00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
that they've got um access closer um
 
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
they are going to start enforcing that
 
00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
um which means a warning to the
 
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
committee and then a toe and so just
 
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
fair warning that you know that is sort
 
00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
of a policy and truth be told I didn't
 
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
know that when I was a first year
 
00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 align:start position:0%
freshman and I didn't get told but I
 
00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
felt bad because I actually used one of
 
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
those and then I stopped using it so
 
00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 align:start position:0%
just a fair
 
00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
warning all right off to the business of
 
00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.830 align:start position:0%

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.080 align:start position:0%

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
Wish ladies and gentlemen of this
 
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
committee Comm let me start by
 
00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 align:start position:0%
acknowledging the fire in the bellies of
 
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
those who spoke last session passion has
 
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
filled this chamber and we must respect
 
00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 align:start position:0%
that but now is the time to stoke that
 
00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
fire with some truth about the engine of
 
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire economy our small
 
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 align:start position:0%
businesses we've heard the tales of
 
00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 align:start position:0%
Union woes and benefits of the sanctity
 
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 align:start position:0%
of collective bargaining for the likes
 
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 align:start position:0%
of teachers electricians and
 
00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
firefighters but what about the silent
 
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 align:start position:0%
majority the small to mediumsized
 
00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 align:start position:0%
Enterprises those with fewer than 200
 
00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
Souls the truckers the local innovators
 
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
the backbone of our state's economy
 
00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 align:start position:0%
these are not the UPS Giants or the
 
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
municipal unions or the Detroit Auto
 
00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 align:start position:0%
factories these are the businesses where
 
00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 align:start position:0%
every employee knows the owner's name
 
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
and where the coffee is brewed by the
 
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
boss's hand let's be clear the Allure of
 
00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 align:start position:0%
Union stability is undeniable who
 
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want the security or a golden
 
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
parachute for retirement but let's not
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
be fooled by the glitter of that gold
 
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
The Narrative that you if you don't grab
 
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
that pot the owner's will is not just
 
00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 align:start position:0%
misleading it's an insult to the
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
hardworking entrepreneurs of New
 
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 align:start position:0%
Hampshire these owners have not only
 
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
Built these businesses from the ground
 
00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
up but they have nurtured their teams
 
00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:37.759 align:start position:0%
turning them into families and then
 
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 align:start position:0%
those into communities so why is it then
 
00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
that these small business owners have
 
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
been conspicuously absent from this
 
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
discourse it's almost if we have decided
 
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 align:start position:0%
to ignore the very people who breathe
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
life into our local economies they have
 
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
been ignored and frankly as a business
 
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
owner I find it highly offensive I stand
 
00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
here to remind my colleagues that
 
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
capitalism isn't the villain in this
 
00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 align:start position:0%
story it's what provides the job jobs
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
and promotes Innovation it's what drives
 
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
our economy forward while unions have
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
their place I can assure you that New
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's small businesses are fully
 
00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:10.759 align:start position:0%
capable of managing their own
 
00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 align:start position:0%
employees respectfully it asks the
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
Committees to remember this without
 
00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 align:start position:0%
these small business owners there are no
 
00:06:20.589 --> 00:06:20.599 align:start position:0%
jobs let's not let the narrative be
 
00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
hijacked by one side and let's Champion
 
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 align:start position:0%
those who have fought tooth and nail to
 
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.360 align:start position:0%

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%

movement uh should have minority
 
00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
bargaining whether or not we should be
 
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 align:start position:0%

00:07:26.589 --> 00:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
employment it provides the opportunity
 
00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
to carve that out now out of the
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
collective marking agreement now think
 
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
about that think about that from some of
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
the comments that have been made in this
 
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee we are a major contributor
 
00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 align:start position:0%
labor movement is a major contributor to
 
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
the economy in New Hampshire and what
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
you're doing here is that you are
 
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:50.840 align:start position:0%
injecting into those relationships that
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
have been built for many many years
 
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
injecting into that into that
 
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
process you're taking away the right
 
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
that these people have to have shared
 
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
cost and shared responsibility because
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
those people who are under the umbrella
 
00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
of the labor movement as part of the
 
00:08:15.309 --> 00:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
law those people H are going to have the
 
00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:18.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get all of those benefits
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of everything that the
 
00:08:23.469 --> 00:08:23.479 align:start position:0%
labor movement has to offer and not pay
 
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
a single dime for that not a single dime
 
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:29.720 align:start position:0%
and that's what's that this is not not
 
00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
about the overall labor move this is
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
about one
 
00:08:37.509 --> 00:08:37.519 align:start position:0%
provision and the law is so specific
 
00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:40.919 align:start position:0%
that many people don't know this but
 
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
they in the union Workforce if members
 
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
of that Union are unhappy with this
 
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.310 align:start position:0%
of that Union are unhappy with this
agency

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
fee what they can do is they can file if
 
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:53.480 align:start position:0%
30% of them want that out of their
 
00:08:55.710 --> 00:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
contract they can file for an election
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
for that particular provision only
 
00:09:00.069 --> 00:09:00.079 align:start position:0%
provision in law
 
00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:02.079 align:start position:0%
the only provision of the Taft hot lead
 
00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
allows people to do that to take that
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
provision out of that Collective bying
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
Agreement so Mr chairman let's let's
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
stipulate that people are not being
 
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:14.640 align:start position:0%
forced into
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
Unions that's the law they are not under
 
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
a condition of employment required to be
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
part of a union That's the Law they
 
00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:25.320 align:start position:0%
can't be fired for not being part of the
 
00:09:27.069 --> 00:09:27.079 align:start position:0%
Union that's the
 
00:09:30.949 --> 00:09:30.959 align:start position:0%
laww and we have heard that all of these
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
arguments which actually misrepresent
 
00:09:36.550 --> 00:09:36.560 align:start position:0%
the law so nobody in this United States
 
00:09:38.069 --> 00:09:38.079 align:start position:0%
of America is being fired because they
 
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:40.240 align:start position:0%
don't want to be part of the union and
 
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
the only thing they can be required to
 
00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:45.560 align:start position:0%
do right now is to pay that agency fee
 
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
if in fact the union negotiates it and
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
the agency fee is not the
 
00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:54.680 align:start position:0%
dues it is only a slice of what it takes
 
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
to to negotiate the Collective buing
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
Agreement and manage the Collective
 
00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:01.680 align:start position:0%
buing Agreement it's nothing beyond that
 
00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
so it's not the dues that the other
 
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
members are paying and let me say one
 
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:07.800 align:start position:0%
final thing because I know a lot of
 
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
people have something to say right now
 
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:12.480 align:start position:0%
you could have somebody join the
 
00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
Carpenters and you have the ref from the
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
Carpenters who talk about this join it
 
00:10:19.069 --> 00:10:19.079 align:start position:0%
join the union enroll in the
 
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
Apprenticeship Training Program which by
 
00:10:24.069 --> 00:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
the way we pay millions of dollars to to
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
build buildings and and and they could
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
basically leave the union and still be
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
part of the Apprenticeship Training
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
Program and we would be on the hook we
 
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:35.240 align:start position:0%
the labor movement would be on the hook
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
for the cost of that employee for their
 
00:10:40.269 --> 00:10:40.279 align:start position:0%
whole career tell me how that's fair
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
tell me how that's fair people should
 
00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
have to if they're getting the benefits
 
00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
and that's our responsibility and we've
 
00:10:48.990 --> 00:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
heard well you can get out we can do it
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
that's not before you what's before you
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
is tap hotly 14b and whether or not
 
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
people share in the responsibility and
 
00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not as a public policy we
 
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
think people should take should be
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
responsible and should and the fair and
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
Equitable thing to do is to require
 
00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:08.440 align:start position:0%
people if we negotiate that provision to
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
pay a portion to support the benefits
 
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
that they get the activities for the
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
benefits to get thank you Mr chairman
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh if give me
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:58.230 align:start position:0%
 
pause

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:28.150 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:58.110 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so just to uh bring everyone up to
 
00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
speed so uh representative fingon was in
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
a car accident this morning and we're
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
waiting to
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
determine how he's doing I don't know uh
 
00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:45.880 align:start position:0%
just all I know is that he was in a car
 
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
accident so representative Maguire was
 
00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:51.560 align:start position:0%
going to sit in for him and vote but
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
according to house rules we have to
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
provide 24 hours notice and so she will
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
not be able to vote and so we just want
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
to make sure that we're straight up with
 
00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
everything and uh that's why she stepped
 
00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
out and we can proceed is there any
 
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:07.880 align:start position:0%
other comments representative K thank
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um we were all here last
 
00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
week when we heard from primarily
 
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
members of the unions and you know they
 
00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
emphatically told us that they thought
 
00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
they were getting their money's worth
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
and probably more by being in the union
 
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
they made a big difference in what they
 
00:14:26.710 --> 00:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
were able to accomplish in their lives
 
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:27.880 align:start position:0%
and for their
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
families and and while I I I respect the
 
00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
comments of uh my colleague down the end
 
00:14:36.269 --> 00:14:36.279 align:start position:0%
of the table that you know businesses or
 
00:14:37.949 --> 00:14:37.959 align:start position:0%
are certain businesses are certainly the
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
backbone of our country so are our
 
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.000 align:start position:0%
workers and we haven't heard from the B
 
00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:44.519 align:start position:0%
from the small businesses what we who we
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
heard from where the
 
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:49.160 align:start position:0%
workers and uh and you have you know
 
00:14:50.430 --> 00:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
maybe you have a business where the
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
owner's making the coffee and but
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's a little can there
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
where you throw in a 50 cents when you
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
when you have a cup of coffee and I'm
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
just saying don't be that guy that come
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
in and has a cup of coffee and a donut
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
and walks past the can chip in something
 
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
you know because you're helping you're
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
you're doing something Beyond yourself
 
00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:09.160 align:start position:0%
but you're making sure that cup of
 
00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
coffee will be there next week when you
 
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
come in so I'm support I'm I'm voting
 
00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
against this bill and I'm I wish we
 
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't keep on seeing this but uh uh
 
00:15:20.509 --> 00:15:20.519 align:start position:0%
it's it's really not the right thing for
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I don't know that there
 
00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
are I don't know that there are
 
00:15:25.870 --> 00:15:25.880 align:start position:0%
companies unan anonymous anonymous
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
companies waiting to come in but I don't
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%

00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
chair I I strongly oppose Right to Work
 
00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
legislation in New Hampshire because it
 
00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
undermines the rights of workers and
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
threatens and the economic well-being of
 
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.230 align:start position:0%
threatens and the economic well-being of
our

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
state right to work laws weaken unions
 
00:15:56.590 --> 00:15:56.600 align:start position:0%
by allowing individuals to benefit from
 
00:15:58.309 --> 00:15:58.319 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining without
 
00:15:58.319 --> 00:15:59.829 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining without
contributing

00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
contributing
 
00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:00.839 align:start position:0%
their fair
 
00:16:04.350 --> 00:16:04.360 align:start position:0%

itself on local control
 
00:16:32.189 --> 00:16:32.199 align:start position:0%

special
 
00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%

values of the Granite
 
00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:43.160 align:start position:0%
State it risks creating division in
 
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
workplaces and weakening the collective

power of employees to negotiate Fair pay
 
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
and safe working conditions I urge this
 
00:16:55.509 --> 00:16:55.519 align:start position:0%
committee to reject this harmful
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
legislation and protect the rights of
 
00:16:59.749 --> 00:16:59.759 align:start position:0%
workers to organiz
 
00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
and advocate for themselves together we
 
00:17:05.789 --> 00:17:05.799 align:start position:0%
can continue to build an economy that
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
works for everyone thank you Mr chair
 
00:17:12.549 --> 00:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any other comments any
 
00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:15.590 align:start position:0%
thank you sir any other comments any
other

00:17:15.590 --> 00:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:18.069 --> 00:17:18.079 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair um
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
just kind of piggyback on everybody
 
00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:21.799 align:start position:0%
starting with representative L Bri I
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
mean uh it's nice that I am able
 
00:17:28.189 --> 00:17:28.199 align:start position:0%
to go to small businesses because
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
that'll be my first choice if I'm going
 
00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
to go spend some money it's going to be
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
to a small business in my area in my
 
00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:35.919 align:start position:0%
town before I go to any any bigger you
 
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
know I'll rather go to a small lumber
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
yard to buy my material than a Home
 
00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
Depot let's put it that way you know
 
00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:42.919 align:start position:0%
stuff like that so I agree with you 100%
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
I'm all for small business and I and I
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
will spend my money there whenever I can
 
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
um to piggyback on representative uh
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
McKenzie I'm not a representative of the
 
00:17:54.789 --> 00:17:54.799 align:start position:0%
Carpenters Union I'm a member of the
 
00:17:56.830 --> 00:17:56.840 align:start position:0%
Carpenters Union just so that you know
 
00:17:59.149 --> 00:17:59.159 align:start position:0%
there's no uh conflict of interest or
 
00:18:01.149 --> 00:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
anything like that but I wanted to talk
 
00:18:03.590 --> 00:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
about what he ended with was the uh the
 
00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship the opportunity for young
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
people or even older people i' I've
 
00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360 align:start position:0%
dealt with and worked with a bunch of
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
people that have been through college
 
00:18:14.149 --> 00:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
realized that what they did wasn't
 
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:15.640 align:start position:0%
making them any money wasn't what they
 
00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:17.320 align:start position:0%
thought it was and have gone into the
 
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:19.480 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship in their mid-30s and
 
00:18:23.390 --> 00:18:23.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes even older um just to realize
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
that hey I'm getting all this and and
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
the cool part is I my most my career has
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
been spent hanging drywall and doing
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
metal framing not the easiest way to go
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
through uh construction but but it did
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
me well but you could also learn
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
flooring uh Hardware IND doors uh
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
ceiling you name it and it's not just
 
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:47.799 align:start position:0%
the apprentices not just new people
 
00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:49.440 align:start position:0%
coming in for people like myself that
 
00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:51.400 align:start position:0%
have been around a while I can learn how
 
00:18:54.149 --> 00:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
to read prints uh I can do learn how to
 
00:18:55.909 --> 00:18:55.919 align:start position:0%
become a foreman I can do other things
 
00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
like that so I don't have to strap on
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
the tools and hang 12 put 58s all day um
 
00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
so I just hate to see people miss that
 
00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity that chance to be able to go
 
00:19:10.270 --> 00:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
join whatever Union you want whether
 
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
it's any of the Building Trades because
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
they all have really great
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
apprenticeship programs and and not be
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
able to do that and like um
 
00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie said you know we
 
00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
train them doesn't mean they got to stay
 
00:19:23.909 --> 00:19:23.919 align:start position:0%
and and lots of people go and either
 
00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:26.440 align:start position:0%
start their own businesses or work for
 
00:19:28.029 --> 00:19:28.039 align:start position:0%
somebody else because maybe they don't
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
agree with the Union ways and that's
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
fine too that's fine too we know we've
 
00:19:34.390 --> 00:19:34.400 align:start position:0%
developed some good people some strong
 
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
people some honest hopefully Hest
 
00:19:38.789 --> 00:19:38.799 align:start position:0%
hardworking people and we'd like to
 
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.480 align:start position:0%
continue that tradition so obviously if
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
you haven't picked up I know I'm against
 
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
this stuff this bill but thank you okay
 
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.390 align:start position:0%
this stuff this bill but thank you okay
fair

00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
fair
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
enough represent Susi thank you Mr
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
chairman I just want to say that I
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
thought it was very compelling from the
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
individuals that came in to testify uh
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
um at the
 
00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
hearing that this is actually going to
 
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
only affect a very small percentage of
 
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
companies in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
and everybody that was here that was
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
testifying that belonged to a union
 
00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.710 align:start position:0%
testifying that belonged to a union
seemed

00:20:16.710 --> 00:20:16.720 align:start position:0%
seemed
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
happy for what the union was providing
 
00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.350 align:start position:0%
happy for what the union was providing
for

00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:20.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:20:22.909 --> 00:20:22.919 align:start position:0%
them the only people that were here that
 
00:20:24.789 --> 00:20:24.799 align:start position:0%
testified on this bill and it was said
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
that day where either a for
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
non-union employee the um witness from
 
00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
Texas who worked for the police
 
00:20:35.789 --> 00:20:35.799 align:start position:0%
department that was
 
00:20:38.789 --> 00:20:38.799 align:start position:0%
non-union or they were public sector
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
employees which this with the Janice
 
00:20:45.149 --> 00:20:45.159 align:start position:0%
decision really doesn't affect at this
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
point so when we're talking about what
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
this bill is going to
 
00:20:52.750 --> 00:20:52.760 align:start position:0%
do for a very small percentage of people
 
00:20:54.990 --> 00:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
in this state and here's the other thing
 
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't see anybody other than the
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
nfib come in in state that all the small
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
businesses you know 85% or 80 to 85% of
 
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
the small businesses in the state are
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
against this but we had many companies
 
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
big companies in the state that afford
 
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:12.149 align:start position:0%
big companies in the state that afford
this

00:21:12.149 --> 00:21:12.159 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
legislation so if we sit here today
 
00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:15.320 align:start position:0%
we're going to try to pass this
 
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
legislation and I've been here this is
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
my this is going to be my eth term I was
 
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
a union guy I was a president of a union
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
for nine years dealing with this and
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
then I came to the legislature and we're
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
still dealing with it
 
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
for a very small amount of people that
 
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
this is going to create a problem for
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
which I feel that it's not creating a
 
00:21:37.990 --> 00:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
problem because there wasn't one person
 
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
that came in here again that belonged to
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
one of these unions out here that was
 
00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:44.200 align:start position:0%
disturbed by this
 
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
legislation so once again folks I I
 
00:21:49.789 --> 00:21:49.799 align:start position:0%
think this is bad legislation I don't
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
think it's needed um I think we could
 
00:21:55.789 --> 00:21:55.799 align:start position:0%
move forward with it without it and as
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
somebody said earlier there aren't
 
00:21:59.190 --> 00:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
companies lined up here we just saw an
 
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
article the other day about a company
 
00:22:02.269 --> 00:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
that was coming in here nothing to do
 
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
with right to work but they're going to
 
00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:05.240 align:start position:0%
employ 500 people moving in from
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they didn't say anything
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
about they're coming here because New
 
00:22:10.070 --> 00:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire may become a right to work
 
00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
state so I'd say like representative lir
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
I think you know where I stand so thank
 
00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:17.480 align:start position:0%
you Roger that yes
 
00:22:21.269 --> 00:22:21.279 align:start position:0%
ma'am thank you Mr chair um yesterday
 
00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:24.240 align:start position:0%
some of us Democrats were speaking about
 
00:22:26.269 --> 00:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
what we might say or could say on this
 
00:22:28.310 --> 00:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
issue and I said oh I'd like to talk
 
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:30.080 align:start position:0%
about about you know the ministers and
 
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
the moral argument and the thought then
 
00:22:34.350 --> 00:22:34.360 align:start position:0%
from some was well you're not going to
 
00:22:36.470 --> 00:22:36.480 align:start position:0%
change any Minds I do agree with
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative Granger we probably all
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
know how we're going to vote before we
 
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
got in here today but I do think it's
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
important to voice in my
 
00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
opinion uh the morality of this the fact
 
00:22:52.269 --> 00:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
that all labor has dignity and um a hero
 
00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:54.440 align:start position:0%
to me is Martin Luther King Jr the
 
00:22:57.390 --> 00:22:57.400 align:start position:0%
Reverend Martin Luther King Jr um and he
 
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
said to parap phrase uh right to work
 
00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
neither increases rates nor improves
 
00:23:05.630 --> 00:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
anything for workers and he said where
 
00:23:08.269 --> 00:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
these laws have been passed wages are
 
00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
lower job opportunities are fewer and
 
00:23:13.149 --> 00:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
there are no civil
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
rights um to me that gets to the Crux of
 
00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:20.480 align:start position:0%
it it is a human right to organize your
 
00:23:22.669 --> 00:23:22.679 align:start position:0%
workplace um we had a number of
 
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:26.440 align:start position:0%
ministers Testify the um group people
 
00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
with the organization faith and labor
 
00:23:31.149 --> 00:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Council of churches and a
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
whole bunch of religions that don't
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
agree on a lot of things politically
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
let's be honest but they all agree that
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
this bill is not the way to take New
 
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or really anywhere in America
 
00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:45.400 align:start position:0%
but in New Hampshire um and to me that
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
has meaning I can tell you about all the
 
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
members of my family tree that are labor
 
00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
unions or the my experience working for
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
labor unions all that is irrelevant to
 
00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
the bigger moral piece in my opinion so
 
00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully that's helpful to to somebody
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
that's listening and I felt I needed to
 
00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
give voice to that here given how many
 
00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:05.120 align:start position:0%
people did testify from that point of
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
view thank you Mr chair thank you I
 
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:09.480 align:start position:0%

legislate the motion is inexpedient to
 
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislate do we have a second on that
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
motion M second representative McKenzie
 
00:27:26.039 --> 00:27:29.149 align:start position:0%
motion M second representative McKenzie
second

00:27:29.149 --> 00:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
and would you like to speak to your
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
motion sure we've heard this bill a
 
00:27:36.990 --> 00:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
number of years and it seems like an
 
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
undue burden on small businesses that
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
already have to comply with law in
 
00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
regards to checking the uh status
 
00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
citizenship ability to work social
 
00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:52.039 align:start position:0%
security card and ID of employees so
 
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
it's just an extra layer and I think
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
we've already piled on enough to the
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
employers of New Hampshire and I've I
 
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:00.440 align:start position:0%
also don't like tying things we do here
 
00:28:03.029 --> 00:28:03.039 align:start position:0%
to uh the feds because that that can
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
change on moment's notice so that's why
 
00:28:07.950 --> 00:28:07.960 align:start position:0%
I am encouraging an expedient to
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
legislate for this legislation all right
 
00:28:12.230 --> 00:28:12.240 align:start position:0%

00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
Unfortunately they don't enforce it um
 
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
we have no jurisdiction as a as a state
 
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
legislature over oer or the federal
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
environment so this really has got to be
 
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
confined to the to the local um to State
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
Employees and to that end I have been in
 
00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:18.519 align:start position:0%
touch with the Department of Labor they
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
are willing to have a discussion about
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
this and potentially propose some kind
 
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:25.480 align:start position:0%
of um there's already language in the
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
law but maybe enhanced the language it's
 
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
in the law and I think that's probably
 
00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
the best way to go so that's uh that's
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
the reason I asked that this be
 
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
inexpedient I I appreciate it it's a it
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
is an important issue and and I hope you
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
can come up with something that that's
 
00:31:43.549 --> 00:31:43.559 align:start position:0%
workable thank you are there any other
 
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:48.440 align:start position:0%

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.350 align:start position:0%
have a motion yes Mr chairman I uh move
we

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:33:48.190 --> 00:33:48.200 align:start position:0%
retain the motion is to retain is there
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:54.519 align:start position:0%
chairman and the second representative
 
00:33:56.350 --> 00:33:56.360 align:start position:0%
Granger would you like to speak to your
 
00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
motion thank you
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
uh we just need I I think there's some
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
more information that we can glean from
 
00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:04.120 align:start position:0%
this and um if we retain it we might be
 
00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:06.200 align:start position:0%
able to get all the information without
 
00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:07.960 align:start position:0%
actually having to pass it on floor vote
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.389 --> 00:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
simple so the idea about retaining is
 
00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
that we would then have an opportunity
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
to look closer at this bill and um we
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
also we already have um um
 
00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
representative lab's agreed to help
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative Granger look into it is
 
00:34:32.589 --> 00:34:32.599 align:start position:0%
there anyone else that would like to
 
00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:34.919 align:start position:0%
look into this bill uh with
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:41.599 --> 00:34:43.829 align:start position:0%
 
Granger

00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
Granger
 
00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:47.200 align:start position:0%
please so we're looking to study the
 
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.389 align:start position:0%
please so we're looking to study the
unemployment

00:34:48.389 --> 00:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
system what does that mean re Granger
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
can you answer that please yes it means
 
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
finding out the answers to all the
 
00:34:56.190 --> 00:34:56.200 align:start position:0%
questions that are listed out in the
 
00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:00.510 align:start position:0%
questions that are listed out in the
bill

00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
I have a question warning if we vote to
 
00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:08.000 align:start position:0%
retain it does that mean it's not
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
reported to the clerk yet or it doesn't
 
00:35:12.150 --> 00:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
go on the calendar and we have until
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
what crossover to deal with
 
00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:18.119 align:start position:0%
it or is it different than interim study
 
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
that's that was my question so interim
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
study is a second term and retain is the
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
first term and the first term it can
 
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
roll over into the second term and then
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
be resurrected in a new form based on
 
00:35:32.470 --> 00:35:32.480 align:start position:0%
the results of the committee do I have
 
00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:36.839 align:start position:0%
that right yeah the um retained Bill uh
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
it's intended to be worked on prior to
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
the next um uh January session and we
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
would vote on all of retained bills on
 
00:35:49.349 --> 00:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
the first day of session in next January
 
00:35:54.750 --> 00:35:54.760 align:start position:0%
um can I please um and I guess um I'm
 
00:35:57.109 --> 00:35:57.119 align:start position:0%
going to vote against retaining okay and
 
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
my rationale is that um this studying um
 
00:36:04.589 --> 00:36:04.599 align:start position:0%
if it's desirable and I respect um
 
00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
representative Granger's interest in the
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
issue his interest in studying the issue
 
00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't believe the uh the committee
 
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.990 align:start position:0%
but I don't believe the uh the committee
um

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
I this this type of insurance is deeply
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
embedded in
 
00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:24.880 align:start position:0%
government um it it is a federal state
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
um uh cooperation that creates it
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
it follows a lot of federal rules um and
 
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh there's there's a lot that goes back
 
00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:36.200 align:start position:0%
and forth between the department of of
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
um uh Employment Security and the the
 
00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
federal government I I believe that's of
 
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:45.560 align:start position:0%
Great Value I don't I have no interest
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
in seeing this privatized in any way um
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
therefore um while I respect
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
representative Granger's interest and I
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
would encourage him to go ahead and
 
00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
study uh um but um I don't believe the
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
committee should be sponsoring that
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
study um so therefore I'm going to vote
 
00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.190 align:start position:0%
study um so therefore I'm going to vote
against

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.200 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:08.200 align:start position:0%
retaining okay fair enough are there any
 
00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
other comments or discussions regarding
 
00:37:15.069 --> 00:37:15.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
motion Mr chairman if I could represent
 
00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:21.240 align:start position:0%
McKenzie so I uh I sered for a number of
 
00:37:22.589 --> 00:37:22.599 align:start position:0%
years on the unemployment advisory
 
00:37:24.990 --> 00:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
committee which is a place where people
 
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
can come and ask questions and get
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
things it's open to the public this this
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
has been open to the public for years
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
you have an opportunity to go there and
 
00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:35.800 align:start position:0%
and and ask all kinds of question
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
anything you want to know uh and they
 
00:37:40.390 --> 00:37:40.400 align:start position:0%
you have a whole entire staff of of that
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
group there so I think that there's
 
00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:45.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities to get answers to
 
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
questions I know that the Department of
 
00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:49.160 align:start position:0%
Employment security has been very open
 
00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
uh Deputy Commissioner labors has been
 
00:37:53.190 --> 00:37:53.200 align:start position:0%
very open to the legislature answering
 
00:37:56.109 --> 00:37:56.119 align:start position:0%
questions you might have um so I think a
 
00:37:57.710 --> 00:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
lot of that could be resolved out side
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
of retain a retain Bill and uh while I
 
00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:06.680 align:start position:0%
volunteered far I would probably vote uh
 
00:38:09.349 --> 00:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
and will vote against retaining it and
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
uh and happy to work with uh with
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
anybody to uh to get better informed
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
about the about the unemployment system
 
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
as a group you know happy to work with
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
anybody on that so represent grer the
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
the uh the commitment in my mind so I
 
00:38:29.550 --> 00:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
and I I I think about this with interim
 
00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:31.680 align:start position:0%
study and with retain bills is the
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
commitment that the the work will go on
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of trying to
 
00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
finish the research associated with
 
00:38:41.150 --> 00:38:41.160 align:start position:0%
putting together a quality
 
00:38:43.589 --> 00:38:43.599 align:start position:0%
legislation and
 
00:38:46.510 --> 00:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh your commitment to making that happen
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
with the assistance of two other members
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:38:53.349 --> 00:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
committee uh it's your assessment that
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
you can come up with something that uh
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
is reasonable given that the testimony
 
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:01.640 align:start position:0%
of what we've heard this
 
00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:03.800 align:start position:0%
morning yeah I think that we can come up
 
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
with something and we can um either
 
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
modify the bill based on our research or
 
00:39:10.309 --> 00:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
at least provide the answers to the
 
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
questions and if we can provide an
 
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
answer to those questions to members of
 
00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:16.520 align:start position:0%
the committee then uh and we don't see
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
the need for further legislation then I
 
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
would make the motion to itl the bill in
 
00:39:26.710 --> 00:39:26.720 align:start position:0%
the second year however if if um
 
00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
hopefully we get the answers to the
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
questions and uh the fact that we are
 
00:39:32.390 --> 00:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
retaining it and we have a subcommittee
 
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
working on it would probably assist with
 
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
that greatly um as as I said I was
 
00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
trying to research this and I reached
 
00:39:42.349 --> 00:39:42.359 align:start position:0%
out to a very many a large amount of
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
resources and I was not able to get the
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
answers uh I believe if we retain it in
 
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
committee we can get those
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
answers okay um subject to your
 
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
commitment uh to that work um I I can
 
00:39:59.829 --> 00:39:59.839 align:start position:0%
support a rain although I completely
 
00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
understand the the detractors on the
 
00:40:03.710 --> 00:40:03.720 align:start position:0%
other side but uh if you can get
 
00:40:04.990 --> 00:40:05.000 align:start position:0%
something done then let's see what
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
happens I'm I'm okay with that thank you
 
00:40:11.430 --> 00:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair are there any other comments
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%

opportunity to speak this morning on
 
01:01:57.510 --> 01:01:57.520 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 82 uh which would increase
 
01:01:58.789 --> 01:01:58.799 align:start position:0%
the maximum benefits for First
 
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
Responders critical injured critically
 
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
injured in the line of duty um as you're
 
01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
all well aware our profession the
 
01:02:07.430 --> 01:02:07.440 align:start position:0%
inherent risks associated with
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
firefighting continue to evolve over
 
01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:11.680 align:start position:0%
time and although there's considerable
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
evolution in firefighting policies
 
01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
procedures best practices and personal
 
01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:18.200 align:start position:0%
protective equipment the fact remains
 
01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
that the dedicated firefighters that
 
01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:21.960 align:start position:0%
protect this state and their communities
 
01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:23.880 align:start position:0%
are constantly at risk for catastrophic
 
01:02:27.470 --> 01:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
injury a devastating illness or death um
 
01:02:29.589 --> 01:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to share a a short anecdote
 
01:02:31.589 --> 01:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
with you um just the other night I also
 
01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
serve as a a fire captain in the city of
 
01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth um just the other night my
 
01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:38.680 align:start position:0%
members responded to a 9-year-old child
 
01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
in Cardiac Arrest um and they treated
 
01:02:43.589 --> 01:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
that patient uh and they treated that
 
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
patient with professional
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
professionalism and due diligence um and
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
as a result of that uh it was determined
 
01:02:52.349 --> 01:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
that it's possible that this patient
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
passed away due to uh
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
menitis and and um our members were
 
01:02:59.710 --> 01:02:59.720 align:start position:0%
subsequently exposed to that during
 
01:03:02.950 --> 01:03:02.960 align:start position:0%
their Airway treatments um this bill
 
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
should my my members be affected um by
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
that illness would help to cover them uh
 
01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:14.520 align:start position:0%
and protect them with uh the the benefit
 
01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:18.920 align:start position:0%
so as current law stands um a claimant
 
01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:20.200 align:start position:0%
that suffers an impairment to their
 
01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:22.520 align:start position:0%
heart lungs brain or internal organ or
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
their senses also has an opportunity in
 
01:03:27.029 --> 01:03:27.039 align:start position:0%
a addition to their workers comp
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
benefits up to
 
01:03:33.390 --> 01:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
$125,000 benefit uh for an impairment to
 
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
one of these organs or to their
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
senses uh the law currently states that
 
01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:42.960 align:start position:0%
this will allow a benefit up to $500,000
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
for all claimants over a banum uh this
 
01:03:49.670 --> 01:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
simply would increase that to $1 million
 
01:03:52.589 --> 01:03:52.599 align:start position:0%
and although uh we have not reached that
 
01:03:54.630 --> 01:03:54.640 align:start position:0%
$500,000 cap as you'll see in the
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
methodology of the bill
 
01:03:58.950 --> 01:03:58.960 align:start position:0%
um it is in large part due to the fact
 
01:04:01.710 --> 01:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
that this is a lesser known benefit that
 
01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
we need to do a better job of educating
 
01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
our members on um and with the evolving
 
01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
risks of the job uh it is easily uh one
 
01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:11.799 align:start position:0%
can easily come to the conclusion that
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
this benefit will be paid out more over
 
01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
time um and over the course of 10 years
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
since this benefit was enacted uh has
 
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
not changed from the
 
01:04:23.950 --> 01:04:23.960 align:start position:0%
$500,000 uh for the bium so with that um
 
01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's just a a simple uh technical change
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
that obviously comes with a financial
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
impact and I would ask um that all the
 
01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:33.640 align:start position:0%
members of this committee respectively
 
01:04:35.029 --> 01:04:35.039 align:start position:0%
uh would vote in favor of this bill and
 
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions you or
 
01:04:39.069 --> 01:04:39.079 align:start position:0%
the committee may have Mr chair thank
 
01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you Mr chairman um thank
 
01:04:45.990 --> 01:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question the
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
$125,000 that uh can be you said up to
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
$125,000 can be paid out what determines
 
01:04:55.870 --> 01:04:55.880 align:start position:0%
how much of that uh 125 is paid out EXA
 
01:04:59.029 --> 01:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
what does it cover sure thank you um I
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
will tell you that there's someone here
 
01:05:01.589 --> 01:05:01.599 align:start position:0%
that's going to testify that'll be able
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
to answer that question a little bit
 
01:05:04.309 --> 01:05:04.319 align:start position:0%
more clearly for you but I'm going to
 
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
take a stab at it um to my knowledge it
 
01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:10.319 align:start position:0%
works in large part dependent upon um
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
the organ that is injured what the
 
01:05:16.029 --> 01:05:16.039 align:start position:0%
individual salary is at the time uh and
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
they're assigned a formula uh that deals
 
01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
with the number of weeks um that is
 
01:05:24.349 --> 01:05:24.359 align:start position:0%
calculated for that injury for that
 
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
organ and the benefit is paid out
 
01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:28.950 align:start position:0%
organ and the benefit is paid out
somewhere

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:05:35.190 --> 01:05:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:37.720 align:start position:0%
injury yes you got
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
Granger uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:05:43.710 --> 01:05:43.720 align:start position:0%
you for taking my questions so I'm
 
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
seeing from 281 a32 that this was it it
 
01:05:48.789 --> 01:05:48.799 align:start position:0%
you can correct me if I'm wrong about
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
this if you if you happened to know if
 
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
not then that's fine I uh that this was
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
put in place on in 2014 and last
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
modified in
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
2017 do you know if we dur since this
 
01:06:02.829 --> 01:06:02.839 align:start position:0%
has ever been put in place if we have
 
01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
ever hit that half million dollar cap so
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
I do not believe we have and I'm only
 
01:06:11.470 --> 01:06:11.480 align:start position:0%
speaking uh from the methodology that
 
01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:13.559 align:start position:0%
came with the bill um and when they
 
01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
looked at the cost of this I believe the
 
01:06:19.150 --> 01:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
highest payout over banum was $350,000
 
01:06:22.829 --> 01:06:22.839 align:start position:0%
and that was in um I believe
 
01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:26.839 align:start position:0%
2023 thank you sure
 
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
represent Warden thank you thank
 
01:06:32.309 --> 01:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
you am I reading the statutes correctly
 
01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:34.760 align:start position:0%
this is in addition to other existing
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
workers compensation that's based on the
 
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
type of injury and the number of weeks
 
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
that a person that's harmed or injured
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
gets uh compensated for for
 
01:06:47.950 --> 01:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
example permanent loss or impairment of
 
01:06:49.630 --> 01:06:49.640 align:start position:0%
heart lung or brain which I think you
 
01:06:51.430 --> 01:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
were talking about the lungs that if
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
somebody suffers that injury that they
 
01:06:56.990 --> 01:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
automatically get 200 eight up to 28
 
01:06:59.870 --> 01:06:59.880 align:start position:0%
weeks of compensation which is four
 
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
years and that this would be in addition
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
to that other uh paid compensation is do
 
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
I have that right correct and this is uh
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
specific to First Responders critical
 
01:07:14.269 --> 01:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
injury it is a an additional benefit due
 
01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
to them but under uh
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
281 I believe that anyone has access to
 
01:07:23.109 --> 01:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
the first piece that you were speaking
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
of this would be in addition to that for
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
specifically for First
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
Responders repres kale thank you thank
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
question um if uh if I recall correctly
 
01:07:38.430 --> 01:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
this legislation was created in response
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
to the shooting of a sergeant Dy of
 
01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester police uh who was had several
 
01:07:46.109 --> 01:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
wounds abominable wounds in the uh in
 
01:07:48.910 --> 01:07:48.920 align:start position:0%
the Coline of Duty uh and I know we were
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
all rush to vote for that and I expect
 
01:07:53.789 --> 01:07:53.799 align:start position:0%
we'll vote we'll vote for this but
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
um is it the idea that with you know
 
01:07:58.190 --> 01:07:58.200 align:start position:0%
more more people becoming aware of it
 
01:08:00.190 --> 01:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
and medical costs getting higher and
 
01:08:02.589 --> 01:08:02.599 align:start position:0%
higher that we need to raise this
 
01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
cap well I think that's um a fair
 
01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:07.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh certainly I would
 
01:08:10.670 --> 01:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
be in favor of raising that cap um but I
 
01:08:12.150 --> 01:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
guess that would be for all of you to to
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
make that determination thank you
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
thanks are there any other questions
 
01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:21.149 align:start position:0%
thanks are there any other questions
representative

01:08:21.149 --> 01:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
McKenzie Mr President thank you for
 
01:08:25.510 --> 01:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
appearing for this committee so what is
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
to reach back on uh on this onund on the
 
01:08:36.430 --> 01:08:36.440 align:start position:0%
25,000 for claim it what is what is the
 
01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
reach I'm not sure I understand your
 
01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:39.640 align:start position:0%
question you asking if there would be
 
01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:41.480 align:start position:0%
retroactive payments made yeah
 
01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:44.880 align:start position:0%
somebody's um to my knowledge it does
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
not specify that in the language I'm not
 
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
sure that there would be a retroactive
 
01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:53.640 align:start position:0%
payment anyone do um maybe the uh I
 
01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:56.159 align:start position:0%
don't know if okay we have somebody else
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
that might be able answer that question
 
01:08:59.470 --> 01:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
for you thank you Mr chair okay thank
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
you and represent Granger thank you Mr
 
01:09:04.110 --> 01:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
chair uh so look looking at this section
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand existing
 
01:09:07.070 --> 01:09:07.080 align:start position:0%
law if there's someone else that can
 
01:09:08.110 --> 01:09:08.120 align:start position:0%
answer these question I don't want to
 
01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
put you on the spot or anything I so it
 
01:09:13.030 --> 01:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
so we have permanent loss or impairment
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
of heart long or brain 208 permanent
 
01:09:16.950 --> 01:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
loss of or impairment of other internal
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
organs 104 so is that additive so if you
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
have a problem with your heart lung or
 
01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:23.239 align:start position:0%
brain and then another internal organ
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
208 it's okay if you don't know I don't
 
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know the answer I I was
 
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
raing to see if I could decide for the
 
01:09:35.229 --> 01:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
the response to it but no I don't I
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
don't have an answer for that thank
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
you representative Drago thank you Mr
 
01:09:43.390 --> 01:09:43.400 align:start position:0%
chair you mentioned trying to get more
 
01:09:45.950 --> 01:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
people um aware of this benefit to take
 
01:09:48.349 --> 01:09:48.359 align:start position:0%
advantage of it do you know how many
 
01:09:51.390 --> 01:09:51.400 align:start position:0%
people how many injuries what percentage
 
01:09:52.829 --> 01:09:52.839 align:start position:0%
actually do take care of it now or use
 
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
this benefit now I don't have a
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
percentage for you but I I can tell you
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
just based on again the the bill
 
01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
methodology from the Department of Labor
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
and their statistics have shown that um
 
01:10:08.430 --> 01:10:08.440 align:start position:0%
only there was the highest amount paid
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
out per Bay name was
 
01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:12.760 align:start position:0%
350,000 which means if uh and I believe
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
two of those to the best of my knowledge
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
were maxed out at
 
01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
125,000 um which means it was probably
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
only two or or there was probably only
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
three or four people that got paid out
 
01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.350 --> 01:10:34.360 align:start position:0%
highest are there any other
 
01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you sir I
 
01:10:39.149 --> 01:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony thanks so much
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.070 --> 01:10:51.080 align:start position:0%
please good morning Mr chairman uh
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
Jared o' Conor uh I'm an attorney with
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
the firm of of Shaheen and Gordon um and
 
01:10:59.510 --> 01:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
I've spent about 20 years representing
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
Injured Workers in workers compensation
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
claims it's the sole focus of my
 
01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
practice um I represent a broad Suite of
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
clients but uh in the last I would say
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
five to seven years in particular my
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
focus has been on First Responders um so
 
01:11:16.270 --> 01:11:16.280 align:start position:0%
I'm here in favor of the bill and I'm
 
01:11:18.110 --> 01:11:18.120 align:start position:0%
really here to offer myself as a
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
resource for questions about some of the
 
01:11:21.390 --> 01:11:21.400 align:start position:0%
technical aspects of the law so let me
 
01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
see if I've written down and can address
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
them one by one uh represent Sullivan
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
you had asked about how this is
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
calculated so under the law you can see
 
01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:34.280 align:start position:0%
that uh depending on the nature of the
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
injury or the nature of the body part
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
that's injured there are a number of
 
01:11:40.070 --> 01:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
weeks worth of benefits assigned to each
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
body part when I say weeks worth of
 
01:11:44.270 --> 01:11:44.280 align:start position:0%
benefits I mean the benefit that this
 
01:11:46.189 --> 01:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
individual worker is entitled to which
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
is calculated based on their own average
 
01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
weekly wage so higher earning claimants
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
have a higher average weekly wage lower
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
earning claim CL it's obviously the
 
01:11:58.629 --> 01:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
reverse so somebody with a average
 
01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
weekly wage of let's just make the math
 
01:12:04.629 --> 01:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
easy 500 bucks a week if they get hund
 
01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
well now I'm not going to be able to do
 
01:12:07.030 --> 01:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
the math in my head but you get the idea
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
if it's a small number um and they're
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
entitled to8 weeks worth of benefits
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
because of an injury to an internal
 
01:12:18.270 --> 01:12:18.280 align:start position:0%
organ then they may only reach 60,000 of
 
01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:18.830 align:start position:0%
organ then they may only reach 60,000 of
the

01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
$125,000 cap whereas someone who is a
 
01:12:24.350 --> 01:12:24.360 align:start position:0%
higher earner um May well exceed and I
 
01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
have had clients who do I've represented
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
firefighters with significant Burns over
 
01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
portions of their body where they lose
 
01:12:33.270 --> 01:12:33.280 align:start position:0%
the ability to touch or have sensation
 
01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
under this uh my client the one I'm
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
thinking of was maxed out at 125,000
 
01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
because his average weekly wage was
 
01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:43.400 align:start position:0%
fairly High um so that's how it's
 
01:12:44.669 --> 01:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
calculated does that answer your
 
01:12:48.229 --> 01:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
question okay um representative McKenzie
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
you had asked about the retroactivity
 
01:12:51.870 --> 01:12:51.880 align:start position:0%
piece of
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
this okay all right fair enough
 
01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
uh and then let's see representative
 
01:13:00.189 --> 01:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
Maguire you had
 
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
asked oh whether it was additive if you
 
01:13:05.709 --> 01:13:05.719 align:start position:0%
have a brain injury and also a shot to
 
01:13:08.110 --> 01:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
the pancreas can you include those I
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
think if you look at the language of the
 
01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:13.199 align:start position:0%
statute yes I think you could however
 
01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
they're still both collectively subject
 
01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:13:18.669 --> 01:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
$125,000 cap so if you have somebody
 
01:13:20.709 --> 01:13:20.719 align:start position:0%
with a particularly low average weekly
 
01:13:23.229 --> 01:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
wage who is entitled to multiple Awards
 
01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:26.679 align:start position:0%
under this section if you scan down to
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
the section of the law under Section 32A
 
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
Roman 2 payments under this section are
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
subject to everything else in workers
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
comp and total compensation shall not
 
01:13:39.430 --> 01:13:39.440 align:start position:0%
exceed under this section 125,000 per
 
01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:41.960 align:start position:0%
claimant so if they do have multiple
 
01:13:44.950 --> 01:13:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:47.070 --> 01:13:47.080 align:start position:0%
cap representative
 
01:13:49.470 --> 01:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
Warden thank you thank you this is very
 
01:13:51.149 --> 01:13:51.159 align:start position:0%
helpful for understanding the statute or
 
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:54.719 align:start position:0%
interpreting it so on on the worst type
 
01:13:57.149 --> 01:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
of injuries which is heart lung and
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
brain 208 weeks which is four years we
 
01:14:01.310 --> 01:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
don't have to break it down by week 52
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
weeks is one year 28 weeks is uh four
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
years so if the employee makes $100,000
 
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
a year and he is entitled to up to four
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
years the max he can get is
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
$125,000 or does he get four years 4 a
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
grand plus the 125 no the max is
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
$125,000 and just just so you know how
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
it works because it's based on their
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
workers compensation disability rate if
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
they're making $100,000 a year under
 
01:14:32.750 --> 01:14:32.760 align:start position:0%
workers comp when you're out on
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
disability you get 60% of your average
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
weekly wage so they would be entitled to
 
01:14:41.510 --> 01:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
60,000 a year if they're out on comp if
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to four years worth of
 
01:14:45.629 --> 01:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
benefits under this provision that would
 
01:14:48.430 --> 01:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
be 240,000 so they're they're going to
 
01:14:50.550 --> 01:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
hit the cap and get 125 in a case like
 
01:14:55.470 --> 01:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
that that's super helpful thank you
 
01:14:58.229 --> 01:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
represent k Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:01.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question so uh the legislation
 
01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:04.440 align:start position:0%
proposed does not raise the 125 cap it
 
01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:06.280 align:start position:0%
only allows more money to be available
 
01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
should there be some sort of
 
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
catastrophic situation where multiple
 
01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
First Responders have severe injuries
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
correct what this legislation does is
 
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
just broaden the pool right now each
 
01:15:19.709 --> 01:15:19.719 align:start position:0%
individual is capped at 125 the pool is
 
01:15:22.590 --> 01:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
500 so you have five four claimants and
 
01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's exhausted um but yes this would
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
broaden the pool but each individual
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
person wouldn't be entitled to more than
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
125 under this thank you representative
 
01:15:36.110 --> 01:15:36.120 align:start position:0%
Granger uh thank you Mr chair so when
 
01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
I'm reading this it says in addition to
 
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
other payments made under RSA 281 so it
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
I understand that the 125k is in
 
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
addition to other workman's comp payouts
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
correct yeah this provision is sort of a
 
01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
standalone benefit available only to
 
01:15:52.510 --> 01:15:52.520 align:start position:0%
group two retirement members meaning
 
01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
police and fire so this is only
 
01:15:56.510 --> 01:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
available to them and it's payable in
 
01:15:57.870 --> 01:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
addition to whatever else they're
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
entitled to underw workers comp because
 
01:16:01.709 --> 01:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to everything that
 
01:16:03.430 --> 01:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
regular citizens are entitled to you
 
01:16:05.110 --> 01:16:05.120 align:start position:0%
know the regular medical benefits
 
01:16:07.350 --> 01:16:07.360 align:start position:0%
disability benefits there is a permanent
 
01:16:09.390 --> 01:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
impairment award that is available to
 
01:16:12.149 --> 01:16:12.159 align:start position:0%
ordinary claimants but it's limited to
 
01:16:14.669 --> 01:16:14.679 align:start position:0%
primarily physical type Orthopedic
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
injuries if you are a you know a do
 
01:16:19.830 --> 01:16:19.840 align:start position:0%
worker or you're working at Walmart and
 
01:16:22.149 --> 01:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
you have a serious injury if that injury
 
01:16:24.669 --> 01:16:24.679 align:start position:0%
is to your internal organs there is no
 
01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
per an impairment award available
 
01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
broadly speaking to workers compensation
 
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
claimants what this benefit does is
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
create that benefit for specifically
 
01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:35.400 align:start position:0%
group two retirement members and it is
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
as you say in addition to whatever else
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
they may be entitled to under workers
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
comp can I get a followup yes please uh
 
01:16:45.070 --> 01:16:45.080 align:start position:0%
what is what is there a cap on what the
 
01:16:47.510 --> 01:16:47.520 align:start position:0%
typical amount so if you're not a first
 
01:16:49.709 --> 01:16:49.719 align:start position:0%
responder and you're on on and you're
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
covered by
 
01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:54.040 align:start position:0%
281 what is is there a cap on how much a
 
01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
single person can get out uh the there
 
01:16:59.229 --> 01:16:59.239 align:start position:0%
there is a cap it's set by the amount of
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
weeks that are assigned to each body
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
part if so if you look at section 32 of
 
01:17:05.790 --> 01:17:05.800 align:start position:0%
the law that's the permanent impairment
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
provision broadly speaking and what that
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
does is it assigns a number of weeks
 
01:17:12.629 --> 01:17:12.639 align:start position:0%
worth of disability benefits to each
 
01:17:15.510 --> 01:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
body part so your arm is worth 210 weeks
 
01:17:17.149 --> 01:17:17.159 align:start position:0%
worth of benefits and your little finger
 
01:17:19.430 --> 01:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
is nine and your leg is 140 and on and
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
on it goes I know this is what this is
 
01:17:24.030 --> 01:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
the Facebook found it's pretty mobber
 
01:17:26.189 --> 01:17:26.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much right so so that so
 
01:17:28.629 --> 01:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
the cap there is just the amount of
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
weeks there's no monetary cap for
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
individual claimants the way there is
 
01:17:34.830 --> 01:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
with this thank you okay and
 
01:17:36.750 --> 01:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
representative Hall he's he's covered
 
01:17:38.950 --> 01:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
mine okay good and representative
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
library and then represent you may or
 
01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
may not know this qu the answer to this
 
01:17:45.070 --> 01:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
question where does the union stand with
 
01:17:46.470 --> 01:17:46.480 align:start position:0%
all this in terms of benefits somebody
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
would receive in in the in the case of
 
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
an accident or long-term disability
 
01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
we're just coming off a union discussion
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
here and we we've heard that they they
 
01:17:56.470 --> 01:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
help and and maybe somebody else could
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
answer it but would you know someone
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
probably else would better answer that
 
01:18:02.189 --> 01:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
than me but I would imagine I just
 
01:18:03.669 --> 01:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to see how that's stacked on top
 
01:18:05.430 --> 01:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
of this I mean it this benefit is
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
payable separate from whatever else the
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
union May provide this is payable out of
 
01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
the general fund from the state so it's
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
not it's not assigned to or payable by
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
the individual City municipality or
 
01:18:17.830 --> 01:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
Insurance Company this is just an
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
entirely separate benefit that comes out
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
of the general fund I was just trying to
 
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
find out what that benefit may be yeah
 
01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you sure yeah representative
 
01:18:26.629 --> 01:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
avalani thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
for taking the question um on this 125
 
01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
per claimant um is that subject
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
to your
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
fee in yes it
 
01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:41.239 align:start position:0%
is and that is 20% attorney's fees are
 
01:18:45.270 --> 01:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
capped at 20% in these cases thank
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
you represent waren question on the
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
mechanics of the payment if somebody
 
01:18:53.790 --> 01:18:53.800 align:start position:0%
qualifies for so many weeks of this
 
01:18:56.189 --> 01:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
additional compensation
 
01:18:58.110 --> 01:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
after he or she has been
 
01:19:02.189 --> 01:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
injured does uh the claimant receive a
 
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
lump sum and he gets to stop working or
 
01:19:08.229 --> 01:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
is it paid out over so many months once
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
it's been approved so the the mechanics
 
01:19:13.870 --> 01:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
of this are that if the claimant has a
 
01:19:15.390 --> 01:19:15.400 align:start position:0%
permanent impairment so it does need to
 
01:19:18.750 --> 01:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
be permanent um once that's demonstrated
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
to the satisfaction of the labor
 
01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
department the labor department
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
certifies the benefit as a critical
 
01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:26.120 align:start position:0%
injury benefit and then sends it over to
 
01:19:27.790 --> 01:19:27.800 align:start position:0%
the executive Council which then
 
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
approves the payment out of the general
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
fund the payment is made in one lump
 
01:19:36.669 --> 01:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
sum followup for a followup thank you
 
01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:39.800 align:start position:0%
that is helpful thank you and then often
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
the pur person's not working anymore
 
01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
that's separate issue right they this
 
01:19:45.470 --> 01:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
comes from the general fund because he's
 
01:19:47.910 --> 01:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
no longer he or she's no longer employed
 
01:19:50.270 --> 01:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
potentially most likely not necessarily
 
01:19:51.629 --> 01:19:51.639 align:start position:0%
I mean it's certainly possible for
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
people to have a permanent injury that
 
01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:55.719 align:start position:0%
nevertheless Isn't So severe that it
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
keeps them from working I mean you can
 
01:19:59.629 --> 01:19:59.639 align:start position:0%
have permanent loss of some function or
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
some loss of range of motion and still
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
hold down a job um so it's not it's not
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily A Ono one I mean in many
 
01:20:08.189 --> 01:20:08.199 align:start position:0%
cases obviously yes the injury is severe
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
enough that they need to retire from the
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
force or from the Department um but it's
 
01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
not necessarily the case it's good of a
 
01:20:18.550 --> 01:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
subject matter expert here thanks
 
01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
sure are there any other
 
01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
questions so I've got a question on one
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
second let me uh well go ahead rent grer
 
01:20:29.629 --> 01:20:29.639 align:start position:0%
go ahead I was just going to ask for a
 
01:20:30.629 --> 01:20:30.639 align:start position:0%
card or
 
01:20:33.149 --> 01:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
something absolutely we can get that can
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
you provide a business card to the
 
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
committee I can thank you and uh so I I
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
got two questions one might be out of
 
01:20:43.790 --> 01:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
your purview but from your understanding
 
01:20:47.830 --> 01:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
the the money comes out of the workers
 
01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:48.870 align:start position:0%
the the money comes out of the workers
comp

01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
comp
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
fund no okay so where does it come from
 
01:20:53.110 --> 01:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
it comes out of the general fund out of
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
the general fund correct okay out of the
 
01:20:58.310 --> 01:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
stage general fund correct okay so this
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
does not affect for example Prim X's
 
01:21:03.709 --> 01:21:03.719 align:start position:0%
rates or each any any individual
 
01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:05.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities workers compensation
 
01:21:07.590 --> 01:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
rates this even though it the statute is
 
01:21:09.709 --> 01:21:09.719 align:start position:0%
contained within the workers comp
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
statute right um and it's defined by a
 
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
lot of the same kinds of issues in
 
01:21:17.590 --> 01:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
workers comp it's paid separately from
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
workers comp it's paid out of the
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
general fund okay and so my second
 
01:21:24.629 --> 01:21:24.639 align:start position:0%
question is if the maximum that we've
 
01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
done that we know of is
 
01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
350,000 and the maximum currently in
 
01:21:34.270 --> 01:21:34.280 align:start position:0%
statute is 150,000 more than that
 
01:21:36.550 --> 01:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
500,000 then why do we have to go up to
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
a million I I'm I'm lost on that a
 
01:21:42.669 --> 01:21:42.679 align:start position:0%
little bit so as a as a practical matter
 
01:21:45.790 --> 01:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
as Mr R mentioned previously I think in
 
01:21:48.270 --> 01:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
part this because this statute is it's a
 
01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:50.920 align:start position:0%
fairly new benefit um it really only
 
01:21:53.350 --> 01:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
took effect I I heard 2014 referenced
 
01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
but my memory was that it pass in 2017
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
it can take a while for these cases to
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
work their way through the system
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
somebody has an initial injury they
 
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
treat for a year or two it's not clear
 
01:22:05.629 --> 01:22:05.639 align:start position:0%
that they are permanently impaired for
 
01:22:08.550 --> 01:22:08.560 align:start position:0%
some time after that then it's submitted
 
01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
for approval so it a awareness of the
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
benefit as something that's even
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
available to First Responders is still I
 
01:22:18.310 --> 01:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
think percolating its way through um the
 
01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
state and just the nature of the cases
 
01:22:22.669 --> 01:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
is such that it can take a while for
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
people to reach the point where they are
 
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
eligible to be rated for a permanent
 
01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:29.000 align:start position:0%
impairment and so I think it's not
 
01:22:30.910 --> 01:22:30.920 align:start position:0%
surprising to me for example that for
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
the first few years maybe even the first
 
01:22:34.070 --> 01:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
four or five years that it was in
 
01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
existence there wasn't many claims made
 
01:22:38.790 --> 01:22:38.800 align:start position:0%
against the fund because people weren't
 
01:22:41.750 --> 01:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
eligible for it until 2017 and it wasn't
 
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
until some years after that that we're
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
now starting to see them be applied for
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:22:50.550 --> 01:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
good represent K thank you Mr chair and
 
01:22:52.070 --> 01:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you again for taking my question
 
01:22:54.470 --> 01:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
so in the event that there are no
 
01:22:57.310 --> 01:22:57.320 align:start position:0%
injuries of this type no claims then the
 
01:22:59.030 --> 01:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
money stays in the general fund is not
 
01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't cost anybody anything is that
 
01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:04.280 align:start position:0%
correct correct thank
 
01:23:07.229 --> 01:23:07.239 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions
 
01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
thank you sir I appreciate your
 
01:23:10.629 --> 01:23:10.639 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
you and Daniel um Miss Albert come on up
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you my name is
 
01:23:27.550 --> 01:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
Danielle Albert I'm the Deputy
 
01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
01:23:31.430 --> 01:23:31.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor um the department
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
has reviewed the proposed language
 
01:23:34.830 --> 01:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
that's associated with this bill we
 
01:23:37.310 --> 01:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
understand the intent um specifically in
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
raising the dollar amount available for
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
this particular benefit from the current
 
01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:44.719 align:start position:0%
$500,000 amount to the $1 million amount
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
um we believe we can administer and
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
regulate uh as written and primarily
 
01:23:50.750 --> 01:23:50.760 align:start position:0%
here are are here to answer any
 
01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:52.480 align:start position:0%
questions I attorney OK Conor I believe
 
01:23:54.510 --> 01:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
has answered quite a few of them but any
 
01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:56.320 align:start position:0%
additional questions um that there may
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
be um I will perhaps start by addressing
 
01:24:01.910 --> 01:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that was raised um
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
relative to um the the the cap as well
 
01:24:09.189 --> 01:24:09.199 align:start position:0%
as the total dollar amount uh that was
 
01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
that has been paid out historically um
 
01:24:13.470 --> 01:24:13.480 align:start position:0%
as noted in the Department's fiscal note
 
01:24:15.390 --> 01:24:15.400 align:start position:0%
to our knowledge the highest amount that
 
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:18.080 align:start position:0%
was ever paid out in any given bium year
 
01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.270 align:start position:0%
was ever paid out in any given bium year
was

01:24:19.270 --> 01:24:19.280 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
$350,000 relative to volume of what the
 
01:24:23.870 --> 01:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
department receives regarding these uh
 
01:24:26.709 --> 01:24:26.719 align:start position:0%
requests for this particular benefit um
 
01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
I don't have firm numbers I'm happy to
 
01:24:30.430 --> 01:24:30.440 align:start position:0%
get them if that's something that's
 
01:24:32.189 --> 01:24:32.199 align:start position:0%
helpful for the committee but on average
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
it's about two to maybe three per year
 
01:24:38.189 --> 01:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
um my recollection is that this per
 
01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
section of Statute went into effect in
 
01:24:43.510 --> 01:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
2014 and I believe there was a sunset
 
01:24:45.510 --> 01:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
provision in it that may have been
 
01:24:47.229 --> 01:24:47.239 align:start position:0%
removed in
 
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
2017 um I'm I'm stretching my memory
 
01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
back away so um that but that's my my
 
01:24:55.470 --> 01:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
general recollection um and just to
 
01:24:56.910 --> 01:24:56.920 align:start position:0%
emphasize attorney oconor did an
 
01:24:58.830 --> 01:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
excellent job explaining it this is a
 
01:25:01.109 --> 01:25:01.119 align:start position:0%
benefit that is not provided through the
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
regular workers
 
01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
compensation um scheme in the sense that
 
01:25:07.149 --> 01:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
the insurance carrier Andor insurance
 
01:25:09.550 --> 01:25:09.560 align:start position:0%
policy is not paying for this benefit it
 
01:25:13.229 --> 01:25:13.239 align:start position:0%
is 100% general fund funded and can be
 
01:25:16.590 --> 01:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
uh paid to uh qualifying or eligible
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
injured worker in addition to all other
 
01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
workers compensation benefits that that
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
individual is entitled to so if the
 
01:25:25.990 --> 01:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
injured work worker uh injured first
 
01:25:27.750 --> 01:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
responder is let's say still working in
 
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
some capacity they have a permanent
 
01:25:32.830 --> 01:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
impairment or um a permanent injury that
 
01:25:34.910 --> 01:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
qualifies under Section 32 of the
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
statute they uh are eligible to they're
 
01:25:40.590 --> 01:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
eligible to receive all of that in
 
01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
addition to this benefit if they qualify
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
so there's no offset or impact on other
 
01:25:47.629 --> 01:25:47.639 align:start position:0%
benefits that are paid for under the
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
more traditional benefit scheme uh by
 
01:25:52.750 --> 01:25:52.760 align:start position:0%
being eligible for this benefit and I am
 
01:25:54.629 --> 01:25:54.639 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if there are
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
any representative Hall uh thank you for
 
01:26:00.669 --> 01:26:00.679 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you have any uh do
 
01:26:03.270 --> 01:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know how many potential cases are in
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
the pipeline now not yet resolved that
 
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:10.040 align:start position:0%
may trigger us hitting the
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
max any potential cases that are in the
 
01:26:14.910 --> 01:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
pipeline that are not yet resolved do
 
01:26:16.990 --> 01:26:17.000 align:start position:0%
you by do you mean that the that
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
petition has been made to the department
 
01:26:21.149 --> 01:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
for certification for the benefit I'm
 
01:26:24.669 --> 01:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
not aware currently of any pending I
 
01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
would I'm happy to double check with Our
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
Workers Compensation Division uh just to
 
01:26:30.390 --> 01:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
assure that something hasn't very
 
01:26:32.669 --> 01:26:32.679 align:start position:0%
recently come in but as far as I'm aware
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
I do not believe that there are any
 
01:26:37.470 --> 01:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
currently pending thank you okay any
 
01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:40.760 align:start position:0%
other questions represent avalani thank
 
01:26:41.990 --> 01:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman good to see you again
 
01:26:44.669 --> 01:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner um so this is on top
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
of everything that workman's comp would
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
pay out so if workman's comp paid out
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
for a loss of limb um for a Public
 
01:26:52.669 --> 01:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
Employee they would also pay out under
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
this as well that is is correct assuming
 
01:26:59.550 --> 01:26:59.560 align:start position:0%
or uh contingent upon one the injured
 
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
individual meeting the eligibility
 
01:27:03.109 --> 01:27:03.119 align:start position:0%
criteria that they are the they meet the
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
definition of first responder they a
 
01:27:07.750 --> 01:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
group to retiree uh that they have uh
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
that the department has certified them
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
as having a permanent injury that's at
 
01:27:13.229 --> 01:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
less than 100% so there are certain
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria attendant to this
 
01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
benefit should the first responder meet
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
those eligibility criteria yes this
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
benefit would be paid on top of lost
 
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
time from work medical benefits um the
 
01:27:26.790 --> 01:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
more traditional permanent impairment
 
01:27:28.669 --> 01:27:28.679 align:start position:0%
award any other comp benefit that's out
 
01:27:31.310 --> 01:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
there follow it Mr chairman please um on
 
01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:34.719 align:start position:0%
the private sector is there a similar um
 
01:27:36.109 --> 01:27:36.119 align:start position:0%
process for that or is it just that
 
01:27:37.310 --> 01:27:37.320 align:start position:0%
you're one andone with the workman's
 
01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
comp and you're back to work there is no
 
01:27:43.109 --> 01:27:43.119 align:start position:0%
secondary level of uh Insurance that's
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
an excellent question so for the private
 
01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
sector for any injured worker who does
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
not qualify as a first responder defined
 
01:27:51.030 --> 01:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
by the comp statute there is no
 
01:27:53.550 --> 01:27:53.560 align:start position:0%
comparable critical injury benefit uh
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
the benefits would be the um there is a
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
permanent impairment benefit that's
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
available set forth at section 32 that's
 
01:28:02.870 --> 01:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
the scheduled table that attorney OK
 
01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
Conor referenced um for certain types of
 
01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
bodily injury um to the the individual's
 
01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
person but the critical injury benefit
 
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware there's no
 
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
comparable thank you thank you Mr
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
chairman representative Granger uh thank
 
01:28:21.629 --> 01:28:21.639 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair is so if if the first
 
01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
responder dies does this apply or no or
 
01:28:27.390 --> 01:28:27.400 align:start position:0%
is that a separate section of law or
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:37.629 --> 01:28:37.639 align:start position:0%
um that's a very good question I think
 
01:28:40.189 --> 01:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
it's arguable I'd have to look at that a
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more closely there are
 
01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
separate death benefits that are
 
01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
available to the dependence of a
 
01:28:48.070 --> 01:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
deceased injured worker whether they're
 
01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
a first responder or not that's um
 
01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
essentially the monetary weekly payment
 
01:28:55.350 --> 01:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
for lost wages
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to look at that a little
 
01:28:59.109 --> 01:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
further I don't want to give an answer
 
01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
that's inaccurate so if if you're
 
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
comfortable with me going back I would
 
01:29:03.870 --> 01:29:03.880 align:start position:0%
just like to look at the statute in
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
detail and provide an answer on it if
 
01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
you could provide it for the whole
 
01:29:08.070 --> 01:29:08.080 align:start position:0%

planning on testifying however um
 
01:29:38.910 --> 01:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
hearing some of the things I did I I
 
01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
felt uh needed uh to say a few words
 
01:29:45.390 --> 01:29:45.400 align:start position:0%
um this this statute I was just telling
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh to my good friend Jim deur here in
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
the back um this is one of the best
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
things we did um back in 2014 doing this
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
for Dan dhy
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
um because it was
 
01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
needed and I will tell you getting it
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
through the house and the Senate um it
 
01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
mod it had to be modified quite a bit as
 
01:30:06.030 --> 01:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
you see the cap and whatnot there was a
 
01:30:08.109 --> 01:30:08.119 align:start position:0%
couple of speed bumps at the time um
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
there was a sunset provision that was
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier
 
01:30:14.870 --> 01:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
um this is critical this is really
 
01:30:18.629 --> 01:30:18.639 align:start position:0%
really important and I can tell you the
 
01:30:21.510 --> 01:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
125,000 okay I still keep in touch with
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
Dan it's not even close
 
01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
it's not even
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
world what I'd like you to think
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
about is what if there were five Dand
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
dores God
 
01:30:42.669 --> 01:30:42.679 align:start position:0%
forbid what happens to that fifth
 
01:30:44.669 --> 01:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
person Dan got
 
01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
$125,000 that was the max he could get
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
should have got
 
01:30:50.709 --> 01:30:50.719 align:start position:0%
more what do you say to that fifth
 
01:30:52.590 --> 01:30:52.600 align:start position:0%
person in a
 
01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
catastrophic AC
 
01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
ENT we all know what happens all the
 
01:30:59.790 --> 01:30:59.800 align:start position:0%
time all all these you know gun violence
 
01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the country what
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
happens this is this is pretty important
 
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
stuff so I would just ask you what do
 
01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
you do with the fifth person and as this
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
and I fully support this legislation by
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
the way expanding this to a million
 
01:31:17.590 --> 01:31:17.600 align:start position:0%
absolutely but Mr chairman you mentioned
 
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:19.520 align:start position:0%
well if there's only
 
01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:21.800 align:start position:0%
350,000 that was that was the highest in
 
01:31:24.149 --> 01:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
one year why don't we just put why don't
 
01:31:25.709 --> 01:31:25.719 align:start position:0%
we just put
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
500 I would challenge you and the rest
 
01:31:30.910 --> 01:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
of this committee to maybe think why
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
even have a cap at
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
all let's use that
 
01:31:37.870 --> 01:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
logic right nobody here has a crystal
 
01:31:40.270 --> 01:31:40.280 align:start position:0%
ball nobody knows what's going to happen
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
today tomorrow but we have a
 
01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
responsibility we have a a real
 
01:31:47.709 --> 01:31:47.719 align:start position:0%
responsibility to those men and women
 
01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
who come to our Aid I fully support the
 
01:31:52.870 --> 01:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
bill cuz I know these sort of things you
 
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
got to take it and baby so I really
 
01:31:57.390 --> 01:31:57.400 align:start position:0%
really uh appreciate the the the uptick
 
01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
from 500 to a million it's
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
important um but I just want you to
 
01:32:04.030 --> 01:32:04.040 align:start position:0%
think about that fifth person right now
 
01:32:06.669 --> 01:32:06.679 align:start position:0%
or as this is read that that ninth
 
01:32:09.070 --> 01:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
person but this is this is moving the
 
01:32:11.750 --> 01:32:11.760 align:start position:0%
needle and I fully support it and I hope
 
01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:20.910 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:32:20.910 --> 01:32:20.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.390 --> 01:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
rivan thank you for your testimony um
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
it it occurs to me that if New Hampshire
 
01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
had a New Hampshire sized version of 911
 
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:34.960 align:start position:0%
would a million dollars be
 
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
enough not even close thank
 
01:32:42.109 --> 01:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
you all right thank you sir I appreciate
 
01:32:47.550 --> 01:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
up okay seeing no more pin cards I just
 
01:32:55.390 --> 01:32:55.400 align:start position:0%
philosophically um
 
01:32:57.790 --> 01:32:57.800 align:start position:0%
what we think about in this committee is
 
01:33:01.350 --> 01:33:01.360 align:start position:0%
policy is this the right thing to do
 
01:33:03.550 --> 01:33:03.560 align:start position:0%
okay this has got a fiscal note on it so
 
01:33:05.669 --> 01:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
by the 6th of March it's got to go to
 
01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:07.679 align:start position:0%
the finance and they figure
 
01:33:09.870 --> 01:33:09.880 align:start position:0%
out yeah it's the right thing to do
 
01:33:11.149 --> 01:33:11.159 align:start position:0%
because the committee said it's the
 
01:33:13.590 --> 01:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
right thing to do but can we afford it
 
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
so there's two separate questions we're
 
01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:17.560 align:start position:0%
answering the first question and as we
 
01:33:19.950 --> 01:33:19.960 align:start position:0%
think we'll exact this next week so as
 
01:33:21.870 --> 01:33:21.880 align:start position:0%
we think through that just recognize
 
01:33:24.030 --> 01:33:24.040 align:start position:0%
that we're the policy guys it's should
 
01:33:26.669 --> 01:33:26.679 align:start position:0%
make sense but the actual determination
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
if we can afford it goes to the finance
 
01:33:32.149 --> 01:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
committee are there any
 
01:33:34.070 --> 01:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative I do have one question
 
01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
for the prime sponsor is it appropriate
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
to ask him to come back for one question
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh he's not here but representative
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
Susie wants to I probably could not
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
answer that ask okay all right okay okay
 
01:33:50.390 --> 01:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
important question and I I need I need
 
01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
ask question okay the question is where
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
do the union stand with the with the
 
01:33:56.669 --> 01:33:56.679 align:start position:0%
compensation for injuries I need to know
 
01:34:00.669 --> 01:34:00.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
please and please state your name again
 
01:34:04.590 --> 01:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
for the record sure thank you again uh
 
01:34:05.990 --> 01:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
my name is Brian re I represent the
 
01:34:07.030 --> 01:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
professional firefighters of New
 
01:34:09.990 --> 01:34:10.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um we represent 42 local
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
firefighter unions throughout the state
 
01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.400 align:start position:0%
um if I'm understanding your question
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
correctly are you asking if there is a
 
01:34:18.669 --> 01:34:18.679 align:start position:0%
benefit provided by the unions in
 
01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
addition to
 
01:34:23.709 --> 01:34:23.719 align:start position:0%
this Mr chair please I am I'm I want
 
01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:25.360 align:start position:0%
want to know what where the purview is
 
01:34:27.149 --> 01:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
with the with the unions where do they
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
what's their scope of payment or uh
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
supplement or something to you know
 
01:34:33.629 --> 01:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
somebody gets hurt or or God forbid
 
01:34:38.109 --> 01:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
killed so we not being the employer of
 
01:34:40.390 --> 01:34:40.400 align:start position:0%
each individual member um we don't
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
provide a critical injury benefit at all
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
um however with that being said many if
 
01:34:49.470 --> 01:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
not most local unions have their own
 
01:34:52.950 --> 01:34:52.960 align:start position:0%
charitable associations in existence we
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
as a professional firefighters of New
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire have uh what we call the
 
01:34:58.830 --> 01:34:58.840 align:start position:0%
Fallen firefighters family fund where we
 
01:35:00.590 --> 01:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
help take care of our members and their
 
01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
families should a catastrophic incident
 
01:35:05.709 --> 01:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
happened um but it is not anything that
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
we can provide any significant benefit
 
01:35:12.470 --> 01:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
um up to in including $125,000 benefit
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
um usually these charitables help with
 
01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
things such as um getting a member
 
01:35:21.070 --> 01:35:21.080 align:start position:0%
lodging down at a uh a hospital or a
 
01:35:23.109 --> 01:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
Trauma Center if they their family needs
 
01:35:25.109 --> 01:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
to stay in AAL hotel or getting them
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
travel to some place um to help them get
 
01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:29.480 align:start position:0%
the care that they need we're helping
 
01:35:31.310 --> 01:35:31.320 align:start position:0%

01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
families and their children and try and
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
help them through things like college we
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%

01:35:42.109 --> 01:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
forbid their um father mother um be
 
01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
killed in in the line of duty we send
 
01:35:45.709 --> 01:35:45.719 align:start position:0%
them money every year to try and help
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
the children um but we do not have a
 
01:35:51.750 --> 01:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
specific critical injury benefit for
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
this thank you sure
 
01:35:56.310 --> 01:35:56.320 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much I appreciate it
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry represent McKenzie do you have
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
sir can you answer one more question
 
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:05.080 align:start position:0%
please so I I just um if I could just uh
 
01:36:07.709 --> 01:36:07.719 align:start position:0%
just State what we have been doing at
 
01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
the national level uh in terms of a
 
01:36:12.510 --> 01:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
death benefit for uh for fallen
 
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
firefighters because that's been an
 
01:36:16.149 --> 01:36:16.159 align:start position:0%
initiative of the if for a number of
 
01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
years sure thank you for the question um
 
01:36:20.750 --> 01:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
so we are you referring to the public
 
01:36:22.590 --> 01:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
safety officers benefit yeah so there is
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
a federal Public Safety officers benefit
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
um should someone tragically die in the
 
01:36:30.310 --> 01:36:30.320 align:start position:0%
line of duty U As A Firefighter and I
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
believe that should they meet that
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
metric and and meet all the
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
qualifications for that it's somewhere
 
01:36:39.910 --> 01:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
in excess of $450,000 benefit paid to
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
the families um obviously it's it's very
 
01:36:43.750 --> 01:36:43.760 align:start position:0%
tragic landine of Duty death so that
 
01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:46.159 align:start position:0%
money wouldn't be paid um to the member
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
but it would be paid to the familyes so
 
01:36:49.149 --> 01:36:49.159 align:start position:0%
and that is something that the
 
01:36:50.270 --> 01:36:50.280 align:start position:0%
International Association of
 
01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
firefighters which is the um
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
International Union that represents us
 
01:36:58.109 --> 01:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
um has has fought for uh at the federal
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
level for many many years um and that
 
01:37:04.030 --> 01:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
benefit has slowly uh increased over
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
time thank you sure all right thank you
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%

surprise the part that was surprising
 
01:48:40.350 --> 01:48:40.360 align:start position:0%
occurred when we had many of our First

Responders from small communities talk
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
about how difficult it is for them to

member and weren't allowed to leave work

in order to go address the situation to
 
01:49:00.669 --> 01:49:00.679 align:start position:0%
those who were on the scenes of horrific
 
01:49:02.229 --> 01:49:02.239 align:start position:0%
accidents where they had to literally
 
01:49:04.149 --> 01:49:04.159 align:start position:0%
search for body parts that were no
 
01:49:04.159 --> 01:49:05.149 align:start position:0%
search for body parts that were no
longer

01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
longer
 
01:49:07.709 --> 01:49:07.719 align:start position:0%
attached um to those who searched for
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
colleagues who had to search remote
 
01:49:13.709 --> 01:49:13.719 align:start position:0%
locations for um colleagues with the who
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
had gone off with the intent of self

harm
 
01:49:19.629 --> 01:49:19.639 align:start position:0%
um we also heard from family members and
 
01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
Friends of First Responders who talked
 
01:49:23.030 --> 01:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
about the long-term impact of the job on

administrators who wish they'd known how
 
01:49:38.669 --> 01:49:38.679 align:start position:0%
to ensure that their Crews knew how to
 
01:49:41.310 --> 01:49:41.320 align:start position:0%
access help but also those from small
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
very small communities who talked about
 
01:49:45.390 --> 01:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
how difficult it was to find any funding
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
for that help um given how small their
 
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
communities were um and the limited
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
resources of those small communities
 
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
we also heard that although technically
 
01:49:57.550 --> 01:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
workers comp is available to First
 
01:49:59.430 --> 01:49:59.440 align:start position:0%

01:50:05.189 --> 01:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
PTSD it's difficult to access and there
 
01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:06.760 align:start position:0%
are limited supports for theirs who are
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
trying to work through their experiences
 
01:50:10.270 --> 01:50:10.280 align:start position:0%
prior to getting to the stage of
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
full-blown PTSD right um one of the
 
01:50:16.669 --> 01:50:16.679 align:start position:0%
consequences of all of this that we know
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
statistically nationally rates of
 
01:50:21.189 --> 01:50:21.199 align:start position:0%
alcoholism substance abuse and suicide
 
01:50:23.030 --> 01:50:23.040 align:start position:0%
are high very high among our first
 
01:50:25.510 --> 01:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
responder populations um as well as
 
01:50:27.430 --> 01:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
domestic violence increases as well in
 
01:50:29.790 --> 01:50:29.800 align:start position:0%
many of those as a result of of the way
 
01:50:32.950 --> 01:50:32.960 align:start position:0%
they handle their issues um larger towns
 
01:50:34.669 --> 01:50:34.679 align:start position:0%
and cities across New Hampshire are
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
generally able to fund insurance for
 
01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
their staff and include an EAP for them
 
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
as well an employee assistance program
 
01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:42.679 align:start position:0%
which I know you know but maybe our
 
01:50:45.350 --> 01:50:45.360 align:start position:0%
viewers at home don't um our smaller and
 
01:50:47.629 --> 01:50:47.639 align:start position:0%
more remote towns are much more likely
 
01:50:50.430 --> 01:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
to have volunteer uh firefighters they
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
may only have one police officer on
 
01:50:54.790 --> 01:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
staff for their town they may have other
 
01:50:56.990 --> 01:50:57.000 align:start position:0%
challenges but they are much less likely
 
01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to fund that kind of care so
 
01:51:02.229 --> 01:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
this bill was really designed to be the
 
01:51:04.470 --> 01:51:04.480 align:start position:0%
stop Gap measure to fill the void to
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
fill the Gap in coverage by creating a
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
state funded EAP that specifically for
 
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer First Responders and those
 
01:51:13.910 --> 01:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
from towns that have five or fewer paid
 
01:51:16.430 --> 01:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
First Responders we can provide the C
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
coverage that's sorely needed it can be
 
01:51:20.790 --> 01:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
accessed remotely for those who've
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
gotten to the level of having
 
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
significant PTSD it can also help
 
01:51:26.030 --> 01:51:26.040 align:start position:0%
provide a specific diagnosis that makes
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
accessing workers comp easier more
 
01:51:31.390 --> 01:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
accessible um I wanted to share a couple
 
01:51:33.750 --> 01:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
of comments with you from some people um
 
01:51:36.470 --> 01:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
one is by a career firefighter EMT who
 
01:51:38.229 --> 01:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
attended our aftermath Workshop where we
 
01:51:40.950 --> 01:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
talked about pts and First
 
01:51:43.149 --> 01:51:43.159 align:start position:0%
Responders this meaning the aftermath
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
program was a little tough for me and
 
01:51:47.550 --> 01:51:47.560 align:start position:0%
some of my former colleagues I've healed
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
but the wound is still sensitive I feel
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
the program is extremely valuable for
 
01:51:54.030 --> 01:51:54.040 align:start position:0%
Community leaders to understand the
 
01:51:56.069 --> 01:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
jovial first responder may have hidden
 
01:51:58.750 --> 01:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
wounds that need attention I've been
 
01:52:00.589 --> 01:52:00.599 align:start position:0%
called to a colleague's house at 2: a.m.
 
01:52:02.350 --> 01:52:02.360 align:start position:0%
to look for my friend who is despondent
 
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
with a shotgun in the
 
01:52:06.589 --> 01:52:06.599 align:start position:0%
woods sometimes a call hits too close to
 
01:52:09.589 --> 01:52:09.599 align:start position:0%
home in time my nightmares have gone
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
away I'm
 
01:52:14.350 --> 01:52:14.360 align:start position:0%
lucky sometimes it seems politicians
 
01:52:16.470 --> 01:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
don't understand what public servants go
 
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
through um I'm going to also pass out to
 
01:52:21.709 --> 01:52:21.719 align:start position:0%
you um an email that I received from
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
Genevie a
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
who's the founder of the elephant in the
 
01:52:26.189 --> 01:52:26.199 align:start position:0%
room project where she adds additional
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
detail about some of the feedback we've
 
01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
gotten from our program and then I also
 
01:52:32.030 --> 01:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to share a couple of the um
 
01:52:33.629 --> 01:52:33.639 align:start position:0%
comments that people posted in their
 
01:52:33.639 --> 01:52:34.629 align:start position:0%
comments that people posted in their
online

01:52:34.629 --> 01:52:34.639 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
testimony um this one is from the town
 
01:52:39.870 --> 01:52:39.880 align:start position:0%
of Lee um Dear honorable members of the
 
01:52:41.589 --> 01:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
committee establishing an employee
 
01:52:43.470 --> 01:52:43.480 align:start position:0%
assistance program for small town First
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
Responders oh the town of Lee is
 
01:52:47.149 --> 01:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
supportive of this bill small
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire have
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
limited resources and it's important
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
there are programs available for all
 
01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
communities to assist with ISS issues
 
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
such as post-traumatic stress for fire
 
01:52:59.149 --> 01:52:59.159 align:start position:0%
police EMS dispatch and DPW staff
 
01:53:01.870 --> 01:53:01.880 align:start position:0%
involved in critical events Municipal
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
staff provides support to Citizens
 
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
concerning the most traumatic life
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
events events imaginable such as health
 
01:53:10.030 --> 01:53:10.040 align:start position:0%

01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
loss serious motor vehicle accidents
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
murders shootings Etc and should be
 
01:53:16.950 --> 01:53:16.960 align:start position:0%
appropriately supported concerning their
 
01:53:19.149 --> 01:53:19.159 align:start position:0%
mental health and well-being this bill
 
01:53:21.030 --> 01:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
will ensure First Responders in small
 
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
communities receive the support they may
 
01:53:25.990 --> 01:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
require that's from um Andy Robertson
 
01:53:27.910 --> 01:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
who's the town manager in the town of
 
01:53:31.470 --> 01:53:31.480 align:start position:0%
Lee um Richard Krauss who's from Fremont
 
01:53:32.910 --> 01:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
I believe wrote this bill is necessary
 
01:53:34.669 --> 01:53:34.679 align:start position:0%
for towns that do not properly offer
 
01:53:36.589 --> 01:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
this program to its First Responders it
 
01:53:39.189 --> 01:53:39.199 align:start position:0%
should be a Statewide um system for all
 
01:53:40.470 --> 01:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
First Responders no matter what
 
01:53:42.030 --> 01:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
community they're in and there's
 
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
additional comments online that I think
 
01:53:46.629 --> 01:53:46.639 align:start position:0%
are valuable
 
01:53:49.950 --> 01:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
um so um a couple of things so trying to
 
01:53:51.589 --> 01:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
figure out how to figure out a cost for
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
this program I looked up how many First
 
01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:55.400 align:start position:0%
Responders we have in New Hampshire I
 
01:53:57.790 --> 01:53:57.800 align:start position:0%
divided that number by 50% and then I
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
multiplied it by the rough estimate of
 
01:54:01.189 --> 01:54:01.199 align:start position:0%
what it cost to enroll a person in an
 
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
EAP so the idea being that obviously not
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
everyone's going to need to access this
 
01:54:07.750 --> 01:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
care every year right ideally it's a
 
01:54:09.910 --> 01:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
small number of people but hopefully
 
01:54:12.589 --> 01:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
it's all covered by by the
 
01:54:16.390 --> 01:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
$150,000 that um I've asked for um at
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
the same time I also looked up the cost
 
01:54:19.790 --> 01:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
to hire and train police and
 
01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:21.480 align:start position:0%
firefighters I didn't look at every type
 
01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
of first responder that wasn't realistic
 
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
for me um but I would say that First
 
01:54:27.189 --> 01:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
Responders also include people who work
 
01:54:29.109 --> 01:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
in Fire and Rescue and other similar
 
01:54:32.229 --> 01:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
groups um based on what I found online
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
and work that I did reaching out to some
 
01:54:36.030 --> 01:54:36.040 align:start position:0%
different police Chiefs the current
 
01:54:38.229 --> 01:54:38.239 align:start position:0%
average State cost to hire a new police
 
01:54:39.750 --> 01:54:39.760 align:start position:0%
officer in New Hampshire including
 
01:54:42.069 --> 01:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
recruiting and training is approximately
 
01:54:44.550 --> 01:54:44.560 align:start position:0%
$70,000 per person and one of them told
 
01:54:45.750 --> 01:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
me it can be up to
 
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
$150,000 per officer to hire someone um
 
01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:51.320 align:start position:0%
for fire it's a much more complicated
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
formula because because some
 
01:54:54.589 --> 01:54:54.599 align:start position:0%
firefighters are hired simply as
 
01:54:56.709 --> 01:54:56.719 align:start position:0%
firefighters some are EMT some are emt's
 
01:54:58.990 --> 01:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
paramedics there's all different levels
 
01:55:01.030 --> 01:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
so the formula came out to about 10,000
 
01:55:04.189 --> 01:55:04.199 align:start position:0%
to 20,000 just to get hired um and then
 
01:55:06.910 --> 01:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
to begin starting to equip them and so
 
01:55:08.350 --> 01:55:08.360 align:start position:0%
if we think about the cost of this
 
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
program versus the cost of hiring
 
01:55:11.270 --> 01:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
retaining and
 
01:55:13.350 --> 01:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
recruiting it's obviously much less
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
expensive to provide our First
 
01:55:17.149 --> 01:55:17.159 align:start position:0%
Responders with critical mental health
 
01:55:18.990 --> 01:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
care when they need it rather than
 
01:55:20.589 --> 01:55:20.599 align:start position:0%
having to go back and try to find new
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
people especially at a time when we
 
01:55:24.069 --> 01:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
vacancies across the state in all of
 
01:55:27.510 --> 01:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
these areas and um with that I will end
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
my testimony and be happy to answer your
 
01:55:31.709 --> 01:55:31.719 align:start position:0%
questions excellent thank you are there
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:55:36.109 --> 01:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
comments right next to you sir
 
01:55:37.950 --> 01:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
representative Alani thank you Mr
 
01:55:39.629 --> 01:55:39.639 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representa taking
 
01:55:41.350 --> 01:55:41.360 align:start position:0%
the questions um you know you mentioned
 
01:55:42.750 --> 01:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
in your testimony that this would be an
 
01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
affirm an affirmative action for a
 
01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
workman's comp claim to go to EAP first
 
01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
and then backtrack to the so what we
 
01:55:54.030 --> 01:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
heard is so technically workers comp is
 
01:55:55.270 --> 01:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to cover
 
01:55:58.229 --> 01:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
PTSD however to get Workers Comp and
 
01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
this is what we were heard hearing from
 
01:56:01.870 --> 01:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
our First Responders directly so I may
 
01:56:04.669 --> 01:56:04.679 align:start position:0%
not have at all 100% accurate to be fair
 
01:56:06.910 --> 01:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
but was that in order to access workers
 
01:56:08.109 --> 01:56:08.119 align:start position:0%
comp they had to have a medical
 
01:56:10.030 --> 01:56:10.040 align:start position:0%
diagnosis in order to get a medical
 
01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
diagnosis they need to have seen someone
 
01:56:13.069 --> 01:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
in order to seen someone they had to
 
01:56:15.069 --> 01:56:15.079 align:start position:0%
have a way to pay for the person so we
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
had one of our people who came to one of
 
01:56:18.589 --> 01:56:18.599 align:start position:0%
our presentations talk about his
 
01:56:20.069 --> 01:56:20.079 align:start position:0%
full-time job is as a gas station
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
attendant he makes $15 an hour and has
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
zero benefits he can't afford to go see
 
01:56:27.550 --> 01:56:27.560 align:start position:0%
someone to begin the process to get the
 
01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
care and he talked about that he's not
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
sure how much longer he can stay as a
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
volunteer firefighter in his community
 
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
because he's not sure how much longer
 
01:56:36.870 --> 01:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
his body can physically handle the
 
01:56:38.709 --> 01:56:38.719 align:start position:0%
stress of the
 
01:56:42.109 --> 01:56:42.119 align:start position:0%
job so the goal was to try to figure out
 
01:56:43.950 --> 01:56:43.960 align:start position:0%
a way in situation like that if there's
 
01:56:46.270 --> 01:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
a program like this that he could access
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
maybe he could get the initial care he
 
01:56:49.910 --> 01:56:49.920 align:start position:0%
needs and maybe it would ultimately lead
 
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
to something to him needing workers comp
 
01:56:52.669 --> 01:56:52.679 align:start position:0%
but maybe it wouldn't but this would
 
01:56:54.270 --> 01:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
fill at least the initial gap of getting
 
01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
him care and maybe it would allow him to
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
stay you know maybe it would be
 
01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
sufficient maybe he'd have two sessions
 
01:57:02.310 --> 01:57:02.320 align:start position:0%
with an EAP personnel and we would go
 
01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
from there this isn't intended to fix
 
01:57:05.870 --> 01:57:05.880 align:start position:0%
everything it's just trying to plug a
 
01:57:09.910 --> 01:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
hole follow yes follow thank you um and
 
01:57:13.470 --> 01:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
it's administered by the EAP program and
 
01:57:15.310 --> 01:57:15.320 align:start position:0%
they would make a medical diagnosis of
 
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
an employee and it public or private I'm
 
01:57:22.470 --> 01:57:22.480 align:start position:0%
conf confused so so an EAP is designed
 
01:57:24.790 --> 01:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
um to provide mental health care or
 
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
other care that people can access
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
remotely right and so the the goal of
 
01:57:30.229 --> 01:57:30.239 align:start position:0%
this is really about figuring out ways
 
01:57:32.069 --> 01:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
to access the mental health care without
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
stigma and and getting them the care
 
01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:36.149 align:start position:0%
stigma and and getting them the care
they

01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
need and final yes what notification to
 
01:57:43.069 --> 01:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
the employer um if they intend to go to
 
01:57:45.709 --> 01:57:45.719 align:start position:0%
EAP looking for a diagnosis to be able
 
01:57:47.830 --> 01:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
to file a claim because worker uh
 
01:57:49.629 --> 01:57:49.639 align:start position:0%
employers have a limited amount of
 
01:57:50.950 --> 01:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
window to file that claim with their
 
01:57:52.830 --> 01:57:52.840 align:start position:0%
insurance company to say there might be
 
01:57:55.149 --> 01:57:55.159 align:start position:0%
something coming or they might be on the
 
01:57:58.709 --> 01:57:58.719 align:start position:0%
hook because it's past the window so um
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
eaps by Design are intended to be
 
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
confidential to protect employees um one
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
of the things that we also heard from
 
01:58:08.430 --> 01:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
our police officers who attended is that
 
01:58:12.149 --> 01:58:12.159 align:start position:0%
if they were to go the route of being U
 
01:58:14.510 --> 01:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
of um seeking Mental Health Care
 
01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
specifically for on the job trauma they
 
01:58:18.189 --> 01:58:18.199 align:start position:0%
can lose their certification as police
 
01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
officers which leaves many of them
 
01:58:24.510 --> 01:58:24.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:27.550 --> 01:58:27.560 align:start position:0%
so um an EAP by Design is is intended to
 
01:58:29.470 --> 01:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
be confidential between the employee or
 
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
the volunteer in this case um and and
 
01:58:34.709 --> 01:58:34.719 align:start position:0%
the EAP program that's what it would be
 
01:58:36.550 --> 01:58:36.560 align:start position:0%
through the state as opposed to through
 
01:58:39.270 --> 01:58:39.280 align:start position:0%
a specific town and
 
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:42.320 align:start position:0%
so um I'm not sure if I'm able to answer
 
01:58:43.870 --> 01:58:43.880 align:start position:0%
your question fully and I'm sorry that
 
01:58:46.149 --> 01:58:46.159 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert in the field okay
 
01:58:48.550 --> 01:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman okay any
 
01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:51.030 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman okay any
further

01:58:51.030 --> 01:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
01:58:56.589 --> 01:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:09.310 --> 01:59:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:12.229 --> 01:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
please good morning I'm Mike laws I am
 
01:59:13.510 --> 01:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
the director of the state of New
 
01:59:18.950 --> 01:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
program so one of the things that I
 
01:59:23.350 --> 01:59:23.360 align:start position:0%
would would try to be brief and maybe
 
01:59:25.550 --> 01:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
leave the the more interactive piece
 
01:59:27.870 --> 01:59:27.880 align:start position:0%
around um potential questions or
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
concerns uh one of the things that we
 
01:59:32.910 --> 01:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
looked at is our capacity to support
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
this bill and so the state of New
 
01:59:37.149 --> 01:59:37.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's employee assistance program
 
01:59:40.109 --> 01:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
has seven uh full-time state employees
 
01:59:42.430 --> 01:59:42.440 align:start position:0%
total and we currently serve All State
 
01:59:45.149 --> 01:59:45.159 align:start position:0%
departments so health and human services
 
01:59:48.270 --> 01:59:48.280 align:start position:0%
safety liquor really any any uh state
 
01:59:51.030 --> 01:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
agency not only does the state employee
 
01:59:52.270 --> 01:59:52.280 align:start position:0%
but their family members have have
 
01:59:56.069 --> 01:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
access to us
 
02:00:00.069 --> 02:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
um so the number we we weren't sure
 
02:00:03.229 --> 02:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
about uh the particular amount of
 
02:00:04.830 --> 02:00:04.840 align:start position:0%
potential clients that this bill was
 
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:08.360 align:start position:0%
covering and so I did some us me and
 
02:00:10.709 --> 02:00:10.719 align:start position:0%
some of the folks uh on on the HHS side
 
02:00:12.910 --> 02:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
did some research and part of what we
 
02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:15.719 align:start position:0%
found out in particular there's a um
 
02:00:17.629 --> 02:00:17.639 align:start position:0%
document that's referenced in the fiscal
 
02:00:20.030 --> 02:00:20.040 align:start position:0%
note worksheet around uh Recruitment and
 
02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:23.679 align:start position:0%
Retention report and recommendations
 
02:00:27.149 --> 02:00:27.159 align:start position:0%
and the the numbers that we come up with
 
02:00:30.910 --> 02:00:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
approximately in 2022 there were
 
02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
4,256 on call or volunteer members of
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
fire departments throughout the state
 
02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
and there also in some internal
 
02:00:44.470 --> 02:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
correspondence with Department of Safety
 
02:00:47.149 --> 02:00:47.159 align:start position:0%
in 2024 there were five uh fire
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
departments who reported having five or
 
02:00:51.669 --> 02:00:51.679 align:start position:0%
less uh fire firefighters so I think in
 
02:00:55.069 --> 02:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
that way just to be clear I'm
 
02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:56.760 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
02:00:59.790 --> 02:00:59.800 align:start position:0%
as all volunteer firefighters would be
 
02:01:02.629 --> 02:01:02.639 align:start position:0%
eligible under this bill as well as any
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
fire department that has five or less
 
02:01:09.550 --> 02:01:09.560 align:start position:0%
full-time firefighters on staff and so
 
02:01:12.069 --> 02:01:12.079 align:start position:0%
uh there were only five fire departments
 
02:01:15.189 --> 02:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
with five or less firefighters on staff
 
02:01:18.030 --> 02:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
but there's uh about 28% of the fire
 
02:01:20.189 --> 02:01:20.199 align:start position:0%
departments did not answer that survey
 
02:01:23.069 --> 02:01:23.079 align:start position:0%
so we we don't really know how many
 
02:01:25.470 --> 02:01:25.480 align:start position:0%
additional uh clients from our
 
02:01:27.189 --> 02:01:27.199 align:start position:0%
perspective would be eligible so we kind
 
02:01:28.550 --> 02:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
of have that
 
02:01:32.830 --> 02:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
4,256 as a starting number plus 25 plus
 
02:01:35.830 --> 02:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
whoever didn't respond so in that way
 
02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:36.870 align:start position:0%
whoever didn't respond so in that way
the

02:01:36.870 --> 02:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:01:41.390 --> 02:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
um 150,000 appropriation wouldn't uh be
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
able to cover the costs of trying to
 
02:01:47.589 --> 02:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
support even say between 6 and 10% most
 
02:01:50.910 --> 02:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
eaps function at about 6% utilization
 
02:01:54.350 --> 02:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
our current estimate are over 10% um but
 
02:01:57.149 --> 02:01:57.159 align:start position:0%
if you think about even 6 to 10% of that
 
02:02:00.030 --> 02:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
number accessing us particularly in
 
02:02:01.910 --> 02:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
rural areas of the state where we may be
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
traveling or providing support trying to
 
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
find providers who you know for
 
02:02:09.870 --> 02:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
currently while we serve all state
 
02:02:12.189 --> 02:02:12.199 align:start position:0%
employees you know a high number of
 
02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
those folks all have Anthem Insurance
 
02:02:16.310 --> 02:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here with this
 
02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
group is we don't know what insurance
 
02:02:20.069 --> 02:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
they have or if they have insurance and
 
02:02:22.109 --> 02:02:22.119 align:start position:0%
the role we would play there would be uh
 
02:02:23.790 --> 02:02:23.800 align:start position:0%
maybe connecting them with the provider
 
02:02:26.149 --> 02:02:26.159 align:start position:0%
or Medicaid if they need uh resources
 
02:02:28.510 --> 02:02:28.520 align:start position:0%
Beyond kind of temporary support with
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
EAP it wouldn't just be a kind of a
 
02:02:33.870 --> 02:02:33.880 align:start position:0%
referral to a provider and and to the
 
02:02:37.229 --> 02:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
previous uh testimony we don't diagnose
 
02:02:39.790 --> 02:02:39.800 align:start position:0%
we don't diagnose so while some of our
 
02:02:42.310 --> 02:02:42.320 align:start position:0%
uh folks on staff at the EAP are
 
02:02:45.069 --> 02:02:45.079 align:start position:0%
licensed clinicians the EAP role in that
 
02:02:47.310 --> 02:02:47.320 align:start position:0%
way would be more about uh providing
 
02:02:49.669 --> 02:02:49.679 align:start position:0%
some support some education around a
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
critical incident or kind of the phys
 
02:02:53.709 --> 02:02:53.719 align:start position:0%
physiological impacts or cognitive
 
02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:56.280 align:start position:0%
emotional impacts but then referring
 
02:02:59.109 --> 02:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
them to a trauma informed provider now
 
02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
in my mind that that diagnosis that was
 
02:03:04.229 --> 02:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
referenced say PTSD uh that's something
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
that could come from a clinical provider
 
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
in the community it could also come from
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
a medical provider and the role we might
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
play there would be helping them connect
 
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
with their PCP providing some
 
02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
information and stabilization or helping
 
02:03:18.189 --> 02:03:18.199 align:start position:0%
them connect with a clinical mental
 
02:03:19.950 --> 02:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
health provider in the community but we
 
02:03:21.870 --> 02:03:21.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to provide a DI di
 
02:03:25.350 --> 02:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
agnosis based on their experience so I'm
 
02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
long-winded I'll I'll kind of pause
 
02:03:29.830 --> 02:03:29.840 align:start position:0%
there and and uh open it up if folks
 
02:03:31.589 --> 02:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
have any questions I'm sorry are you in
 
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
favor of this bill opposed to it or
 
02:03:36.990 --> 02:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
neutral I would say neutral in that way
 
02:03:38.830 --> 02:03:38.840 align:start position:0%
I I think it's a great bill I apologize
 
02:03:40.430 --> 02:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
for selecting I didn't know there was a
 
02:03:42.870 --> 02:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
neutral option I guess I'm in favor of
 
02:03:45.750 --> 02:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
it I think we're in favor of it but we
 
02:03:47.189 --> 02:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
see that there's more of a financial
 
02:03:49.990 --> 02:03:50.000 align:start position:0%
impact than was init initially kind of
 
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:55.750 align:start position:0%
impact than was init initially kind of
addressed

02:03:55.750 --> 02:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:59.990 --> 02:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
schz so um thank you Mr chair I assume
 
02:04:02.549 --> 02:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
firefighters who do have access to an
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
employee assistance program that don't
 
02:04:08.709 --> 02:04:08.719 align:start position:0%
qualify for this because they have
 
02:04:10.589 --> 02:04:10.599 align:start position:0%
already have access it's not through the
 
02:04:13.549 --> 02:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
state it's must be through um maybe the
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
firefighters Union or another
 
02:04:18.589 --> 02:04:18.599 align:start position:0%
Association maybe they local town oh
 
02:04:20.629 --> 02:04:20.639 align:start position:0%
okay if I'm assuming if they have a
 
02:04:22.189 --> 02:04:22.199 align:start position:0%
large enough employee group group a lot
 
02:04:26.350 --> 02:04:26.360 align:start position:0%
of um private agencies are have elected
 
02:04:30.270 --> 02:04:30.280 align:start position:0%
a private EAP perhaps okay um and and
 
02:04:33.229 --> 02:04:33.239 align:start position:0%
they may be you know a provider a couple
 
02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
of States over you know in turn I
 
02:04:37.830 --> 02:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
brought some orientation material about
 
02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
the EAP and kind of the breadth of our
 
02:04:42.109 --> 02:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
services and also around how we respond
 
02:04:43.709 --> 02:04:43.719 align:start position:0%
to critical incidents and things of that
 
02:04:45.350 --> 02:04:45.360 align:start position:0%
nature our folks have all been trained
 
02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
in critical incident stress management
 
02:04:51.709 --> 02:04:51.719 align:start position:0%
um but some eaps are kind of a phone
 
02:04:54.069 --> 02:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
number multiple States over whereas we
 
02:04:56.750 --> 02:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
are internal residents of the state we
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
pride ourselves on resources and
 
02:05:00.910 --> 02:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
Connections in the state if we provided
 
02:05:02.549 --> 02:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
a mental health clinician in the
 
02:05:04.189 --> 02:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
community we wouldn't just give you a
 
02:05:06.149 --> 02:05:06.159 align:start position:0%
random number we check to make sure that
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
person has availability they accept your
 
02:05:10.350 --> 02:05:10.360 align:start position:0%
insurance and we wouldn't give that name
 
02:05:11.870 --> 02:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
unless we were comfortable with our own
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
family members accessing that employee
 
02:05:16.990 --> 02:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
or that that clinician my apologies
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
representative Hall thank you Mr chair U
 
02:05:22.109 --> 02:05:22.119 align:start position:0%
thanks for your testimony um we heard
 
02:05:24.229 --> 02:05:24.239 align:start position:0%
from representative Cel when she
 
02:05:26.149 --> 02:05:26.159 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill that one of the
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
hopes was that this program would help
 
02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
get someone a diagnosis so that they
 
02:05:35.189 --> 02:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
could um enter a workman's comp claim
 
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
but based on your testimony it doesn't
 
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
sound like this would help because EAP
 
02:05:43.830 --> 02:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
programs don't do that kind of diagnosis
 
02:05:46.510 --> 02:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
can you talk about yes I apologize for
 
02:05:49.189 --> 02:05:49.199 align:start position:0%
jumping in um to the point of us
 
02:05:50.950 --> 02:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
diagnosing no we wouldn't be able to
 
02:05:53.270 --> 02:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
diagnose um that's not under our current
 
02:05:56.270 --> 02:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
scope of practice and uh but what we
 
02:05:58.390 --> 02:05:58.400 align:start position:0%
would do there and our familiarity you
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
know so where we serve All State
 
02:06:01.709 --> 02:06:01.719 align:start position:0%
agencies you know we've worked with
 
02:06:03.709 --> 02:06:03.719 align:start position:0%
folks who have had on the job injuries
 
02:06:05.149 --> 02:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
right and so in that way we're familiar
 
02:06:06.910 --> 02:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
with they the process that kind of
 
02:06:09.470 --> 02:06:09.480 align:start position:0%
emerges in that uh so our role in that
 
02:06:11.549 --> 02:06:11.559 align:start position:0%
particular incident let's say an
 
02:06:13.229 --> 02:06:13.239 align:start position:0%
employee reached out or a firefighter
 
02:06:15.390 --> 02:06:15.400 align:start position:0%
reached out they had an event we would
 
02:06:17.589 --> 02:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
support and assess based on what they're
 
02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
presenting with and I would imagine in a
 
02:06:21.629 --> 02:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
situation like that part of the
 
02:06:24.030 --> 02:06:24.040 align:start position:0%
conversation would also be around where
 
02:06:26.669 --> 02:06:26.679 align:start position:0%
are their resources and and that bigger
 
02:06:28.830 --> 02:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
umbrella is a resource that could
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
provide them a diagnosis and so at that
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
level it would be a PCP or a uh licensed
 
02:06:36.990 --> 02:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
clinical mental health counselor in the
 
02:06:39.149 --> 02:06:39.159 align:start position:0%
community which we have relationships
 
02:06:41.109 --> 02:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
with folks like in those ways and so
 
02:06:43.310 --> 02:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
from a referral process standpoint that
 
02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
may be a much smoother transaction for
 
02:06:47.270 --> 02:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
them but we could help them get
 
02:06:48.910 --> 02:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
connected and kind of support them in
 
02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
the in the process of getting connected
 
02:06:52.430 --> 02:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
and dealing with the emotions and
 
02:06:54.030 --> 02:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
experiences that they're dealing with in
 
02:06:55.990 --> 02:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
the in the present moment quick followup
 
02:06:59.270 --> 02:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
yes so there would still be an
 
02:07:02.470 --> 02:07:02.480 align:start position:0%
additional benefit needed somewhere for
 
02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
that person to get the diagnosis to go
 
02:07:06.669 --> 02:07:06.679 align:start position:0%
into the workers's comp system it would
 
02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
in that you know if they had insurance
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
we would quickly we' help them kind of
 
02:07:13.629 --> 02:07:13.639 align:start position:0%
rule in or out what's the quickest path
 
02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:15.360 align:start position:0%
with path you know because they may also
 
02:07:17.870 --> 02:07:17.880 align:start position:0%
have an existing mental health condition
 
02:07:19.390 --> 02:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
they may also be on prescription
 
02:07:21.030 --> 02:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
medication and so part of the
 
02:07:24.669 --> 02:07:24.679 align:start position:0%
conversation may be uh what what path is
 
02:07:26.390 --> 02:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
the quickest path to get connected with
 
02:07:28.589 --> 02:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
an additional resource who who are you
 
02:07:30.910 --> 02:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
considering reaching out to a PCP would
 
02:07:32.510 --> 02:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
probably be in that equation where
 
02:07:34.830 --> 02:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
there's some other factors there um if
 
02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
they didn't have insurance we would be
 
02:07:39.229 --> 02:07:39.239 align:start position:0%
reaching out to providers that we know
 
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
either uh work on a sliding scale or
 
02:07:44.750 --> 02:07:44.760 align:start position:0%
they have a area of specialty with with
 
02:07:46.510 --> 02:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
First Responders or firefighters and so
 
02:07:48.430 --> 02:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
they're open to working with folks uh
 
02:07:50.910 --> 02:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
either at a reduced rate or or you know
 
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
uh SL scale um if they didn't have
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
insurance and that was something that
 
02:07:57.030 --> 02:07:57.040 align:start position:0%
they would likely need to navigate this
 
02:07:58.709 --> 02:07:58.719 align:start position:0%
process we'd be helping them connect
 
02:08:00.390 --> 02:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
with medicate or going through the
 
02:08:02.430 --> 02:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
application process to kind of navigate
 
02:08:05.669 --> 02:08:05.679 align:start position:0%
that as well so it would never be us
 
02:08:07.510 --> 02:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
kind of meeting and then just kind of
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
moving on we we try to support through
 
02:08:11.629 --> 02:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
that whole process anticipate where the
 
02:08:13.390 --> 02:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
challenges would be connecting them with
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
resources that would help them navigate
 
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
the process and then the
 
02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
followup Zam
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank you Mr Mr chairman thank
 
02:08:24.990 --> 02:08:25.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking the question um you
 
02:08:27.310 --> 02:08:27.320 align:start position:0%
testified that $150,000 would be
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
insufficient to uh cover the cost of
 
02:08:32.709 --> 02:08:32.719 align:start position:0%
this um do you have an idea of what a
 
02:08:34.390 --> 02:08:34.400 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount would
 
02:08:37.229 --> 02:08:37.239 align:start position:0%
be the uh fiscal I'm not sure if the
 
02:08:39.069 --> 02:08:39.079 align:start position:0%
fiscal note sheet we submitted the
 
02:08:46.990 --> 02:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
16th I don't see
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
it me
 
02:08:53.360 --> 02:08:59.109 align:start position:0%
it me
see

02:08:59.109 --> 02:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:01.830 --> 02:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
okay we we anticipated based on the
 
02:09:03.430 --> 02:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
numbers that we had in trying to
 
02:09:07.030 --> 02:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
estimate the impact in our capacity uh
 
02:09:10.750 --> 02:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
we we estimated having to hire a new uh
 
02:09:15.310 --> 02:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
field rep position a full-time position
 
02:09:18.109 --> 02:09:18.119 align:start position:0%
um and I have the numbers here let me
 
02:09:20.510 --> 02:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
just see if I can tease them out I'm
 
02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:32.390 align:start position:0%
just see if I can tease them out I'm
sorry

02:09:32.390 --> 02:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:34.189 --> 02:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:36.990 --> 02:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
John so for fiscal
 
02:09:41.030 --> 02:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
year 2026 it would be
 
02:09:47.030 --> 02:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:49.709 --> 02:09:49.719 align:start position:0%
111,000 and that's I'm sorry and that's
 
02:09:52.109 --> 02:09:52.119 align:start position:0%
over and above the cost of the actual
 
02:09:56.109 --> 02:09:56.119 align:start position:0%
program that that cost is not factoring
 
02:09:57.629 --> 02:09:57.639 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:10:00.149 --> 02:10:00.159 align:start position:0%
$150,000 that was initially reference
 
02:10:03.069 --> 02:10:03.079 align:start position:0%
this is just the cost to be able to hire
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
a new full-time position and absorb the
 
02:10:08.310 --> 02:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
capacity that may come in through that
 
02:10:11.549 --> 02:10:11.559 align:start position:0%
volume of potential clients for followup
 
02:10:13.910 --> 02:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
for followup just just to make sure
 
02:10:16.950 --> 02:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
we're clear it looks like
 
02:10:19.390 --> 02:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
$260,000 would be sufficient to fund
 
02:10:23.149 --> 02:10:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:25.030 --> 02:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
I mean when I look at the the fiscal
 
02:10:28.629 --> 02:10:28.639 align:start position:0%
note here it's it's 106 for the 26 and
 
02:10:32.430 --> 02:10:32.440 align:start position:0%
111 so two I I believe the initial
 
02:10:36.229 --> 02:10:36.239 align:start position:0%
proposal said 150 so 250 would but I
 
02:10:39.589 --> 02:10:39.599 align:start position:0%
think the estimates are 106 and 111 so
 
02:10:42.910 --> 02:10:42.920 align:start position:0%
217 over the the two the
 
02:10:45.669 --> 02:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
bium thank you
 
02:10:49.470 --> 02:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
all represent Granger thank you Mr chair
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
so the governor has implemented hiring
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
freeze do you expect that by the time
 
02:10:58.549 --> 02:10:58.559 align:start position:0%
this is passed the employee we it would
 
02:11:01.870 --> 02:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
be justifiable to hire an employee for
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
this while we're possibly letting go of
 
02:11:06.390 --> 02:11:06.400 align:start position:0%
employers for other stuff employees for
 
02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:09.669 align:start position:0%
employers for other stuff employees for
other

02:11:09.669 --> 02:11:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
stuff I'm not sure how to respond to
 
02:11:16.069 --> 02:11:16.079 align:start position:0%
that other than um to say that when
 
02:11:18.109 --> 02:11:18.119 align:start position:0%
we're looking at a candidate for this
 
02:11:20.069 --> 02:11:20.079 align:start position:0%
type of position the you know the
 
02:11:21.709 --> 02:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
background and experience that somebody
 
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
would need to be able to come into the
 
02:11:25.390 --> 02:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
world the roles that we're in and
 
02:11:27.470 --> 02:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
respond to somebody who is dealing with
 
02:11:31.870 --> 02:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
trauma and have had significant events
 
02:11:34.390 --> 02:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
um I don't know that all positions would
 
02:11:36.270 --> 02:11:36.280 align:start position:0%
translate to that position in terms of
 
02:11:38.750 --> 02:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
kind of the the role of a a potentially
 
02:11:41.310 --> 02:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
vacant position and a position opening
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
um other than to say you know we would
 
02:11:46.750 --> 02:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
have our normal job posting and and and
 
02:11:48.830 --> 02:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
process interview process if that was
 
02:11:50.709 --> 02:11:50.719 align:start position:0%
available to us if we weren't able to do
 
02:11:52.109 --> 02:11:52.119 align:start position:0%
that we would wouldn't be able to do
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
02:11:58.350 --> 02:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
you can me just read back what I think I
 
02:12:00.990 --> 02:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
hearde is that there's currently five
 
02:12:03.830 --> 02:12:03.840 align:start position:0%
departments that qualify under this five
 
02:12:07.870 --> 02:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
person five known departments with
 
02:12:09.830 --> 02:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
several departments that had not
 
02:12:13.390 --> 02:12:13.400 align:start position:0%
responded yes there are we're hiring
 
02:12:16.830 --> 02:12:16.840 align:start position:0%
someone then to administer a program for
 
02:12:19.709 --> 02:12:19.719 align:start position:0%
five small town departments no that that
 
02:12:23.310 --> 02:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
um I apologize I have a lot of documents
 
02:12:29.910 --> 02:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
here all right I believe this was also
 
02:12:31.709 --> 02:12:31.719 align:start position:0%
referenced oh the fiscal note hadn't
 
02:12:36.149 --> 02:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
but currently four based on the
 
02:12:40.470 --> 02:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
information that was available to us in
 
02:12:42.629 --> 02:12:42.639 align:start position:0%
this Recruitment and Retention report
 
02:12:42.639 --> 02:12:44.669 align:start position:0%
this Recruitment and Retention report
that

02:12:44.669 --> 02:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:12:49.390 --> 02:12:49.400 align:start position:0%
uh of 2022 was there are
 
02:12:51.990 --> 02:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
4,281 individuals who be eligible for
 
02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
EAP Services through the proposal
 
02:12:57.750 --> 02:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
there's a those are the volunteer
 
02:13:00.510 --> 02:13:00.520 align:start position:0%
firefighters there are there
 
02:13:03.430 --> 02:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
are also departments with five or less
 
02:13:05.830 --> 02:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
full-time firefighters would be
 
02:13:08.669 --> 02:13:08.679 align:start position:0%
eligible what we know about departments
 
02:13:13.709 --> 02:13:13.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:16.790 --> 02:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
2024 uh fire departments are required to
 
02:13:18.189 --> 02:13:18.199 align:start position:0%
submit information about how many
 
02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
employees they have how many full-time
 
02:13:23.270 --> 02:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
firefighters they have uh only
 
02:13:26.910 --> 02:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
72% submitted that information of that
 
02:13:29.470 --> 02:13:29.480 align:start position:0%
72% there were only five additional fire
 
02:13:31.030 --> 02:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
departments that were named as having
 
02:13:34.109 --> 02:13:34.119 align:start position:0%
five or less uh firefighters so there's
 
02:13:37.069 --> 02:13:37.079 align:start position:0%
an additional 28% and you know what are
 
02:13:38.750 --> 02:13:38.760 align:start position:0%
those are those the majority are those
 
02:13:40.510 --> 02:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
in rural areas there's pieces of that
 
02:13:42.629 --> 02:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
that we can't really tease out for
 
02:13:45.750 --> 02:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
certain but what we do know is that
 
02:13:50.350 --> 02:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
4,000 281 plus I would say plus whatever
 
02:13:51.910 --> 02:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
those departments are plus whatever
 
02:13:53.549 --> 02:13:53.559 align:start position:0%
those departments okay now I understand
 
02:13:56.589 --> 02:13:56.599 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
02:13:58.470 --> 02:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chairman thank
 
02:14:01.510 --> 02:14:01.520 align:start position:0%
you for the questions um this says First
 
02:14:05.069 --> 02:14:05.079 align:start position:0%
Responders and then it sets the limit at
 
02:14:08.669 --> 02:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
five full-time paid First Responders
 
02:14:11.549 --> 02:14:11.559 align:start position:0%
yes does that include fire police gpw
 
02:14:13.350 --> 02:14:13.360 align:start position:0%
that that are technically First
 
02:14:16.350 --> 02:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
Responders and are we should we expect
 
02:14:20.030 --> 02:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
more than 4,000 that would take part in
 
02:14:22.270 --> 02:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
this I'm not sure how to respond to that
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
it may I mean I based on the information
 
02:14:30.390 --> 02:14:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
4,256 on call or volunteer members of
 
02:14:39.109 --> 02:14:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:42.510 --> 02:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
state so I think that would cover that
 
02:14:44.589 --> 02:14:44.599 align:start position:0%
group but I'm not sure that that
 
02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
language that I just referenced is taken
 
02:14:48.750 --> 02:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
directly out of this report so as of
 
02:14:52.549 --> 02:14:52.559 align:start position:0%
July 2022 there were 4,2 56 on call or
 
02:14:54.310 --> 02:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
volunteer members of fire
 
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
department I guess it doesn't it doesn't
 
02:14:59.870 --> 02:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
specify if that's also emergency
 
02:15:01.229 --> 02:15:01.239 align:start position:0%
services to your
 
02:15:04.470 --> 02:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
point I'm getting for followup I'm
 
02:15:06.629 --> 02:15:06.639 align:start position:0%
getting nods of yet affirmative behind
 
02:15:09.629 --> 02:15:09.639 align:start position:0%
you and we don't know from the actual
 
02:15:12.430 --> 02:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
department so um that would be a
 
02:15:15.030 --> 02:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
question because that would uh
 
02:15:17.470 --> 02:15:17.480 align:start position:0%
exponentially increase the process for
 
02:15:19.310 --> 02:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
additional workman's compensation claims
 
02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
across three different SE ments of
 
02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:23.470 align:start position:0%
across three different SE ments of
public

02:15:23.470 --> 02:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
public
 
02:15:25.910 --> 02:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
employment I don't know if I should I
 
02:15:27.870 --> 02:15:27.880 align:start position:0%
representative Cel can you respond to
 
02:15:29.709 --> 02:15:29.719 align:start position:0%
that yeah so the goal of this is not to
 
02:15:32.270 --> 02:15:32.280 align:start position:0%
increase workers comp the goal is to get
 
02:15:34.549 --> 02:15:34.559 align:start position:0%
people who are working First Responders
 
02:15:36.549 --> 02:15:36.559 align:start position:0%
to be able to access immediate care so
 
02:15:37.589 --> 02:15:37.599 align:start position:0%
that they don't get to the point of
 
02:15:40.229 --> 02:15:40.239 align:start position:0%
needing workers comp right because if if
 
02:15:41.950 --> 02:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
by having two or three consultations
 
02:15:44.510 --> 02:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
with someone in an EAP program allows
 
02:15:46.229 --> 02:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
them to work through or identify
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
strategies to avoid getting further
 
02:15:49.510 --> 02:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
through the process they're never going
 
02:15:50.549 --> 02:15:50.559 align:start position:0%
to get to the point of needing the
 
02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
workers comp the goal is to to create
 
02:15:59.430 --> 02:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:04.549 --> 02:16:04.559 align:start position:0%
level good I welome okay thank
 
02:16:07.470 --> 02:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
you representative L thank you Mr chair
 
02:16:09.709 --> 02:16:09.719 align:start position:0%
quickly to that point when you get hurt
 
02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
on a job you within 24 hours you need to
 
02:16:15.750 --> 02:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
file for workman's C immediately so
 
02:16:19.109 --> 02:16:19.119 align:start position:0%
would that now go away with this
 
02:16:21.109 --> 02:16:21.119 align:start position:0%
plan uh I don't believe that that would
 
02:16:23.709 --> 02:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
go away at all but again there's a
 
02:16:27.069 --> 02:16:27.079 align:start position:0%
a mental illness caused by trauma is
 
02:16:29.629 --> 02:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
because of repeated trauma we know that
 
02:16:31.870 --> 02:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
over the course of a career um someone
 
02:16:33.870 --> 02:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
who works as a first responder and
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
there's there are other people who are
 
02:16:36.270 --> 02:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
going to be better at testifying to this
 
02:16:39.669 --> 02:16:39.679 align:start position:0%
than I am but may see over 2,000
 
02:16:42.509 --> 02:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
individual incidents and that cumulative
 
02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
effect is what ultimately leads them to
 
02:16:48.990 --> 02:16:49.000 align:start position:0%
the the various issues or followup sorry
 
02:16:50.030 --> 02:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
I just want to make sure one's not
 
02:16:51.629 --> 02:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
replacing the other that's all no the
 
02:16:53.790 --> 02:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
goal is not to replace it's it's really
 
02:16:56.190 --> 02:16:56.200 align:start position:0%
to provide an additional layer to
 
02:16:58.110 --> 02:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
support especially our volunteers and
 
02:17:00.110 --> 02:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
those from really small communities and
 
02:17:01.709 --> 02:17:01.719 align:start position:0%
in like one of the examples about fire
 
02:17:03.110 --> 02:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
departments one of the Departments close
 
02:17:06.270 --> 02:17:06.280 align:start position:0%
to where I live has one uh fire chief
 
02:17:08.190 --> 02:17:08.200 align:start position:0%
that's a paid person for the town and
 
02:17:09.790 --> 02:17:09.800 align:start position:0%
the entire rest of the department is all
 
02:17:12.549 --> 02:17:12.559 align:start position:0%
volunteer call Firefighters we have
 
02:17:14.190 --> 02:17:14.200 align:start position:0%
another community near us that has one
 
02:17:17.230 --> 02:17:17.240 align:start position:0%
police officer for their town right when
 
02:17:19.750 --> 02:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
that police officer is off duty I guess
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
they get to get off duty at some Point
 
02:17:22.990 --> 02:17:23.000 align:start position:0%
um you know they're covered through
 
02:17:26.110 --> 02:17:26.120 align:start position:0%
mutual Aid right but what we're hearing
 
02:17:28.629 --> 02:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
over and over is just that the it's so
 
02:17:30.589 --> 02:17:30.599 align:start position:0%
hard to access any kind of care and that
 
02:17:33.870 --> 02:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
these people need a lifeline and so I
 
02:17:35.790 --> 02:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
really designed this bill to be the
 
02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:37.599 align:start position:0%
lifeline and you'll see it's not a
 
02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
partisan Bill I just want to be really
 
02:17:41.030 --> 02:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
clear um one of the people who's here to
 
02:17:43.509 --> 02:17:43.519 align:start position:0%
testify is representative Mark PR he's a
 
02:17:45.790 --> 02:17:45.800 align:start position:0%
much better expert around the area of
 
02:17:47.190 --> 02:17:47.200 align:start position:0%
First Responders that I am and we'll
 
02:17:48.349 --> 02:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
probably be able to answer a lot of
 
02:17:50.230 --> 02:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
those questions I this is not my
 
02:17:51.709 --> 02:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
professional back ground it just came
 
02:17:54.030 --> 02:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
from a place of hearing these stories
 
02:17:56.709 --> 02:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
and these pleas for support and thinking
 
02:17:58.669 --> 02:17:58.679 align:start position:0%
what can we do as legislators to give
 
02:18:01.270 --> 02:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
them the lifeline okay thank you
 
02:18:03.349 --> 02:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
representative Granger thank you Mr
 
02:18:05.950 --> 02:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
chair and thanks for taking my question
 
02:18:09.150 --> 02:18:09.160 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that this bill
 
02:18:11.190 --> 02:18:11.200 align:start position:0%
would require the hiring of a new
 
02:18:14.589 --> 02:18:14.599 align:start position:0%
employee um however and with fairness to
 
02:18:15.910 --> 02:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
the bill sponsors they couldn't have
 
02:18:17.589 --> 02:18:17.599 align:start position:0%
known that this executive order came out
 
02:18:19.629 --> 02:18:19.639 align:start position:0%
when Bill filing season was here and I I
 
02:18:21.349 --> 02:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
believe they have the best of in with
 
02:18:24.830 --> 02:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
this bill however I have here the
 
02:18:26.629 --> 02:18:26.639 align:start position:0%
executive order from the governor is
 
02:18:29.309 --> 02:18:29.319 align:start position:0%
whereas the state is facing a budget get
 
02:18:30.429 --> 02:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
into the good parts not reading the
 
02:18:31.950 --> 02:18:31.960 align:start position:0%
whole thing whereas the state is facing
 
02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
a budget deficit necess necessitating a
 
02:18:35.549 --> 02:18:35.559 align:start position:0%
recalibration of spending levels
 
02:18:37.629 --> 02:18:37.639 align:start position:0%
consistent with fiscal responsibility as
 
02:18:39.349 --> 02:18:39.359 align:start position:0%
and whereas the governor of New
 
02:18:41.110 --> 02:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is positioned to review all
 
02:18:43.150 --> 02:18:43.160 align:start position:0%
state payroll expenditures as well as to
 
02:18:44.429 --> 02:18:44.439 align:start position:0%
balance and protect the interest of the
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens of New Hampshire
 
02:18:49.070 --> 02:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
skipping a bit all full-time and
 
02:18:51.270 --> 02:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
part-time classified and classified
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
employee positions within the agencies
 
02:18:56.669 --> 02:18:56.679 align:start position:0%
of the executive branch that are vacant
 
02:18:58.270 --> 02:18:58.280 align:start position:0%
on the effective date of this order or
 
02:19:00.230 --> 02:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
that become vacant after the effective
 
02:19:01.790 --> 02:19:01.800 align:start position:0%
date of this order shall remain vacant
 
02:19:03.790 --> 02:19:03.800 align:start position:0%
unless otherwise explicitly Exempted by
 
02:19:08.070 --> 02:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
this order etc etc so this now it
 
02:19:10.509 --> 02:19:10.519 align:start position:0%
doesn't explicitly say no hiring of new
 
02:19:13.509 --> 02:19:13.519 align:start position:0%
employees but doesn't that seem to us
 
02:19:15.629 --> 02:19:15.639 align:start position:0%
that this is there's unfortunately no
 
02:19:17.429 --> 02:19:17.439 align:start position:0%
legs to this legislation with this
 
02:19:17.439 --> 02:19:21.709 align:start position:0%
legs to this legislation with this
governor

02:19:21.709 --> 02:19:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:23.150 --> 02:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that's a question
 
02:19:25.429 --> 02:19:25.439 align:start position:0%
directly for me or for the group yeah
 
02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
fair enough okay that's a good question
 
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
um what's that yeah I think it it could
 
02:19:37.190 --> 02:19:37.200 align:start position:0%
be a fiscal committee question in terms
 
02:19:40.349 --> 02:19:40.359 align:start position:0%
of how do you again we're saying is this
 
02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do the fiscal
 
02:19:43.750 --> 02:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
committee is saying can we do
 
02:19:47.429 --> 02:19:47.439 align:start position:0%
it based on the governor's guidance so
 
02:19:51.750 --> 02:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
fair enough represent McKenzie
 
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr
 
02:19:57.910 --> 02:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
chair let me let me see if I I can ask
 
02:19:59.309 --> 02:19:59.319 align:start position:0%
this question in a
 
02:20:05.710 --> 02:20:05.720 align:start position:0%
way um that you could respond so you um
 
02:20:07.630 --> 02:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
you have taken a look at kind of the
 
02:20:10.990 --> 02:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
landscape of of firefighters and small
 
02:20:14.510 --> 02:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
communities as has the sponsor so if we
 
02:20:14.520 --> 02:20:15.910 align:start position:0%
communities as has the sponsor so if we
do

02:20:15.910 --> 02:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
do
 
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
nothing uh in your professional opinion
 
02:20:19.950 --> 02:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
is somebody who has represented these
 
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
people uh now I was a Manchester
 
02:20:23.830 --> 02:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
firefighter we had access to all kinds
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
of services and even with that we had
 
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
some real tragedies within the
 
02:20:31.630 --> 02:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
Manchester fire department so if if we
 
02:20:35.070 --> 02:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
don't do something here for people who
 
02:20:39.990 --> 02:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
face um the same critical kinds of uh
 
02:20:42.590 --> 02:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
stresses as we do did professional
 
02:20:45.990 --> 02:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
full-time firefighters what what's a
 
02:20:48.990 --> 02:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
consequence uh of that to uh to our
 
02:20:51.870 --> 02:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
communities uh to those IFI
 
02:20:54.670 --> 02:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
as as a profession maybe you could apply
 
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
on first I appreciate the question you
 
02:20:58.590 --> 02:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
know my background is I'm a licensed
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
social worker and I'm also a licensed
 
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
drug and alcohol
 
02:21:06.830 --> 02:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
counselor uh certainly see uh the value
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
of trauma informed work in these areas
 
02:21:12.230 --> 02:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
of not only individuals who just need
 
02:21:14.990 --> 02:21:15.000 align:start position:0%
supports and resources but uh you know a
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
heightened level for folks who have
 
02:21:18.950 --> 02:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
exposure to trauma and multiple traumas
 
02:21:20.870 --> 02:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
in their in their journey I mean one of
 
02:21:24.630 --> 02:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
the things that is uh often thrown out
 
02:21:26.150 --> 02:21:26.160 align:start position:0%
and floated out there is that we all
 
02:21:27.990 --> 02:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
have our own individual sense of
 
02:21:31.630 --> 02:21:31.640 align:start position:0%
resiliency you know but um I I would say
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
that resiliency is something that uh
 
02:21:37.030 --> 02:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
gets built on and developed
 
02:21:38.389 --> 02:21:38.399 align:start position:0%
collaboratively and not just
 
02:21:41.030 --> 02:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
individually you know and so I think
 
02:21:43.309 --> 02:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
that folks and and you know there's
 
02:21:45.110 --> 02:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
something to be said and the research
 
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
supports this around people who are
 
02:21:49.750 --> 02:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
exposed to tra uh trauma getting support
 
02:21:52.230 --> 02:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
and resources is uh earlier in that
 
02:21:53.710 --> 02:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
process not everybody is going to have
 
02:21:56.190 --> 02:21:56.200 align:start position:0%
the same impact or Consequences from a
 
02:21:57.870 --> 02:21:57.880 align:start position:0%
traumatic event or exposure to a
 
02:21:59.910 --> 02:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
traumatic event uh but there's can
 
02:22:02.270 --> 02:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
certainly be a cumulative quality to
 
02:22:05.070 --> 02:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
that and so uh I'm I'm very much in
 
02:22:06.750 --> 02:22:06.760 align:start position:0%
favor of people having access to
 
02:22:08.910 --> 02:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
supports and resources to navigate
 
02:22:11.110 --> 02:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
challenges that could not only show up
 
02:22:13.830 --> 02:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
and impact their uh their longevity from
 
02:22:16.110 --> 02:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
that physiological standpoint but
 
02:22:19.349 --> 02:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
quality of life family relationships uh
 
02:22:21.150 --> 02:22:21.160 align:start position:0%
you know there the the rip effect of
 
02:22:22.990 --> 02:22:23.000 align:start position:0%
these kinds of experiences can be
 
02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:27.349 align:start position:0%
these kinds of experiences can be
far-reaching

02:22:27.349 --> 02:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:32.630 --> 02:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay um for another Germain question
 
02:22:34.030 --> 02:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair is this something
 
02:22:38.910 --> 02:22:38.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:42.110 --> 02:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
government I think that working uh
 
02:22:44.309 --> 02:22:44.319 align:start position:0%
creatively and collaboratively for
 
02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
providing resources can happen a lot of
 
02:22:48.429 --> 02:22:48.439 align:start position:0%
different ways I I I would say with a
 
02:22:50.150 --> 02:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
group as large as this is it's going to
 
02:22:51.750 --> 02:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
create it's going to require some
 
02:22:54.230 --> 02:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
creativity and some intentionality uh
 
02:22:55.670 --> 02:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
but I think that there are other places
 
02:22:58.910 --> 02:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
to access resources um what that plan
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
might look like I think would you know
 
02:23:02.910 --> 02:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
take some folks to sit down and try to
 
02:23:04.870 --> 02:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
Hash it out and see if it's possible I
 
02:23:06.910 --> 02:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
think that our group our state of New
 
02:23:09.950 --> 02:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire EAP the work we do with all
 
02:23:12.030 --> 02:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
state employees and their family members
 
02:23:14.349 --> 02:23:14.359 align:start position:0%
to include people who have exposure to
 
02:23:17.830 --> 02:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
imense trauma we're a um we're a
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
resource that does really uh complex
 
02:23:20.080 --> 02:23:20.950 align:start position:0%
resource that does really uh complex
work

02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:23:22.750 --> 02:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
and at a fairly low
 
02:23:24.670 --> 02:23:24.680 align:start position:0%
cost thank
 
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
you okay uh representative aval thank
 
02:23:31.070 --> 02:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so as of right now the
 
02:23:33.030 --> 02:23:33.040 align:start position:0%
state assistance EAP program only
 
02:23:35.550 --> 02:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
handles state employees and their family
 
02:23:37.389 --> 02:23:37.399 align:start position:0%
members and their family members so this
 
02:23:39.389 --> 02:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
would be follow up please this would be
 
02:23:41.710 --> 02:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
an additional task for your crew it
 
02:23:43.550 --> 02:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
would be and that's that's the real
 
02:23:45.710 --> 02:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
justification around needing an
 
02:23:49.670 --> 02:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
additional position follow last one yes
 
02:23:51.830 --> 02:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
um any other state agency states around
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
us that do the same thing for state
 
02:23:56.349 --> 02:23:56.359 align:start position:0%
employees and then public
 
02:23:58.750 --> 02:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
employees I'm not aware of them but I
 
02:24:00.990 --> 02:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
haven't looked so I I apologize I don't
 
02:24:03.630 --> 02:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
have more information to respond to that
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%

Solan actually I'm not sure who this
 
02:24:13.230 --> 02:24:13.240 align:start position:0%
question is for but it appears that
 
02:24:15.269 --> 02:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
there is a fiscal note that the
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
committee does not have are we going to
 
02:24:19.070 --> 02:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
be receiving
 
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
this we we will

has been written but we haven't received
 
02:24:32.630 --> 02:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
can you get a hold of that and send it
 
02:24:35.030 --> 02:24:35.040 align:start position:0%

02:25:13.830 --> 02:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro 15 which is
 
02:25:16.990 --> 02:25:17.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester Ward 8 a little bit about me
 
02:25:18.990 --> 02:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
I did 30 years in the city of nashor As
 
02:25:21.269 --> 02:25:21.279 align:start position:0%
A Firefighter retired as Lieutenant I'm
 
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:24.560 align:start position:0%
now a deputy chief in the town of
 
02:25:27.309 --> 02:25:27.319 align:start position:0%
eping the other reason that I'm here is
 
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
that I run the gr estate critical
 
02:25:31.030 --> 02:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
incident stress management team I've
 
02:25:34.110 --> 02:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
been doing that for almost 40 years so
 
02:25:35.790 --> 02:25:35.800 align:start position:0%
the grand estate critical inance stress
 
02:25:38.670 --> 02:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
team we respond to departments police
 
02:25:41.469 --> 02:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
Fire EMS dispatchers that have had a
 
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
critical incident we try to educate them
 
02:25:47.910 --> 02:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
about what's going to happen to them uh
 
02:25:49.990 --> 02:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
and if it does happen to them to try and
 
02:25:53.590 --> 02:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
get back to us so we can refer so this
 
02:25:56.269 --> 02:25:56.279 align:start position:0%
program that is being proposed would
 
02:26:01.510 --> 02:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:05.190 --> 02:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
that because if I can't do it and they
 
02:26:08.030 --> 02:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
may not want to come back to me and seek
 
02:26:11.030 --> 02:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
the more autonomous or
 
02:26:13.630 --> 02:26:13.640 align:start position:0%
Anonymous connection with the
 
02:26:17.550 --> 02:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
EAP right um so we're looking to refer
 
02:26:19.710 --> 02:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
and we can refer them to the EAP and if
 
02:26:21.870 --> 02:26:21.880 align:start position:0%
they have some on staff who's been
 
02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
trained to deal with emergency
 
02:26:26.710 --> 02:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
responders because we are a little bit
 
02:26:28.630 --> 02:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
different than most people right and we
 
02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
look at things differently we react to
 
02:26:32.870 --> 02:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
things differently
 
02:26:35.429 --> 02:26:35.439 align:start position:0%
So and I've been told that we scare the
 
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
crap out of some mental health
 
02:26:38.830 --> 02:26:38.840 align:start position:0%
professionals when we tell our stories
 
02:26:40.910 --> 02:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
so they really need to know who we are
 
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
what we're about and what they're going
 
02:26:43.710 --> 02:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
to hear
 
02:26:47.190 --> 02:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
right so we talked about the freeze is
 
02:26:51.030 --> 02:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
this position really important
 
02:26:53.830 --> 02:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
I truly believe it is
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
because in my experience in the state
 
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
over the last 40 years I've watched
 
02:27:00.670 --> 02:27:00.680 align:start position:0%
suicide of First
 
02:27:03.550 --> 02:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
Responders climb through the roof it's
 
02:27:05.269 --> 02:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
almost like we're in a race with the
 
02:27:07.150 --> 02:27:07.160 align:start position:0%
veterans to see who can end up on top of
 
02:27:11.469 --> 02:27:11.479 align:start position:0%
that pile unfortunately right so without
 
02:27:13.710 --> 02:27:13.720 align:start position:0%
this kind of help for
 
02:27:17.309 --> 02:27:17.319 align:start position:0%
them it's just going to get worse right
 
02:27:19.910 --> 02:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
or if they just leave the service right
 
02:27:22.269 --> 02:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
because I can't take this anymore we
 
02:27:22.279 --> 02:27:23.510 align:start position:0%
because I can't take this anymore we
talked

02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
talked
 
02:27:26.950 --> 02:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
about retention and
 
02:27:28.790 --> 02:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
recruitment but the other thing that
 
02:27:32.710 --> 02:27:32.720 align:start position:0%
walks out of that door if they leave or
 
02:27:35.950 --> 02:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
if they pass on is their
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
experience right you look at fire
 
02:27:42.269 --> 02:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
service when I started in
 
02:27:44.910 --> 02:27:44.920 align:start position:0%
1980 we had a lot of
 
02:27:48.269 --> 02:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
fires we got a lot of experience so as a
 
02:27:51.070 --> 02:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
young guy coming through the door I got
 
02:27:54.429 --> 02:27:54.439 align:start position:0%
led by seasoned officers and other
 
02:27:56.950 --> 02:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
firefighters that showed me the ropes
 
02:27:58.790 --> 02:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
and we had plenty of opportunity to do
 
02:28:01.349 --> 02:28:01.359 align:start position:0%
that we don't get that anymore fire
 
02:28:03.670 --> 02:28:03.680 align:start position:0%
prevention is working
 
02:28:05.950 --> 02:28:05.960 align:start position:0%
right I can't tell you the last time I
 
02:28:09.590 --> 02:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
went to a fire and upping I go Mutual
 
02:28:11.950 --> 02:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
Aid thank goodness right so we can keep
 
02:28:13.309 --> 02:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
our skills
 
02:28:16.710 --> 02:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
up but those guys that walk out with all
 
02:28:18.870 --> 02:28:18.880 align:start position:0%
that experience early before we're ready
 
02:28:20.830 --> 02:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
to replace them
 
02:28:25.510 --> 02:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
is killing the Departments right
 
02:28:29.790 --> 02:28:29.800 align:start position:0%
um into your question a lot of times
 
02:28:32.429 --> 02:28:32.439 align:start position:0%
when we have a bad incident we everybody
 
02:28:34.670 --> 02:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
on that incident fill out that first
 
02:28:39.269 --> 02:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
Contact form for um workers comp whether
 
02:28:42.750 --> 02:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
it gets used or not I I've also sat on
 
02:28:46.269 --> 02:28:46.279 align:start position:0%
the uh PTSD commission and we've been
 
02:28:48.990 --> 02:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
working with workers comp and they're
 
02:28:50.790 --> 02:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:28:54.030 --> 02:28:54.040 align:start position:0%
24 hours from when your reactions or
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
signs start not and sure sometimes you
 
02:29:01.190 --> 02:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
can go back to oh it was this call but
 
02:29:04.349 --> 02:29:04.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's just a collection of call
 
02:29:07.790 --> 02:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
after call after call that affects them
 
02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
right and the thing about critical
 
02:29:12.190 --> 02:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
instant stress is what affects me may
 
02:29:13.710 --> 02:29:13.720 align:start position:0%
not affect anyone else and what affects
 
02:29:16.550 --> 02:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
everyone else may not affect me because
 
02:29:18.830 --> 02:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
we all have personal baggage that we
 
02:29:22.349 --> 02:29:22.359 align:start position:0%
accumulate as we go through life and
 
02:29:24.389 --> 02:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
something insignificant as a shoe in the
 
02:29:25.750 --> 02:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
middle of the
 
02:29:28.469 --> 02:29:28.479 align:start position:0%
road wipes you out because it reminds
 
02:29:30.110 --> 02:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
you of your kids shoe or something like
 
02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
that who knows right so early
 
02:29:37.630 --> 02:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
intervention just my program alone I
 
02:29:40.830 --> 02:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
think helps quite a bit me being able to
 
02:29:44.550 --> 02:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
refer them to EAP with a trained
 
02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
professional may
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
only take a couple of conversations to
 
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
get them back on track because when
 
02:29:56.710 --> 02:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
we're in the very beginning of this
 
02:29:59.070 --> 02:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
we're not mentally ill people we're just
 
02:30:01.190 --> 02:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
someone who got our feet knocked out
 
02:30:03.590 --> 02:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
from underneath us and need coaching to
 
02:30:06.230 --> 02:30:06.240 align:start position:0%
get back on track and sometimes that's
 
02:30:09.150 --> 02:30:09.160 align:start position:0%
all it is sometimes it's more than that
 
02:30:12.190 --> 02:30:12.200 align:start position:0%
but if we can intervene very early catch
 
02:30:14.590 --> 02:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
it before it becomes PTSD and it's just
 
02:30:17.269 --> 02:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
critical incident of stress we're ahead
 
02:30:21.150 --> 02:30:21.160 align:start position:0%
of the game we're saving money right so
 
02:30:24.790 --> 02:30:24.800 align:start position:0%
hiring freeze is this position worth it
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
to save lives
 
02:30:28.150 --> 02:30:28.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely and if it doesn't get
 
02:30:31.230 --> 02:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
implemented until the freeze comes off
 
02:30:34.230 --> 02:30:34.240 align:start position:0%
at least it'll be in place ready for
 
02:30:36.710 --> 02:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
when the governor says okay we can start
 
02:30:39.950 --> 02:30:39.960 align:start position:0%
hiring again we're back we're back in
 
02:30:43.389 --> 02:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
the black right so I think we need to
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
move this forward
 
02:30:48.990 --> 02:30:49.000 align:start position:0%
uh and see where it goes and with that
 
02:30:51.389 --> 02:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
I'll take questions all right any
 
02:30:53.590 --> 02:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative Warden and then
 
02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
representa thanks for taking our
 
02:30:55.760 --> 02:30:57.630 align:start position:0%
representa thanks for taking our
question

02:30:57.630 --> 02:30:57.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:31:00.230 --> 02:31:00.240 align:start position:0%
representative when somebody is a new
 
02:31:02.590 --> 02:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
hire as a first responder I assume
 
02:31:04.269 --> 02:31:04.279 align:start position:0%
there's some sort of physical fitness
 
02:31:07.870 --> 02:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
test is there a psych eval or mental
 
02:31:09.710 --> 02:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
fitness test that's given to these
 
02:31:13.110 --> 02:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
people before they're hired so yes they
 
02:31:15.309 --> 02:31:15.319 align:start position:0%
you get a medical test uh you go through
 
02:31:19.469 --> 02:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
a physical um not sure how much on the
 
02:31:20.710 --> 02:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh mental health side I think there's
 
02:31:25.070 --> 02:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
some it's been a long time since I've
 
02:31:28.429 --> 02:31:28.439 align:start position:0%
been hired so I know definitely in the
 
02:31:30.269 --> 02:31:30.279 align:start position:0%
police there's a mental health
 
02:31:34.070 --> 02:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
evaluation uh the other piece of that is
 
02:31:37.070 --> 02:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
my training gets out to pretty much
 
02:31:40.309 --> 02:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
every firefighter in the state every EMT
 
02:31:43.230 --> 02:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
in the state and I know on the police
 
02:31:47.550 --> 02:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
side they get it as well so they're made
 
02:31:50.590 --> 02:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
aware of critical incident stress
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh what it looks like how to try to
 
02:31:55.510 --> 02:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
mitigate it on your own and and how to
 
02:31:59.269 --> 02:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
reach out when you can't follow that's
 
02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
ongoing training you provide not just in
 
02:32:04.190 --> 02:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
reaction to an incident but you give
 
02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:05.359 align:start position:0%
that training to different departments
 
02:32:08.510 --> 02:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
andol okay that's great thanks and
 
02:32:08.520 --> 02:32:10.590 align:start position:0%
andol okay that's great thanks and
represent

02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:32:14.510 --> 02:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
stop thank you Mr chairman um we talked
 
02:32:17.710 --> 02:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
a lot about firefighters and EMTs in in
 
02:32:21.630 --> 02:32:21.640 align:start position:0%
particular about fires but um what other
 
02:32:24.910 --> 02:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
kinds of trauma inducing incidents do
 
02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
firefighters and EMTs and U volunteers
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:35.790 --> 02:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
so we do probably
 
02:32:38.830 --> 02:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
75% or more
 
02:32:41.550 --> 02:32:41.560 align:start position:0%
EMS and the rest is now fir so it used
 
02:32:47.070 --> 02:32:47.080 align:start position:0%
to be the other way around so we go to
 
02:32:48.950 --> 02:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
all kinds of medical emergencies motor
 
02:32:51.349 --> 02:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
vehicle accidents that are still pretty
 
02:32:55.269 --> 02:32:55.279 align:start position:0%
horrific you've heard about I95 lately
 
02:33:00.630 --> 02:33:00.640 align:start position:0%
right and how horrific those are
 
02:33:04.269 --> 02:33:04.279 align:start position:0%
um the things I've seen over the
 
02:33:08.190 --> 02:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
years is incredible right plus you're
 
02:33:10.510 --> 02:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
going to Baby calls that don't always
 
02:33:13.230 --> 02:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
make it you're going to domestic
 
02:33:15.950 --> 02:33:15.960 align:start position:0%
violence right not only just the police
 
02:33:18.870 --> 02:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
side but we get to pick up the victims
 
02:33:21.309 --> 02:33:21.319 align:start position:0%
who got the crap beat out of them and
 
02:33:23.030 --> 02:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
you can't even recognize their face
 
02:33:25.590 --> 02:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
because they're so blatant and I'm going
 
02:33:28.150 --> 02:33:28.160 align:start position:0%
to tell you in the small town it's
 
02:33:30.150 --> 02:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
probably worse I worked in the city of
 
02:33:31.910 --> 02:33:31.920 align:start position:0%
nashar I never lived there the only
 
02:33:33.510 --> 02:33:33.520 align:start position:0%
people I knew in the city of nashar were
 
02:33:36.110 --> 02:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
fellow firefighters right so I could put
 
02:33:39.150 --> 02:33:39.160 align:start position:0%
up a pretty good wall because I didn't
 
02:33:39.160 --> 02:33:39.990 align:start position:0%
up a pretty good wall because I didn't
know

02:33:39.990 --> 02:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:33:42.630 --> 02:33:42.640 align:start position:0%
them you go to the small town you either
 
02:33:44.830 --> 02:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
know them or you're related to
 
02:33:47.349 --> 02:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
them right
 
02:33:51.070 --> 02:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
so the worst thing I think
 
02:33:53.910 --> 02:33:53.920 align:start position:0%
is going to do CPR on your mom because
 
02:33:56.389 --> 02:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
you're the closest one there and you're
 
02:33:58.269 --> 02:33:58.279 align:start position:0%
waiting for the rest of the crew to come
 
02:34:00.790 --> 02:34:00.800 align:start position:0%
so you can stop doing it and get out of
 
02:34:06.349 --> 02:34:06.359 align:start position:0%
the room but nope I'm there right um I I
 
02:34:09.030 --> 02:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:12.389 --> 02:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
incident this firefighter went to the
 
02:34:15.870 --> 02:34:15.880 align:start position:0%
crash was working on the guy he got
 
02:34:18.309 --> 02:34:18.319 align:start position:0%
ejected from the car and he's working
 
02:34:20.110 --> 02:34:20.120 align:start position:0%
and he looks up and he sees the license
 
02:34:21.269 --> 02:34:21.279 align:start position:0%
plate and
 
02:34:26.389 --> 02:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:28.910 --> 02:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
brother he had no idea because his brain
 
02:34:32.070 --> 02:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
just said don't recognize that you you
 
02:34:35.269 --> 02:34:35.279 align:start position:0%
need you need to work don't recognize it
 
02:34:36.990 --> 02:34:37.000 align:start position:0%
and as soon as he saw the plate he goes
 
02:34:41.070 --> 02:34:41.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:44.309 --> 02:34:44.319 align:start position:0%
out so those are the things that are
 
02:34:47.349 --> 02:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
happening out there
 
02:34:50.710 --> 02:34:50.720 align:start position:0%
um drunk drivers are up there they're
 
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
killing people left and right drunk
 
02:34:55.389 --> 02:34:55.399 align:start position:0%
drivers don't drive
 
02:34:58.190 --> 02:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
slow okay represent
 
02:35:00.590 --> 02:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
McKenzie I'll ask a just a quick
 
02:35:03.429 --> 02:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
question you're out of nashal I used to
 
02:35:05.790 --> 02:35:05.800 align:start position:0%
be yeah I come out of Manchester so when
 
02:35:07.870 --> 02:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
we go back to the firehouses five six
 
02:35:10.230 --> 02:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
seven eight 10 people there if you go to
 
02:35:12.309 --> 02:35:12.319 align:start position:0%
a little town like your town now that
 
02:35:15.230 --> 02:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
you're a deputy chief of or a number of
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
communities uh have one firefighter on
 
02:35:20.190 --> 02:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
duty or none so they
 
02:35:22.630 --> 02:35:22.640 align:start position:0%
dispersed there's a difference correct
 
02:35:26.309 --> 02:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
when you look at that support system oh
 
02:35:26.319 --> 02:35:27.910 align:start position:0%
when you look at that support system oh
absolutely

02:35:27.910 --> 02:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
um it used to be funny because back in
 
02:35:32.790 --> 02:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
the day there was a lot of stigma to
 
02:35:36.710 --> 02:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
this it's falling off quite a bit but it
 
02:35:38.309 --> 02:35:38.319 align:start position:0%
would be funny we'd come back from a bad
 
02:35:39.630 --> 02:35:39.640 align:start position:0%
call we'd all be sitting around the
 
02:35:41.710 --> 02:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
table drinking a cup of
 
02:35:44.870 --> 02:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
coffee I would be debriefing them and
 
02:35:46.870 --> 02:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
they had no idea what I was
 
02:35:49.389 --> 02:35:49.399 align:start position:0%
doing right yeah don't give me any of
 
02:35:51.309 --> 02:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
that stuff that you do I'm all set with
 
02:35:56.309 --> 02:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
that okay right but if if and like he
 
02:35:58.550 --> 02:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
said in the small
 
02:36:01.630 --> 02:36:01.640 align:start position:0%
town you pack up and you go home you bu
 
02:36:04.389 --> 02:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
Yourself by yourself and I'm going to
 
02:36:06.750 --> 02:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
tell you one of the
 
02:36:11.830 --> 02:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
biggest Rising population of of suicide
 
02:36:11.840 --> 02:36:13.910 align:start position:0%
biggest Rising population of of suicide
is

02:36:13.910 --> 02:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:36:16.429 --> 02:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
retirees right I look at my life in in
 
02:36:19.309 --> 02:36:19.319 align:start position:0%
nashar I spent onethird of my life or
 
02:36:19.319 --> 02:36:20.510 align:start position:0%
nashar I spent onethird of my life or
more

02:36:20.510 --> 02:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:36:22.550 --> 02:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
more with a
 
02:36:25.070 --> 02:36:25.080 align:start position:0%
family that maybe I like better than my
 
02:36:28.950 --> 02:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
other family right because when I had a
 
02:36:31.790 --> 02:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
bad day A bad call I could talk to them
 
02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:39.269 --> 02:36:39.279 align:start position:0%
experienced I walked out I retired from
 
02:36:41.790 --> 02:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
NASA got up in the morning I was no
 
02:36:44.349 --> 02:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
longer Lieutenant PR I was Mark
 
02:36:46.670 --> 02:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
Pro I no longer had those friends I
 
02:36:50.790 --> 02:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:53.550 --> 02:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
now I have nobody that I can reach out
 
02:36:56.670 --> 02:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
on on a weekly basis daily basis I still
 
02:37:00.070 --> 02:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
keep in contact with some of them but
 
02:37:01.670 --> 02:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
those years that I wasn't in the fire
 
02:37:05.150 --> 02:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
service it's pretty hard and and luckily
 
02:37:08.429 --> 02:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
I do this so I knew and when I was
 
02:37:10.389 --> 02:37:10.399 align:start position:0%
having trouble I could reach out to
 
02:37:13.670 --> 02:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
people in my circle to
 
02:37:17.870 --> 02:37:17.880 align:start position:0%
get what I needed not everybody is that
 
02:37:20.630 --> 02:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
lucky especially in a small department
 
02:37:23.510 --> 02:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
they have nobody to reach out to and
 
02:37:25.070 --> 02:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes in that smaller Department the
 
02:37:28.510 --> 02:37:28.520 align:start position:0%
stigma is still there so sorry okay
 
02:37:31.110 --> 02:37:31.120 align:start position:0%
trying to be short but no no thanks so
 
02:37:36.190 --> 02:37:36.200 align:start position:0%

02:37:58.640 --> 02:38:03.110 align:start position:0%
 
issue

02:38:03.110 --> 02:38:03.120 align:start position:0%

representative H Damon I serve half of
 
02:38:12.590 --> 02:38:12.600 align:start position:0%
Sullivan County aworth langon lemster
 
02:38:15.510 --> 02:38:15.520 align:start position:0%
Goan Washington Springfield sunap my
 
02:38:17.830 --> 02:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
hometown of Cen and the City of
 
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
Claremont um and Brian Sullivan has been
 
02:38:22.110 --> 02:38:22.120 align:start position:0%
telling me for the last two and a half
 
02:38:24.070 --> 02:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
years that this is the best committee so
 
02:38:25.670 --> 02:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
I just need to acknowledge that I've
 
02:38:27.630 --> 02:38:27.640 align:start position:0%
never spoken before
 
02:38:30.670 --> 02:38:30.680 align:start position:0%
you so I am in fact here in support of
 
02:38:33.269 --> 02:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
this bill of those nine towns that I
 
02:38:36.150 --> 02:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
represent eight of them either have
 
02:38:39.150 --> 02:38:39.160 align:start position:0%
entirely volunteer first responder
 
02:38:43.190 --> 02:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
services or less than five one only one
 
02:38:46.070 --> 02:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
has uh full paid
 
02:38:48.429 --> 02:38:48.439 align:start position:0%
staff I think we're all very grateful to
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
the many First Responders who put their
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
lives on the line for our communities
 
02:38:54.670 --> 02:38:54.680 align:start position:0%
the toll on their well-being can be
 
02:38:57.110 --> 02:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
substantial and the more times that a
 
02:38:59.830 --> 02:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
person is exposed to trauma the greater
 
02:39:02.830 --> 02:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
the likelihood that they develop
 
02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
PTSD the studies that I looked at show a
 
02:39:09.590 --> 02:39:09.600 align:start position:0%
10 to 35% incidence of PTSD I think I
 
02:39:11.190 --> 02:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
just lost power okay I'm just going to
 
02:39:14.110 --> 02:39:14.120 align:start position:0%
tell you what it says um 10 to 35%
 
02:39:16.550 --> 02:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
incidents of PTSD in First
 
02:39:18.910 --> 02:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
Responders listening to representative
 
02:39:22.349 --> 02:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
PLS remarks I was reminded of a loss in
 
02:39:26.389 --> 02:39:26.399 align:start position:0%
cipe within the last four or 5
 
02:39:29.349 --> 02:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
years a young woman 22 years old coming
 
02:39:33.309 --> 02:39:33.319 align:start position:0%
home from her first post colle job in a
 
02:39:35.230 --> 02:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
really freaky year in the wrong place at
 
02:39:37.710 --> 02:39:37.720 align:start position:0%
the wrong time accident a tree fell down
 
02:39:40.349 --> 02:39:40.359 align:start position:0%
on her car her moving car and she died
 
02:39:43.590 --> 02:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
on the spot and the first first
 
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
responder when it was called in by a
 
02:39:48.990 --> 02:39:49.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle behind her was her lifetime best
 
02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:50.550 align:start position:0%
vehicle behind her was her lifetime best
friend

02:39:50.550 --> 02:39:50.560 align:start position:0%
friend
 
02:39:52.150 --> 02:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
her dad's the principal of the high
 
02:39:54.870 --> 02:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
school in centi to this day I cannot
 
02:39:57.790 --> 02:39:57.800 align:start position:0%
imagine being that young woman coming on
 
02:40:00.070 --> 02:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
the scene of her best
 
02:40:03.830 --> 02:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
friend and having to deal with that we
 
02:40:06.230 --> 02:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
know that when you treat
 
02:40:08.670 --> 02:40:08.680 align:start position:0%
PTSD um when you initiate treatment
 
02:40:12.429 --> 02:40:12.439 align:start position:0%
early it's much more successful and so
 
02:40:13.990 --> 02:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
the remarks that I was hearing about the
 
02:40:15.710 --> 02:40:15.720 align:start position:0%
concerns of
 
02:40:17.750 --> 02:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
increasing likelihood of workman's
 
02:40:19.349 --> 02:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
compensation claims it's actually the
 
02:40:20.950 --> 02:40:20.960 align:start position:0%
the opposite of that if you look up the
 
02:40:23.230 --> 02:40:23.240 align:start position:0%
data for EAP programs they decrease
 
02:40:25.389 --> 02:40:25.399 align:start position:0%
workman's comp costs not
 
02:40:25.399 --> 02:40:27.349 align:start position:0%
workman's comp costs not
increase

02:40:27.349 --> 02:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:40:30.670 --> 02:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
um and now I'm having a brain cramp and
 
02:40:32.030 --> 02:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
you know the power cord is down in
 
02:40:35.750 --> 02:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
education funding um I will just say
 
02:40:38.750 --> 02:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
that I very vigorously support this bill
 
02:40:41.349 --> 02:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
I think it is critically important that
 
02:40:44.309 --> 02:40:44.319 align:start position:0%
we keep adequate Staffing throughout our
 
02:40:47.150 --> 02:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
districts for First Responders and that
 
02:40:48.790 --> 02:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
reminds me of the remaining piece in
 
02:40:48.800 --> 02:40:50.110 align:start position:0%
reminds me of the remaining piece in
convers

02:40:50.110 --> 02:40:50.120 align:start position:0%
convers
 
02:40:52.469 --> 02:40:52.479 align:start position:0%
with several Fire Chiefs in my district
 
02:40:54.389 --> 02:40:54.399 align:start position:0%
in particular with the Springfield Fire
 
02:40:58.110 --> 02:40:58.120 align:start position:0%
Chief who is very experienced he notes
 
02:41:00.309 --> 02:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
the difficulty of retaining people when
 
02:41:03.349 --> 02:41:03.359 align:start position:0%
the level of stress leads to unhealthy
 
02:41:05.269 --> 02:41:05.279 align:start position:0%
behaviors and relationship struggles
 
02:41:07.750 --> 02:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
because they're not addressing the
 
02:41:10.510 --> 02:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
trauma and the stress in a timely and
 
02:41:13.030 --> 02:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
effective way this could really help
 
02:41:16.030 --> 02:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
retain people who want to stay on the
 
02:41:19.389 --> 02:41:19.399 align:start position:0%
force but need to be well so thank thank

appreciate your

patience um I'm opening the hearing on
 
03:13:44.670 --> 03:13:44.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 299 FN seeing that we have a
 
03:13:47.110 --> 03:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
quorum it's an act relative to the
 
03:13:49.870 --> 03:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
reward of attorney's fees and costs in
 
03:13:53.269 --> 03:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
workers compensation claims and
 
03:13:55.070 --> 03:13:55.080 align:start position:0%
representative uh Pearson are you
 
03:13:57.229 --> 03:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill please we'd like
 
03:14:02.269 --> 03:14:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:04.389 --> 03:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:14:06.990 --> 03:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to sit in the big seat
 
03:14:11.670 --> 03:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:13.790 --> 03:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
rooms my name is Representative Steve
 
03:14:15.429 --> 03:14:15.439 align:start position:0%
Pearson Rockingham District 13 which
 
03:14:17.630 --> 03:14:17.640 align:start position:0%
encompasses Dairy
 
03:14:18.950 --> 03:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
and what I bring before you today is
 
03:14:21.630 --> 03:14:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:26.389 --> 03:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
299 the premise of 299 involves workers
 
03:14:29.510 --> 03:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
compensation and
 
03:14:32.070 --> 03:14:32.080 align:start position:0%
the responsibility financial
 
03:14:36.429 --> 03:14:36.439 align:start position:0%
responsibility when it comes to a
 
03:14:39.750 --> 03:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
positive litigation
 
03:14:41.790 --> 03:14:41.800 align:start position:0%
outcome so one of the things that I do
 
03:14:44.309 --> 03:14:44.319 align:start position:0%
for the legislature is I also I'm the
 
03:14:46.550 --> 03:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
vice chair of the PTSD commission I have
 
03:14:49.510 --> 03:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
been for or a couple of terms now and
 
03:14:52.910 --> 03:14:52.920 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we've learned um
 
03:14:57.309 --> 03:14:57.319 align:start position:0%
sadly is in workers compensation
 
03:14:59.150 --> 03:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
events there's a couple things that
 
03:15:00.910 --> 03:15:00.920 align:start position:0%
occur the first one being everybody gets
 
03:15:03.950 --> 03:15:03.960 align:start position:0%
that Dreadful denial letter within the
 
03:15:09.070 --> 03:15:09.080 align:start position:0%
first 30 days as a procedural move um
 
03:15:10.910 --> 03:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
partially due to the limitations that
 
03:15:15.630 --> 03:15:15.640 align:start position:0%
the law puts on insurance companies to
 
03:15:17.990 --> 03:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
make contact with
 
03:15:19.110 --> 03:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
someone who filed the workers's
 
03:15:22.150 --> 03:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
compensation claim um but the other
 
03:15:24.830 --> 03:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
thing is is that
 
03:15:28.189 --> 03:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
when you're perceived to be AG grieved
 
03:15:31.510 --> 03:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
right if you are injured or or worse if
 
03:15:32.950 --> 03:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
you know dismembered or anything on the
 
03:15:34.429 --> 03:15:34.439 align:start position:0%
job and you go through the workers's
 
03:15:37.269 --> 03:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
compensation process a lot of times you
 
03:15:40.990 --> 03:15:41.000 align:start position:0%
have to fight for your
 
03:15:43.870 --> 03:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
right to that
 
03:15:47.070 --> 03:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
claim the battle that which occurs there
 
03:15:49.269 --> 03:15:49.279 align:start position:0%
is is extraordinarily one-sided as you
 
03:15:51.790 --> 03:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
would imagine right so you
 
03:15:55.429 --> 03:15:55.439 align:start position:0%
have a worker who's already hurt who now
 
03:15:58.790 --> 03:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
has to engage in a legal action against
 
03:16:00.990 --> 03:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
either a corporation or municipality or
 
03:16:04.710 --> 03:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
or an entity such as that so what this
 
03:16:08.830 --> 03:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
says is that you would be entitled to
 
03:16:11.469 --> 03:16:11.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of those
 
03:16:14.070 --> 03:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
costs now I have before you that I
 
03:16:16.429 --> 03:16:16.439 align:start position:0%
believe was passed out the an amendment
 
03:16:17.630 --> 03:16:17.640 align:start position:0%
to this
 
03:16:21.269 --> 03:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
the amendment adds three or excuse me
 
03:16:24.630 --> 03:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
four words to the bill um it was done so
 
03:16:27.229 --> 03:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
at the request of the
 
03:16:29.710 --> 03:16:29.720 align:start position:0%
methodology of the bill on the
 
03:16:31.830 --> 03:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
methodology near the bottom it says the
 
03:16:33.710 --> 03:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
department notes the language does not
 
03:16:36.229 --> 03:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
specify whom is responsible for
 
03:16:38.110 --> 03:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement reasonable Council fees
 
03:16:38.120 --> 03:16:39.110 align:start position:0%
reimbursement reasonable Council fees
and

03:16:39.110 --> 03:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:16:42.910 --> 03:16:42.920 align:start position:0%
costs taking a note of that we clean
 
03:16:42.920 --> 03:16:43.670 align:start position:0%
costs taking a note of that we clean
that

03:16:43.670 --> 03:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:16:47.189 --> 03:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
up so I I'm I believe the method ology
 
03:16:49.510 --> 03:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
was done by the Department of Labor so
 
03:16:54.469 --> 03:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:58.110 --> 03:16:58.120 align:start position:0%
who as to who is responsible that that
 
03:17:00.830 --> 03:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
is the impetus of the amendment and why
 
03:17:02.550 --> 03:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
it was was brought forward at that
 
03:17:06.030 --> 03:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
request so getting again getting back to
 
03:17:08.590 --> 03:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
the the substance of of why this why
 
03:17:12.630 --> 03:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
this exists you know
 
03:17:14.710 --> 03:17:14.720 align:start position:0%
specifically with the experiences we had
 
03:17:17.990 --> 03:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
on the PTSD commission and just the the
 
03:17:20.150 --> 03:17:20.160 align:start position:0%
amazing battle that people have to go
 
03:17:23.030 --> 03:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
through for
 
03:17:25.830 --> 03:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
something that can be extraordinarily
 
03:17:28.070 --> 03:17:28.080 align:start position:0%
financially taxing right and there's a
 
03:17:30.150 --> 03:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
lot of people that just frankly give up
 
03:17:31.830 --> 03:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
because they don't have the means or
 
03:17:35.110 --> 03:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
they're not willing to risk the means to
 
03:17:39.389 --> 03:17:39.399 align:start position:0%
fight for what they believe is right so
 
03:17:41.870 --> 03:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
that is where this comes from
 
03:17:44.950 --> 03:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
and um we we're fortunate to have a a
 
03:17:48.349 --> 03:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
well-respected um workers comp attorney
 
03:17:50.309 --> 03:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
with us today who also sits on the PTSD
 
03:17:52.309 --> 03:17:52.319 align:start position:0%
commission that I'm sure will be able to
 
03:17:54.070 --> 03:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
answer technical aspects of this that I
 
03:17:54.080 --> 03:17:55.110 align:start position:0%
answer technical aspects of this that I
certainly

03:17:55.110 --> 03:17:55.120 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
03:17:57.950 --> 03:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
cannot okay thank you thank you for
 
03:18:00.389 --> 03:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill are there any
 
03:18:04.550 --> 03:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:06.710 --> 03:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
committee saying none thank you sir I

03:18:27.110 --> 03:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair honorable
 
03:18:28.710 --> 03:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record

my name is Brian will um still the
 
03:18:32.070 --> 03:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
president of the professional
 
03:18:33.710 --> 03:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
firefighters of New Hampshire uh thank
 
03:18:35.349 --> 03:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
you for allowing me uh once again the
 
03:18:37.910 --> 03:18:37.920 align:start position:0%

in or this afternoon in favor of House
Bill

03:18:40.990 --> 03:18:41.000 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:18:44.750 --> 03:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
299 um I represent approximately 2,000
 
03:18:46.349 --> 03:18:46.359 align:start position:0%
active and retired firefighters across
 
03:18:48.150 --> 03:18:48.160 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire uh which is
 
03:18:49.790 --> 03:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
an inherently dangerous profession as we
 
03:18:51.830 --> 03:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
are all aware uh and I believe that our
 
03:18:53.630 --> 03:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
states our cities and our towns have an
 
03:18:55.870 --> 03:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
obligation to protect those uh that
 
03:18:59.110 --> 03:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
provide this very um dangerous public
 
03:19:02.229 --> 03:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
service what we find in the fire service
 
03:19:05.830 --> 03:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
is um claims are often workers comp
 
03:19:08.830 --> 03:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
claims are often routinely denied um
 
03:19:10.110 --> 03:19:10.120 align:start position:0%
thanks to the explanation that
 
03:19:12.750 --> 03:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson provided um a lot
 
03:19:14.830 --> 03:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
of the reason for this some in some
 
03:19:18.830 --> 03:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
cases is to satisfy a um part of the law
 
03:19:20.590 --> 03:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
which requires there needs to be a
 
03:19:24.750 --> 03:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
response or a claim paid within 21 days
 
03:19:24.760 --> 03:19:26.070 align:start position:0%
response or a claim paid within 21 days
of

03:19:26.070 --> 03:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:19:28.870 --> 03:19:28.880 align:start position:0%
filing in many cases what this does with
 
03:19:31.750 --> 03:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
our members is they see their claims
 
03:19:34.269 --> 03:19:34.279 align:start position:0%
routinely denied um because quite
 
03:19:39.030 --> 03:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
frankly there is no reason to not do so
 
03:19:41.429 --> 03:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
um from an insurance company's
 
03:19:44.429 --> 03:19:44.439 align:start position:0%
standpoint there is no obligation to pay
 
03:19:46.429 --> 03:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
a claim at the first level and quite
 
03:19:48.269 --> 03:19:48.279 align:start position:0%
Frank frankly we see more and more of
 
03:19:51.030 --> 03:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
our claims becoming routinely denied um
 
03:19:54.429 --> 03:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
because there is no downside um if if
 
03:19:56.590 --> 03:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
you're the one that's paying out the
 
03:20:00.630 --> 03:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
claim so our members then in order to
 
03:20:04.309 --> 03:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
further fight this need to file a uh for
 
03:20:07.189 --> 03:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
a first level Hearing in order to get a
 
03:20:08.870 --> 03:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
ruling from the Department as to whether
 
03:20:11.670 --> 03:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
or not their claim would be approved um
 
03:20:13.150 --> 03:20:13.160 align:start position:0%
in many cases we're finding that our
 
03:20:15.469 --> 03:20:15.479 align:start position:0%
members choose not to do so because of
 
03:20:16.910 --> 03:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
the financial burden there are
 
03:20:18.269 --> 03:20:18.279 align:start position:0%
experiencing by being out with a
 
03:20:21.150 --> 03:20:21.160 align:start position:0%
work-related injury uh and they're only
 
03:20:24.030 --> 03:20:24.040 align:start position:0%
uh they're only potentially either
 
03:20:28.870 --> 03:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
receiving um whatever savings they have
 
03:20:30.870 --> 03:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
um or getting paid from their earned
 
03:20:32.710 --> 03:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
time or their disability leave they
 
03:20:36.110 --> 03:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
don't have the funds to then go um get
 
03:20:39.150 --> 03:20:39.160 align:start position:0%
legal counsel to fight this claim so in
 
03:20:41.070 --> 03:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
many cases they're not doing so adding
 
03:20:43.229 --> 03:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
to U what is already a traumatic
 
03:20:45.630 --> 03:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
situation for them in the
 
03:20:49.790 --> 03:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
moment should they get denied uh upon a
 
03:20:51.910 --> 03:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
department level hearing and they appeal
 
03:20:54.670 --> 03:20:54.680 align:start position:0%
this and they win on the appeal their
 
03:20:56.830 --> 03:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
claims are then covered the attorney's
 
03:20:58.950 --> 03:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
fees can then be covered um by the
 
03:21:00.750 --> 03:21:00.760 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier but it is not until
 
03:21:02.870 --> 03:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
such time that they were to appeal the
 
03:21:06.189 --> 03:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
Department's uh ruling and be successful
 
03:21:08.070 --> 03:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
that those claims would be denied all
 
03:21:11.229 --> 03:21:11.239 align:start position:0%
this bill does is it bumps up the uh
 
03:21:13.550 --> 03:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
compensation for those attorney fees by
 
03:21:16.830 --> 03:21:16.840 align:start position:0%
one step um so it's already in existence
 
03:21:18.309 --> 03:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to bump it up by one
 
03:21:22.030 --> 03:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
step in hopes that this will um avoid
 
03:21:25.349 --> 03:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
future frivolous denials um for our
 
03:21:28.269 --> 03:21:28.279 align:start position:0%
members so it's just a um in practice
 
03:21:29.990 --> 03:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to protect our members
 
03:21:33.189 --> 03:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
allow them the opportunity to um to have
 
03:21:35.269 --> 03:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
full representation when they file a
 
03:21:37.389 --> 03:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
claim for an occupational related injury
 
03:21:39.910 --> 03:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
or illness U with that I would uh
 
03:21:41.349 --> 03:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions that I might be
 
03:21:42.269 --> 03:21:42.279 align:start position:0%
able to
 
03:21:45.309 --> 03:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
answer may not be many but represent
 
03:21:45.319 --> 03:21:47.229 align:start position:0%
answer may not be many but represent
labr

03:21:47.229 --> 03:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
labr
 
03:21:48.910 --> 03:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair most likely I have
 
03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
this wrong so humor me let's just walk
 
03:21:53.429 --> 03:21:53.439 align:start position:0%
through it together as an example I have
 
03:21:54.910 --> 03:21:54.920 align:start position:0%
a guy that gets hurt on the
 
03:21:57.469 --> 03:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
job uh he's out of work he files his
 
03:22:00.389 --> 03:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
claim maybe it's a $1,000
 
03:22:03.950 --> 03:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
claim it gets rejected goes to to do
 
03:22:07.349 --> 03:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
gets rejected then he appeals
 
03:22:10.030 --> 03:22:10.040 align:start position:0%
it after battling back and forth with
 
03:22:11.550 --> 03:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
them they approve
 
03:22:14.389 --> 03:22:14.399 align:start position:0%
it you said the insurance
 
03:22:17.189 --> 03:22:17.199 align:start position:0%
carrier my insurance carrier
 
03:22:19.670 --> 03:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
pays the freight on that so the the
 
03:22:22.670 --> 03:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
workers comp insurance carrier that
 
03:22:25.229 --> 03:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
initially denied the claim which would
 
03:22:29.349 --> 03:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
be mine yeah would then if they denied
 
03:22:31.630 --> 03:22:31.640 align:start position:0%
my claim or your claim in this instance
 
03:22:35.150 --> 03:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
is the injured employee um yes they
 
03:22:36.790 --> 03:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
would be the ones responsible for those
 
03:22:38.710 --> 03:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees at that level to my
 
03:22:40.670 --> 03:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
knowledge and if attorney oconor knows
 
03:22:42.710 --> 03:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
differently than I'm going to let the
 
03:22:43.910 --> 03:22:43.920 align:start position:0%
conversation develop a little bit I have
 
03:22:46.670 --> 03:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
some more questions but let's let it
 
03:22:50.670 --> 03:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
oil yeah thanks any other questions
 
03:22:50.680 --> 03:22:52.030 align:start position:0%
oil yeah thanks any other questions
representative

03:22:52.030 --> 03:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:22:56.030 --> 03:22:56.040 align:start position:0%
Sullivan oops you uh mentioned that the
 
03:23:00.030 --> 03:23:00.040 align:start position:0%
um um if the department uh denies the
 
03:23:02.910 --> 03:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
claim and it gets appealed that the
 
03:23:05.030 --> 03:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
attorney's fees for those that appeal
 
03:23:08.189 --> 03:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
would be covered under current law um
 
03:23:10.309 --> 03:23:10.319 align:start position:0%
who pays for that those attorney fees is
 
03:23:12.110 --> 03:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
that the insurance company I believe
 
03:23:14.910 --> 03:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
currently is the insurance company yeah
 
03:23:17.630 --> 03:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
and so this simply means that if the uh
 
03:23:19.990 --> 03:23:20.000 align:start position:0%
insurance company denies the claim and
 
03:23:22.110 --> 03:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
you go to the department the department
 
03:23:25.870 --> 03:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh approves the claim those um any
 
03:23:28.429 --> 03:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
attorney fees at the department would
 
03:23:31.670 --> 03:23:31.680 align:start position:0%
also be covered by the um the insurance
 
03:23:35.550 --> 03:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
company for the employees uh attorneys
 
03:23:38.030 --> 03:23:38.040 align:start position:0%
fees not for anything that the that the
 
03:23:42.349 --> 03:23:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:44.550 --> 03:23:44.560 align:start position:0%

03:24:50.389 --> 03:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
behalf of two uh Insurance
 
03:24:54.349 --> 03:24:54.359 align:start position:0%
clients uh one is the American uh
 
03:24:56.590 --> 03:24:56.600 align:start position:0%
property Casualty Insurance Association
 
03:24:58.110 --> 03:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
I've just handed out their written
 
03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
testimony and I won't repeat what they
 
03:25:05.150 --> 03:25:05.160 align:start position:0%
have to say uh our second client is uh
 
03:25:07.590 --> 03:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
the uh New Hampshire Association of
 
03:25:11.870 --> 03:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
domestic insurance companies and um
 
03:25:14.429 --> 03:25:14.439 align:start position:0%
together uh these clients
 
03:25:17.990 --> 03:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
represent uh most of the workers comp
 
03:25:22.030 --> 03:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
insurance that is written in in our
 
03:25:24.590 --> 03:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
state we oppose this
 
03:25:28.389 --> 03:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
bill I don't think that the uh
 
03:25:31.070 --> 03:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
proponents of the bill uh give enough
 
03:25:33.710 --> 03:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
credit to the hearing officers at the
 
03:25:35.870 --> 03:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
insurance department and I mean at the
 
03:25:38.349 --> 03:25:38.359 align:start position:0%
uh labor department and and the job that
 
03:25:42.510 --> 03:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
they do these are skilled experienced uh
 
03:25:45.590 --> 03:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
people who hear these cases day in and
 
03:25:46.950 --> 03:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
day out
 
03:25:50.429 --> 03:25:50.439 align:start position:0%
and they look favorably upon I think
 
03:25:52.950 --> 03:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's there's General agreement within
 
03:25:55.830 --> 03:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
the uh workers comp community that their
 
03:25:58.790 --> 03:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
decisions are fair uh and balanced
 
03:26:01.910 --> 03:26:01.920 align:start position:0%
there's going to be uh a view on the
 
03:26:05.309 --> 03:26:05.319 align:start position:0%
part of one side or the other that that
 
03:26:08.389 --> 03:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
uh uh decisions are not always correct
 
03:26:10.910 --> 03:26:10.920 align:start position:0%
but they do they do a very good job and
 
03:26:14.389 --> 03:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
they have in my view for many many years
 
03:26:18.229 --> 03:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
at determining whether the injury that
 
03:26:20.910 --> 03:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
is work rated number one and whether
 
03:26:22.750 --> 03:26:22.760 align:start position:0%
it's disabling those those are the
 
03:26:24.710 --> 03:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
questions before the hearing
 
03:26:27.790 --> 03:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
officers this system was designed to
 
03:26:30.510 --> 03:26:30.520 align:start position:0%
make it unnecessary to have legal
 
03:26:35.950 --> 03:26:35.960 align:start position:0%
council represent either party um
 
03:26:38.790 --> 03:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
and it's designed to be an informal
 
03:26:42.790 --> 03:26:42.800 align:start position:0%
process and an exped expedited uh
 
03:26:45.030 --> 03:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
process uh The Rules of Evidence don't
 
03:26:47.950 --> 03:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
apply so there are medical reports that
 
03:26:52.469 --> 03:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
are introduced into evidence and these
 
03:26:55.750 --> 03:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
adjudications generally uh resolve
 
03:26:57.309 --> 03:26:57.319 align:start position:0%
matters I think the labor department
 
03:26:59.870 --> 03:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
would have statistics uh more current
 
03:27:02.189 --> 03:27:02.199 align:start position:0%
than anything I have but I think that
 
03:27:05.150 --> 03:27:05.160 align:start position:0%
there are is a sort of an equal uh
 
03:27:08.870 --> 03:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
division between successful uh workers
 
03:27:11.550 --> 03:27:11.560 align:start position:0%
comp claims and and those that are not
 
03:27:13.110 --> 03:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
and then as has been
 
03:27:14.910 --> 03:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh
 
03:27:17.710 --> 03:27:17.720 align:start position:0%
if uh if there's an appeal by either
 
03:27:20.030 --> 03:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
party that appeal is taken to the
 
03:27:22.910 --> 03:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
workers compensation appeals board that
 
03:27:25.790 --> 03:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
board has three members uh it's chaired
 
03:27:27.750 --> 03:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
by an attorney that's a member of the
 
03:27:30.630 --> 03:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
appeals panel uh and then there's a
 
03:27:32.510 --> 03:27:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative of Labor and a
 
03:27:34.670 --> 03:27:34.680 align:start position:0%
representative of employers and those
 
03:27:37.630 --> 03:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
three hear the appeals and if the
 
03:27:38.870 --> 03:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
claimant is
 
03:27:42.070 --> 03:27:42.080 align:start position:0%
successful uh the attorney's fees and
 
03:27:45.150 --> 03:27:45.160 align:start position:0%
costs of that appeal are paid for by the
 
03:27:47.870 --> 03:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
employer or the insurance company but
 
03:27:50.429 --> 03:27:50.439 align:start position:0%
ultimately the employer pays what
 
03:27:51.910 --> 03:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
whatever costs we're talking about are
 
03:27:54.229 --> 03:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
born by the employer who pays the
 
03:27:57.950 --> 03:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
workers compensation premium so we think
 
03:28:00.550 --> 03:28:00.560 align:start position:0%
the current system uh works
 
03:28:04.349 --> 03:28:04.359 align:start position:0%
well uh and that uh the interjection of
 
03:28:07.229 --> 03:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
encouraging lawyers to participate at
 
03:28:09.670 --> 03:28:09.680 align:start position:0%
the hearings level uh would not be
 
03:28:13.550 --> 03:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the public or to Employers
 
03:28:17.030 --> 03:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
in this state thank you Mr chairman
 
03:28:18.429 --> 03:28:18.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for your testimony do we
 
03:28:20.630 --> 03:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
have any questions representative kale
 
03:28:22.710 --> 03:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
03:28:25.309 --> 03:28:25.319 align:start position:0%
russos just to be clear when you say the
 
03:28:28.510 --> 03:28:28.520 align:start position:0%
cost is born uh by in the premiums those
 
03:28:30.590 --> 03:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
are spread out across everyone buying
 
03:28:33.309 --> 03:28:33.319 align:start position:0%
Insurance in in this market is there a
 
03:28:36.309 --> 03:28:36.319 align:start position:0%
higher uh is there like a a score you
 
03:28:39.670 --> 03:28:39.680 align:start position:0%
keep of how many the particular employer
 
03:28:41.950 --> 03:28:41.960 align:start position:0%
racks up does that does that affect
 
03:28:44.070 --> 03:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
their uh premiums I would expect it
 
03:28:48.110 --> 03:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
might premium sor based represent kahill
 
03:28:51.309 --> 03:28:51.319 align:start position:0%
on primarily on the classification of
 
03:28:54.550 --> 03:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
the workers of the of the employer uh
 
03:28:57.830 --> 03:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
but also upon the uh work the loss
 
03:29:00.630 --> 03:29:00.640 align:start position:0%
experience of each particular employer
 
03:29:03.710 --> 03:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
so uh that would affect the uh
 
03:29:06.030 --> 03:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
ratemaking process for employers if
 
03:29:08.990 --> 03:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
their losses were greater than those
 
03:29:11.309 --> 03:29:11.319 align:start position:0%
those of somebody else and then there is
 
03:29:14.830 --> 03:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
a risk pool that residual Market that uh
 
03:29:17.429 --> 03:29:17.439 align:start position:0%
would apply fortunately things are very
 
03:29:19.189 --> 03:29:19.199 align:start position:0%
healthy right now as you know in the
 
03:29:20.830 --> 03:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
workers compensation market and they
 
03:29:23.309 --> 03:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
have been for many years
 
03:29:27.429 --> 03:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
but to me it wasn't all that long ago
 
03:29:29.389 --> 03:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
maybe seems so to many of you but back
 
03:29:32.229 --> 03:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
in the 90s some of you may remember
 
03:29:34.229 --> 03:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
workers compensation was just not
 
03:29:36.870 --> 03:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
available at all to employers and the
 
03:29:38.710 --> 03:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
market was approaching
 
03:29:41.389 --> 03:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
50% where no no insurance company wanted
 
03:29:44.870 --> 03:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
to write workers compensation and so
 
03:29:46.870 --> 03:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
that led to reforms
 
03:29:49.510 --> 03:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh in the workers compensation law and
 
03:29:52.189 --> 03:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
it's been a tremendous uh success over
 
03:29:55.550 --> 03:29:55.560 align:start position:0%
the years in fact rates have declined uh
 
03:29:58.510 --> 03:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
over I think over the past at least 10
 
03:30:01.469 --> 03:30:01.479 align:start position:0%
years annually so it's a healthy system
 
03:30:04.229 --> 03:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
right now follow up yes for followup
 
03:30:06.110 --> 03:30:06.120 align:start position:0%
thank you sir would you attribute that
 
03:30:08.349 --> 03:30:08.359 align:start position:0%
those those premium declines the rates
 
03:30:11.550 --> 03:30:11.560 align:start position:0%
to improve safety practice I would yes
 
03:30:17.750 --> 03:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
sir thank you sir yes okay repres solvin
 
03:30:20.950 --> 03:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um the
 
03:30:24.229 --> 03:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
um you you indicated that about 50% of
 
03:30:27.950 --> 03:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
the time uh the the appeal at the uh
 
03:30:31.469 --> 03:30:31.479 align:start position:0%
hearing level hearing officer level um
 
03:30:34.990 --> 03:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
is in favor of the um uh the
 
03:30:39.870 --> 03:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
worker um which arguably means that 50%
 
03:30:42.110 --> 03:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
of the time the insurance company got it
 
03:30:46.070 --> 03:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
wrong um in which case
 
03:30:48.790 --> 03:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be fair for the uh uh the
 
03:30:51.670 --> 03:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
worker to be uh compensated for their um
 
03:30:54.550 --> 03:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
legal fees in instances where the
 
03:30:56.750 --> 03:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
insurance company got it
 
03:30:59.189 --> 03:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
wrong no I think the current system is
 
03:31:01.110 --> 03:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
fair and by the way don't hold me to
 
03:31:04.030 --> 03:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
that 50% I think uh I would defer the
 
03:31:06.750 --> 03:31:06.760 align:start position:0%
labor department to assign whatever
 
03:31:09.429 --> 03:31:09.439 align:start position:0%
statistics they have I just I just took
 
03:31:11.870 --> 03:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
that number out of some data then did
 
03:31:15.110 --> 03:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
you make up anything else no I and I
 
03:31:17.070 --> 03:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
didn't make that up either but but I I
 
03:31:19.469 --> 03:31:19.479 align:start position:0%
could stand corrected uh but no I think
 
03:31:21.670 --> 03:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
the system is fair we don't need to G it
 
03:31:25.030 --> 03:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
up with lawyers at the hearing uh level
 
03:31:26.870 --> 03:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
process we've got hearing officers that
 
03:31:29.790 --> 03:31:29.800 align:start position:0%
can tell and ascertain whether which
 
03:31:31.950 --> 03:31:31.960 align:start position:0%
side is correct whether the the injuries
 
03:31:33.870 --> 03:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
work rated and whether it's disabled
 
03:31:36.309 --> 03:31:36.319 align:start position:0%
without without encouraging the
 
03:31:38.950 --> 03:31:38.960 align:start position:0%
participation of of lawyers
 
03:31:43.030 --> 03:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily so so I I agree with that
 
03:31:46.269 --> 03:31:46.279 align:start position:0%
statement but the question I've got is
 
03:31:49.830 --> 03:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
of these cases that are heard by the
 
03:31:52.830 --> 03:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
insurance panel that you talked about
 
03:31:55.349 --> 03:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
how many of those
 
03:31:58.550 --> 03:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
employes have lawyers with them present
 
03:31:58.560 --> 03:31:59.309 align:start position:0%
employes have lawyers with them present
at

03:31:59.309 --> 03:31:59.319 align:start position:0%
at
 
03:32:01.990 --> 03:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
that at that hearing I think that's a
 
03:32:03.630 --> 03:32:03.640 align:start position:0%
great question I I don't know the answer
 
03:32:05.469 --> 03:32:05.479 align:start position:0%
to the question but hopefully the the
 
03:32:07.349 --> 03:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
labor department can can give you that
 
03:32:08.870 --> 03:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
answer that's that's a good question I
 
03:32:11.429 --> 03:32:11.439 align:start position:0%
don't know any
 
03:32:17.229 --> 03:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:20.150 --> 03:32:20.160 align:start position:0%
my question is um you're talking about
 
03:32:22.990 --> 03:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
prosay claimants you're saying that
 
03:32:23.000 --> 03:32:23.950 align:start position:0%
prosay claimants you're saying that
people

03:32:23.950 --> 03:32:23.960 align:start position:0%
people
 
03:32:26.710 --> 03:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
can um Can represent themselves and the
 
03:32:31.189 --> 03:32:31.199 align:start position:0%
just the uh system allows for that but
 
03:32:35.630 --> 03:32:35.640 align:start position:0%
in light of that um would you admit that
 
03:32:37.790 --> 03:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
it can get very complicated a workers
 
03:32:41.309 --> 03:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
compensation case can even at the uh
 
03:32:43.750 --> 03:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
even at the hearing level let alone the
 
03:32:46.990 --> 03:32:47.000 align:start position:0%
appeals board and would would you agree
 
03:32:49.469 --> 03:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
that you have to follow certain
 
03:32:52.309 --> 03:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
guidelines and rules and timing of uh
 
03:32:55.309 --> 03:32:55.319 align:start position:0%
when you file and how you file and that
 
03:32:57.469 --> 03:32:57.479 align:start position:0%
for an injured worker do you think that
 
03:32:59.469 --> 03:32:59.479 align:start position:0%
that a burden that Injured Workers may
 
03:33:02.750 --> 03:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
want to shift off to a professional uh
 
03:33:04.710 --> 03:33:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh an attorney to help them with their
 
03:33:06.750 --> 03:33:06.760 align:start position:0%
process well thank you thank you for the
 
03:33:08.990 --> 03:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
question and certainly that's an option
 
03:33:11.349 --> 03:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
that uh that a claimant has is to is to
 
03:33:13.110 --> 03:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
hire a lawyer no one's no one's saying
 
03:33:16.030 --> 03:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
they don't they can't hire a lawyer but
 
03:33:17.950 --> 03:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
I I think and you would know this that
 
03:33:19.150 --> 03:33:19.160 align:start position:0%
these hearing
 
03:33:21.469 --> 03:33:21.479 align:start position:0%
officers understand that people are
 
03:33:24.070 --> 03:33:24.080 align:start position:0%
injured workers are there unrepresented
 
03:33:25.830 --> 03:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
and they make allowances in my
 
03:33:28.590 --> 03:33:28.600 align:start position:0%
experience for uh for that fact and that
 
03:33:31.150 --> 03:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
they may not be familiar with the the
 
03:33:33.990 --> 03:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
system I remember having a
 
03:33:36.469 --> 03:33:36.479 align:start position:0%
hearing with a hearing officer and
 
03:33:40.550 --> 03:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
representing a claim it years ago and uh
 
03:33:42.110 --> 03:33:42.120 align:start position:0%
my U the
 
03:33:44.469 --> 03:33:44.479 align:start position:0%
claimant explain the circumstances of
 
03:33:46.550 --> 03:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
his injury and his treat and why he's
 
03:33:48.710 --> 03:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
disabled and we went into that and then
 
03:33:50.229 --> 03:33:50.239 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
03:33:53.990 --> 03:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
officer who I really appreciate said now
 
03:33:56.429 --> 03:33:56.439 align:start position:0%
we have to hear from the insurance
 
03:33:56.439 --> 03:33:58.870 align:start position:0%
we have to hear from the insurance
company

03:33:58.870 --> 03:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
company
 
03:34:01.670 --> 03:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
so that happened it's an it's maybe not
 
03:34:04.229 --> 03:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
the usual practice but I I do think the
 
03:34:06.030 --> 03:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
that these hearing officers deserve a
 
03:34:08.150 --> 03:34:08.160 align:start position:0%
lot of credit they they understand that
 
03:34:10.150 --> 03:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
people Injured Workers are there and
 
03:34:12.070 --> 03:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
they're not represented and they're not
 
03:34:14.229 --> 03:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
as familiar with the processes as they
 
03:34:15.950 --> 03:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
might be and they make allowances for
 
03:34:20.349 --> 03:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
that and try to result uh try to uh give
 
03:34:22.229 --> 03:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
the come to the right decision and the
 
03:34:24.469 --> 03:34:24.479 align:start position:0%
fair decision and I think they do by and
 
03:34:27.189 --> 03:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
large and then as you say if that
 
03:34:30.070 --> 03:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
doesn't work uh and there's an appeal
 
03:34:31.990 --> 03:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
and the appeal is successful those
 
03:34:34.070 --> 03:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees and costs are paid paid
 
03:34:38.830 --> 03:34:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:42.269 --> 03:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
employer represent
 
03:34:46.309 --> 03:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
Sol um at the hearing level um does the
 
03:34:48.229 --> 03:34:48.239 align:start position:0%
insurance company send a an
 
03:34:50.309 --> 03:34:50.319 align:start position:0%
inexperienced lay person or an attorney
 
03:34:54.030 --> 03:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
to represent the insurance company again
 
03:34:55.910 --> 03:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
that that I think is a good question
 
03:34:58.229 --> 03:34:58.239 align:start position:0%
about representation on the on the other
 
03:35:00.590 --> 03:35:00.600 align:start position:0%
side and of course you're talking about
 
03:35:03.110 --> 03:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh self-insured uh groups as well that
 
03:35:05.510 --> 03:35:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't have insurance companies they they
 
03:35:09.469 --> 03:35:09.479 align:start position:0%
insure themselves and and uh uh when I
 
03:35:12.710 --> 03:35:12.720 align:start position:0%
last was uh doing this work the uh
 
03:35:15.030 --> 03:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
typically there would be an insurance uh
 
03:35:17.150 --> 03:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
Adjusters so he would have experience in
 
03:35:20.630 --> 03:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
workers compensation for sure but uh as
 
03:35:22.349 --> 03:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
often as not they would not be lawyers
 
03:35:24.030 --> 03:35:24.040 align:start position:0%
whether there and sometimes there would
 
03:35:27.389 --> 03:35:27.399 align:start position:0%
be lawyers that would represent the uh
 
03:35:31.670 --> 03:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
employer um again it might be helpful to
 
03:35:33.309 --> 03:35:33.319 align:start position:0%
to hear from the insurance department I
 
03:35:36.429 --> 03:35:36.439 align:start position:0%
mean the uh the labor department uh
 
03:35:40.429 --> 03:35:40.439 align:start position:0%
about about that uh distribution of on
 
03:35:41.550 --> 03:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
the other
 
03:35:45.870 --> 03:35:45.880 align:start position:0%
side Zam K thank you again Mr Russ just
 
03:35:48.309 --> 03:35:48.319 align:start position:0%
to be clear it I believe I heard you as
 
03:35:49.790 --> 03:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
an attorney saying that we don't need
 
03:35:51.670 --> 03:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
attorneys gumming up the
 
03:35:57.510 --> 03:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
works is that correct thank you I I I I
 
03:36:00.150 --> 03:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
think that this is another topic bigger
 
03:36:02.710 --> 03:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
topic than this bill but I think we we
 
03:36:04.830 --> 03:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
we have just too many lawyers involved
 
03:36:07.870 --> 03:36:07.880 align:start position:0%
in too many things today and as a lawyer
 
03:36:10.030 --> 03:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
I say that and don't tell my partner as
 
03:36:12.950 --> 03:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
I said it but uh it it's just it's
 
03:36:14.229 --> 03:36:14.239 align:start position:0%
gotten so comp you can't read a
 
03:36:17.229 --> 03:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
newspaper without uh being a lawyer to
 
03:36:19.070 --> 03:36:19.080 align:start position:0%
understand what so I think we've gone
 
03:36:21.030 --> 03:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
too far but that is that's a that's a
 
03:36:23.830 --> 03:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
topic for another day uh I'm happy to
 
03:36:26.389 --> 03:36:26.399 align:start position:0%
happy to talk about thank you sir yeah
 
03:36:28.070 --> 03:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you all right
 
03:36:30.150 --> 03:36:30.160 align:start position:0%
sir thank you for your testimony I
 
03:36:32.830 --> 03:36:32.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate it thank you I'd like to call
 
03:36:40.830 --> 03:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:42.910 --> 03:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon Mr chairman
 
03:36:45.030 --> 03:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
members of the committee um so my name
 
03:36:46.550 --> 03:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
is Jared Connor I'm with the firm of
 
03:36:49.309 --> 03:36:49.319 align:start position:0%
Shaheen and Gordon um my role in this
 
03:36:51.990 --> 03:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
and I support this legislation I am a
 
03:36:53.550 --> 03:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
claimants attorney in workers
 
03:36:55.550 --> 03:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
compensation it's all I do it's all I've
 
03:36:57.389 --> 03:36:57.399 align:start position:0%
done for about 20 years now is represent
 
03:36:59.590 --> 03:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
Injured Workers um I am also the
 
03:37:01.670 --> 03:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
attorney representative on the PTSD
 
03:37:03.910 --> 03:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
commission and have been for five years
 
03:37:05.910 --> 03:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
um that rep representative Pearson
 
03:37:08.429 --> 03:37:08.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned um so I'm really here to
 
03:37:10.550 --> 03:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
answer some questions if any about the
 
03:37:12.510 --> 03:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
way that all of this works but I do want
 
03:37:15.150 --> 03:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
to at least Begin by noting that I don't
 
03:37:17.389 --> 03:37:17.399 align:start position:0%
know that it's entirely accurate to say
 
03:37:19.630 --> 03:37:19.640 align:start position:0%
that these first level hearings are sort
 
03:37:22.269 --> 03:37:22.279 align:start position:0%
of intended to and actually operate with
 
03:37:24.030 --> 03:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
no attorneys and we don't want attorneys
 
03:37:26.309 --> 03:37:26.319 align:start position:0%
guming up the works the two main things
 
03:37:28.830 --> 03:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
I want to say about that is that first
 
03:37:31.469 --> 03:37:31.479 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge virtually every time
 
03:37:33.030 --> 03:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
there is a hearing a first level hearing
 
03:37:34.990 --> 03:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
at the labor department the insurance
 
03:37:37.790 --> 03:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
carrier or the self-insured through its
 
03:37:39.870 --> 03:37:39.880 align:start position:0%
third party administrator has an
 
03:37:42.429 --> 03:37:42.439 align:start position:0%
attorney there representing them so a
 
03:37:44.510 --> 03:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
prosay injured worker who goes up there
 
03:37:47.269 --> 03:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
by themselves is facing an attorney on
 
03:37:49.389 --> 03:37:49.399 align:start position:0%
the other side so there's already an
 
03:37:51.790 --> 03:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
attorney in the works whether adding
 
03:37:53.990 --> 03:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
another one is going to gum up the works
 
03:37:55.670 --> 03:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
um I think the best evidence that that's
 
03:37:59.950 --> 03:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
not true is that when a prosay litigant
 
03:38:01.389 --> 03:38:01.399 align:start position:0%
asks for a hearing at the labor
 
03:38:03.349 --> 03:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
department and the labor department can
 
03:38:04.830 --> 03:38:04.840 align:start position:0%
confirm this they will routinely
 
03:38:07.309 --> 03:38:07.319 align:start position:0%
schedule it for at least an hour and a
 
03:38:09.630 --> 03:38:09.640 align:start position:0%
half if there are attorneys on both
 
03:38:11.790 --> 03:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
sides they schedule it for an hour
 
03:38:13.429 --> 03:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
having two attorneys does not gum up the
 
03:38:14.950 --> 03:38:14.960 align:start position:0%
works it Smooths things out and makes
 
03:38:16.309 --> 03:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
things more efficient because the
 
03:38:18.389 --> 03:38:18.399 align:start position:0%
attorneys who do this work understand
 
03:38:20.389 --> 03:38:20.399 align:start position:0%
the cases we know how to present them
 
03:38:22.229 --> 03:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
they go much smoother and faster than
 
03:38:24.429 --> 03:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
dealing with an individual who doesn't
 
03:38:25.670 --> 03:38:25.680 align:start position:0%
know what they're doing or how to
 
03:38:26.710 --> 03:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
present the
 
03:38:29.710 --> 03:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
case to that point I think the the
 
03:38:31.910 --> 03:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
Practical issue that this is intended to
 
03:38:34.389 --> 03:38:34.399 align:start position:0%
address is that when you're an injured
 
03:38:36.030 --> 03:38:36.040 align:start position:0%
worker and your claim has been
 
03:38:38.389 --> 03:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
immediately denied you need to request a
 
03:38:39.990 --> 03:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
hearing at the labor department so that
 
03:38:41.710 --> 03:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
you can try to get some benefits coming
 
03:38:43.189 --> 03:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
in you know you've just had this
 
03:38:45.550 --> 03:38:45.560 align:start position:0%
catastrophic injury your bills aren't
 
03:38:46.750 --> 03:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
being paid the medical is not being
 
03:38:48.590 --> 03:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
covered you need relief fast and the
 
03:38:50.710 --> 03:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
labor department is set up for that so
 
03:38:52.189 --> 03:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
you can request a hearing and you'll be
 
03:38:54.469 --> 03:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
up there within two months maybe three
 
03:38:56.510 --> 03:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
at the max to have your hearing and
 
03:38:57.630 --> 03:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
present your
 
03:39:00.229 --> 03:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
case if you have a hearing like that and
 
03:39:02.389 --> 03:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
Prevail what you get from the labor
 
03:39:04.550 --> 03:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
department is an order that benefits are
 
03:39:07.870 --> 03:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
payable meaning you get retroactive pay
 
03:39:09.189 --> 03:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
back to the beginning of when you first
 
03:39:11.150 --> 03:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
went out of work so maybe you get 3 to
 
03:39:13.950 --> 03:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
four months worth of retroactive pay
 
03:39:17.110 --> 03:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
that currently is how attorneys are paid
 
03:39:18.710 --> 03:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
if we represent people at the first
 
03:39:20.670 --> 03:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
level so you go to the hearing you're
 
03:39:22.870 --> 03:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
successful maybe 3 to four months of
 
03:39:26.910 --> 03:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
retroactive pay 20% of that comes to
 
03:39:29.150 --> 03:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
attorneys the Practical issue is that
 
03:39:31.710 --> 03:39:31.720 align:start position:0%
for a lot of Injured Workers that
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
four-month window of pay it might be
 
03:39:39.750 --> 03:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
6,000 8,000 bucks maybe less 20% of that
 
03:39:41.830 --> 03:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
isn't enough to justify hiring an
 
03:39:44.229 --> 03:39:44.239 align:start position:0%
attorney um and so they find it
 
03:39:45.990 --> 03:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
difficult to get representation at that
 
03:39:48.269 --> 03:39:48.279 align:start position:0%
first level that's really I think the
 
03:39:51.070 --> 03:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
Practical issue um it is certainly true
 
03:39:53.830 --> 03:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
that then on appeal the way that the
 
03:39:56.229 --> 03:39:56.239 align:start position:0%
fees are currently structured is that if
 
03:39:59.150 --> 03:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
you proceed and Prevail at the appeals
 
03:40:01.429 --> 03:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
level then attorney's fees are awardable
 
03:40:03.550 --> 03:40:03.560 align:start position:0%
and payable by the insurance carrier if
 
03:40:05.389 --> 03:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
we go to a hearing and lose then
 
03:40:07.150 --> 03:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
attorneys are simply not paid and that's
 
03:40:08.550 --> 03:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
the way it works it's a contingent
 
03:40:10.950 --> 03:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
Arrangement um and that's set up by the
 
03:40:13.389 --> 03:40:13.399 align:start position:0%
statute this is the same exact thing
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
except at the first level hearings so
 
03:40:18.110 --> 03:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
the idea would be to allow people to
 
03:40:20.910 --> 03:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
retain experienced Council so that they
 
03:40:22.510 --> 03:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
can present their case and have a better
 
03:40:25.110 --> 03:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
shot of prevailing whether that's the
 
03:40:28.030 --> 03:40:28.040 align:start position:0%
initial denial when they really need to
 
03:40:30.670 --> 03:40:30.680 align:start position:0%
be able to Marshal evidence and it's you
 
03:40:31.990 --> 03:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
know it's true that these first level
 
03:40:34.349 --> 03:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
hearings are pretty informal there again
 
03:40:36.990 --> 03:40:37.000 align:start position:0%
there are no rules of evidence um that
 
03:40:39.309 --> 03:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
being said the legal issues in workers
 
03:40:41.590 --> 03:40:41.600 align:start position:0%
comp can be fairly complex and they've
 
03:40:44.510 --> 03:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
just become more so in the last 15 to 20
 
03:40:45.950 --> 03:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
years I would say you know we've
 
03:40:48.830 --> 03:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
introduced presumptions in the law the
 
03:40:50.550 --> 03:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has weighed in on a number
 
03:40:52.309 --> 03:40:52.319 align:start position:0%
of occasions making the cases more
 
03:40:54.510 --> 03:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
complicated as to whether you have an
 
03:40:56.269 --> 03:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
injury that arises from what they call a
 
03:40:58.670 --> 03:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
neutral risk or a direct risk or a mixed
 
03:41:00.950 --> 03:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
risk these are legal categories that can
 
03:41:04.030 --> 03:41:04.040 align:start position:0%
affect whether you qualify your average
 
03:41:05.910 --> 03:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
pro litigant is not going to understand
 
03:41:07.630 --> 03:41:07.640 align:start position:0%
or know about the appeal of margison
 
03:41:09.950 --> 03:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
case and how to argue it which is more
 
03:41:13.189 --> 03:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
likely to lead to a unfavorable decision
 
03:41:15.429 --> 03:41:15.439 align:start position:0%
so those are the kinds of situations
 
03:41:17.229 --> 03:41:17.239 align:start position:0%
where it can absolutely help to have
 
03:41:19.630 --> 03:41:19.640 align:start position:0%
experienced Council come in early to
 
03:41:22.309 --> 03:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
assist them with their claim if we under
 
03:41:24.389 --> 03:41:24.399 align:start position:0%
this regime if we were to go to that
 
03:41:28.110 --> 03:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
first appeal and lose again no fee is
 
03:41:31.030 --> 03:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
payable um so that's that's one
 
03:41:32.750 --> 03:41:32.760 align:start position:0%
circumstance probably the primary
 
03:41:34.510 --> 03:41:34.520 align:start position:0%
circumstance where this would assist
 
03:41:37.710 --> 03:41:37.720 align:start position:0%
people in getting competent experienced
 
03:41:39.349 --> 03:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
representation at their first level
 
03:41:42.030 --> 03:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
hearing the other is another situation
 
03:41:44.990 --> 03:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
that I see not at all uncommonly where
 
03:41:46.790 --> 03:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
people people haven't accepted workers
 
03:41:48.309 --> 03:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
comp claim the insurance company is
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
paying for everything they're supposed
 
03:41:51.469 --> 03:41:51.479 align:start position:0%
to pay for they're getting their weekly
 
03:41:53.309 --> 03:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
benefits maybe they've gone through
 
03:41:55.269 --> 03:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
surgery they've been disabled for a
 
03:41:58.750 --> 03:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
while um at that point at any point in
 
03:42:00.670 --> 03:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
the case but usually at that point the
 
03:42:02.790 --> 03:42:02.800 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier can request a hearing
 
03:42:05.189 --> 03:42:05.199 align:start position:0%
to seek to reduce or terminate benefits
 
03:42:06.990 --> 03:42:07.000 align:start position:0%
on the theory that this person could or
 
03:42:08.790 --> 03:42:08.800 align:start position:0%
should be working and maybe they haven't
 
03:42:10.110 --> 03:42:10.120 align:start position:0%
been given a Work Release by their
 
03:42:12.030 --> 03:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
doctor so there's a dispute about
 
03:42:13.830 --> 03:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
whether they can work the insurance
 
03:42:16.110 --> 03:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
carrier can request a hearing to review
 
03:42:18.429 --> 03:42:18.439 align:start position:0%
that if you go to that hearing and
 
03:42:20.830 --> 03:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
Prevail by showing no my doctors all
 
03:42:22.349 --> 03:42:22.359 align:start position:0%
agree I'm still disabled and can't be
 
03:42:25.070 --> 03:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
working right now then what's awarded to
 
03:42:27.590 --> 03:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
you is nothing it's just continued
 
03:42:30.550 --> 03:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
status quo so there is no retroactive
 
03:42:33.149 --> 03:42:33.159 align:start position:0%
benefit out of which to award attorney's
 
03:42:35.670 --> 03:42:35.680 align:start position:0%
fees so again people have a difficult
 
03:42:38.269 --> 03:42:38.279 align:start position:0%
time finding council to represent them
 
03:42:40.710 --> 03:42:40.720 align:start position:0%
for these hearings where even if you do
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of work there is no pay involved
 
03:42:46.269 --> 03:42:46.279 align:start position:0%
and this these hearings can can be a lot
 
03:42:48.030 --> 03:42:48.040 align:start position:0%
of work you know when you have these
 
03:42:49.510 --> 03:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
kinds of disputes about whether someone
 
03:42:52.030 --> 03:42:52.040 align:start position:0%
is disabled the insurance carrier with
 
03:42:54.149 --> 03:42:54.159 align:start position:0%
the assistance of their counil we'll
 
03:42:56.349 --> 03:42:56.359 align:start position:0%
bring in medical experts we'll bring in
 
03:42:58.269 --> 03:42:58.279 align:start position:0%
vocational experts and labor market
 
03:43:01.030 --> 03:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
surveys to show what is available out in
 
03:43:02.790 --> 03:43:02.800 align:start position:0%
the marketplace for these people to be
 
03:43:05.229 --> 03:43:05.239 align:start position:0%
able to find work the average proa
 
03:43:07.830 --> 03:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
litigant has no idea how to rebut that
 
03:43:09.550 --> 03:43:09.560 align:start position:0%
how to go out and find their own expert
 
03:43:11.550 --> 03:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
or pay for their own expert to be able
 
03:43:13.189 --> 03:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
to challenge it adequately at the first
 
03:43:16.349 --> 03:43:16.359 align:start position:0%
level so I I guess that's all I I'll
 
03:43:18.189 --> 03:43:18.199 align:start position:0%
stop pontificating and answer questions
 
03:43:21.070 --> 03:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
if you have that's great um any
 
03:43:24.710 --> 03:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
questions please representative Hall
 
03:43:27.830 --> 03:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh attorney oconor as
 
03:43:31.030 --> 03:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
a subject matter expert in this
 
03:43:34.710 --> 03:43:34.720 align:start position:0%
um does is it your opinion that this
 
03:43:37.070 --> 03:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
bill would remove the 20% cap I don't
 
03:43:39.110 --> 03:43:39.120 align:start position:0%
see anything specified other than
 
03:43:41.950 --> 03:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable attorney fees no the 20% cap
 
03:43:43.990 --> 03:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
is set by Department of Labor regulation
 
03:43:45.950 --> 03:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
so that's already in the law where
 
03:43:48.830 --> 03:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
attorneys fees are awarded um they are
 
03:43:50.910 --> 03:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
awarded pursuant to approval by the
 
03:43:52.229 --> 03:43:52.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner and that actually is in the
 
03:43:54.309 --> 03:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
law you can see this um it exists
 
03:43:57.070 --> 03:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
already in the law for other kind of for
 
03:43:59.349 --> 03:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
this bill if a claimant prevails the
 
03:44:00.670 --> 03:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
claimant shall be entitled to
 
03:44:02.510 --> 03:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement of reasonable Council fees
 
03:44:04.149 --> 03:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
and costs as approved by the
 
03:44:06.389 --> 03:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner meaning approval by the
 
03:44:07.670 --> 03:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
labor department and that's how this
 
03:44:09.750 --> 03:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
works now for existing hearings where
 
03:44:11.910 --> 03:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
there is fee shifting you submit your
 
03:44:13.990 --> 03:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
bill to the hearings officer who heard
 
03:44:16.269 --> 03:44:16.279 align:start position:0%
the case hearing officer then reviews it
 
03:44:17.630 --> 03:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
for reasonableness if they think it's
 
03:44:19.790 --> 03:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
too high they can knock it down um and
 
03:44:21.349 --> 03:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
then they will approve it and it's
 
03:44:24.630 --> 03:44:24.640 align:start position:0%
payable by the insurance carrier thank
 
03:44:27.790 --> 03:44:27.800 align:start position:0%
you representative McKenzie thank
 
03:44:30.830 --> 03:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
you uh having served in the comp appeals
 
03:44:33.070 --> 03:44:33.080 align:start position:0%
board I understand how
 
03:44:36.110 --> 03:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
complicated uh these things can
 
03:44:39.510 --> 03:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
be uh in terms of prosay
 
03:44:42.389 --> 03:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
liance uh the role that the hearing
 
03:44:45.189 --> 03:44:45.199 align:start position:0%
officer plays is not to present the case
 
03:44:47.710 --> 03:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
correct for the prosay litigate so it's
 
03:44:51.670 --> 03:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
their burden their burden to know what
 
03:44:54.469 --> 03:44:54.479 align:start position:0%
the law and understand the law and
 
03:44:55.830 --> 03:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
they're up against somebody who does
 
03:44:58.670 --> 03:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
this every day that's certainly true um
 
03:45:00.630 --> 03:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
you know the hearing officer is ideally
 
03:45:02.469 --> 03:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
neutral you know they're not there to
 
03:45:04.550 --> 03:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
assist the claimant um as a prosay
 
03:45:07.429 --> 03:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
litigant and as a proa litigant as any
 
03:45:10.990 --> 03:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
kind of claimant the burden is always on
 
03:45:13.389 --> 03:45:13.399 align:start position:0%
you to present the case and to prove the
 
03:45:15.550 --> 03:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
case it's always the claimants of proof
 
03:45:17.990 --> 03:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
to show that this is a work rated
 
03:45:20.429 --> 03:45:20.439 align:start position:0%
accident or injury um except in very
 
03:45:21.990 --> 03:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
minor cases like we have some
 
03:45:24.910 --> 03:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
presumption shifting um for cancer and
 
03:45:27.189 --> 03:45:27.199 align:start position:0%
PTSD and First Responders but for
 
03:45:29.269 --> 03:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
everything else the burden is always on
 
03:45:31.910 --> 03:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
the claimant to prove the case and so it
 
03:45:34.189 --> 03:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
is on them and if they don't show up
 
03:45:35.550 --> 03:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
with the appropriate evidence the
 
03:45:37.950 --> 03:45:37.960 align:start position:0%
hearing officer shouldn't be stepping in
 
03:45:40.910 --> 03:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
to do their job for them I don't attend
 
03:45:43.670 --> 03:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
Pro hearings cuz I'm not involved so
 
03:45:45.429 --> 03:45:45.439 align:start position:0%
it's hard for me to generalize
 
03:45:48.550 --> 03:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
for followup sir thank you uh based on
 
03:45:51.550 --> 03:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
your experience when you prepare a
 
03:45:55.790 --> 03:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
packet for the appeals board or or um or
 
03:45:58.189 --> 03:45:58.199 align:start position:0%
the hearings
 
03:46:00.550 --> 03:46:00.560 align:start position:0%
officer what is what is something like
 
03:46:02.990 --> 03:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
that take in a in a complicated case to
 
03:46:05.429 --> 03:46:05.439 align:start position:0%
pull out all that together so to so to
 
03:46:07.710 --> 03:46:07.720 align:start position:0%
be able to present any workers comp case
 
03:46:09.349 --> 03:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
essentially what you need is all of the
 
03:46:12.309 --> 03:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
relevant medical records um which can be
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
in in most cases is Medical records that
 
03:46:17.110 --> 03:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
predate the date of the injury you need
 
03:46:18.269 --> 03:46:18.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to organize them
 
03:46:19.790 --> 03:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
chronologically in a way that makes
 
03:46:22.389 --> 03:46:22.399 align:start position:0%
sense to the hearing officer um you know
 
03:46:23.910 --> 03:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
again you're therefore for a first level
 
03:46:25.910 --> 03:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
hearing that takes about an hour so
 
03:46:27.469 --> 03:46:27.479 align:start position:0%
these hearings move quickly and you need
 
03:46:29.790 --> 03:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to present 600 Pages worth of
 
03:46:32.469 --> 03:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
medical history in an organized fashion
 
03:46:34.670 --> 03:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
that makes sense whether that's putting
 
03:46:36.590 --> 03:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
the orthopedic notes on top in
 
03:46:38.110 --> 03:46:38.120 align:start position:0%
chronological order and then saving the
 
03:46:40.070 --> 03:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
PT toward the back and then being able
 
03:46:41.550 --> 03:46:41.560 align:start position:0%
to present that in a way that the
 
03:46:43.189 --> 03:46:43.199 align:start position:0%
hearing officer can understand and
 
03:46:45.590 --> 03:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
relate to the initial
 
03:46:47.870 --> 03:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
accident itself and that's leaving aside
 
03:46:49.910 --> 03:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
the other issues like the labor market
 
03:46:51.710 --> 03:46:51.720 align:start position:0%
surveys or other vocational evidence
 
03:46:54.309 --> 03:46:54.319 align:start position:0%
that may be necessary to show uh the
 
03:46:55.510 --> 03:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
difficulty the person has in finding
 
03:46:55.520 --> 03:46:58.630 align:start position:0%
difficulty the person has in finding
other

03:46:58.630 --> 03:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:01.870 --> 03:47:01.880 align:start position:0%
work represent K thank you Mr chair and
 
03:47:04.149 --> 03:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question from
 
03:47:06.429 --> 03:47:06.439 align:start position:0%
from what I've heard you say this this
 
03:47:09.349 --> 03:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
afternoon it sounds like if if if an
 
03:47:12.750 --> 03:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
injured employer employee comes to you
 
03:47:15.030 --> 03:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
tells you the facts of what happened you
 
03:47:16.670 --> 03:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
can sort of screen out the things that
 
03:47:19.790 --> 03:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
are not likely to be successful and
 
03:47:22.110 --> 03:47:22.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps sh the department and the employ
 
03:47:25.070 --> 03:47:25.080 align:start position:0%
and the worker uh a bit of time is that
 
03:47:27.269 --> 03:47:27.279 align:start position:0%
correct I mean I I certainly go through
 
03:47:29.030 --> 03:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
a screening process every time a client
 
03:47:30.990 --> 03:47:31.000 align:start position:0%
or potential client calls to be able to
 
03:47:32.870 --> 03:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
assess it and figure out whether this is
 
03:47:35.149 --> 03:47:35.159 align:start position:0%
likely to be a case that we would be
 
03:47:37.710 --> 03:47:37.720 align:start position:0%
prevailing on um or whether there's some
 
03:47:39.030 --> 03:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
Wrinkle in the law that actually
 
03:47:41.349 --> 03:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
precludes them um that kind of thing
 
03:47:43.630 --> 03:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
happens a lot is that is that answer
 
03:47:45.030 --> 03:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
your question uh yes thank you thank you
 
03:47:48.590 --> 03:47:48.600 align:start position:0%
very much okay represent
 
03:47:50.990 --> 03:47:51.000 align:start position:0%
suvan I assume there are times when you
 
03:47:54.149 --> 03:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
represent a worker who's um represented
 
03:47:58.510 --> 03:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
themselves at the hearing level um is U
 
03:48:00.910 --> 03:48:00.920 align:start position:0%
uh been denied by the hearing
 
03:48:04.110 --> 03:48:04.120 align:start position:0%
officer um and then comes to you to see
 
03:48:07.229 --> 03:48:07.239 align:start position:0%
if an appeal would be uh uh likely to be
 
03:48:09.269 --> 03:48:09.279 align:start position:0%
successful and you do the
 
03:48:12.469 --> 03:48:12.479 align:start position:0%
appeal is is there ever a time um when
 
03:48:14.189 --> 03:48:14.199 align:start position:0%
you find that some of the things that
 
03:48:16.229 --> 03:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
the work did in the
 
03:48:16.239 --> 03:48:18.269 align:start position:0%
the work did in the
hearing

03:48:18.269 --> 03:48:18.279 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:48:23.910 --> 03:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
um uh is uh detrimental to the um uh to
 
03:48:23.920 --> 03:48:24.670 align:start position:0%
um uh is uh detrimental to the um uh to
the

03:48:24.670 --> 03:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:48:27.469 --> 03:48:27.479 align:start position:0%
appeal yeah absolutely um because they
 
03:48:29.349 --> 03:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
they're not an attorney and they this is
 
03:48:31.590 --> 03:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
often the first exposure these people
 
03:48:34.070 --> 03:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
have ever had to the legal system and
 
03:48:35.229 --> 03:48:35.239 align:start position:0%
you know they assume I'm just going to
 
03:48:36.750 --> 03:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
show up at the first level and tell my
 
03:48:39.149 --> 03:48:39.159 align:start position:0%
story and that'll be the end of it and
 
03:48:41.750 --> 03:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
it's not quite that simple you know it
 
03:48:43.790 --> 03:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
does take the proper presentation of
 
03:48:46.110 --> 03:48:46.120 align:start position:0%
medical and other and so yeah it's not
 
03:48:48.110 --> 03:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
at all uncommon for people who have lost
 
03:48:49.990 --> 03:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
their first level hearing whether
 
03:48:51.269 --> 03:48:51.279 align:start position:0%
because of a legal issue that they
 
03:48:53.189 --> 03:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
didn't know how to argue or because of
 
03:48:55.070 --> 03:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
medical evidence that they failed to
 
03:48:56.710 --> 03:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
obtain which turned out to have been
 
03:48:58.870 --> 03:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
relevant to the argument those are all
 
03:49:00.870 --> 03:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
things that we know how to assess and to
 
03:49:03.429 --> 03:49:03.439 align:start position:0%
present at the appeals level and usually
 
03:49:06.710 --> 03:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
with some success um you know it's it's
 
03:49:08.309 --> 03:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
always unfortunate when someone comes to
 
03:49:10.030 --> 03:49:10.040 align:start position:0%
you after having represented themselves
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
and lost because it takes another four
 
03:49:13.630 --> 03:49:13.640 align:start position:0%
or five months at least to get in front
 
03:49:15.630 --> 03:49:15.640 align:start position:0%
of the appeals board at that point if
 
03:49:18.110 --> 03:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
you Prevail great the person can be made
 
03:49:19.950 --> 03:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
whole retroactively all the way back to
 
03:49:21.750 --> 03:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
the beginning of their claim but they've
 
03:49:24.309 --> 03:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
gone through nine to 10 maybe more
 
03:49:26.990 --> 03:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
months of having no income come in from
 
03:49:29.750 --> 03:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
the comp claim whatsoever so you know is
 
03:49:32.229 --> 03:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
there ultimately a remedy sure but if
 
03:49:33.910 --> 03:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing can be avoided by
 
03:49:36.750 --> 03:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
getting con you know concrete adequate
 
03:49:38.950 --> 03:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
representation early on I think it's to
 
03:49:41.269 --> 03:49:41.279 align:start position:0%
certainly their
 
03:49:45.189 --> 03:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
benefit all right again thank you sir I
 
03:49:47.750 --> 03:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate your testimony okay thank you
 
03:49:58.830 --> 03:49:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:00.910 --> 03:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
please good afternoon my name is
 
03:50:02.550 --> 03:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
Danielle Albert I'm the Deputy
 
03:50:03.550 --> 03:50:03.560 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
03:50:05.750 --> 03:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor um I will try to be
 
03:50:08.110 --> 03:50:08.120 align:start position:0%
brief um the department has reviewed the
 
03:50:11.189 --> 03:50:11.199 align:start position:0%
language proposed by House Bill 299 we
 
03:50:13.030 --> 03:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
understand uh the purpose we understand
 
03:50:14.269 --> 03:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
the state of change we believe we can
 
03:50:16.349 --> 03:50:16.359 align:start position:0%
implement and regulate that um just to
 
03:50:18.429 --> 03:50:18.439 align:start position:0%
kind of touch on a few of the questions
 
03:50:20.110 --> 03:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
that were brought up over the course of
 
03:50:22.269 --> 03:50:22.279 align:start position:0%
previous testimony I understood one of
 
03:50:24.550 --> 03:50:24.560 align:start position:0%
the questions to be in regard to um kind
 
03:50:26.630 --> 03:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
of what's the current status of the way
 
03:50:28.189 --> 03:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
fees are handled at the department level
 
03:50:29.670 --> 03:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
and I think attorney o Conor in his
 
03:50:31.830 --> 03:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
testimony gave a very good outline of
 
03:50:34.149 --> 03:50:34.159 align:start position:0%
how that works um what I'll uh what I'll
 
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
further note is under current construct
 
03:50:40.030 --> 03:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
um the current statutory construct when
 
03:50:41.910 --> 03:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
an injured worker is coming into a
 
03:50:44.269 --> 03:50:44.279 align:start position:0%
department level hearing um there are
 
03:50:47.469 --> 03:50:47.479 align:start position:0%
sort of two ways that fees are going to
 
03:50:49.750 --> 03:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
be approached if the issue in dispute
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
relates to the whole claim was denied so
 
03:50:53.990 --> 03:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
you've got that memo of denial from the
 
03:50:56.349 --> 03:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier uh and the injured
 
03:50:58.389 --> 03:50:58.399 align:start position:0%
worker goes forward and prevails if
 
03:51:00.590 --> 03:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
there is retroactive cash benefits at
 
03:51:03.469 --> 03:51:03.479 align:start position:0%
issue the 20% retroactive is what is
 
03:51:05.189 --> 03:51:05.199 align:start position:0%
awarded or can be awarded to the
 
03:51:07.590 --> 03:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
attorney for the representation if the
 
03:51:09.510 --> 03:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
claim is a compensable one meaning the
 
03:51:11.750 --> 03:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier did not dispute that
 
03:51:13.950 --> 03:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
this is a work injury but at some point
 
03:51:15.790 --> 03:51:15.800 align:start position:0%
down the line Indemnity the cash
 
03:51:18.070 --> 03:51:18.080 align:start position:0%
benefits are in dispute the claimant
 
03:51:19.510 --> 03:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
comes in and prevails and there's a
 
03:51:21.469 --> 03:51:21.479 align:start position:0%
retroactive award the attorney can be
 
03:51:23.630 --> 03:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
paid through that 20% of the retroactive
 
03:51:26.870 --> 03:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
award um to just as OK attorney OK Conor
 
03:51:29.349 --> 03:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
had noted if there's nothing no
 
03:51:30.830 --> 03:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
retroactive anything in claim it
 
03:51:32.910 --> 03:51:32.920 align:start position:0%
prevails there is no mechanism by which
 
03:51:36.349 --> 03:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh fees uh or costs can be awarded the
 
03:51:38.790 --> 03:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
other mechanism is when an insurance
 
03:51:40.590 --> 03:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
carrier has agreed or there is a
 
03:51:42.149 --> 03:51:42.159 align:start position:0%
determination that a claim is a
 
03:51:44.349 --> 03:51:44.359 align:start position:0%
compensable one so it's not an issue of
 
03:51:46.429 --> 03:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
the is not a work injury it is a
 
03:51:48.950 --> 03:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
compensable claim and specific medical
 
03:51:51.269 --> 03:51:51.279 align:start position:0%
bills have been denied so injured worker
 
03:51:53.070 --> 03:51:53.080 align:start position:0%
has been treating they've gone to see a
 
03:51:55.269 --> 03:51:55.279 align:start position:0%
doctor the insurance carrier has a right
 
03:51:57.189 --> 03:51:57.199 align:start position:0%
to review or does review those medical
 
03:51:59.189 --> 03:51:59.199 align:start position:0%
bills and they have denied date of
 
03:52:01.670 --> 03:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
service a b and c if an injured worker
 
03:52:03.630 --> 03:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
comes in and prevails with their
 
03:52:06.670 --> 03:52:06.680 align:start position:0%
attorney on disputed medical bills um
 
03:52:08.670 --> 03:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
under current iteration of Statute fees
 
03:52:10.550 --> 03:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
and costs can be awarded to the attorney
 
03:52:12.149 --> 03:52:12.159 align:start position:0%
as it relates to the work done for those
 
03:52:14.950 --> 03:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
medical bills um our understanding of
 
03:52:16.590 --> 03:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
this proposed change is that it is now
 
03:52:18.630 --> 03:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
broadening that category that uh at the
 
03:52:20.750 --> 03:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
department level if an injured worker
 
03:52:22.309 --> 03:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
prevails then fees and costs can be
 
03:52:24.510 --> 03:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
approved by or can be paid for by the
 
03:52:26.149 --> 03:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier we appreciate the
 
03:52:28.309 --> 03:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
amendment um clarifying that that was a
 
03:52:31.030 --> 03:52:31.040 align:start position:0%
question that the department had um the
 
03:52:33.070 --> 03:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
other question that I um heard and I
 
03:52:35.030 --> 03:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
believe it was from representative Hall
 
03:52:36.790 --> 03:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
was whether or not if this change goes
 
03:52:39.389 --> 03:52:39.399 align:start position:0%
into effect is that going to change the
 
03:52:42.750 --> 03:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
20% um payment from retroactive Awards
 
03:52:44.950 --> 03:52:44.960 align:start position:0%
um exactly as attorney Conor had
 
03:52:47.030 --> 03:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
highlighted that is a provision or a
 
03:52:48.469 --> 03:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
requirement that is borne out through
 
03:52:51.750 --> 03:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
administrative rule at lab 207 in the
 
03:52:53.429 --> 03:52:53.439 align:start position:0%
200 rules I think the department would
 
03:52:54.710 --> 03:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
have to look at those administrative
 
03:52:56.870 --> 03:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
rules to determine whether or not there
 
03:52:58.309 --> 03:52:58.319 align:start position:0%
um needs to be a change I think the
 
03:53:00.910 --> 03:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
question would be whether or not um it
 
03:53:03.670 --> 03:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
would be fees and costs plus the 20% or
 
03:53:06.030 --> 03:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
is the statutory language simply uh
 
03:53:07.590 --> 03:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
mandating that the fees and costs is
 
03:53:11.149 --> 03:53:11.159 align:start position:0%
what's awarded um and I other than that
 
03:53:12.630 --> 03:53:12.640 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions if there
 
03:53:17.309 --> 03:53:17.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:20.550 --> 03:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
labry thank you Mr chair just one quick
 
03:53:21.670 --> 03:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
question is there a difference in
 
03:53:23.830 --> 03:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
hearing officers from level one to an
 
03:53:27.030 --> 03:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
escalated level two that's uh thank you
 
03:53:28.269 --> 03:53:28.279 align:start position:0%
for the question it's an excellent
 
03:53:30.030 --> 03:53:30.040 align:start position:0%
question so when we are looking at the
 
03:53:32.710 --> 03:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
workers's compensation system there is
 
03:53:36.110 --> 03:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
there are um two tiers uh administered
 
03:53:39.510 --> 03:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
through the agency for appeel the first
 
03:53:41.550 --> 03:53:41.560 align:start position:0%
level appeal is done at what we call the
 
03:53:43.630 --> 03:53:43.640 align:start position:0%
department level so that happens when an
 
03:53:44.950 --> 03:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
insurance carrier
 
03:53:46.309 --> 03:53:46.319 align:start position:0%
receives notice of a claim they've
 
03:53:48.469 --> 03:53:48.479 align:start position:0%
reviewed it they issue a memo of denial
 
03:53:50.550 --> 03:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
saying um we don't think this injury
 
03:53:52.070 --> 03:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
arose out of it in the course of
 
03:53:55.389 --> 03:53:55.399 align:start position:0%
employment um those appeals go to a
 
03:53:57.309 --> 03:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
first level hearing administered through
 
03:53:58.950 --> 03:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor uh the
 
03:54:02.510 --> 03:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
department has uh five full-time one
 
03:54:04.990 --> 03:54:05.000 align:start position:0%
part-time hearing officer who adjudicate
 
03:54:07.309 --> 03:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
those claims a decision renders from
 
03:54:09.269 --> 03:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
that decision and any AG grieved party
 
03:54:11.469 --> 03:54:11.479 align:start position:0%
can then appeal up to the next level
 
03:54:13.469 --> 03:54:13.479 align:start position:0%
which is the compensation appeals board
 
03:54:15.149 --> 03:54:15.159 align:start position:0%
the compensation appe heals board is an
 
03:54:17.510 --> 03:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
administratively attached agency to the
 
03:54:21.309 --> 03:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor there are 27 members
 
03:54:23.950 --> 03:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
um and they comprise uh hearing is
 
03:54:27.070 --> 03:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
provided presided over by a panel of the
 
03:54:28.550 --> 03:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
designated members there's an attorney
 
03:54:30.870 --> 03:54:30.880 align:start position:0%
member a labor member uh and an
 
03:54:34.309 --> 03:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
employer's member they hear the case
 
03:54:36.550 --> 03:54:36.560 align:start position:0%
they will then make a determination any
 
03:54:38.830 --> 03:54:38.840 align:start position:0%
party who's grieved by that outcome then
 
03:54:40.309 --> 03:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
has a right to appeal to the Supreme
 
03:54:41.790 --> 03:54:41.800 align:start position:0%
Court which is outside of the the
 
03:54:44.429 --> 03:54:44.439 align:start position:0%
administrative agency um so as far as a
 
03:54:46.950 --> 03:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
difference between first level uh
 
03:54:48.110 --> 03:54:48.120 align:start position:0%
Department level hearings and the
 
03:54:50.550 --> 03:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
compensation appeals board um you know
 
03:54:51.790 --> 03:54:51.800 align:start position:0%
the compensation appeals board is a
 
03:54:53.670 --> 03:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
tribunal they're not Department
 
03:54:55.750 --> 03:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
employees um they they are an
 
03:54:57.710 --> 03:54:57.720 align:start position:0%
independent sort of agency in and of
 
03:54:59.630 --> 03:54:59.640 align:start position:0%
themselves I will note that at the
 
03:55:01.670 --> 03:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
department level although the hearing
 
03:55:04.429 --> 03:55:04.439 align:start position:0%
officers are Department employees
 
03:55:06.030 --> 03:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
they're not given Direction on how to
 
03:55:08.990 --> 03:55:09.000 align:start position:0%
decide cases they are uh independent in
 
03:55:11.309 --> 03:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
that regard but in those hearings it is
 
03:55:13.389 --> 03:55:13.399 align:start position:0%
one adjudicator as opposed to a panel of
 
03:55:16.910 --> 03:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
three you're welcome representative
 
03:55:21.030 --> 03:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
McKenzie and then representative suan
 
03:55:24.550 --> 03:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
um the you mentioned the medical costs
 
03:55:27.950 --> 03:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
um for a long time we were not able to
 
03:55:30.510 --> 03:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
get attorneys to go after Medical Only
 
03:55:32.950 --> 03:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
claims and we made the change to the law
 
03:55:35.550 --> 03:55:35.560 align:start position:0%
which allows them to do that now so this
 
03:55:38.469 --> 03:55:38.479 align:start position:0%
is an expansion of this is actually
 
03:55:41.349 --> 03:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
somewhat the same thing in the sense
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
that it's hard to get an attorney to to
 
03:55:46.990 --> 03:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
repres pres you at the first level I I
 
03:55:48.309 --> 03:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
don't know that the Department's in a
 
03:55:50.110 --> 03:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
position to comment as to whether or not
 
03:55:51.630 --> 03:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
it's hard to get an attorney to
 
03:55:53.990 --> 03:55:54.000 align:start position:0%
represent at the first level um our
 
03:55:55.349 --> 03:55:55.359 align:start position:0%
understanding of the proposed language
 
03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
is that it does expand the ability uh to
 
03:56:01.110 --> 03:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
have approval for the insurance carrier
 
03:56:03.590 --> 03:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
to pay fees and costs to more than
 
03:56:06.110 --> 03:56:06.120 align:start position:0%
simply specifically disputed medical
 
03:56:08.590 --> 03:56:08.600 align:start position:0%
bills a follow-up question real quick
 
03:56:11.269 --> 03:56:11.279 align:start position:0%
yes please uh prosay
 
03:56:13.550 --> 03:56:13.560 align:start position:0%
claimants how do you handle pray
 
03:56:16.510 --> 03:56:16.520 align:start position:0%
claimants who accumulate fees who
 
03:56:19.429 --> 03:56:19.439 align:start position:0%
accumulate expenses as a result of
 
03:56:22.590 --> 03:56:22.600 align:start position:0%
making a presentation before either the
 
03:56:25.070 --> 03:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh the first in other words if they're
 
03:56:26.590 --> 03:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
accumulating all the records and they're
 
03:56:28.910 --> 03:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
doing all researching all of this it
 
03:56:32.309 --> 03:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't speak to proos claimants at all
 
03:56:34.110 --> 03:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
correct and forgive me if I
 
03:56:37.389 --> 03:56:37.399 align:start position:0%
misunderstood the question um are you
 
03:56:39.750 --> 03:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
asking whether or not there is a way for
 
03:56:42.149 --> 03:56:42.159 align:start position:0%
prosay individuals to get reimbursement
 
03:56:44.790 --> 03:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
for those costs so under this this
 
03:56:46.670 --> 03:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
you're saying the attorneys
 
03:56:49.389 --> 03:56:49.399 align:start position:0%
can put that in but there are people who
 
03:56:52.110 --> 03:56:52.120 align:start position:0%
prosay yep who could
 
03:56:54.590 --> 03:56:54.600 align:start position:0%
accumulate you know costs as a result of
 
03:56:56.229 --> 03:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
making this presentation accumulating
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
records and all of those kinds of things
 
03:57:00.309 --> 03:57:00.319 align:start position:0%
that they would have to do I understand
 
03:57:02.189 --> 03:57:02.199 align:start position:0%
um as the language is drafted it is
 
03:57:04.229 --> 03:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
specific relative to council fees and
 
03:57:06.229 --> 03:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
costs so the department understands that
 
03:57:08.269 --> 03:57:08.279 align:start position:0%
to mean the fees that are in the fees
 
03:57:09.990 --> 03:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
and costs that that are incurred through
 
03:57:13.189 --> 03:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
having Council so I I I we do not read
 
03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
or understand it to expand to pray
 
03:57:16.750 --> 03:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
individuals also having those costs
 
03:57:18.469 --> 03:57:18.479 align:start position:0%
reimbursed through the insurance carrier
 
03:57:20.070 --> 03:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you good
 
03:57:21.990 --> 03:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
question representative Sullivan thank
 
03:57:25.950 --> 03:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
you um it was asked earlier and it was
 
03:57:27.950 --> 03:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
anticipated that you could answer um
 
03:57:31.510 --> 03:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
what is the current uh uh representation
 
03:57:34.750 --> 03:57:34.760 align:start position:0%
level for uh workers at the department
 
03:57:37.110 --> 03:57:37.120 align:start position:0%
level hearings uh percentage wise or
 
03:57:38.990 --> 03:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
something that's an excellent question
 
03:57:40.670 --> 03:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
and forgive me I don't have exact
 
03:57:42.429 --> 03:57:42.439 align:start position:0%
numbers with me today but I am happy to
 
03:57:43.510 --> 03:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
see if it's something that we can
 
03:57:45.830 --> 03:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
generate for you I will say uh kind of
 
03:57:49.349 --> 03:57:49.359 align:start position:0%
broadly or globally speaking um a fair
 
03:57:52.590 --> 03:57:52.600 align:start position:0%
number of individuals of Injured Workers
 
03:57:56.590 --> 03:57:56.600 align:start position:0%
appear to be represented um either at
 
03:57:58.309 --> 03:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
the outset when petitioning for a
 
03:58:01.590 --> 03:58:01.600 align:start position:0%
hearing or obtain Council afterwards
 
03:58:03.189 --> 03:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
there are some number that go forward
 
03:58:05.469 --> 03:58:05.479 align:start position:0%
Pro say um and I'm happy to try to drill
 
03:58:07.830 --> 03:58:07.840 align:start position:0%
down and see if we can get an exact uh
 
03:58:10.590 --> 03:58:10.600 align:start position:0%
an exact figure for you on the insurance
 
03:58:12.910 --> 03:58:12.920 align:start position:0%
or on the employer insurance carrier
 
03:58:14.830 --> 03:58:14.840 align:start position:0%
side the observation has been it's
 
03:58:17.030 --> 03:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
almost there's almost always an attorney
 
03:58:20.070 --> 03:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
involved follow please would you say
 
03:58:22.990 --> 03:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
it's the majority of um uh workers that
 
03:58:29.189 --> 03:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:32.389 --> 03:58:32.399 align:start position:0%
that I will say from
 
03:58:35.790 --> 03:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
observation my my recollection is it's
 
03:58:37.910 --> 03:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
it it feels as
 
03:58:40.550 --> 03:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
though a little more than half but I
 
03:58:42.910 --> 03:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
would prefer to perhaps get you a solid
 
03:58:44.790 --> 03:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
number just so that I'm not misspeaking
 
03:58:47.790 --> 03:58:47.800 align:start position:0%
or misleading thank you and Mr Allen if
 
03:58:49.630 --> 03:58:49.640 align:start position:0%
you could get that information send it
 
03:58:53.189 --> 03:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
out please I appreciate it
 
03:58:55.790 --> 03:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative Hall thank you for taking
 
03:59:00.469 --> 03:59:00.479 align:start position:0%
my question um if a worker appears with
 
03:59:05.149 --> 03:59:05.159 align:start position:0%
a union appointed um attorney is there
 
03:59:07.910 --> 03:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
any difference in compensation very good
 
03:59:10.790 --> 03:59:10.800 align:start position:0%
question um no I the fees and costs
 
03:59:12.229 --> 03:59:12.239 align:start position:0%
would be addressed the same way
 
03:59:14.189 --> 03:59:14.199 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not it was uh
 
03:59:16.189 --> 03:59:16.199 align:start position:0%
attorney provided through a union or an
 
03:59:19.550 --> 03:59:19.560 align:start position:0%
attorney that the individual uh
 
03:59:22.990 --> 03:59:23.000 align:start position:0%
hired or hired from a private
 
03:59:26.750 --> 03:59:26.760 align:start position:0%

299 I'm now opening the uh hearing on HB
 
04:00:06.110 --> 04:00:06.120 align:start position:0%
303 relative requiring the Department of
 
04:00:08.110 --> 04:00:08.120 align:start position:0%
Labor review and adopt workers
 
04:00:10.550 --> 04:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
occupational safety requirements that
 
04:00:13.229 --> 04:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
are similar to OSHA standards and
 
04:00:15.870 --> 04:00:15.880 align:start position:0%
representative you you as the sponsor
 
04:00:17.750 --> 04:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to be uh presenting
 
04:00:17.760 --> 04:00:19.429 align:start position:0%
you're going to be uh presenting
this

04:00:19.429 --> 04:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:00:23.189 --> 04:00:23.199 align:start position:0%
cool and do we have a no and do you have
 
04:00:25.910 --> 04:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
a pin card if you get a chance yeah when
 
04:00:28.389 --> 04:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
you get done please all right sir the
 
04:00:29.429 --> 04:00:29.439 align:start position:0%
floor is
 
04:00:33.590 --> 04:00:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:37.670 --> 04:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
you I think I'll start start off
 
04:00:40.030 --> 04:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
with I don't know why this place always
 
04:00:42.149 --> 04:00:42.159 align:start position:0%
makes me lose my voice but it
 
04:00:44.950 --> 04:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
does um
 
04:00:47.149 --> 04:00:47.159 align:start position:0%
one piece of uh information that is
 
04:00:51.630 --> 04:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
commonly not known is that
 
04:00:54.630 --> 04:00:54.640 align:start position:0%
um public sector workers are not covered
 
04:00:57.790 --> 04:00:57.800 align:start position:0%
by OIP um it's generally assumed that
 
04:01:00.950 --> 04:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
everybody's covered by OIP um and in
 
04:01:04.030 --> 04:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
some states everybody is covered by Osan
 
04:01:06.870 --> 04:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
um not in New Hampshire in New Hampshire
 
04:01:09.389 --> 04:01:09.399 align:start position:0%
all private sector employees are covered
 
04:01:12.469 --> 04:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
by Osha Osha and their safety
 
04:01:15.870 --> 04:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
standards um public sector workers are
 
04:01:18.030 --> 04:01:18.040 align:start position:0%
covered by the Department of Labor in
 
04:01:19.790 --> 04:01:19.800 align:start position:0%
its safety
 
04:01:19.800 --> 04:01:21.309 align:start position:0%
its safety
standards

04:01:21.309 --> 04:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
standards
 
04:01:24.830 --> 04:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
um it is undeniable that the OSHA
 
04:01:28.269 --> 04:01:28.279 align:start position:0%
standards are far more
 
04:01:30.990 --> 04:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
complete um than the department of labor
 
04:01:32.790 --> 04:01:32.800 align:start position:0%
standards um there's never been an
 
04:01:34.469 --> 04:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
argument from the Department on that
 
04:01:38.790 --> 04:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
point um the um with with that I'll I'll
 
04:01:40.309 --> 04:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
give you a little bit of History I I've
 
04:01:44.389 --> 04:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
been at this for a while um and
 
04:01:48.149 --> 04:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
um it uh goes back about five years um
 
04:01:48.159 --> 04:01:49.229 align:start position:0%
um it uh goes back about five years um
in

04:01:49.229 --> 04:01:49.239 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:01:53.149 --> 04:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
2020 um I sponsored HB
 
04:01:56.750 --> 04:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
1171 and it was designed to create a um
 
04:01:59.510 --> 04:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
OSHA state plan for New
 
04:02:02.670 --> 04:02:02.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh the state plan is a very
 
04:02:05.550 --> 04:02:05.560 align:start position:0%
involved process between the New
 
04:02:08.309 --> 04:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor and of the
 
04:02:14.149 --> 04:02:14.159 align:start position:0%
federal oia and um it uh it's it's a bit
 
04:02:18.229 --> 04:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
daunting frankly um and
 
04:02:20.550 --> 04:02:20.560 align:start position:0%
um in through the process of getting
 
04:02:22.990 --> 04:02:23.000 align:start position:0%
through that I mean I will admit that
 
04:02:25.750 --> 04:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
when I sponsored that bill I put it
 
04:02:28.189 --> 04:02:28.199 align:start position:0%
together in two
 
04:02:31.630 --> 04:02:31.640 align:start position:0%
weeks um I thought it was an important
 
04:02:34.990 --> 04:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
issue I thought it ought to be addressed
 
04:02:39.269 --> 04:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
um I was uh embarrassingly naive when it
 
04:02:42.830 --> 04:02:42.840 align:start position:0%
came to exactly what it inv involved
 
04:02:46.149 --> 04:02:46.159 align:start position:0%
um it uh event it eventually went
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
through but the uh Governor um vetoed it
 
04:02:54.349 --> 04:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
um I'm glad he did um in
 
04:02:58.870 --> 04:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
2021 um I had another idea I sponsored a
 
04:03:01.870 --> 04:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
bill that created a study committee to
 
04:03:04.429 --> 04:03:04.439 align:start position:0%
figure out exactly what went into
 
04:03:06.630 --> 04:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
creating an OSHA state
 
04:03:13.269 --> 04:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
plan um that bill um and and frankly um
 
04:03:15.870 --> 04:03:15.880 align:start position:0%
the the balance of power had shifted by
 
04:03:19.790 --> 04:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
that time um and um
 
04:03:23.469 --> 04:03:23.479 align:start position:0%
uh the other party um had taken uh
 
04:03:27.070 --> 04:03:27.080 align:start position:0%
control of House and Senate um
 
04:03:30.030 --> 04:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
but I was able to Prevail and in
 
04:03:32.830 --> 04:03:32.840 align:start position:0%
convincing folks that um a study
 
04:03:35.830 --> 04:03:35.840 align:start position:0%
committee was appropriate and needed and
 
04:03:38.469 --> 04:03:38.479 align:start position:0%
um it was and actually the governor had
 
04:03:40.590 --> 04:03:40.600 align:start position:0%
a signing ceremony for that study
 
04:03:44.309 --> 04:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
committee um so things were moving along
 
04:03:48.309 --> 04:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
in a different direction in
 
04:03:48.319 --> 04:03:50.149 align:start position:0%
in a different direction in
2022

04:03:50.149 --> 04:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
2022
 
04:03:55.429 --> 04:03:55.439 align:start position:0%
um I I filed HB 232 to adopt the and
 
04:03:56.630 --> 04:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
this this came out of the study
 
04:03:58.750 --> 04:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
committee the study committee uh
 
04:04:01.149 --> 04:04:01.159 align:start position:0%
consisted of um two Democrats and two
 
04:04:04.950 --> 04:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
Republicans myself and um uh Kevin
 
04:04:08.030 --> 04:04:08.040 align:start position:0%
Kavanaugh Senator Kavanaugh and uh
 
04:04:11.870 --> 04:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
chairman infantine at the time and um um
 
04:04:17.030 --> 04:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
representative evalani and um we uh came
 
04:04:20.030 --> 04:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
to a unanimous conclusion that the best
 
04:04:22.309 --> 04:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
thing to do was not create the state
 
04:04:26.309 --> 04:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
plan but instead to Simply adopt a
 
04:04:28.790 --> 04:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
section of the osia standards that best
 
04:04:32.830 --> 04:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
fit the New Hampshire public sector so
 
04:04:35.149 --> 04:04:35.159 align:start position:0%
our New Hampshire Department of Labor
 
04:04:38.269 --> 04:04:38.279 align:start position:0%
would still um oversee safety standards
 
04:04:42.269 --> 04:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
for public sector um but they would um
 
04:04:45.630 --> 04:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
have a a vast UPG grade on their um
 
04:04:49.030 --> 04:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
safety standards to um ocean
 
04:04:53.309 --> 04:04:53.319 align:start position:0%
standards um that um that bill passed
 
04:04:57.429 --> 04:04:57.439 align:start position:0%
the committee um no no I that's wrong um
 
04:05:00.030 --> 04:05:00.040 align:start position:0%
that bill was retained by the committee
 
04:05:02.189 --> 04:05:02.199 align:start position:0%
I was retained by the committee
 
04:05:05.229 --> 04:05:05.239 align:start position:0%
because for certain technical reasons
 
04:05:07.309 --> 04:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
the study committee was delayed in
 
04:05:12.030 --> 04:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
getting started um and um in the end we
 
04:05:14.550 --> 04:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
had not had not opportunity to hear from
 
04:05:15.910 --> 04:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of the St
 
04:05:19.070 --> 04:05:19.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholders um we got through the um
 
04:05:21.870 --> 04:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
the technical aspects of um uh adopting
 
04:05:23.670 --> 04:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
those standards but we really didn't
 
04:05:25.510 --> 04:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
hear from a lot of the employers and
 
04:05:29.830 --> 04:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
such and um they let us know it um in
 
04:05:31.670 --> 04:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
such a way that we figured they deserve
 
04:05:34.910 --> 04:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
that opportunity so we retained the bill
 
04:05:38.229 --> 04:05:38.239 align:start position:0%
and um in the fall we had a series of
 
04:05:41.710 --> 04:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
meetings with those stakeholders and we
 
04:05:44.590 --> 04:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
um uh we heard from them
 
04:05:46.630 --> 04:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
um we also worked with the Department of
 
04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
Labor um and I'm immensely grateful to
 
04:05:52.389 --> 04:05:52.399 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor for um doing
 
04:05:55.309 --> 04:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
what they did which was to revamp and
 
04:05:58.550 --> 04:05:58.560 align:start position:0%
amend the bill um in into the form that
 
04:05:59.670 --> 04:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
you see
 
04:06:05.790 --> 04:06:05.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:09.950 --> 04:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately HB 232 died on the
 
04:06:12.149 --> 04:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
table um it never received a vote in the
 
04:06:13.990 --> 04:06:14.000 align:start position:0%
house never made it to the Senate it
 
04:06:18.269 --> 04:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
didn't go to the governor um so being
 
04:06:22.030 --> 04:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
determined it's back um and it's u in
 
04:06:24.349 --> 04:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
the form it was
 
04:06:26.590 --> 04:06:26.600 align:start position:0%
before and I'd like to go through the
 
04:06:32.070 --> 04:06:32.080 align:start position:0%
key features of um HB now
 
04:06:35.229 --> 04:06:35.239 align:start position:0%
303 HB 303 directs the New Hampshire
 
04:06:37.550 --> 04:06:37.560 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor to develop standards
 
04:06:40.750 --> 04:06:40.760 align:start position:0%
through rul making that are this is key
 
04:06:44.910 --> 04:06:44.920 align:start position:0%
at least as effective as the ocean 19 10
 
04:06:48.510 --> 04:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
standards that phrase is the one that
 
04:06:52.429 --> 04:06:52.439 align:start position:0%
does a lot of work at least as
 
04:06:57.510 --> 04:06:57.520 align:start position:0%
effective it means we we put in a hefty
 
04:07:00.110 --> 04:07:00.120 align:start position:0%
dose of New Hampshire common sense into
 
04:07:01.229 --> 04:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
these safety
 
04:07:03.149 --> 04:07:03.159 align:start position:0%
standards for
 
04:07:05.349 --> 04:07:05.359 align:start position:0%
example we heard from the Department of
 
04:07:07.349 --> 04:07:07.359 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services that they have
 
04:07:10.910 --> 04:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
some very expensive um air testing
 
04:07:14.030 --> 04:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
equipment um designed and built in in
 
04:07:16.990 --> 04:07:17.000 align:start position:0%
Europe um and purchased by the
 
04:07:19.510 --> 04:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services it
 
04:07:22.030 --> 04:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
is highquality equipment does a great
 
04:07:26.429 --> 04:07:26.439 align:start position:0%
job it is not OSHA
 
04:07:29.670 --> 04:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
approved at least as effective takes
 
04:07:32.670 --> 04:07:32.680 align:start position:0%
care of that the Department of Labor can
 
04:07:34.670 --> 04:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
can go in and make the determination
 
04:07:36.149 --> 04:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
that there's nothing wrong with this
 
04:07:38.309 --> 04:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
equipment it doesn't have to be OS
 
04:07:40.389 --> 04:07:40.399 align:start position:0%
approved it just has to be as effective
 
04:07:44.269 --> 04:07:44.279 align:start position:0%
as o an OSHA approved system and on that
 
04:07:47.389 --> 04:07:47.399 align:start position:0%
basis they can approve it another
 
04:07:50.710 --> 04:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
example there is a town uh Hall
 
04:07:52.710 --> 04:07:52.720 align:start position:0%
somewhere down toward the SE Co I want
 
04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
to say e exitor but I can't remember
 
04:07:57.510 --> 04:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
which one exactly but one of the Town
 
04:08:00.630 --> 04:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
Halls they have a very historic building
 
04:08:03.870 --> 04:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
um with a big wooden front
 
04:08:08.550 --> 04:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
door um it is not up to OSHA fire
 
04:08:08.560 --> 04:08:10.349 align:start position:0%
door um it is not up to OSHA fire
standards

04:08:10.349 --> 04:08:10.359 align:start position:0%
standards
 
04:08:13.990 --> 04:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
but upon inspection it would work at
 
04:08:17.309 --> 04:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
least as well as an OSHA approved fire
 
04:08:20.750 --> 04:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
door um therefore our department of
 
04:08:22.990 --> 04:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
labor can go in using common sense and
 
04:08:25.590 --> 04:08:25.600 align:start position:0%
say this is not a hazard there's nothing
 
04:08:27.349 --> 04:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
wrong with it it just doesn't meet OSHA
 
04:08:31.189 --> 04:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
standards and we we can override that so
 
04:08:33.510 --> 04:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
wherever issues like that come up as
 
04:08:35.870 --> 04:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
long as it is at least as
 
04:08:40.630 --> 04:08:40.640 align:start position:0%
effective it's okay um and that would
 
04:08:44.229 --> 04:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
U help immensely
 
04:08:46.590 --> 04:08:46.600 align:start position:0%
the bill also provides for three
 
04:08:49.349 --> 04:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
provides three years for um the
 
04:08:51.710 --> 04:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
department to engage in its rul making
 
04:08:54.550 --> 04:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
and gearing up to be ready to uh
 
04:08:57.790 --> 04:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
Implement um the uh the new
 
04:09:00.469 --> 04:09:00.479 align:start position:0%
standards um I've been in communication
 
04:09:03.030 --> 04:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
with the department and the um in fact I
 
04:09:06.149 --> 04:09:06.159 align:start position:0%
met with them last week and
 
04:09:09.670 --> 04:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
um we're wondering if maybe three years
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
isn't quite enough perhaps four if the
 
04:09:14.149 --> 04:09:14.159 align:start position:0%
department feels that that type of
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
amendment would be appropriate um I'd be
 
04:09:20.630 --> 04:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
you know certainly open to it I I don't
 
04:09:23.710 --> 04:09:23.720 align:start position:0%
feel compelled to rush through this we
 
04:09:25.590 --> 04:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
want to get it done but we want to get
 
04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
it done right and we also want to have
 
04:09:32.229 --> 04:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
employers have enough time to um to get
 
04:09:34.590 --> 04:09:34.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it
 
04:09:39.349 --> 04:09:39.359 align:start position:0%
um also um in the rul making process um
 
04:09:41.870 --> 04:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
one of the goals of the department is to
 
04:09:44.269 --> 04:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
write rules
 
04:09:48.229 --> 04:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
that people can read um and understand
 
04:09:51.109 --> 04:09:51.119 align:start position:0%
um they do not have to use OSHA language
 
04:09:52.750 --> 04:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
and I've read some of the ocean
 
04:09:55.070 --> 04:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
standards maybe some of you have it's a
 
04:09:56.229 --> 04:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
04:09:59.670 --> 04:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
dense a little bit long um so they can
 
04:10:01.229 --> 04:10:01.239 align:start position:0%
boil it down into something that
 
04:10:03.950 --> 04:10:03.960 align:start position:0%
employers and employees can read and
 
04:10:05.950 --> 04:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
understand but it has to be at least as
 
04:10:08.109 --> 04:10:08.119 align:start position:0%
effective as the ocean um it doesn't
 
04:10:10.590 --> 04:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
have to be at least as confusing as the
 
04:10:14.309 --> 04:10:14.319 align:start position:0%
oosha standards so um that another um
 
04:10:14.319 --> 04:10:16.030 align:start position:0%
oosha standards so um that another um
important

04:10:16.030 --> 04:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:10:16.040 --> 04:10:18.750 align:start position:0%
important
piece

04:10:18.750 --> 04:10:18.760 align:start position:0%
piece
 
04:10:21.349 --> 04:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
um it also allows the department to
 
04:10:24.469 --> 04:10:24.479 align:start position:0%
determine um which standards are not
 
04:10:27.149 --> 04:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
relevant to public sector um Employers
 
04:10:29.750 --> 04:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and not have to write
 
04:10:33.750 --> 04:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
standards to to match no no reason to
 
04:10:36.149 --> 04:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
write rules that are not needed in New
 
04:10:38.550 --> 04:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um the department can
 
04:10:41.510 --> 04:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
figure that out and um where it's
 
04:10:44.670 --> 04:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to write rules they
 
04:10:44.680 --> 04:10:52.149 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to write rules they
don't

04:10:52.149 --> 04:10:52.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:54.630 --> 04:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
um it also directs the department to do
 
04:10:58.389 --> 04:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
an annual um review of the standards and
 
04:11:00.070 --> 04:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
determine if some of them need to need
 
04:11:01.830 --> 04:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
to be some new standards need to be
 
04:11:06.189 --> 04:11:06.199 align:start position:0%
implemented or if um some of the current
 
04:11:09.670 --> 04:11:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:11.790 --> 04:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
updated it also authorizes the
 
04:11:14.870 --> 04:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
department to hire six IAL inspectors in
 
04:11:17.670 --> 04:11:17.680 align:start position:0%
one clerical position
 
04:11:20.630 --> 04:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
um and it's key to know and I didn't
 
04:11:22.149 --> 04:11:22.159 align:start position:0%
know this until partway through this
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
process the Department of Labor is not
 
04:11:27.189 --> 04:11:27.199 align:start position:0%
funded through General funds Department
 
04:11:31.269 --> 04:11:31.279 align:start position:0%
of Labor is fully funded internally um
 
04:11:33.870 --> 04:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
through fees it collects uh I believe
 
04:11:36.070 --> 04:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
and the Deputy Commissioner can confirm
 
04:11:38.670 --> 04:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
this I believe the fees are um collected
 
04:11:41.070 --> 04:11:41.080 align:start position:0%
through uh workers comp insurance
 
04:11:44.389 --> 04:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
companies um but basically
 
04:11:46.910 --> 04:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
um those
 
04:11:49.790 --> 04:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
um those six there are seven new
 
04:11:52.990 --> 04:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
employees um would would use um would be
 
04:11:54.389 --> 04:11:54.399 align:start position:0%
funded through Department of Labor
 
04:11:56.830 --> 04:11:56.840 align:start position:0%
Administration fund or the Department of
 
04:11:59.950 --> 04:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
Labor restricted funds um so there would
 
04:12:01.349 --> 04:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
not need to be an appropriation I
 
04:12:03.389 --> 04:12:03.399 align:start position:0%
believe it would need to be approved by
 
04:12:05.469 --> 04:12:05.479 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee but it would not
 
04:12:09.070 --> 04:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:11.429 --> 04:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
funds a few other key
 
04:12:14.950 --> 04:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
factors um I mentioned earlier that the
 
04:12:16.910 --> 04:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
department has four years to uh put the
 
04:12:19.550 --> 04:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
rules together um employers will
 
04:12:22.229 --> 04:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
additionally have those four years to
 
04:12:25.030 --> 04:12:25.040 align:start position:0%
get used to the idea and get educated by
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor on changes that
 
04:12:27.720 --> 04:12:29.550 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor on changes that
are

04:12:29.550 --> 04:12:29.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:12:33.910 --> 04:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
happening the department uh uh the
 
04:12:36.830 --> 04:12:36.840 align:start position:0%
department always has and will continue
 
04:12:38.710 --> 04:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
to work with employers and I confirmed
 
04:12:40.950 --> 04:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
this again last week to work with
 
04:12:42.910 --> 04:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
employers to meet safety standards isn't
 
04:12:45.309 --> 04:12:45.319 align:start position:0%
in a reasonable way penalties are
 
04:12:47.870 --> 04:12:47.880 align:start position:0%
generally not implemented If an employer
 
04:12:51.269 --> 04:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
makes a good faith effort to um comply
 
04:12:53.590 --> 04:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
so the department might do a safety
 
04:12:56.550 --> 04:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
inspection come in and find that um
 
04:12:59.550 --> 04:12:59.560 align:start position:0%
there's a violation of some
 
04:12:59.560 --> 04:13:01.229 align:start position:0%
there's a violation of some
standard

04:13:01.229 --> 04:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
standard
 
04:13:03.830 --> 04:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
they'll they may very well warn the the
 
04:13:07.990 --> 04:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
employer of what the um fine um might
 
04:13:10.349 --> 04:13:10.359 align:start position:0%
be and then
 
04:13:12.830 --> 04:13:12.840 align:start position:0%
they have a timetable as to when the
 
04:13:14.750 --> 04:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
correct will take place if the
 
04:13:16.710 --> 04:13:16.720 align:start position:0%
correction takes place in a timely and
 
04:13:19.950 --> 04:13:19.960 align:start position:0%
effective way the the um fines are
 
04:13:23.670 --> 04:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
generally waved so it's not a punitive
 
04:13:27.349 --> 04:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
system I would think that if the um
 
04:13:30.590 --> 04:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
violation is ignored nothing is done and
 
04:13:32.510 --> 04:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
the department comes back and finds that
 
04:13:34.910 --> 04:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
the the violation is still occurring
 
04:13:37.429 --> 04:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
yeah they ought to be fined and that's
 
04:13:37.439 --> 04:13:41.870 align:start position:0%
yeah they ought to be fined and that's
appropriate

04:13:41.870 --> 04:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:46.349 --> 04:13:46.359 align:start position:0%
um the department has also um always
 
04:13:48.149 --> 04:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
understood that compliance might need to
 
04:13:50.590 --> 04:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
accommodate a budget cycle for a public
 
04:13:54.189 --> 04:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
uh employer um you can't just uh if if
 
04:13:56.189 --> 04:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
if there is an expense if there's a
 
04:13:58.309 --> 04:13:58.319 align:start position:0%
lighting need or something um it might
 
04:13:59.870 --> 04:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
have to go through the next budget cycle
 
04:14:01.469 --> 04:14:01.479 align:start position:0%
and and the department figures out a way
 
04:14:05.030 --> 04:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
to have an interim uh solution um in the
 
04:14:09.070 --> 04:14:09.080 align:start position:0%
meantime um there have been um issues
 
04:14:11.429 --> 04:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
raised about unfunded
 
04:14:13.550 --> 04:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
mandates um
 
04:14:16.630 --> 04:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
the uh former deputy um commissioner
 
04:14:17.870 --> 04:14:17.880 align:start position:0%
those of us who have been around for a
 
04:14:22.109 --> 04:14:22.119 align:start position:0%
while remember Rudy Ogden um now judge
 
04:14:27.070 --> 04:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
Ogden um but um he made it very clear
 
04:14:29.670 --> 04:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
that under current circumstances the
 
04:14:31.469 --> 04:14:31.479 align:start position:0%
department is put in a position of
 
04:14:33.830 --> 04:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
informing employers that you've got a
 
04:14:36.149 --> 04:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
safety violation that might cost you
 
04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
some money to um to rectify it's always
 
04:14:41.389 --> 04:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
had to do this and it's always had to
 
04:14:44.070 --> 04:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to make that work work
 
04:14:47.830 --> 04:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
um keep the workers safe don't spend
 
04:14:47.840 --> 04:14:48.790 align:start position:0%
um keep the workers safe don't spend
money

04:14:48.790 --> 04:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
money
 
04:14:52.109 --> 04:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily but when necessary you've
 
04:14:54.750 --> 04:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
got to spend money and and frankly it's
 
04:14:57.349 --> 04:14:57.359 align:start position:0%
always been found that um complying with
 
04:14:59.870 --> 04:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
safety standards is not an expense it's
 
04:15:02.830 --> 04:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
it's a savings because not having a safe
 
04:15:05.429 --> 04:15:05.439 align:start position:0%
workplace is far more expensive uh for
 
04:15:07.670 --> 04:15:07.680 align:start position:0%
employers than the
 
04:15:10.269 --> 04:15:10.279 align:start position:0%
opposite and I guess the the last item
 
04:15:13.349 --> 04:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
is that um at present
 
04:15:16.389 --> 04:15:16.399 align:start position:0%
because the current safety standards has
 
04:15:20.750 --> 04:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
holes in it substantial holes in it um
 
04:15:24.389 --> 04:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
when a safety inspection takes place and
 
04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
there is a condition that is clearly
 
04:15:30.149 --> 04:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
unsafe however it is not covered by our
 
04:15:32.070 --> 04:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
current Department of Labor safety
 
04:15:35.229 --> 04:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
standards um they've got sort of a uh
 
04:15:38.750 --> 04:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
safety valve um it's the general duties
 
04:15:41.429 --> 04:15:41.439 align:start position:0%
Clause um and that General duties Clause
 
04:15:43.870 --> 04:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
basically I I'll paraphrase I can't
 
04:15:45.870 --> 04:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
quote it exactly but basically it says
 
04:15:48.830 --> 04:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
you ought to have a safe workplace um
 
04:15:48.840 --> 04:15:49.870 align:start position:0%
you ought to have a safe workplace um
and

04:15:49.870 --> 04:15:49.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:15:53.229 --> 04:15:53.239 align:start position:0%
um and they can lean on that when
 
04:15:56.389 --> 04:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
necessary to uh to say you've got to fix
 
04:15:59.349 --> 04:15:59.359 align:start position:0%
this um unsafe situation and often
 
04:16:01.990 --> 04:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
they'll lean on the OSHA standards to uh
 
04:16:05.189 --> 04:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
sort of justify what they're doing um or
 
04:16:07.149 --> 04:16:07.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes other other standards in in
 
04:16:11.269 --> 04:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
the industry um but I see this that as
 
04:16:13.469 --> 04:16:13.479 align:start position:0%
being grossly unfair
 
04:16:15.149 --> 04:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
um an employer should be able to read
 
04:16:17.429 --> 04:16:17.439 align:start position:0%
the standard and comply with the
 
04:16:19.870 --> 04:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
standard the employer shouldn't be
 
04:16:22.830 --> 04:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
finding out that um there's a standard
 
04:16:25.870 --> 04:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
that OSHA's got that New Hampshire is
 
04:16:28.510 --> 04:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
going to lean on to uh through the
 
04:16:31.750 --> 04:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
general duties Clause um to hold a a uh
 
04:16:34.830 --> 04:16:34.840 align:start position:0%
employer um responsible for an unsafe
 
04:16:36.550 --> 04:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
situation they ought to know what the
 
04:16:38.710 --> 04:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
standards are and through upgrading our
 
04:16:41.550 --> 04:16:41.560 align:start position:0%
standards to standards that are at least
 
04:16:44.950 --> 04:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
as effective as the oosha standards
 
04:16:46.870 --> 04:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
everyone will know what the standards
 
04:16:51.229 --> 04:16:51.239 align:start position:0%
are and will be able to um read them
 
04:16:55.070 --> 04:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
understand them and Implement them um
 
04:16:57.189 --> 04:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
I'm very proud of where where this is
 
04:17:00.269 --> 04:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
now I'm uh again very grateful to the
 
04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor they're the ones
 
04:17:03.030 --> 04:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
that came up with the at least as
 
04:17:06.189 --> 04:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
effective line and that is um that was a
 
04:17:08.870 --> 04:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
godsend that makes this work so much
 
04:17:14.030 --> 04:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
better um I uh very hopeful that we can
 
04:17:16.469 --> 04:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
come up with a bipartisan support for
 
04:17:19.469 --> 04:17:19.479 align:start position:0%
this um when I first presented this to
 
04:17:22.109 --> 04:17:22.119 align:start position:0%
Chairman infantine he said yeah I'm with
 
04:17:25.229 --> 04:17:25.239 align:start position:0%
you I'm a safety guy and he did workers
 
04:17:28.990 --> 04:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
comp uh insurance and he had lost um
 
04:17:32.229 --> 04:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
workers to on the job uh
 
04:17:37.349 --> 04:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
injuries on job fatalities and um he he
 
04:17:40.750 --> 04:17:40.760 align:start position:0%
took he takes um safety very seriously
 
04:17:43.590 --> 04:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
and um um he was was a partner through
 
04:17:45.670 --> 04:17:45.680 align:start position:0%
much much of this process as was
 
04:17:47.950 --> 04:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
representative avalani and I am grateful
 
04:17:51.550 --> 04:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
for their um their backing um so with
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
that I'll uh take any questions you've
 
04:17:56.510 --> 04:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
got F the first of all just thank you
 
04:17:59.389 --> 04:17:59.399 align:start position:0%
for a ton of work it's hard as you work
 
04:18:02.469 --> 04:18:02.479 align:start position:0%
over four years which we've all done to
 
04:18:04.590 --> 04:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
try to make it work so I I can see
 
04:18:07.229 --> 04:18:07.239 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of been a lot of work uh
 
04:18:07.239 --> 04:18:08.349 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of been a lot of work uh
representative

04:18:08.349 --> 04:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:18:10.269 --> 04:18:10.279 align:start position:0%
Granger thank you Mr
 
04:18:12.550 --> 04:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
chair so when you originally introduced
 
04:18:14.670 --> 04:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
this Bill back in the day and you had
 
04:18:16.389 --> 04:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
the study committee you had a senator as
 
04:18:19.309 --> 04:18:19.319 align:start position:0%
part of that and if I remember correctly
 
04:18:20.910 --> 04:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
and I could I I could be misremembering
 
04:18:23.309 --> 04:18:23.319 align:start position:0%
it one of the problems that with the
 
04:18:26.670 --> 04:18:26.680 align:start position:0%
bill last year when we were executing it
 
04:18:30.030 --> 04:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
or executing it was that we found
 
04:18:31.510 --> 04:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
information that the Senate was not
 
04:18:34.389 --> 04:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
going to pass the Bill do we have more
 
04:18:36.309 --> 04:18:36.319 align:start position:0%
Senate Buy in this year or do you not
 
04:18:36.319 --> 04:18:37.910 align:start position:0%
Senate Buy in this year or do you not
know

04:18:37.910 --> 04:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:18:41.910 --> 04:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
or I don't recollect that the Senate was
 
04:18:44.389 --> 04:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
uh put I I I'm not saying it would have
 
04:18:46.550 --> 04:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
been a uh Cakewalk at the sen in the
 
04:18:50.790 --> 04:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
Senate um but um uh I don't recall that
 
04:18:53.309 --> 04:18:53.319 align:start position:0%
the senate had specific
 
04:18:57.630 --> 04:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
problems okay okay represent kahill
 
04:19:00.269 --> 04:19:00.279 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Mr chair and thank you
 
04:19:02.349 --> 04:19:02.359 align:start position:0%
representative uh were you present in
 
04:19:04.870 --> 04:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
the room earlier when we heard from an
 
04:19:07.429 --> 04:19:07.439 align:start position:0%
attorney representing uh insurance
 
04:19:10.070 --> 04:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
companies and he stated that our rates
 
04:19:12.189 --> 04:19:12.199 align:start position:0%
have gone down and our safety record has
 
04:19:14.830 --> 04:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
gone down due to improved safety
 
04:19:17.109 --> 04:19:17.119 align:start position:0%
practices and would you would you infer
 
04:19:18.870 --> 04:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
that safety practices are improved when
 
04:19:21.510 --> 04:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
you have better safety standards I think
 
04:19:24.950 --> 04:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
I already testified that U um strong
 
04:19:28.229 --> 04:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
safety standards saves money and he was
 
04:19:29.670 --> 04:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
talking about saving money on workers
 
04:19:32.309 --> 04:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
comp so that's part of the savings thank
 
04:19:34.149 --> 04:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:19:36.790 --> 04:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
labr thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:19:38.670 --> 04:19:38.680 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um you had
 
04:19:39.870 --> 04:19:39.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned the wooden door that wasn't
 
04:19:42.469 --> 04:19:42.479 align:start position:0%
ocean compliant do you see this driving
 
04:19:44.830 --> 04:19:44.840 align:start position:0%
this OSHA upgrade do you see this OSHA
 
04:19:49.550 --> 04:19:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:52.750 --> 04:19:52.760 align:start position:0%
costs well I I
 
04:19:55.910 --> 04:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
guess if there is a unsafe
 
04:19:59.149 --> 04:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
situation um that needs to be corrected
 
04:20:00.950 --> 04:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
that could have a cost effect but it's
 
04:20:02.590 --> 04:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
also going to improve safety standards
 
04:20:04.870 --> 04:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
and I did say in the in the wooden door
 
04:20:06.870 --> 04:20:06.880 align:start position:0%
that if the Department of Labor would in
 
04:20:10.269 --> 04:20:10.279 align:start position:0%
all likelihood let that stand um because
 
04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
it it was as effective as a OA approved
 
04:20:19.269 --> 04:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:22.109 --> 04:20:22.119 align:start position:0%
door follow
 
04:20:24.309 --> 04:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
up what is the current safety
 
04:20:26.469 --> 04:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
requirements by do today when they do an
 
04:20:28.389 --> 04:20:28.399 align:start position:0%
inspection at somebody's yard do you
 
04:20:30.269 --> 04:20:30.279 align:start position:0%
know what they are meaning do they do
 
04:20:31.790 --> 04:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
they require certain checklist of things
 
04:20:33.710 --> 04:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
you have to have whether it's a safety
 
04:20:36.670 --> 04:20:36.680 align:start position:0%
manual on the Shelf in the office or
 
04:20:39.070 --> 04:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
certain items that the uh the staff
 
04:20:40.590 --> 04:20:40.600 align:start position:0%
would have to have what is their safety
 
04:20:42.189 --> 04:20:42.199 align:start position:0%
protocol you familiar with those I would
 
04:20:44.309 --> 04:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
defer to to the department on that okay
 
04:20:44.319 --> 04:20:46.030 align:start position:0%
defer to to the department on that okay
thank

04:20:46.030 --> 04:20:46.040 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:20:49.950 --> 04:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
you further questions so I I got a
 
04:20:52.550 --> 04:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
couple of things and and and again that
 
04:20:56.229 --> 04:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
the work seems very exhaustive but I've
 
04:20:58.389 --> 04:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
worked with OSHA on several cases and
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
the volumes of rules regulations and
 
04:21:02.550 --> 04:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
requirements and OSHA could fill this
 
04:21:02.560 --> 04:21:03.990 align:start position:0%
requirements and OSHA could fill this
entire

04:21:03.990 --> 04:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
entire
 
04:21:08.590 --> 04:21:08.600 align:start position:0%
room is it your assessment that the
 
04:21:11.550 --> 04:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
wording that it makes sense for New
 
04:21:15.510 --> 04:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire will will prevent us from
 
04:21:18.510 --> 04:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
overwhelming My Town Hall was built in
 
04:21:20.870 --> 04:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
1819 I will guarantee you that the
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
lights the vents the windows the hatched
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
hatched doors all that stuff is going to
 
04:21:30.750 --> 04:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
violate some sort of ocean regulation
 
04:21:33.630 --> 04:21:33.640 align:start position:0%
and and how do we ensure that we don't
 
04:21:36.070 --> 04:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden put on our
 
04:21:38.750 --> 04:21:38.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities this overwhelming
 
04:21:40.870 --> 04:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
requirement to
 
04:21:43.710 --> 04:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
meet such volume of Regulation that
 
04:21:45.309 --> 04:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
that's my biggest concern well I I I
 
04:21:49.189 --> 04:21:49.199 align:start position:0%
think these Town Hall issues are often
 
04:21:51.950 --> 04:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
um excuse me building standards more
 
04:21:56.469 --> 04:21:56.479 align:start position:0%
than OSHA standards um but
 
04:21:59.510 --> 04:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
um I think the way this this bill has
 
04:22:03.950 --> 04:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
been structured um where it costs a town
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
or public entity money it's going to be
 
04:22:09.469 --> 04:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
money well spent I think the Department
 
04:22:11.070 --> 04:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
of Labor can um
 
04:22:14.349 --> 04:22:14.359 align:start position:0%
avoid um creating rules that are going
 
04:22:17.309 --> 04:22:17.319 align:start position:0%
to um
 
04:22:20.790 --> 04:22:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh for Force um they're going to create
 
04:22:23.469 --> 04:22:23.479 align:start position:0%
rules that will improve safety that's a
 
04:22:25.950 --> 04:22:25.960 align:start position:0%
good thing it's also a good thing that
 
04:22:27.630 --> 04:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
they will not create rules that would
 
04:22:31.510 --> 04:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
simply spend money because uh of uh a
 
04:22:33.670 --> 04:22:33.680 align:start position:0%
silly requirement they can get rid of
 
04:22:36.030 --> 04:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
the silly requirements and actually
 
04:22:38.670 --> 04:22:38.680 align:start position:0%
focus in on safety I I'm convinced of
 
04:22:42.590 --> 04:22:42.600 align:start position:0%
that um and I
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
been meeting with the Department enough
 
04:22:47.269 --> 04:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
that I I've got great confidence that um
 
04:22:50.389 --> 04:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
they can do the job um and um and we'll
 
04:22:53.630 --> 04:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
be a better State when it's done okay
 
04:22:57.910 --> 04:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you see no questions oh I'm sorry
 
04:23:04.469 --> 04:23:04.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:07.870 --> 04:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
McKenzie yes uh you can speak but then
 
04:23:10.149 --> 04:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
you cannot return to ask a question the
 
04:23:13.590 --> 04:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
I think the rule is if I if I may that
 
04:23:17.990 --> 04:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
if if you speak from um if you testify
 
04:23:20.109 --> 04:23:20.119 align:start position:0%
you can't ask questions that's correct
 
04:23:22.229 --> 04:23:22.239 align:start position:0%
um but if you are
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor um you can go ahead as long
 
04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
as you don't
 
04:23:27.870 --> 04:23:27.880 align:start position:0%
testify okay I thought you you asked if
 
04:23:30.910 --> 04:23:30.920 align:start position:0%
you could testify can I I guess can I
 
04:23:30.920 --> 04:23:32.389 align:start position:0%
you could testify can I I guess can I
ask

04:23:32.389 --> 04:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
ask
 
04:23:34.590 --> 04:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
questions have I ever denied you I've
 
04:23:37.389 --> 04:23:37.399 align:start position:0%
asking a question but I believe me repr
 
04:23:39.070 --> 04:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
McKenzie I'm keeping tabs and you're
 
04:23:41.510 --> 04:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
number two but yes go ahead and ask your
 
04:23:41.520 --> 04:23:42.950 align:start position:0%
number two but yes go ahead and ask your
question

04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:23:45.389 --> 04:23:45.399 align:start position:0%
uh so the question
 
04:23:50.630 --> 04:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
is the question is um uh when did this
 
04:23:50.640 --> 04:23:52.229 align:start position:0%
is the question is um uh when did this
standard

04:23:52.229 --> 04:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
standard
 
04:23:55.590 --> 04:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
pass um that covered public employees
 
04:23:58.469 --> 04:23:58.479 align:start position:0%
and you may not know the answer but so
 
04:24:02.189 --> 04:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
and the department may know it so as I
 
04:24:04.269 --> 04:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
understand it looking at the rules the
 
04:24:05.910 --> 04:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
original rules were promulgated they
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
were authorized in ' 86 they expired
 
04:24:11.229 --> 04:24:11.239 align:start position:0%
they went back in okay are you asking a
 
04:24:13.109 --> 04:24:13.119 align:start position:0%
question or are you giving
 
04:24:15.109 --> 04:24:15.119 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get to a question I guess
 
04:24:17.269 --> 04:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
okay but I think I'm I don't think he's
 
04:24:18.550 --> 04:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
going to I think I'm putting him on the
 
04:24:21.309 --> 04:24:21.319 align:start position:0%
spot so how about put me on the spot
 
04:24:23.349 --> 04:24:23.359 align:start position:0%
okay well the the question is the the
 
04:24:25.950 --> 04:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
evolution of this standard are you are
 
04:24:28.870 --> 04:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
you uh the current standard 1400 rules
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
are you familiar with the evolution of
 
04:24:34.590 --> 04:24:34.600 align:start position:0%
this and how many times has expired and
 
04:24:36.309 --> 04:24:36.319 align:start position:0%
it expires every 10 years and needs to
 
04:24:39.030 --> 04:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
be uh reopt it the department is working
 
04:24:42.429 --> 04:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
on um a read-option right now and uh
 
04:24:43.550 --> 04:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
after meeting with them last week
 
04:24:45.870 --> 04:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
they're looking at five sections of the
 
04:24:49.590 --> 04:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
rules to um be uh revised um but every
 
04:24:51.950 --> 04:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
10 every 10 years they have to be reopt
 
04:24:55.030 --> 04:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
it um so that we're in that process
 
04:24:56.790 --> 04:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
right now great thank you thank you okay
 
04:24:59.670 --> 04:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
good thank you sir all right um thank
 
04:25:01.830 --> 04:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
you for your oh I'm sorry representative
 
04:25:04.750 --> 04:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
Hall go ahead thank you Mr chair uh
 
04:25:07.510 --> 04:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Sullivan my
 
04:25:09.309 --> 04:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
question you're as a few people have
 
04:25:11.990 --> 04:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
commented bringing in OSHA comes with
 
04:25:13.750 --> 04:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
the whole whole lot of baggage and a
 
04:25:15.750 --> 04:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
whole lot of paperwork and regulations
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
can you talk about some of the specific
 
04:25:20.950 --> 04:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
issues that you're aware of that this
 
04:25:24.070 --> 04:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
would address what the benefits are of
 
04:25:26.710 --> 04:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
this like specifics you know like rates
 
04:25:30.349 --> 04:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
of injury that kind of thing I'm glad
 
04:25:33.630 --> 04:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
you Ed the phrase bringing in OIP we are
 
04:25:37.630 --> 04:25:37.640 align:start position:0%
not bringing in OIP um way back when we
 
04:25:41.349 --> 04:25:41.359 align:start position:0%
did the study committee it was um
 
04:25:43.349 --> 04:25:43.359 align:start position:0%
specifically decid Ed that we did not
 
04:25:46.189 --> 04:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
want to have an O OSHA state plan
 
04:25:48.389 --> 04:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
because um we wanted to do it the New
 
04:25:51.070 --> 04:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way um what we are doing is we
 
04:25:53.990 --> 04:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
are mirroring New Hampshire safety
 
04:25:58.269 --> 04:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
regulation on making it equivalent to um
 
04:26:02.710 --> 04:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
the oosha standards um and
 
04:26:04.950 --> 04:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
um I can give one example there there
 
04:26:08.429 --> 04:26:08.439 align:start position:0%
are no electrical standards in the um uh
 
04:26:11.870 --> 04:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
Department Department of Labor um uh
 
04:26:15.429 --> 04:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
standard s um obviously there are many
 
04:26:18.550 --> 04:26:18.560 align:start position:0%
electrical um safety issues but in the
 
04:26:20.349 --> 04:26:20.359 align:start position:0%
in the department of labor standards if
 
04:26:22.910 --> 04:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
I if I I recall correctly and I hope the
 
04:26:24.269 --> 04:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner will correct me if
 
04:26:26.429 --> 04:26:26.439 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but I don't believe there are
 
04:26:28.790 --> 04:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
any electrical standards there so it's
 
04:26:32.189 --> 04:26:32.199 align:start position:0%
just a g gaping hole that we need to
 
04:26:35.870 --> 04:26:35.880 align:start position:0%
fill follow up but my question is more
 
04:26:38.349 --> 04:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
are there concrete examples of workplace
 
04:26:40.189 --> 04:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
injuries lost work that sort of thing
 
04:26:42.269 --> 04:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
that this would address uh the
 
04:26:43.990 --> 04:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
inspiration for this
 
04:26:47.550 --> 04:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
bill um was a worker and I believe it
 
04:26:50.429 --> 04:26:50.439 align:start position:0%
was the town of Northwood who
 
04:26:55.950 --> 04:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
um was engaged a town a town worker
 
04:27:01.030 --> 04:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
um they were trying to move a um uh I
 
04:27:03.870 --> 04:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
think I think it was a large trailer and
 
04:27:08.229 --> 04:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
they're using um a bucket loader you two
 
04:27:09.790 --> 04:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
pieces of he heavy equipment I'm not
 
04:27:12.389 --> 04:27:12.399 align:start position:0%
sure exactly what they were
 
04:27:12.399 --> 04:27:14.030 align:start position:0%
sure exactly what they were
the

04:27:14.030 --> 04:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:17.429 --> 04:27:17.439 align:start position:0%
um the worker was I believe acting as a
 
04:27:20.990 --> 04:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
flagger um and people lost track of
 
04:27:23.389 --> 04:27:23.399 align:start position:0%
where other people were he was crushed
 
04:27:24.710 --> 04:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
between the trailer and one of the
 
04:27:27.229 --> 04:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
pieces of heavy equipment and was
 
04:27:27.239 --> 04:27:29.510 align:start position:0%
pieces of heavy equipment and was
killed

04:27:29.510 --> 04:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
killed
 
04:27:31.630 --> 04:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
um that one
 
04:27:34.790 --> 04:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
death I think is enough to justify doing
 
04:27:38.389 --> 04:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
this um I I don't personally have
 
04:27:40.710 --> 04:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
percentages and numbers that I can
 
04:27:42.349 --> 04:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
provide to you uh the department might
 
04:27:44.189 --> 04:27:44.199 align:start position:0%
be able to they do all the workers comp
 
04:27:48.070 --> 04:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
so they would they would know um but uh
 
04:27:51.149 --> 04:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
I don't have the statistics but
 
04:27:54.109 --> 04:27:54.119 align:start position:0%
um that that was the motivation for and
 
04:27:57.109 --> 04:27:57.119 align:start position:0%
frankly we had um his daughter came to
 
04:27:59.870 --> 04:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
testify before this committee um two or
 
04:28:01.309 --> 04:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
three different times unfortunately
 
04:28:04.429 --> 04:28:04.439 align:start position:0%
she's passed um and uh isn't here
 
04:28:07.229 --> 04:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
anymore she actually dedicated her life
 
04:28:11.550 --> 04:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
to worker safety she um got an education
 
04:28:14.670 --> 04:28:14.680 align:start position:0%
and uh frankly was um um was in the
 
04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
process of um Basics she worked for a
 
04:28:20.590 --> 04:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
company that went into um New Hampshire
 
04:28:25.870 --> 04:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
um uh companies and helped them um
 
04:28:28.070 --> 04:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
create uh safety programs that would
 
04:28:31.469 --> 04:28:31.479 align:start position:0%
help and so it was uh that was part of
 
04:28:31.479 --> 04:28:33.269 align:start position:0%
help and so it was uh that was part of
the

04:28:33.269 --> 04:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:28:36.429 --> 04:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
inspiration and representative King
 
04:28:38.630 --> 04:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so a question on
 
04:28:40.269 --> 04:28:40.279 align:start position:0%
the current rules the Department of
 
04:28:42.790 --> 04:28:42.800 align:start position:0%
Labor has did the committee study how
 
04:28:45.389 --> 04:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
detailed uh how much changes there were
 
04:28:49.109 --> 04:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
from what the OSHA rules are currently I
 
04:28:52.950 --> 04:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
should have said that um the department
 
04:28:56.269 --> 04:28:56.279 align:start position:0%
leading up to the um work of the study
 
04:29:00.550 --> 04:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
committee they spent hours and hours and
 
04:29:02.710 --> 04:29:02.720 align:start position:0%
did a detailed side by side and I can
 
04:29:05.189 --> 04:29:05.199 align:start position:0%
share this um with the committee if it
 
04:29:07.349 --> 04:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
would if it's desirable and I would just
 
04:29:08.990 --> 04:29:09.000 align:start position:0%
share there was actually three sections
 
04:29:11.670 --> 04:29:11.680 align:start position:0%
of oal rules the 1910 rules were the
 
04:29:13.109 --> 04:29:13.119 align:start position:0%
ones that we thought were most
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate um and
 
04:29:18.269 --> 04:29:18.279 align:start position:0%
uh the department went through all of
 
04:29:20.349 --> 04:29:20.359 align:start position:0%
the oosha rules all of the the New
 
04:29:22.349 --> 04:29:22.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Department of Labor rules did
 
04:29:25.630 --> 04:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
a side-by-side comparison in some cases
 
04:29:29.389 --> 04:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
the department had um rules that uh had
 
04:29:31.309 --> 04:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
similar rules with OSHA other times
 
04:29:32.630 --> 04:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
there's just no rule at all in New
 
04:29:34.630 --> 04:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and they went completely
 
04:29:38.189 --> 04:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
through that so they are well prepared
 
04:29:41.750 --> 04:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
to uh to do the work um and I'd be ha
 
04:29:43.750 --> 04:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
I'll just just warn you it's a big
 
04:29:46.109 --> 04:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
file um but I'd be happy to share that
 
04:29:49.510 --> 04:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
with the committee it um it's
 
04:29:51.710 --> 04:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
uh it's just a little bit tricky opening
 
04:29:55.229 --> 04:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
at the first time I as as requested if
 
04:29:56.550 --> 04:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
so if people requested if you could
 
04:29:58.149 --> 04:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
share that that would be great I will do
 
04:30:00.469 --> 04:30:00.479 align:start position:0%
that and represent thank you Mr
 
04:30:02.910 --> 04:30:02.920 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking the
 
04:30:06.309 --> 04:30:06.319 align:start position:0%
question in your bill here you're
 
04:30:08.790 --> 04:30:08.800 align:start position:0%
envisioning up to six new inspectors
 
04:30:12.429 --> 04:30:12.439 align:start position:0%
labor inspectors to be funded and and my
 
04:30:14.590 --> 04:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
question to you is if the Department of
 
04:30:17.670 --> 04:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
Labor already has a set number of
 
04:30:20.349 --> 04:30:20.359 align:start position:0%
regulations standards in
 
04:30:22.910 --> 04:30:22.920 align:start position:0%
place those are being currently enforced
 
04:30:26.630 --> 04:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
by the current uh staff levels you're
 
04:30:28.790 --> 04:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
asking what you want to do as I
 
04:30:30.149 --> 04:30:30.159 align:start position:0%
understand is to change those
 
04:30:31.910 --> 04:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
regulations to make them much more
 
04:30:33.750 --> 04:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
effective much more strict but there's
 
04:30:35.550 --> 04:30:35.560 align:start position:0%
still going to be a number of
 
04:30:37.710 --> 04:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
regulations in place just they're going
 
04:30:38.710 --> 04:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
to be
 
04:30:41.189 --> 04:30:41.199 align:start position:0%
different uh are you is your purpose
 
04:30:43.030 --> 04:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
here to
 
04:30:46.269 --> 04:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
uh wild or drastically
 
04:30:49.550 --> 04:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
increase um work site investigations and
 
04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
inspections by adding the staff um these
 
04:30:56.149 --> 04:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
are not my my intentions the six
 
04:30:58.189 --> 04:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
additional inspectors was suggested by
 
04:31:00.750 --> 04:31:00.760 align:start position:0%
the department um and so I I think I'll
 
04:31:03.510 --> 04:31:03.520 align:start position:0%
defer that to the department to let them
 
04:31:06.030 --> 04:31:06.040 align:start position:0%
indicate exactly um how they will
 
04:31:07.349 --> 04:31:07.359 align:start position:0%
operate what they're I think one of the
 
04:31:10.429 --> 04:31:10.439 align:start position:0%
things they're expected to do is um to
 
04:31:12.349 --> 04:31:12.359 align:start position:0%
help employers understand the safety
 
04:31:14.910 --> 04:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
standards um and get them ready to um
 
04:31:16.830 --> 04:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
Implement them so that they're they'll
 
04:31:18.590 --> 04:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
be uh doing a fair bit of work bu
 
04:31:20.910 --> 04:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
building up to it um but again the
 
04:31:24.030 --> 04:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
department can it was their idea so I'll
 
04:31:27.990 --> 04:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
let them explain it okay and thank you
 
04:31:29.950 --> 04:31:29.960 align:start position:0%
all right good question all right sir
 
04:31:31.510 --> 04:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for introducing the
 
04:31:34.710 --> 04:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
bill and I'd like to call Miss Mary bour
 
04:31:34.720 --> 04:31:49.510 align:start position:0%
bill and I'd like to call Miss Mary bour
please

04:31:49.510 --> 04:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:51.030 --> 04:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
and ma'am if you could State your your
 
04:32:06.950 --> 04:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:09.229 --> 04:32:09.239 align:start position:0%
please so honorable members thank you
 
04:32:13.070 --> 04:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
for giving me the opportunity here this
 
04:32:15.670 --> 04:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
um I have over thank you very much I
 
04:32:17.469 --> 04:32:17.479 align:start position:0%
have over 20 years of experience in
 
04:32:19.109 --> 04:32:19.119 align:start position:0%
Facilities Management both in the
 
04:32:21.349 --> 04:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
private and public sector and while I
 
04:32:24.189 --> 04:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
represent Sullivan County today the New
 
04:32:26.309 --> 04:32:26.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of counties
 
04:32:29.229 --> 04:32:29.239 align:start position:0%
legislative committee has reviewed hb303
 
04:32:30.870 --> 04:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
and all New Hampshire counties share
 
04:32:33.590 --> 04:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
concerns regarding its impact this bill
 
04:32:36.309 --> 04:32:36.319 align:start position:0%
mandates OSHA level safety standards for
 
04:32:38.510 --> 04:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
public employees presenting significant
 
04:32:40.670 --> 04:32:40.680 align:start position:0%
financial and operational challenges for
 
04:32:42.590 --> 04:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
local governments and
 
04:32:46.590 --> 04:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers hb303 does create an unfunded
 
04:32:48.830 --> 04:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
mandate in Staffing burdens counties
 
04:32:50.590 --> 04:32:50.600 align:start position:0%
will need to hire additional Personnel
 
04:32:52.670 --> 04:32:52.680 align:start position:0%
or Consultants to manage and ensure
 
04:32:55.229 --> 04:32:55.239 align:start position:0%
compliance Sullivan County anticipates
 
04:32:56.950 --> 04:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
the need for one to two full-time
 
04:32:59.349 --> 04:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
employees for compliance efforts which
 
04:33:01.590 --> 04:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
are not budgeted and come at a time of
 
04:33:04.470 --> 04:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
increased fiscal scrutiny Statewide
 
04:33:06.510 --> 04:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
implementation will increase competition
 
04:33:08.910 --> 04:33:08.920 align:start position:0%
for qualified safety personnel straining
 
04:33:11.789 --> 04:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
resources further without dedicated
 
04:33:13.590 --> 04:33:13.600 align:start position:0%
funding counties face tough budget
 
04:33:15.629 --> 04:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
choices potentially leading to service
 
04:33:19.470 --> 04:33:19.480 align:start position:0%
reductions or tax increases hb303
 
04:33:21.670 --> 04:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
imposes a significant unfunded mandate
 
04:33:23.990 --> 04:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
on counties by requiring costly building
 
04:33:25.869 --> 04:33:25.879 align:start position:0%
upgrades to comply with ocean level
 
04:33:28.029 --> 04:33:28.039 align:start position:0%

built before current safety standards
 
04:33:44.910 --> 04:33:44.920 align:start position:0%
would require extensive retrofitting
 
04:33:48.109 --> 04:33:48.119 align:start position:0%
including electrical lighting HVAC fire
 
04:33:50.070 --> 04:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
safety improvements and accessibility
 
04:33:52.390 --> 04:33:52.400 align:start position:0%

compliance timeline for covered entities
 
04:34:05.189 --> 04:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
while the state has three years to
 
04:34:07.349 --> 04:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
implement administrative rules the bill
 
04:34:09.750 --> 04:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
does not specify the timeline for local
 
04:34:11.709 --> 04:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
compliance without a phased approach
 
04:34:13.990 --> 04:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
approach counties could face rushed
 
04:34:16.109 --> 04:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
implementation resulting in financial
 
04:34:18.429 --> 04:34:18.439 align:start position:0%
strain and operational
 
04:34:21.789 --> 04:34:21.799 align:start position:0%
disruptions hb303 would introduce yet
 
04:34:24.390 --> 04:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
another layer of oversight complicating
 
04:34:27.830 --> 04:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
and already complex regulatory landscape
 
04:34:29.590 --> 04:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
counties already operate within a
 
04:34:31.949 --> 04:34:31.959 align:start position:0%
complex regulatory landscape overseeing
 
04:34:34.349 --> 04:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
critical service such as Corrections law
 
04:34:36.910 --> 04:34:36.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement and long-term care adding
 
04:34:39.109 --> 04:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
another layer of oversight complicates
 
04:34:41.189 --> 04:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
compliance with existing mandates
 
04:34:43.310 --> 04:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
including criminal justice standards
 
04:34:45.750 --> 04:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
accredit accreditation requirements and
 
04:34:48.470 --> 04:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
Health Care guidelines aligning OSHA
 
04:34:50.029 --> 04:34:50.039 align:start position:0%
equivalent standards with County
 
04:34:52.230 --> 04:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
operations present significant challenge
 
04:34:54.269 --> 04:34:54.279 align:start position:0%
given the unique and high-risk nature of
 
04:34:57.349 --> 04:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
our work while workplace safety is a
 
04:35:00.551 --> 04:35:00.561 align:start position:0%
priority hb303 imposes substantial
 
04:35:02.670 --> 04:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
unfunded burdens on local governments
 
04:35:05.029 --> 04:35:05.039 align:start position:0%
placing additional pay additional
 
04:35:08.109 --> 04:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
pressure on our local taxpayers we
 
04:35:10.150 --> 04:35:10.160 align:start position:0%
respectfully request reconsideration of
 
04:35:13.109 --> 04:35:13.119 align:start position:0%
the Bill's scope time line and financial
 
04:35:15.150 --> 04:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
Provisions to ensure a balanced and
 
04:35:18.349 --> 04:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
achievable approach to workplace safety
 
04:35:25.510 --> 04:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:27.470 --> 04:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
consideration thank you ma'am are there
 
04:35:29.189 --> 04:35:29.199 align:start position:0%
any questions representative McKenzie
 
04:35:30.910 --> 04:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
and then representative Granger thank
 
04:35:34.551 --> 04:35:34.561 align:start position:0%
you um I'm dragging this back from a few
 
04:35:38.390 --> 04:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
years ago but my understanding is that
 
04:35:41.750 --> 04:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
uh that long-term care facilities uh are
 
04:35:43.070 --> 04:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
not covered by
 
04:35:45.629 --> 04:35:45.639 align:start position:0%
OSHA uh that's that's my recollection
 
04:35:47.109 --> 04:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
that they have their own standard and
 
04:35:49.869 --> 04:35:49.879 align:start position:0%
therefore they you are currently uh
 
04:35:51.629 --> 04:35:51.639 align:start position:0%
operating under a separate standard for
 
04:35:53.670 --> 04:35:53.680 align:start position:0%
mosha and I believe that's the case with
 
04:35:56.230 --> 04:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
prisons as well they have their own
 
04:35:57.910 --> 04:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
their own standard and then
 
04:36:00.670 --> 04:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
finally me I'm sorry one question at a
 
04:36:04.551 --> 04:36:04.561 align:start position:0%
time yes sir please um yes that uh I
 
04:36:07.629 --> 04:36:07.639 align:start position:0%
mean to me that that demonstrates how
 
04:36:09.429 --> 04:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
complex it makes it because you would
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
have some operations within the counties
 
04:36:14.470 --> 04:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
that are subject to OSHA following those
 
04:36:17.551 --> 04:36:17.561 align:start position:0%
guidelines or the state as equ as
 
04:36:20.189 --> 04:36:20.199 align:start position:0%
equivalent to OSHA while you have other
 
04:36:22.990 --> 04:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
operations within the counties that are
 
04:36:26.709 --> 04:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
um underneath their own uh accreditation
 
04:36:28.949 --> 04:36:28.959 align:start position:0%
so to speak and so what it does is it
 
04:36:32.510 --> 04:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
just creates more complicated layering
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
of which
 
04:36:38.070 --> 04:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
uh which regulations actually apply and
 
04:36:40.029 --> 04:36:40.039 align:start position:0%
for that reason is why we're saying that
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
it would create a much more complex
 
04:36:44.551 --> 04:36:44.561 align:start position:0%
safety program than what we currently
 
04:36:47.189 --> 04:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
have that we do feel is effective in the
 
04:36:49.070 --> 04:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
way that we manage our
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce for followup sir thank you so
 
04:36:56.029 --> 04:36:56.039 align:start position:0%
if the uh if the legislation recognized
 
04:36:58.109 --> 04:36:58.119 align:start position:0%
the fact that you already have standards
 
04:37:00.869 --> 04:37:00.879 align:start position:0%
in place the nationally recognized
 
04:37:03.949 --> 04:37:03.959 align:start position:0%
standards and you were not covered by so
 
04:37:06.070 --> 04:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
this this would we would to write you
 
04:37:07.830 --> 04:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
out that
 
04:37:11.949 --> 04:37:11.959 align:start position:0%
section um would that would that help
 
04:37:14.590 --> 04:37:14.600 align:start position:0%
you would this be less complicated for
 
04:37:17.310 --> 04:37:17.320 align:start position:0%
you given that OSHA doesn't cover this
 
04:37:19.390 --> 04:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't cover those areas anyways at
 
04:37:21.750 --> 04:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
this point um well there's certainly a
 
04:37:24.310 --> 04:37:24.320 align:start position:0%
wide variety of of things that we do
 
04:37:27.150 --> 04:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
within the county Beyond long-term care
 
04:37:30.390 --> 04:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
and Corrections um I would also group
 
04:37:33.150 --> 04:37:33.160 align:start position:0%
the Sheriff's Office operations within
 
04:37:35.629 --> 04:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
at that probably as law enforcement um
 
04:37:37.869 --> 04:37:37.879 align:start position:0%
but you know we we operate cour houses
 
04:37:40.709 --> 04:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
we have Office Buildings and so I think
 
04:37:43.070 --> 04:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
even if you were to exclude long-term
 
04:37:44.789 --> 04:37:44.799 align:start position:0%
care and Corrections it would still
 
04:37:48.109 --> 04:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
create a fractured program within the
 
04:37:52.150 --> 04:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
county to be Ure that we were um we were
 
04:37:54.150 --> 04:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
operating in a way that met all of our
 
04:37:57.789 --> 04:37:57.799 align:start position:0%
requirements whether it was through dhh
 
04:38:00.551 --> 04:38:00.561 align:start position:0%
licensing um whether it was through the
 
04:38:02.910 --> 04:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
administrative rules or whatnot it it
 
04:38:04.949 --> 04:38:04.959 align:start position:0%
just increases the complexity I think no
 
04:38:06.629 --> 04:38:06.639 align:start position:0%
matter which way you look at it because
 
04:38:09.310 --> 04:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
the counties do provide a wide variety
 
04:38:12.709 --> 04:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
of very unique services that are unlike
 
04:38:12.719 --> 04:38:13.709 align:start position:0%
of very unique services that are unlike
each

04:38:13.709 --> 04:38:13.719 align:start position:0%
each
 
04:38:16.629 --> 04:38:16.639 align:start position:0%
other thank you thank you okay thank you
 
04:38:19.590 --> 04:38:19.600 align:start position:0%
and repres Granger thank you Mr chair do
 
04:38:20.629 --> 04:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
you think this bill would increase
 
04:38:20.639 --> 04:38:21.670 align:start position:0%
you think this bill would increase
property

04:38:21.670 --> 04:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
property
 
04:38:24.990 --> 04:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
taxes um I would say in most cases most
 
04:38:26.990 --> 04:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
definitely not only at the county level
 
04:38:30.750 --> 04:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
but also for municipalities we you know
 
04:38:33.230 --> 04:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
the um the committee has also has
 
04:38:36.029 --> 04:38:36.039 align:start position:0%
already talked about old facilities um
 
04:38:38.070 --> 04:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
and so one of the things to think about
 
04:38:40.230 --> 04:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
is over time we have these older
 
04:38:42.709 --> 04:38:42.719 align:start position:0%
facilities that local governments are
 
04:38:46.029 --> 04:38:46.039 align:start position:0%
operating in that have kept up with
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
building codes and increasing fire codes
 
04:38:51.990 --> 04:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
as they've needed to um in terms of when
 
04:38:53.590 --> 04:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
they do Renovations they need to bring
 
04:38:55.510 --> 04:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
things up to building codes but if
 
04:38:57.230 --> 04:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
buildings haven't done Renovations for a
 
04:38:59.990 --> 04:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
long time you're asking now a building
 
04:39:03.109 --> 04:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
that wasn't wasn't planned to have a r
 
04:39:06.109 --> 04:39:06.119 align:start position:0%
any type of renovation to now meet a
 
04:39:11.189 --> 04:39:11.199 align:start position:0%
modern um Safety Code that that um you
 
04:39:13.590 --> 04:39:13.600 align:start position:0%
know really the local government hasn't
 
04:39:15.910 --> 04:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
been in a position to factor that into
 
04:39:18.230 --> 04:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
their Capital Improvement plan whatnot
 
04:39:20.029 --> 04:39:20.039 align:start position:0%
so whether it's things that need to be
 
04:39:22.429 --> 04:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
addressed immediately or things that
 
04:39:24.510 --> 04:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
need to come longer longer term
 
04:39:26.230 --> 04:39:26.240 align:start position:0%
depending on the length of time that
 
04:39:29.029 --> 04:39:29.039 align:start position:0%
entities have to comply is most
 
04:39:30.869 --> 04:39:30.879 align:start position:0%
definitely though those are going to
 
04:39:33.470 --> 04:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
cost and that cost will be passed on to
 
04:39:38.708 --> 04:39:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:41.430 --> 04:39:41.440 align:start position:0%
you I seeing no further questions ma'am
 
04:39:42.708 --> 04:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming down appreciate
 
04:39:52.948 --> 04:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:20.910 --> 04:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um to be clear my
 
04:40:24.270 --> 04:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
name is Susie nordor and that's okay my
 
04:40:26.948 --> 04:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
mom had to be creative with the spelling
 
04:40:29.830 --> 04:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
so uh not your
 
04:40:32.830 --> 04:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
fault I am here I work for the National
 
04:40:34.628 --> 04:40:34.638 align:start position:0%
Council for occupational safety and
 
04:40:37.990 --> 04:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
health and we are a nonprofit and we do
 
04:40:41.510 --> 04:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
advocacy education training uh for
 
04:40:45.230 --> 04:40:45.240 align:start position:0%
workers on safety in the workplace and
 
04:40:47.550 --> 04:40:47.560 align:start position:0%
we support House Bill
 
04:40:50.910 --> 04:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
303 um I have been involved with this
 
04:40:52.708 --> 04:40:52.718 align:start position:0%
for actually even longer than
 
04:40:57.190 --> 04:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan because prior
 
04:41:01.350 --> 04:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
to uh him submitting the bill to create
 
04:41:03.510 --> 04:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
a public sector OSHA for New
 
04:41:06.390 --> 04:41:06.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um actually I believe it was
 
04:41:07.910 --> 04:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie who put the
 
04:41:13.670 --> 04:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
first one in um I had met the daughter
 
04:41:15.350 --> 04:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
of Tom Wooten who worked for the
 
04:41:15.360 --> 04:41:16.670 align:start position:0%
of Tom Wooten who worked for the
Northfield

04:41:16.670 --> 04:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
Northfield
 
04:41:20.110 --> 04:41:20.120 align:start position:0%
DPW and um heard her story and I I would
 
04:41:22.510 --> 04:41:22.520 align:start position:0%
like to fill in a few of the gaps that
 
04:41:26.030 --> 04:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan didn't mention
 
04:41:29.550 --> 04:41:29.560 align:start position:0%
um because I think they're pertinent so
 
04:41:32.350 --> 04:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
in July of 2016 Tom Wooten who worked
 
04:41:34.070 --> 04:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
for the Northfield Department of Public
 
04:41:38.590 --> 04:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
Works uh was working and the town had a
 
04:41:40.990 --> 04:41:41.000 align:start position:0%
it's like a tractor trailer container it
 
04:41:42.590 --> 04:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't the whole tractor trailer just
 
04:41:44.430 --> 04:41:44.440 align:start position:0%
the the container and I don't know the
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
words for these so you have to forgive
 
04:41:47.590 --> 04:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
me that they would move from one
 
04:41:49.830 --> 04:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
location to another was a couple miles
 
04:41:52.350 --> 04:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
not very far and rather than spending
 
04:41:56.270 --> 04:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
$300 to $500 to hire a truck to attach
 
04:41:58.390 --> 04:41:58.400 align:start position:0%
the the to carry the container from
 
04:42:00.190 --> 04:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
place to place what they would do is
 
04:42:02.910 --> 04:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
they would take equipment that they had
 
04:42:07.110 --> 04:42:07.120 align:start position:0%
for who knows what that had I don't I
 
04:42:08.470 --> 04:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
call them front loaders I think I'm
 
04:42:11.350 --> 04:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
wrong with that but the buckets on the
 
04:42:13.430 --> 04:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
for scooping dirt and so they had a
 
04:42:15.948 --> 04:42:15.958 align:start position:0%
tractor trailer for an 18-wheeler that
 
04:42:18.510 --> 04:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
they were carrying between two vehicles
 
04:42:20.788 --> 04:42:20.798 align:start position:0%
and it was going down public roads so
 
04:42:24.150 --> 04:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
they had um Tom Wooten as a
 
04:42:28.070 --> 04:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
flagger and what happened in July of
 
04:42:32.628 --> 04:42:32.638 align:start position:0%
2016 was that something jostled Tom
 
04:42:35.230 --> 04:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
tried to stabilize it and he was crushed
 
04:42:39.750 --> 04:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
between the uh the bucket and the truck
 
04:42:41.708 --> 04:42:41.718 align:start position:0%
or the trailer or I don't know the names
 
04:42:42.948 --> 04:42:42.958 align:start position:0%
of the pieces you have to forgive me I
 
04:42:46.030 --> 04:42:46.040 align:start position:0%
am not a safety technical expert by any
 
04:42:47.990 --> 04:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
stretch of the imagination his pelvis
 
04:42:51.110 --> 04:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
was crushed and he
 
04:42:55.030 --> 04:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
died and um his wife was on a business
 
04:42:57.510 --> 04:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
trip it took her 12 hours to get home
 
04:42:59.670 --> 04:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
she was told her husband was in the
 
04:43:01.750 --> 04:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
hospital so he might be dead she she
 
04:43:03.270 --> 04:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
didn't know because he didn't die right
 
04:43:05.550 --> 04:43:05.560 align:start position:0%
away his daughter was at the gym she
 
04:43:07.310 --> 04:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
didn't get the message she was unable to
 
04:43:13.310 --> 04:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:14.788 --> 04:43:14.798 align:start position:0%
and so his
 
04:43:18.230 --> 04:43:18.240 align:start position:0%
family became a statistic basically the
 
04:43:20.708 --> 04:43:20.718 align:start position:0%
family of he became a statistic of
 
04:43:22.830 --> 04:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
someone killed on the
 
04:43:25.030 --> 04:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
job and the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:43:27.470 --> 04:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
Labor sent an inspector and the
 
04:43:29.590 --> 04:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
inspector sent them a report it was
 
04:43:32.430 --> 04:43:32.440 align:start position:0%
seven pages mostly pictures that just
 
04:43:34.470 --> 04:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
said this
 
04:43:37.990 --> 04:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
happened they didn't do uh root cause
 
04:43:40.390 --> 04:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
analysis they didn't do interviews of
 
04:43:41.550 --> 04:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
the people who were there there they
 
04:43:43.708 --> 04:43:43.718 align:start position:0%
didn't there there were so many things
 
04:43:46.910 --> 04:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
that would happen in an OSHA inspection
 
04:43:50.270 --> 04:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
had Tom worked for a public or private
 
04:43:52.868 --> 04:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
construction company or private whatever
 
04:43:55.350 --> 04:43:55.360 align:start position:0%
company that just don't happen the
 
04:43:58.310 --> 04:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor
 
04:44:00.708 --> 04:44:00.718 align:start position:0%
did I can't say nothing because they did
 
04:44:03.270 --> 04:44:03.280 align:start position:0%
take some pictures and write a report
 
04:44:05.510 --> 04:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
the report didn't say anything Anyone
 
04:44:08.868 --> 04:44:08.878 align:start position:0%
who reads it is flabbergasted that this
 
04:44:11.190 --> 04:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
was all that they could muster for the
 
04:44:14.830 --> 04:44:14.840 align:start position:0%
death of someone who was working um for
 
04:44:17.430 --> 04:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
the people of the town of
 
04:44:23.948 --> 04:44:23.958 align:start position:0%
Northfield so Sam his daughter um in in
 
04:44:26.628 --> 04:44:26.638 align:start position:0%
April of 2017 came to an event I was
 
04:44:28.510 --> 04:44:28.520 align:start position:0%
working at the New Hampshire uh
 
04:44:32.070 --> 04:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
affiliate of national Kosh and we had
 
04:44:34.550 --> 04:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
have every year a memorial dinner for
 
04:44:36.788 --> 04:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
workers who are killed on the job the
 
04:44:40.590 --> 04:44:40.600 align:start position:0%
previous year and Sam and Tom's wife
 
04:44:43.110 --> 04:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
Allison and the rest of the family came
 
04:44:46.510 --> 04:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
and 9 months later you could still see
 
04:44:50.750 --> 04:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
this family their pain was palpable and
 
04:44:53.150 --> 04:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
what I've later learned is this was Tom
 
04:44:55.310 --> 04:44:55.320 align:start position:0%
had been some sort of a engineer like
 
04:44:57.510 --> 04:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
Highway engineer or something um and
 
04:44:59.150 --> 04:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
they moved to New Hampshire this was his
 
04:45:01.708 --> 04:45:01.718 align:start position:0%
retirement job he loved to hunt he loved
 
04:45:04.110 --> 04:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
to fish he loved the outdoors they came
 
04:45:06.830 --> 04:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
here this was his job um before they
 
04:45:10.110 --> 04:45:10.120 align:start position:0%
like retired retired and he was killed
 
04:45:12.310 --> 04:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
and all of their PL
 
04:45:18.550 --> 04:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
just didn't happen and so um Sam his
 
04:45:21.350 --> 04:45:21.360 align:start position:0%
daughter was mad and so she talked to us
 
04:45:22.750 --> 04:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
and she told us you know this is what
 
04:45:24.190 --> 04:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
they they didn't even tell us anything
 
04:45:25.948 --> 04:45:25.958 align:start position:0%
about what happened they didn't know and
 
04:45:27.510 --> 04:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
at the time she was a college student
 
04:45:30.590 --> 04:45:30.600 align:start position:0%
she was studying I think
 
04:45:30.600 --> 04:45:32.310 align:start position:0%
she was studying I think
psychology

04:45:32.310 --> 04:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
psychology
 
04:45:34.788 --> 04:45:34.798 align:start position:0%
um and so we tried to find out what
 
04:45:36.190 --> 04:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
happened and we saw this report and
 
04:45:38.270 --> 04:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
we're like where's this analysis and
 
04:45:40.390 --> 04:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
where are all the things that you would
 
04:45:42.110 --> 04:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
normally in an
 
04:45:44.990 --> 04:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
OSHA level
 
04:45:49.190 --> 04:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
report and so we started looking into it
 
04:45:51.750 --> 04:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
representative Mckenzie was the chair of
 
04:45:54.350 --> 04:45:54.360 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire C board at the time he
 
04:45:57.270 --> 04:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
looked into it he realized that and he
 
04:45:58.510 --> 04:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
probably knew this anyway because he's
 
04:46:01.470 --> 04:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:05.550 --> 04:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
forever um that the department had rule
 
04:46:07.788 --> 04:46:07.798 align:start position:0%
in rule they had jurisdiction over
 
04:46:10.550 --> 04:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
public employees sa safety and health
 
04:46:12.190 --> 04:46:12.200 align:start position:0%
but it was wasn't into statute so that
 
04:46:13.830 --> 04:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
was the first thing that we did because
 
04:46:17.390 --> 04:46:17.400 align:start position:0%
as you just heard the rules they expire
 
04:46:19.270 --> 04:46:19.280 align:start position:0%
they do this and they do that and nobody
 
04:46:20.788 --> 04:46:20.798 align:start position:0%
really knows the status of them although
 
04:46:23.310 --> 04:46:23.320 align:start position:0%
I would imagine the department does but
 
04:46:28.310 --> 04:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
um so in 2019 we actually um put into
 
04:46:31.150 --> 04:46:31.160 align:start position:0%
statute and I the papers that I gave you
 
04:46:33.590 --> 04:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
I referenced the statute that the
 
04:46:35.670 --> 04:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
department has jurisdiction over public
 
04:46:35.680 --> 04:46:37.030 align:start position:0%
department has jurisdiction over public
sector

04:46:37.030 --> 04:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
sector
 
04:46:39.510 --> 04:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
employees and I will say that the former
 
04:46:41.670 --> 04:46:41.680 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner
 
04:46:44.628 --> 04:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
Ogden um took this very seriously and
 
04:46:48.070 --> 04:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
when he heard the frankly horrifyingly
 
04:46:50.350 --> 04:46:50.360 align:start position:0%
inaccurate or not inaccurate um
 
04:46:51.990 --> 04:46:52.000 align:start position:0%
incomplete amount of information that
 
04:46:54.948 --> 04:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
the Wooten family was given he did make
 
04:46:57.670 --> 04:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
changes at the department level um to
 
04:46:59.788 --> 04:46:59.798 align:start position:0%
try to to beef this
 
04:47:03.548 --> 04:47:03.558 align:start position:0%
up and um and that's good I I think
 
04:47:07.788 --> 04:47:07.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:10.948 --> 04:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
Department I think
 
04:47:13.030 --> 04:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
when I come to these I get so angry
 
04:47:16.030 --> 04:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
because the people like Tom and he's not
 
04:47:18.190 --> 04:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
the only one if you go Hazen road you
 
04:47:21.190 --> 04:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
can see the memorial with all the the
 
04:47:24.788 --> 04:47:24.798 align:start position:0%
the shovels for all of the Public Works
 
04:47:27.030 --> 04:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
employees who've been killed on the job
 
04:47:29.390 --> 04:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
Public Works people do some of the most
 
04:47:32.070 --> 04:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
dangerous work in they I mean Tree
 
04:47:34.670 --> 04:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
Service is like a hugely um dangerous
 
04:47:38.670 --> 04:47:38.680 align:start position:0%
job who knew that um road construction
 
04:47:41.390 --> 04:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
other construction these are very
 
04:47:43.910 --> 04:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
dangerous jobs
 
04:47:47.190 --> 04:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
and the state the Departments and the
 
04:47:49.430 --> 04:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
dees does a great job they know they
 
04:47:51.310 --> 04:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
have equipment they know if it's OSHA
 
04:47:53.470 --> 04:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
compliant or not the towns like
 
04:47:56.230 --> 04:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
Northfield don't necessarily know that
 
04:47:57.230 --> 04:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
do you know what the first thing the
 
04:47:59.990 --> 04:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
town did after Tom died they sent the
 
04:48:02.270 --> 04:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
rest of the the department to an OSHA 10
 
04:48:04.590 --> 04:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
safety training kind of like closing the
 
04:48:07.390 --> 04:48:07.400 align:start position:0%
Barn Door after the horse is
 
04:48:12.350 --> 04:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
dead they need support support in
 
04:48:14.270 --> 04:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
getting this as the women from the
 
04:48:17.470 --> 04:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
counties said the the smaller entities
 
04:48:19.590 --> 04:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
that live on these shoestring budgets
 
04:48:22.868 --> 04:48:22.878 align:start position:0%
and I suspect I hope that some of the
 
04:48:24.708 --> 04:48:24.718 align:start position:0%
six employees that the Department of
 
04:48:28.310 --> 04:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
Labor intends to add um have to do with
 
04:48:30.590 --> 04:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
there's there's aspects of Osha that we
 
04:48:33.510 --> 04:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
do not have um for public sector
 
04:48:35.390 --> 04:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
employees that that is available for
 
04:48:39.548 --> 04:48:39.558 align:start position:0%
private sector um employers which is um
 
04:48:41.788 --> 04:48:41.798 align:start position:0%
sort of like a consult program coaching
 
04:48:45.070 --> 04:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
and Consulting so that the employers can
 
04:48:47.548 --> 04:48:47.558 align:start position:0%
actually for free have someone come and
 
04:48:49.470 --> 04:48:49.480 align:start position:0%
look and tell them these are the things
 
04:48:53.150 --> 04:48:53.160 align:start position:0%
that an ocean Spectre will find and
 
04:48:56.310 --> 04:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
here's the things that you can do to um
 
04:48:58.430 --> 04:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
to bring yourself up to code because
 
04:49:00.190 --> 04:49:00.200 align:start position:0%
what happens when you run the way that
 
04:49:02.510 --> 04:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
we're running now where everybody has
 
04:49:04.150 --> 04:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
their own thing and if you have the
 
04:49:06.948 --> 04:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
money and the expertise inh housee great
 
04:49:09.990 --> 04:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
if you don't it's the employees it's the
 
04:49:11.830 --> 04:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
people who work work for our towns and
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
our counties and our
 
04:49:16.350 --> 04:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
schools they're the ones who bear the
 
04:49:18.150 --> 04:49:18.160 align:start position:0%
risk it's families like the Wooten
 
04:49:20.670 --> 04:49:20.680 align:start position:0%
family who lost Tom's income for the
 
04:49:22.230 --> 04:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
rest of his life he I believe he was in
 
04:49:24.910 --> 04:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
his 50s so he had you know 10 more years
 
04:49:27.788 --> 04:49:27.798 align:start position:0%
of working they lost his companionship
 
04:49:29.868 --> 04:49:29.878 align:start position:0%
they lost his granddaughter lost her
 
04:49:32.750 --> 04:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
grandfather his daughter lost her father
 
04:49:36.510 --> 04:49:36.520 align:start position:0%
the family was devastated by his death
 
04:49:40.708 --> 04:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
and that's just one of I think since
 
04:49:43.708 --> 04:49:43.718 align:start position:0%
2000 it was something like 40 I believe
 
04:49:46.788 --> 04:49:46.798 align:start position:0%
it was maybe one or two a year um
 
04:49:49.310 --> 04:49:49.320 align:start position:0%
between all levels and that's as
 
04:49:51.310 --> 04:49:51.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive as we could get some of
 
04:49:54.270 --> 04:49:54.280 align:start position:0%
them aren't recorded some of them aren't
 
04:49:56.948 --> 04:49:56.958 align:start position:0%
even considered there's workers comp
 
04:50:01.310 --> 04:50:01.320 align:start position:0%
issues that um if somebody's rejected
 
04:50:05.430 --> 04:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
they don't I mean there are so
 
04:50:09.788 --> 04:50:09.798 align:start position:0%
many large entities that are on the side
 
04:50:13.030 --> 04:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
of who's paying and what's going on and
 
04:50:16.788 --> 04:50:16.798 align:start position:0%
so few of us who really are here to say
 
04:50:18.910 --> 04:50:18.920 align:start position:0%
what is the right thing to do for the
 
04:50:21.830 --> 04:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
people who work for this company like
 
04:50:25.628 --> 04:50:25.638 align:start position:0%
Tom because I actually after the I I met
 
04:50:28.310 --> 04:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
the inspector who did this pathetic
 
04:50:30.670 --> 04:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
excuse for a report um I had lunch with
 
04:50:33.708 --> 04:50:33.718 align:start position:0%
her and what I want to tell you is that
 
04:50:35.948 --> 04:50:35.958 align:start position:0%
she told me she's like yeah you know I
 
04:50:37.750 --> 04:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
mean what they were doing was obviously
 
04:50:39.788 --> 04:50:39.798 align:start position:0%
crazy but there's no law that says you
 
04:50:41.628 --> 04:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
can't do that
 
04:50:42.830 --> 04:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
and I said to her I'm like what about
 
04:50:44.750 --> 04:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
the general duty clause which literally
 
04:50:47.190 --> 04:50:47.200 align:start position:0%
says you can't do crazy things maybe not
 
04:50:49.590 --> 04:50:49.600 align:start position:0%
literally but it does it says you have a
 
04:50:51.548 --> 04:50:51.558 align:start position:0%
general duty to provide
 
04:50:55.708 --> 04:50:55.718 align:start position:0%
safe work to your employees and we in
 
04:50:57.948 --> 04:50:57.958 align:start position:0%
the state have said that we know you
 
04:51:00.788 --> 04:51:00.798 align:start position:0%
have that's that's inst State Statute
 
04:51:03.948 --> 04:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
already even at the time in
 
04:51:06.670 --> 04:51:06.680 align:start position:0%
2016 and the but the inspector the
 
04:51:08.788 --> 04:51:08.798 align:start position:0%
person who looked at
 
04:51:11.390 --> 04:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
this was like yeah it kind of his fault
 
04:51:13.470 --> 04:51:13.480 align:start position:0%
cuz he was being too conscientious he
 
04:51:16.070 --> 04:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
tried to fix something and now this is
 
04:51:17.390 --> 04:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
you know I mean if this was a court of
 
04:51:18.788 --> 04:51:18.798 align:start position:0%
law The Rules of Evidence don't apply
 
04:51:22.510 --> 04:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's hearsay um but just so you know
 
04:51:25.788 --> 04:51:25.798 align:start position:0%
this is why Professional Standards that
 
04:51:29.070 --> 04:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
are right now in at this moment right
 
04:51:31.230 --> 04:51:31.240 align:start position:0%
now all of the private employers that
 
04:51:33.070 --> 04:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
are over a certain size in the state of
 
04:51:36.750 --> 04:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire are are subject to so
 
04:51:39.708 --> 04:51:39.718 align:start position:0%
we're not asking towns and cities to do
 
04:51:42.070 --> 04:51:42.080 align:start position:0%
anything more than we ask our small
 
04:51:44.868 --> 04:51:44.878 align:start position:0%
businesses to do we aren't we're asking
 
04:51:47.910 --> 04:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
them simply to protect their workers the
 
04:51:49.750 --> 04:51:49.760 align:start position:0%
human beings who are the ones who bear
 
04:51:53.868 --> 04:51:53.878 align:start position:0%
the risk when the their employers can't
 
04:51:57.070 --> 04:51:57.080 align:start position:0%
be bothered to do the least and and
 
04:51:58.830 --> 04:51:58.840 align:start position:0%
people in my industry the health and
 
04:52:00.948 --> 04:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
safety industry for what for lack of a
 
04:52:02.708 --> 04:52:02.718 align:start position:0%
better word consider Osan standards a
 
04:52:02.718 --> 04:52:03.750 align:start position:0%
better word consider Osan standards a
bare

04:52:03.750 --> 04:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
bare
 
04:52:06.110 --> 04:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
minimum and if you look
 
04:52:08.750 --> 04:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
at probably the ones the long-term care
 
04:52:09.990 --> 04:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
standards that they're using at the
 
04:52:11.470 --> 04:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
county level they're going to pass by
 
04:52:13.390 --> 04:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
this because they'll probably be higher
 
04:52:15.150 --> 04:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
lots of of
 
04:52:18.230 --> 04:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
professional um associations have higher
 
04:52:20.510 --> 04:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
than that and that's fine that's always
 
04:52:23.030 --> 04:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
great but OSHA is a bare minimum and I
 
04:52:25.910 --> 04:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
think that we owe our public sector
 
04:52:28.910 --> 04:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
employees our neighbors our friends that
 
04:52:31.708 --> 04:52:31.718 align:start position:0%
bare minimum as well thank you thank you
 
04:52:33.350 --> 04:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
ma'am for your compelling testimony are
 
04:52:35.788 --> 04:52:35.798 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Granger
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair you mentioned a um uh
 
04:52:42.030 --> 04:52:42.040 align:start position:0%
some sort of general rule in OSHA that
 
04:52:44.590 --> 04:52:44.600 align:start position:0%
says don't do crazy stuff more or less
 
04:52:47.788 --> 04:52:47.798 align:start position:0%
yes the general duty Clause I so I is is
 
04:52:49.868 --> 04:52:49.878 align:start position:0%
that just a OSHA
 
04:52:53.070 --> 04:52:53.080 align:start position:0%
regulation the general duty Clause it is
 
04:52:56.150 --> 04:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
an OSHA regulation but it is also one of
 
04:52:59.150 --> 04:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
the when in 1986 as representative
 
04:53:01.470 --> 04:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
McKenzie said when they first put some
 
04:53:03.670 --> 04:53:03.680 align:start position:0%
of the OSHA standards that's been an
 
04:53:05.948 --> 04:53:05.958 align:start position:0%
OSHA standard for as long as OSHA's been
 
04:53:09.750 --> 04:53:09.760 align:start position:0%
around so since 1970 and that basically
 
04:53:11.708 --> 04:53:11.718 align:start position:0%
the it Duty what it means is the
 
04:53:14.670 --> 04:53:14.680 align:start position:0%
employer has a general duty anything
 
04:53:17.150 --> 04:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
that is not enumerated in this you know
 
04:53:20.788 --> 04:53:20.798 align:start position:0%
mountain of rules and regulations would
 
04:53:22.868 --> 04:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
get which get ridiculously specific I
 
04:53:25.948 --> 04:53:25.958 align:start position:0%
would 100% admit but there is the one
 
04:53:30.510 --> 04:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
that says if it's obviously unsafe
 
04:53:33.470 --> 04:53:33.480 align:start position:0%
MH as if like a sane person would say
 
04:53:34.670 --> 04:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
you shouldn't be doing that cuz
 
04:53:38.030 --> 04:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
someone's going to get hurt or killed
 
04:53:41.590 --> 04:53:41.600 align:start position:0%
then the department can site someone and
 
04:53:45.310 --> 04:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
and as representative Sullivan explained
 
04:53:49.350 --> 04:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
that right now they use that in places
 
04:53:53.310 --> 04:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
where um there might be either an OSHA
 
04:53:57.708 --> 04:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
standard or a a professional association
 
04:54:00.390 --> 04:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
standard they reference those but they
 
04:54:02.190 --> 04:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
they actually would site someone under
 
04:54:05.510 --> 04:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
the general duty to provide safe work so
 
04:54:07.190 --> 04:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
like if you have an electrical panel
 
04:54:09.350 --> 04:54:09.360 align:start position:0%
that has like a leak dripping right on
 
04:54:10.990 --> 04:54:11.000 align:start position:0%
top of it and there's like sparks flying
 
04:54:13.350 --> 04:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
out of it and you're like whoa that's
 
04:54:15.788 --> 04:54:15.798 align:start position:0%
dangerous they would cite that under
 
04:54:17.670 --> 04:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
general duty cuz which was as we just
 
04:54:18.868 --> 04:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
heard they don't have anything on
 
04:54:22.110 --> 04:54:22.120 align:start position:0%
electricity in the New Hampshire rules
 
04:54:24.990 --> 04:54:25.000 align:start position:0%
so and then what the inspector at the
 
04:54:26.830 --> 04:54:26.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire do would do is they'd
 
04:54:30.390 --> 04:54:30.400 align:start position:0%
probably look at whatever code and
 
04:54:32.390 --> 04:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
electrical code or something like that
 
04:54:34.670 --> 04:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
that they thought was appropriate and
 
04:54:36.310 --> 04:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
they would say this is what we suggest
 
04:54:38.430 --> 04:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
you do to remedy it but the citation
 
04:54:39.990 --> 04:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
would actually be under this general
 
04:54:43.430 --> 04:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
duty which already exists today in New
 
04:54:45.910 --> 04:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think it's the 1400 rule but
 
04:54:48.150 --> 04:54:48.160 align:start position:0%
I could be wrong for a clarification
 
04:54:51.110 --> 04:54:51.120 align:start position:0%
question yes so you are you referring to
 
04:54:53.830 --> 04:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
a state law or an OSHA standard is this
 
04:54:56.788 --> 04:54:56.798 align:start position:0%
an OSHA standard or a state La both um
 
04:54:59.310 --> 04:54:59.320 align:start position:0%
it was originally an OSHA standard and
 
04:55:04.628 --> 04:55:04.638 align:start position:0%
then in 1980 Something um the department
 
04:55:08.390 --> 04:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
put several OSHA standards into I
 
04:55:10.030 --> 04:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
believe it's the 1400 rule but don't
 
04:55:13.788 --> 04:55:13.798 align:start position:0%
quote me on that um and the general duty
 
04:55:15.830 --> 04:55:15.840 align:start position:0%
Clause is one of
 
04:55:18.150 --> 04:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
those okay okay thank you you're welcome
 
04:55:20.948 --> 04:55:20.958 align:start position:0%
questions representative Hall if I
 
04:55:22.708 --> 04:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly and first of
 
04:55:24.788 --> 04:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
all let me preface my question this is a
 
04:55:27.470 --> 04:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
horrible story tragic I understand
 
04:55:31.150 --> 04:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
everybody's heartbroken um but if I'm
 
04:55:32.750 --> 04:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
understanding you correctly there was
 
04:55:35.230 --> 04:55:35.240 align:start position:0%
already a rule against doing what was
 
04:55:38.510 --> 04:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
done when this tragedy occurred there
 
04:55:40.470 --> 04:55:40.480 align:start position:0%
was and so you would think that the
 
04:55:42.788 --> 04:55:42.798 align:start position:0%
inspector would have said doing this
 
04:55:46.948 --> 04:55:46.958 align:start position:0%
crazy thing that again here say people
 
04:55:48.390 --> 04:55:48.400 align:start position:0%
driving by said someone's going to get
 
04:55:51.670 --> 04:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
hurt or killed doing that um everybody
 
04:55:53.190 --> 04:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
who looked at it could say this is
 
04:55:55.750 --> 04:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
insane why are you doing it this way
 
04:55:58.948 --> 04:55:58.958 align:start position:0%
spend the $300 to get a truck to take it
 
04:56:02.708 --> 04:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
um but the inspector for whatever reason
 
04:56:04.868 --> 04:56:04.878 align:start position:0%
said there's not a law that specifically
 
04:56:06.990 --> 04:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
says you can't carry a trailer between
 
04:56:09.190 --> 04:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
two trucks that weren't designed for
 
04:56:11.030 --> 04:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
carrying trailers
 
04:56:13.270 --> 04:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
and so she didn't do any she so she did
 
04:56:15.590 --> 04:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
not site the town of
 
04:56:17.910 --> 04:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
Northfield for a followup quick
 
04:56:17.920 --> 04:56:20.390 align:start position:0%
Northfield for a followup quick
follow-up

04:56:20.390 --> 04:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
04:56:24.350 --> 04:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
so the difference that this bill would
 
04:56:27.070 --> 04:56:27.080 align:start position:0%
bring is a different set of standards
 
04:56:29.070 --> 04:56:29.080 align:start position:0%
for writing the report after the
 
04:56:30.990 --> 04:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
accident occurred is that accurate
 
04:56:32.788 --> 04:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
honestly yes it would bring some of
 
04:56:34.590 --> 04:56:34.600 align:start position:0%
those but what it would also bring is
 
04:56:38.110 --> 04:56:38.120 align:start position:0%
training for the Department's inspectors
 
04:56:40.510 --> 04:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
so that they would know what general
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
duty means because I as a lay person can
 
04:56:44.990 --> 04:56:45.000 align:start position:0%
understand it but apparently at that
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
time and I my understanding is that
 
04:56:50.948 --> 04:56:50.958 align:start position:0%
since that time they are um a lot more
 
04:56:53.628 --> 04:56:53.638 align:start position:0%
attentive to such things but at that
 
04:56:55.350 --> 04:56:55.360 align:start position:0%
time the
 
04:56:57.590 --> 04:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
inspector just general duty didn't occur
 
04:56:57.600 --> 04:56:58.310 align:start position:0%
inspector just general duty didn't occur
to

04:56:58.310 --> 04:56:58.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:57:01.708 --> 04:57:01.718 align:start position:0%
her okay and representative
 
04:57:04.350 --> 04:57:04.360 align:start position:0%
McKenzie um thank you for referencing
 
04:57:08.030 --> 04:57:08.040 align:start position:0%
1985 by the way uh I was still in the
 
04:57:10.590 --> 04:57:10.600 align:start position:0%
question I have is you have two
 
04:57:14.230 --> 04:57:14.240 align:start position:0%
employers you have a a state employee or
 
04:57:18.868 --> 04:57:18.878 align:start position:0%
local Town employee and you have a um a
 
04:57:22.110 --> 04:57:22.120 align:start position:0%
private employer work on the same road
 
04:57:24.590 --> 04:57:24.600 align:start position:0%
in the same town right next to each
 
04:57:27.788 --> 04:57:27.798 align:start position:0%
other so what rules apply to the private
 
04:57:27.798 --> 04:57:28.830 align:start position:0%
other so what rules apply to the private
sector

04:57:28.830 --> 04:57:28.840 align:start position:0%
sector
 
04:57:31.548 --> 04:57:31.558 align:start position:0%
worker does ooser apply
 
04:57:33.868 --> 04:57:33.878 align:start position:0%
there as long as the company is large
 
04:57:35.590 --> 04:57:35.600 align:start position:0%
enough yeah if it's like a sole
 
04:57:37.990 --> 04:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
proprietor probably not and the and the
 
04:57:39.750 --> 04:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
other side of the street those that are
 
04:57:41.670 --> 04:57:41.680 align:start position:0%
not working the ones that are working
 
04:57:43.910 --> 04:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
for the public sector entity are um
 
04:57:46.230 --> 04:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
subject to whatever's in the do rules
 
04:57:48.350 --> 04:57:48.360 align:start position:0%
right now right okay but it's not an the
 
04:57:50.510 --> 04:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
yosha stand so the point being if I
 
04:57:52.990 --> 04:57:53.000 align:start position:0%
could two different two different sets
 
04:57:54.390 --> 04:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
of standards for those people that are
 
04:57:57.230 --> 04:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
working in the same road well and the
 
04:57:59.548 --> 04:57:59.558 align:start position:0%
thing that I find really interesting is
 
04:58:02.470 --> 04:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
that nobody from federal Osan they have
 
04:58:04.830 --> 04:58:04.840 align:start position:0%
an office here in New Hampshire and they
 
04:58:06.590 --> 04:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
come to the New Hampshire Memorial
 
04:58:08.510 --> 04:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
dinner every year so I talk to some of
 
04:58:10.628 --> 04:58:10.638 align:start position:0%
their inspectors and um have told them
 
04:58:12.830 --> 04:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm I'm working on and they're all
 
04:58:16.628 --> 04:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
like oh you know I see road construction
 
04:58:19.030 --> 04:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
or this or that all the time that if we
 
04:58:20.510 --> 04:58:20.520 align:start position:0%
were looking at it wouldn't be done the
 
04:58:21.708 --> 04:58:21.718 align:start position:0%
way it was being
 
04:58:23.868 --> 04:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
done but you know you can't get one of
 
04:58:25.350 --> 04:58:25.360 align:start position:0%
them to come in here and tell you that
 
04:58:29.230 --> 04:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
on the you know in public
 
04:58:32.590 --> 04:58:32.600 align:start position:0%
but the towns and cities do the best
 
04:58:34.230 --> 04:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
that they can I'm not saying that they
 
04:58:37.788 --> 04:58:37.798 align:start position:0%
don't appreciate their employees I don't
 
04:58:39.390 --> 04:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
Northfield built a like a little
 
04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
Monument to
 
04:58:40.680 --> 04:58:42.430 align:start position:0%
Monument to
Tom

04:58:42.430 --> 04:58:42.440 align:start position:0%
Tom
 
04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
um but they are under tremendous
 
04:58:48.830 --> 04:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
tremendous pressure from those who say
 
04:58:51.430 --> 04:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
cut cut cut don't spend don't spend and
 
04:58:54.070 --> 04:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
safety is one of those things that even
 
04:58:55.990 --> 04:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
though and if you look at the page two
 
04:58:58.270 --> 04:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
of my testimonies on page one page two
 
04:59:00.470 --> 04:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
has some links I hope you'll email me
 
04:59:02.110 --> 04:59:02.120 align:start position:0%
and I'll send you the actual Live Links
 
04:59:04.628 --> 04:59:04.638 align:start position:0%
or you can type them in whatever that
 
04:59:06.750 --> 04:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
talk about what would actually save
 
04:59:08.470 --> 04:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
money is to take care of your employees
 
04:59:11.390 --> 04:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
and do things right rather than have to
 
04:59:15.230 --> 04:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
buy build a ma monument and to them
 
04:59:17.868 --> 04:59:17.878 align:start position:0%
later and this is you know I talk about
 
04:59:20.788 --> 04:59:20.798 align:start position:0%
Tom Wooten because it's a dramatic
 
04:59:23.430 --> 04:59:23.440 align:start position:0%
instance if you figure that public
 
04:59:27.868 --> 04:59:27.878 align:start position:0%
workers are 10 to 15% of the workforce
 
04:59:31.310 --> 04:59:31.320 align:start position:0%
think of how many workers comp cases
 
04:59:33.830 --> 04:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
that is how many slips trips falls
 
04:59:38.670 --> 04:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
struck by um electrocutions the common
 
04:59:41.350 --> 04:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
uh things that happen to people at work
 
04:59:45.150 --> 04:59:45.160 align:start position:0%
that are so easily preventable and the
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
costs to prevent them are minimal it's
 
04:59:50.788 --> 04:59:50.798 align:start position:0%
put a sign up move this don't you know
 
04:59:53.030 --> 04:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
the things that say this base to remain
 
04:59:55.750 --> 04:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
open those kinds of things the large
 
04:59:58.830 --> 04:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
majority of the cost in the system is
 
05:00:03.390 --> 05:00:03.400 align:start position:0%
not Tom wooten's fatality the largest
 
05:00:05.990 --> 05:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
costs are the simple things that just
 
05:00:07.910 --> 05:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
don't occur to people because when you
 
05:00:09.430 --> 05:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
go to work and you do the same thing
 
05:00:11.270 --> 05:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
every day you see the same thing every
 
05:00:14.030 --> 05:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
day it doesn't necessarily occur to you
 
05:00:15.750 --> 05:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
that if we kept this thing clear people
 
05:00:18.948 --> 05:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't trip but an ocean ins Spector
 
05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
would come in and say you keep this
 
05:00:23.470 --> 05:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
clear and then you don't have those and
 
05:00:26.788 --> 05:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
that's what I would say probably 75% of
 
05:00:29.430 --> 05:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
the benefit of putting this bill in
 
05:00:29.440 --> 05:00:30.390 align:start position:0%
the benefit of putting this bill in
would

05:00:30.390 --> 05:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
would
 
05:00:32.430 --> 05:00:32.440 align:start position:0%
accomplish thank you ma'am I appreciate
 
05:00:35.510 --> 05:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
it and if I could call uh Miss Albert
 
05:00:56.910 --> 05:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:59.548 --> 05:00:59.558 align:start position:0%
and please introduce yourself and your
 
05:01:01.430 --> 05:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
organization and looking forward to your
 
05:01:02.868 --> 05:01:02.878 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you very much I'm
 
05:01:04.030 --> 05:01:04.040 align:start position:0%
Danielle Albert I'm the Deputy
 
05:01:05.030 --> 05:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
05:01:06.750 --> 05:01:06.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor I'm here today with
 
05:01:08.430 --> 05:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
John garan who is the Department's
 
05:01:12.510 --> 05:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
general counsel um so maybe as a
 
05:01:14.350 --> 05:01:14.360 align:start position:0%
beginning point the department is has
 
05:01:16.030 --> 05:01:16.040 align:start position:0%
reviewed the proposed language uh
 
05:01:17.628 --> 05:01:17.638 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan had referenced
 
05:01:19.350 --> 05:01:19.360 align:start position:0%
in his testimony that he has worked with
 
05:01:21.470 --> 05:01:21.480 align:start position:0%
the Department uh in relation to this
 
05:01:23.788 --> 05:01:23.798 align:start position:0%
bill um and we U he did a very lovely
 
05:01:26.590 --> 05:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
job I think introducing it um just by
 
05:01:28.190 --> 05:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
way of summary the department
 
05:01:29.990 --> 05:01:30.000 align:start position:0%
understands the proposed language to be
 
05:01:34.270 --> 05:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
requiring us to um uh promate and
 
05:01:36.190 --> 05:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
develop regulations uh through the
 
05:01:37.910 --> 05:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
administrative rule process that are at
 
05:01:40.230 --> 05:01:40.240 align:start position:0%
least as safe as the ocean 1910 uh
 
05:01:42.708 --> 05:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
standards and protections there is some
 
05:01:44.150 --> 05:01:44.160 align:start position:0%
Authority that's granted to the
 
05:01:45.270 --> 05:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner through the proposed
 
05:01:46.750 --> 05:01:46.760 align:start position:0%
language to determining which of those
 
05:01:49.150 --> 05:01:49.160 align:start position:0%
standards may be inapplicable uh to New
 
05:01:51.470 --> 05:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and it also requires annual
 
05:01:54.070 --> 05:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
review and Reporting uh annual review of
 
05:01:56.270 --> 05:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
the standards that have been developed
 
05:01:57.830 --> 05:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh with determinations as to whether or
 
05:01:59.430 --> 05:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
not new standards need to be added
 
05:02:01.470 --> 05:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
altered or changed as well as making
 
05:02:03.430 --> 05:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the legisl uh
 
05:02:05.868 --> 05:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
legislature based off of those uh based
 
05:02:08.510 --> 05:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
off of those annual reviews um so that's
 
05:02:10.310 --> 05:02:10.320 align:start position:0%
our understanding of what the the uh
 
05:02:12.910 --> 05:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
proposed language is doing um as
 
05:02:15.390 --> 05:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan had noted during
 
05:02:18.030 --> 05:02:18.040 align:start position:0%
his introduction of the bill um this
 
05:02:19.990 --> 05:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
would be done through the rul making
 
05:02:22.548 --> 05:02:22.558 align:start position:0%
process uh the department has safety
 
05:02:25.590 --> 05:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
rules that pertain to the public
 
05:02:28.430 --> 05:02:28.440 align:start position:0%
employment sector those rules really
 
05:02:30.190 --> 05:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
come from um several statutory
 
05:02:33.350 --> 05:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
authorities uh they come from RSA 277
 
05:02:36.150 --> 05:02:36.160 align:start position:0%
they come from 281 a64 and culminate in
 
05:02:38.390 --> 05:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
the uh 1400 rules which are where the
 
05:02:40.708 --> 05:02:40.718 align:start position:0%
safety standards uh the current safety
 
05:02:43.390 --> 05:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
standards exist um the department is
 
05:02:44.948 --> 05:02:44.958 align:start position:0%
currently working on those rules
 
05:02:46.470 --> 05:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan had had
 
05:02:48.430 --> 05:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
referenced that when he introduced the
 
05:02:50.390 --> 05:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
bill um and in working on those rules
 
05:02:52.548 --> 05:02:52.558 align:start position:0%
they are due for Wholesale reopt in
 
05:02:54.868 --> 05:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
April of this year um but what we have
 
05:02:57.548 --> 05:02:57.558 align:start position:0%
done uh is is looked at them and tried
 
05:03:00.310 --> 05:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
to identify you know specific areas
 
05:03:03.150 --> 05:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
where gaps need to be filled where they
 
05:03:06.150 --> 05:03:06.160 align:start position:0%
they could be um enhanced or modified uh
 
05:03:09.310 --> 05:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
to provide additional protections um the
 
05:03:11.070 --> 05:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
sections we are looking at relate to
 
05:03:12.868 --> 05:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
confined spaces and some other areas
 
05:03:15.628 --> 05:03:15.638 align:start position:0%
that we've identified as needing perhaps
 
05:03:18.788 --> 05:03:18.798 align:start position:0%
um as needing increased safety uh
 
05:03:20.910 --> 05:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
Provisions our intent whether this
 
05:03:22.750 --> 05:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
language passes or not is to continue
 
05:03:24.788 --> 05:03:24.798 align:start position:0%
working on those rules um certainly if
 
05:03:26.350 --> 05:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
this passes there will be a statutory
 
05:03:29.910 --> 05:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
mandate that um specific uh that
 
05:03:29.920 --> 05:03:31.470 align:start position:0%
mandate that um specific uh that
specific

05:03:31.470 --> 05:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
specific
 
05:03:34.708 --> 05:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
um OSHA esque standards are are brought
 
05:03:36.910 --> 05:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
into those rules um some questions had
 
05:03:38.910 --> 05:03:38.920 align:start position:0%
come up or some commentary had come up
 
05:03:41.230 --> 05:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
related how to how much time uh the
 
05:03:42.708 --> 05:03:42.718 align:start position:0%
department would need there's currently
 
05:03:44.030 --> 05:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
within the statute there's a a
 
05:03:45.750 --> 05:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
three-year post-effective date time
 
05:03:48.548 --> 05:03:48.558 align:start position:0%
frame uh the department would estimate
 
05:03:50.270 --> 05:03:50.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps four years maybe better
 
05:03:52.390 --> 05:03:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan had um had
 
05:03:54.110 --> 05:03:54.120 align:start position:0%
referenced uh deferring to the
 
05:03:55.788 --> 05:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
department on time frame we would
 
05:03:57.190 --> 05:03:57.200 align:start position:0%
anticipate that the four years would
 
05:03:59.470 --> 05:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
allow the department to fully draft
 
05:04:01.628 --> 05:04:01.638 align:start position:0%
those rules and go through the gel car
 
05:04:04.270 --> 05:04:04.280 align:start position:0%
uh process I always forget exactly what
 
05:04:05.990 --> 05:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
gel car stands for but the joint
 
05:04:08.788 --> 05:04:08.798 align:start position:0%
legislative action committee uh who is
 
05:04:10.708 --> 05:04:10.718 align:start position:0%
the legislative body that's responsible
 
05:04:13.270 --> 05:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
for putting rules through um our hope
 
05:04:14.990 --> 05:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
would be to be able to promate those
 
05:04:17.190 --> 05:04:17.200 align:start position:0%
rules in sections but you know from
 
05:04:19.030 --> 05:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
start to finish it can take up to six
 
05:04:20.868 --> 05:04:20.878 align:start position:0%
months for rules to go through gel car
 
05:04:23.310 --> 05:04:23.320 align:start position:0%
so incorporating in the drafting process
 
05:04:24.948 --> 05:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
you know coming up with the language
 
05:04:26.470 --> 05:04:26.480 align:start position:0%
that would be relevant for the rules and
 
05:04:28.430 --> 05:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
then putting it through that process um
 
05:04:29.990 --> 05:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
we think four years would would probably
 
05:04:31.750 --> 05:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
be enough time that would also give the
 
05:04:34.110 --> 05:04:34.120 align:start position:0%
department time to hire these staff
 
05:04:35.990 --> 05:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
persons that are referenced within the
 
05:04:37.750 --> 05:04:37.760 align:start position:0%
bill as well as get those individuals
 
05:04:40.910 --> 05:04:40.920 align:start position:0%
trained um kind of relative to cost um
 
05:04:42.548 --> 05:04:42.558 align:start position:0%
the department can comment on cost to
 
05:04:44.910 --> 05:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
the department itself we have put within
 
05:04:46.310 --> 05:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that we were asked to
 
05:04:48.548 --> 05:04:48.558 align:start position:0%
provide our estimated cost of of what it
 
05:04:50.390 --> 05:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
would of cost incurred by the department
 
05:04:53.628 --> 05:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
in order to put these changes into place
 
05:04:55.510 --> 05:04:55.520 align:start position:0%
um it is premised upon the seven staff
 
05:04:57.270 --> 05:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
persons that are referenced within the
 
05:04:59.270 --> 05:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
statute um there is also a component
 
05:05:01.548 --> 05:05:01.558 align:start position:0%
related to spacing the Cur Department's
 
05:05:03.350 --> 05:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
current space is not big enough to hold
 
05:05:05.430 --> 05:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
seven additional staff persons we would
 
05:05:07.948 --> 05:05:07.958 align:start position:0%
need to look for new um new building
 
05:05:10.430 --> 05:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
space in order to uh increase uh
 
05:05:12.990 --> 05:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
increase our staffing by that
 
05:05:13.000 --> 05:05:17.190 align:start position:0%
increase our staffing by that
size

05:05:17.190 --> 05:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:20.110 --> 05:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
um uh addressing um some of the other
 
05:05:22.350 --> 05:05:22.360 align:start position:0%
testimony um the department has
 
05:05:24.430 --> 05:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
testified in the past you know relative
 
05:05:29.390 --> 05:05:29.400 align:start position:0%
to uh relative to um safety as regulated
 
05:05:30.910 --> 05:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
by the department as it currently stands
 
05:05:32.310 --> 05:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
we've acknowledged in the past and we
 
05:05:33.750 --> 05:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
continue to acknowledge you know we do
 
05:05:36.150 --> 05:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
need to do a good job and a better job
 
05:05:38.310 --> 05:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
you know with safety um I am comfortable
 
05:05:39.948 --> 05:05:39.958 align:start position:0%
reporting and I believe my pred assessor
 
05:05:41.430 --> 05:05:41.440 align:start position:0%
had also reported we have made some
 
05:05:43.510 --> 05:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
changes over the past several years
 
05:05:45.430 --> 05:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
relative to improving the quality of
 
05:05:48.350 --> 05:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
inspections how inspections go forward
 
05:05:50.510 --> 05:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh training um and qualifications for
 
05:05:53.110 --> 05:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
our inspectors and relative to report
 
05:05:55.430 --> 05:05:55.440 align:start position:0%
writing um so that it is an improved uh
 
05:05:57.670 --> 05:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
and a more quality product um again
 
05:05:59.150 --> 05:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether this legislation
 
05:06:00.670 --> 05:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
passes it's our intent to continue
 
05:06:02.548 --> 05:06:02.558 align:start position:0%
making those improvements um and it's a
 
05:06:05.750 --> 05:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
goal that we continue to have
 
05:06:08.350 --> 05:06:08.360 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to entertain or to take
 
05:06:11.030 --> 05:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
any questions uh if there are
 
05:06:13.230 --> 05:06:13.240 align:start position:0%
any represent
 
05:06:16.750 --> 05:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
Drago thank you Mr chair we've heard
 
05:06:18.788 --> 05:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
basically there two two standards is the
 
05:06:21.750 --> 05:06:21.760 align:start position:0%
OSHA standard and then the safety
 
05:06:24.150 --> 05:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
standard that we have for the public
 
05:06:26.788 --> 05:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
sector the consensus is that the OSHA
 
05:06:29.190 --> 05:06:29.200 align:start position:0%
standard creates a much safer workplace
 
05:06:31.350 --> 05:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
my question is do you have numbers to
 
05:06:33.910 --> 05:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
show if we take the same type of worker
 
05:06:35.788 --> 05:06:35.798 align:start position:0%
uh say tree worker uh Parks and
 
05:06:40.270 --> 05:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
Recreation that um maybe cutting grass
 
05:06:43.270 --> 05:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
is the incident of injuries reported per
 
05:06:45.868 --> 05:06:45.878 align:start position:0%
capita higher in the public sector or
 
05:06:47.110 --> 05:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
the private
 
05:06:49.310 --> 05:06:49.320 align:start position:0%
sector I don't have direct numbers
 
05:06:53.788 --> 05:06:53.798 align:start position:0%
available with me today my general
 
05:06:57.070 --> 05:06:57.080 align:start position:0%
recollection is I I believe lower but I
 
05:06:58.948 --> 05:06:58.958 align:start position:0%
would like to get the firm numbers for
 
05:07:01.830 --> 05:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
you so um if if it's agreeable I'm happy
 
05:07:03.548 --> 05:07:03.558 align:start position:0%
to go back to the department and we can
 
05:07:06.110 --> 05:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
look at the we can pull some data um to
 
05:07:08.910 --> 05:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
give to the committee showing um you're
 
05:07:10.510 --> 05:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
looking for the comparison between
 
05:07:13.110 --> 05:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
public and private sector is that
 
05:07:14.990 --> 05:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
correct yes if you could do that that
 
05:07:17.708 --> 05:07:17.718 align:start position:0%
would be great yeah okay yeah okay and
 
05:07:19.590 --> 05:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
are you the information that we would
 
05:07:20.910 --> 05:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
have would be based on injuries so
 
05:07:24.590 --> 05:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
you're looking for reported injuries
 
05:07:27.948 --> 05:07:27.958 align:start position:0%
okay representative labber thank you Mr
 
05:07:30.190 --> 05:07:30.200 align:start position:0%
chair Deputy Commissioner Albert it
 
05:07:31.470 --> 05:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't go you don't go much higher on
 
05:07:34.350 --> 05:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
the ladder than you are so this question
 
05:07:37.868 --> 05:07:37.878 align:start position:0%
hoping you can answer it um do you feel
 
05:07:39.990 --> 05:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
that your Department's standard
 
05:07:42.430 --> 05:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
for safety inspections are inferior to
 
05:07:44.948 --> 05:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
oer OSHA's standards and do you feel
 
05:07:48.430 --> 05:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:50.788 --> 05:07:50.798 align:start position:0%
overhaul thank you for the question um
 
05:07:53.110 --> 05:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
it's a very good question I I don't know
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
how I would go about or how the
 
05:07:56.470 --> 05:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
department would go about rating
 
05:07:58.590 --> 05:07:58.600 align:start position:0%
inferiority um you know I think as the
 
05:08:00.190 --> 05:08:00.200 align:start position:0%
department has previously testified as
 
05:08:02.110 --> 05:08:02.120 align:start position:0%
we've testified today uh certainly there
 
05:08:03.628 --> 05:08:03.638 align:start position:0%
can always be improvements that are made
 
05:08:05.230 --> 05:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
and we've already taken some steps uh
 
05:08:07.628 --> 05:08:07.638 align:start position:0%
towards improving um th some of those
 
05:08:09.430 --> 05:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
standards um our understanding of the
 
05:08:12.548 --> 05:08:12.558 align:start position:0%
ENT of this proposed language is to um
 
05:08:15.430 --> 05:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
bring forward a more more Harmony
 
05:08:17.510 --> 05:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
between o requirements and what's
 
05:08:21.390 --> 05:08:21.400 align:start position:0%
currently required by um by by state
 
05:08:24.750 --> 05:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
regulation and and state statute um so
 
05:08:26.430 --> 05:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
there are differences between the two I
 
05:08:27.470 --> 05:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
think it's fair to say that there are
 
05:08:28.628 --> 05:08:28.638 align:start position:0%
differences between the two there are
 
05:08:31.590 --> 05:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
some similarities as
 
05:08:35.110 --> 05:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
well please and just real quickly you
 
05:08:36.788 --> 05:08:36.798 align:start position:0%
had you had made mention that there was
 
05:08:39.270 --> 05:08:39.280 align:start position:0%
a need for more space more real estate
 
05:08:40.868 --> 05:08:40.878 align:start position:0%
um um are we talking a new building or
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
are we talking what do you think we're
 
05:08:44.390 --> 05:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
talking here Renovations new building
 
05:08:46.030 --> 05:08:46.040 align:start position:0%
that's very good question I think more
 
05:08:48.230 --> 05:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
likely than not uh probably a new
 
05:08:50.110 --> 05:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
building um it's a little bit unclear to
 
05:08:51.868 --> 05:08:51.878 align:start position:0%
us at this point in time uh the
 
05:08:54.030 --> 05:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
department is currently at full capacity
 
05:08:56.430 --> 05:08:56.440 align:start position:0%
in the sense that we are um out of space
 
05:08:58.990 --> 05:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
to to seat literally seat new employees
 
05:09:01.510 --> 05:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
where we to hire any so with seven new
 
05:09:03.190 --> 05:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
positions we would more likely than not
 
05:09:05.270 --> 05:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
need new space uh the building we're
 
05:09:06.708 --> 05:09:06.718 align:start position:0%
currently in is one that's rented we do
 
05:09:09.190 --> 05:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
not own it um so we very well may need
 
05:09:11.030 --> 05:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
to look at renting a new space thank you
 
05:09:11.040 --> 05:09:12.150 align:start position:0%
to look at renting a new space thank you
Deputy

05:09:12.150 --> 05:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
Deputy
 
05:09:14.628 --> 05:09:14.638 align:start position:0%
Commissioner representative hall and
 
05:09:15.910 --> 05:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
then representative
 
05:09:18.590 --> 05:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
McKenzie thank you uh Mr chair uh
 
05:09:20.350 --> 05:09:20.360 align:start position:0%
question the Bill calls
 
05:09:24.070 --> 05:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
for funding new inspector positions but
 
05:09:25.948 --> 05:09:25.958 align:start position:0%
strikes me that OSHA regulations are a
 
05:09:28.390 --> 05:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
moving Target and you would need some
 
05:09:30.470 --> 05:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
amount of Staffing to track those and
 
05:09:32.310 --> 05:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
make sure you're staying in compliance
 
05:09:34.190 --> 05:09:34.200 align:start position:0%
could you do that with existing staff or
 
05:09:36.070 --> 05:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
would you need additional people to do
 
05:09:38.350 --> 05:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question it's an
 
05:09:41.590 --> 05:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
excellent question you know currently uh
 
05:09:44.510 --> 05:09:44.520 align:start position:0%
one as this language is proposed and is
 
05:09:46.628 --> 05:09:46.638 align:start position:0%
written there would need to be tracking
 
05:09:48.270 --> 05:09:48.280 align:start position:0%
relative to the oia standards but if
 
05:09:50.670 --> 05:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
osia standards changed um it wouldn't be
 
05:09:51.990 --> 05:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
the same as incorporating them by
 
05:09:53.670 --> 05:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
reference in the sense that whatever the
 
05:09:55.548 --> 05:09:55.558 align:start position:0%
federal government is doing would W by
 
05:09:58.230 --> 05:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
word be drawn into uh the state level um
 
05:09:59.750 --> 05:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
we do have individuals within the
 
05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
department who assist in tracking um
 
05:10:05.310 --> 05:10:05.320 align:start position:0%
legislative changes both both at the
 
05:10:08.150 --> 05:10:08.160 align:start position:0%
federal and at the state level um so I
 
05:10:09.510 --> 05:10:09.520 align:start position:0%
believe we would more likely than not
 
05:10:12.030 --> 05:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
have sufficient Staffing to look at uh
 
05:10:13.830 --> 05:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
the changes and to keep a breast of them
 
05:10:15.590 --> 05:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
such that we were able to be making
 
05:10:17.510 --> 05:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
decisions uh through those annual
 
05:10:19.110 --> 05:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
reviews about what would need to change
 
05:10:21.190 --> 05:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
what would need to be incorporated in I
 
05:10:23.390 --> 05:10:23.400 align:start position:0%
think it would be more the uh more
 
05:10:26.670 --> 05:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
robust um and inspections uh to have
 
05:10:27.990 --> 05:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
individuals going out and actually
 
05:10:29.628 --> 05:10:29.638 align:start position:0%
performing those working with the
 
05:10:32.390 --> 05:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
employers providing the education on the
 
05:10:34.230 --> 05:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
the new changes how to stay in
 
05:10:36.030 --> 05:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
compliance and to work with them on um
 
05:10:39.628 --> 05:10:39.638 align:start position:0%
mitigating or or correcting any uh any
 
05:10:41.750 --> 05:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
violations that may be
 
05:10:44.548 --> 05:10:44.558 align:start position:0%
found so I
 
05:10:47.510 --> 05:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
guess very compelling testimony on the
 
05:10:51.110 --> 05:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
need to improve safety standards some of
 
05:10:54.190 --> 05:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
that is the regulatory requirements some
 
05:10:56.948 --> 05:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
of that is a culture of safety and some
 
05:11:00.708 --> 05:11:00.718 align:start position:0%
of that is is
 
05:11:03.430 --> 05:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement what this law as I
 
05:11:05.230 --> 05:11:05.240 align:start position:0%
understand having listened to it now for
 
05:11:07.470 --> 05:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
the last
 
05:11:10.350 --> 05:11:10.360 align:start position:0%
hour what this law does is it says hey
 
05:11:13.788 --> 05:11:13.798 align:start position:0%
here's amount of regulations let's pick
 
05:11:15.430 --> 05:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
and choose which ones make the most
 
05:11:17.030 --> 05:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
sense for New
 
05:11:17.040 --> 05:11:19.110 align:start position:0%
sense for New
Hampshire

05:11:19.110 --> 05:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
05:11:22.670 --> 05:11:22.680 align:start position:0%
and my question is as the person there's
 
05:11:24.470 --> 05:11:24.480 align:start position:0%
someone going to do it someone the
 
05:11:26.590 --> 05:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
department later is going to say okay I
 
05:11:28.590 --> 05:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
want that one that one and that
 
05:11:31.750 --> 05:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
one and the compelling testimony of
 
05:11:33.708 --> 05:11:33.718 align:start position:0%
Representative Solomon is this is going
 
05:11:35.270 --> 05:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
to make sense for New
 
05:11:37.910 --> 05:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but really make sense for New
 
05:11:40.070 --> 05:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire comes down to that
 
05:11:43.750 --> 05:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
person that is picking and choosing and
 
05:11:45.390 --> 05:11:45.400 align:start position:0%
what are the checks and balances then in
 
05:11:47.190 --> 05:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor has said he
 
05:11:49.230 --> 05:11:49.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't pick all of it I mean I'm not
 
05:11:50.708 --> 05:11:50.718 align:start position:0%
saying he would
 
05:11:53.590 --> 05:11:53.600 align:start position:0%
but how's that check and balance so that
 
05:11:56.230 --> 05:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
the municipalities are I talk to my
 
05:11:59.270 --> 05:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
municipality every day and I talked to
 
05:12:01.110 --> 05:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
three constituents last night whose
 
05:12:04.190 --> 05:12:04.200 align:start position:0%
property tax went up by
 
05:12:07.390 --> 05:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
100% And and so here I am saying okay
 
05:12:09.430 --> 05:12:09.440 align:start position:0%
how am I going to approve this law and
 
05:12:11.390 --> 05:12:11.400 align:start position:0%
there's no check and balance say that
 
05:12:12.868 --> 05:12:12.878 align:start position:0%
the cost of this isn't going to be
 
05:12:15.110 --> 05:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
exorbitant when it goes down to the town
 
05:12:17.830 --> 05:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
level recognizing that I completely
 
05:12:20.628 --> 05:12:20.638 align:start position:0%
agree with the premise of the of the of
 
05:12:23.548 --> 05:12:23.558 align:start position:0%
changing it that that's where I'm stuck
 
05:12:25.110 --> 05:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a good question as I
 
05:12:26.990 --> 05:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
understand from the proposed language um
 
05:12:28.750 --> 05:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
the the checks and balance I believe
 
05:12:30.310 --> 05:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
that you're referencing would come um
 
05:12:32.150 --> 05:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
potentially from two places one it would
 
05:12:33.628 --> 05:12:33.638 align:start position:0%
come through those annual reviews that
 
05:12:34.948 --> 05:12:34.958 align:start position:0%
the department or the commissioner
 
05:12:37.270 --> 05:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
through the department is mandated to do
 
05:12:39.270 --> 05:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
um there's record that's required to be
 
05:12:40.670 --> 05:12:40.680 align:start position:0%
maintained of that that has to be
 
05:12:42.670 --> 05:12:42.680 align:start position:0%
provided to any interested party on
 
05:12:44.510 --> 05:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
request and the other check and balance
 
05:12:45.868 --> 05:12:45.878 align:start position:0%
would more likely than not come through
 
05:12:47.548 --> 05:12:47.558 align:start position:0%
the administrative rule process itself
 
05:12:49.628 --> 05:12:49.638 align:start position:0%
which is a public process when any
 
05:12:51.070 --> 05:12:51.080 align:start position:0%
Department not just the Department of
 
05:12:53.190 --> 05:12:53.200 align:start position:0%
Labor uh is initiating the rul making
 
05:12:55.310 --> 05:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
process there are periods uh in which
 
05:12:57.548 --> 05:12:57.558 align:start position:0%
they for public comment in which the
 
05:12:59.670 --> 05:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
rules are are posted they're reviewed
 
05:13:01.990 --> 05:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
the public comes in they provide uh
 
05:13:03.990 --> 05:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
their feedback um and then it goes
 
05:13:05.948 --> 05:13:05.958 align:start position:0%
through the the gel car process where
 
05:13:09.190 --> 05:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
that that commentary is is also at issue
 
05:13:11.110 --> 05:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
um so there would be the ability for the
 
05:13:12.948 --> 05:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
public to comment as well about whether
 
05:13:15.670 --> 05:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
or not you know a rule that has been
 
05:13:18.030 --> 05:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
drawn in or has been um that has been
 
05:13:19.948 --> 05:13:19.958 align:start position:0%
written to be at least as effective as
 
05:13:23.708 --> 05:13:23.718 align:start position:0%
an ocean 1910 standard um is has makes
 
05:13:26.390 --> 05:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
sense doesn't make sense um and and that
 
05:13:28.190 --> 05:13:28.200 align:start position:0%
is a form of check and balance okay
 
05:13:29.310 --> 05:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
thank you you're
 
05:13:32.868 --> 05:13:32.878 align:start position:0%
welcome represent McKenzie thank you uh
 
05:13:34.590 --> 05:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
I know that somebody asked you for
 
05:13:37.230 --> 05:13:37.240 align:start position:0%
reports uh the only thing I ask you uh

when you're reporting that out is that
 
05:13:42.628 --> 05:13:42.638 align:start position:0%
you take into consideration the the
 
05:13:45.830 --> 05:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
private sector numbers so compared to
 
05:13:48.310 --> 05:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
the public sector so you know 25
 
05:13:50.470 --> 05:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
injuries with thousand employees much
 
05:13:52.868 --> 05:13:52.878 align:start position:0%

regard to to proportionality between the
 
05:14:01.628 --> 05:14:01.638 align:start position:0%
two can you share the uh with this if I
 
05:14:04.470 --> 05:14:04.480 align:start position:0%

all right representative
 
05:17:58.150 --> 05:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
K uh what we're going to do judging by
 
05:18:00.110 --> 05:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
the number of cards that just came in I
 
05:18:02.910 --> 05:18:02.920 align:start position:0%
went from one to 100 in about 4 and a
 
05:18:05.708 --> 05:18:05.718 align:start position:0%
half seconds uh which is a speeding
 
05:18:08.750 --> 05:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
violation um we're going to punt on
 
05:18:12.948 --> 05:18:12.958 align:start position:0%
we're going to recess on 378 today and
 
05:18:15.628 --> 05:18:15.638 align:start position:0%
we'll take that up next week okay in
 
05:18:19.990 --> 05:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
favor of 7:35 which we'll address today
 
05:18:22.470 --> 05:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
okay if that works for you it works fine
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
okay with
 
05:18:26.470 --> 05:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
apologies so I'd like to close the
 
05:18:30.868 --> 05:18:30.878 align:start position:0%
hearing on 378 I apologize we just run a
 
05:18:33.510 --> 05:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
little bit behind and uh we got a lot of
 
05:18:36.390 --> 05:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:39.708 --> 05:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
7:35 the amendment yeah

05:20:22.868 --> 05:20:22.878 align:start position:0%
moved it in a really good
 
05:20:31.990 --> 05:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:39.230 --> 05:20:39.240 align:start position:0%

05:31:50.070 --> 05:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:52.788 --> 05:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
all right good afternoon everyone and uh
 
05:31:54.830 --> 05:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
I appreciate your patience long day
 
05:31:58.510 --> 05:31:58.520 align:start position:0%
we're getting a lot done um I'm going to
 
05:32:01.470 --> 05:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on HB 735
 
05:32:04.430 --> 05:32:04.440 align:start position:0%
FN relative to elections and collabor
 
05:32:07.070 --> 05:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
and collab collective bargaining and I'd
 
05:32:10.510 --> 05:32:10.520 align:start position:0%
like to open with representative Granger
 
05:32:13.350 --> 05:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
who will introduce his Bill thank you Mr
 
05:32:15.390 --> 05:32:15.400 align:start position:0%
chair members of the committee so this
 
05:32:17.910 --> 05:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
bill is basically just term limits for
 
05:32:20.470 --> 05:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
unions uh unions should represent their
 
05:32:22.430 --> 05:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
members and if they do a good job of it
 
05:32:24.270 --> 05:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
then it should be no problem to restify
 
05:32:29.350 --> 05:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
them at um when it comes time for that
 
05:32:31.350 --> 05:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
and uh if not then they should be able
 
05:32:33.270 --> 05:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
to switch which Union is representing
 
05:32:35.230 --> 05:32:35.240 align:start position:0%
them and so that's essentially what this
 
05:32:37.548 --> 05:32:37.558 align:start position:0%
bill does the mechanism that this bill
 
05:32:40.350 --> 05:32:40.360 align:start position:0%
uses is is when the majority of the
 
05:32:42.310 --> 05:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
workers were not there for the initial
 
05:32:44.990 --> 05:32:45.000 align:start position:0%
vote so if a significant amount of time
 
05:32:47.830 --> 05:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
goes by um then they would have to go up
 
05:32:49.750 --> 05:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
for recertification and they would have
 
05:32:52.628 --> 05:32:52.638 align:start position:0%
to do another vote to uh uh certify the
 
05:32:55.310 --> 05:32:55.320 align:start position:0%
union and another way you could go at it
 
05:32:57.030 --> 05:32:57.040 align:start position:0%
if uh that's more preferable to the
 
05:32:58.910 --> 05:32:58.920 align:start position:0%
committee is just do it on a time scale
 
05:33:01.190 --> 05:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
so for instance in some states they just
 
05:33:03.190 --> 05:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
do it every five years and in other
 
05:33:05.510 --> 05:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
states they do it every 10 years and
 
05:33:07.230 --> 05:33:07.240 align:start position:0%
basically we need this in order to make
 
05:33:09.868 --> 05:33:09.878 align:start position:0%
sure that unions aren't just
 
05:33:12.150 --> 05:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
perpetually protecting their little fom
 
05:33:14.030 --> 05:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
and saying this is our workplace and we
 
05:33:16.190 --> 05:33:16.200 align:start position:0%
own it forever they the workers would
 
05:33:18.270 --> 05:33:18.280 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to say okay well
 
05:33:20.070 --> 05:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
you know thanks for all your help over
 
05:33:21.548 --> 05:33:21.558 align:start position:0%
the years but we think that we need a
 
05:33:23.310 --> 05:33:23.320 align:start position:0%
different Union supporting us because we
 
05:33:24.948 --> 05:33:24.958 align:start position:0%
have needs that are unmet or whatever
 
05:33:26.750 --> 05:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
the case may be if you want to think
 
05:33:29.670 --> 05:33:29.680 align:start position:0%
about it in terms of regular politics um
 
05:33:33.750 --> 05:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
we don't elect Kings um in America um we
 
05:33:36.150 --> 05:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
have a president and uh he lasts four
 
05:33:38.310 --> 05:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
years and if he do doesn't do a very
 
05:33:40.470 --> 05:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
good job then uh we vote for someone
 
05:33:43.430 --> 05:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
else and uh this this just extends that
 
05:33:50.030 --> 05:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:53.708 --> 05:33:53.718 align:start position:0%
like are there any questions represent
 
05:33:56.628 --> 05:33:56.638 align:start position:0%
McKenzie So currently unless I'm
 
05:34:01.030 --> 05:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
mistaken there is within the um the law
 
05:34:03.868 --> 05:34:03.878 align:start position:0%
the ability for a union to petition to
 
05:34:06.470 --> 05:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
decertify the local union and to come up
 
05:34:09.110 --> 05:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
with a whole another uh Union uh
 
05:34:10.670 --> 05:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
representative if they
 
05:34:14.150 --> 05:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
want are you suggesting that that's not
 
05:34:17.788 --> 05:34:17.798 align:start position:0%
sufficient to uh to to meet the test
 
05:34:19.910 --> 05:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
that if people are unhappy with what
 
05:34:23.190 --> 05:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
they currently have that uh that that
 
05:34:25.990 --> 05:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
structure is not good enough well you
 
05:34:28.350 --> 05:34:28.360 align:start position:0%
and I know that a union would never use
 
05:34:30.590 --> 05:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
intimidation or tactics of that nature
 
05:34:33.190 --> 05:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
in order to scare people against
 
05:34:35.548 --> 05:34:35.558 align:start position:0%
decertifying a union but there is an
 
05:34:37.110 --> 05:34:37.120 align:start position:0%
impression among many workers that that
 
05:34:38.430 --> 05:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
is the case
 
05:34:40.150 --> 05:34:40.160 align:start position:0%
so this this just makes sure that
 
05:34:42.070 --> 05:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
everyone knows there's a regular either
 
05:34:46.230 --> 05:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
a regular schedule or when um the union
 
05:34:46.240 --> 05:34:47.470 align:start position:0%
a regular schedule or when um the union
is

05:34:47.470 --> 05:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:34:49.830 --> 05:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
sufficiently distan from when they were
 
05:34:51.868 --> 05:34:51.878 align:start position:0%
certified we'll just do a
 
05:34:53.590 --> 05:34:53.600 align:start position:0%
recertification and that way you don't
 
05:34:55.470 --> 05:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
have to put pressure on certain members
 
05:34:57.948 --> 05:34:57.958 align:start position:0%
of the Union as to you know oh will they
 
05:35:02.150 --> 05:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:04.750 --> 05:35:04.760 align:start position:0%
topic okay any other questions
 
05:35:09.030 --> 05:35:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:10.830 --> 05:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
your bill makes reference to both the
 
05:35:12.628 --> 05:35:12.638 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and the Public
 
05:35:15.390 --> 05:35:15.400 align:start position:0%
employe Public Employee Labor Relations
 
05:35:18.110 --> 05:35:18.120 align:start position:0%
Board um which of them actually has
 
05:35:22.708 --> 05:35:22.718 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over public sector um
 
05:35:26.230 --> 05:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
unions the ladder I
 
05:35:31.708 --> 05:35:31.718 align:start position:0%
believe followup for a followup um why
 
05:35:33.150 --> 05:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
is the department of labor included in
 
05:35:34.990 --> 05:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
this bill then because they would have
 
05:35:37.030 --> 05:35:37.040 align:start position:0%
to keep track so the other way that we
 
05:35:38.910 --> 05:35:38.920 align:start position:0%
could do this is we could just have it
 
05:35:40.990 --> 05:35:41.000 align:start position:0%
on a Time based system where it's like
 
05:35:43.708 --> 05:35:43.718 align:start position:0%
every five years um right now they would
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
need to keep track of who was working
 
05:35:48.030 --> 05:35:48.040 align:start position:0%
for the company when the certification
 
05:35:51.510 --> 05:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
occurred um that way when the majority
 
05:35:53.948 --> 05:35:53.958 align:start position:0%
of the employees in that Union are no
 
05:35:55.590 --> 05:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
long weren't there for the vote they
 
05:35:57.948 --> 05:35:57.958 align:start position:0%
could say well now we get to do a
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
recertification um I don't believe that
 
05:36:03.628 --> 05:36:03.638 align:start position:0%
would be the case if uh I I could be
 
05:36:05.190 --> 05:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
wrong about this so I'll put that caveat
 
05:36:08.190 --> 05:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
in if we had a 5-year scheme a 10-year
 
05:36:11.230 --> 05:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
scheme instead that I don't believe that
 
05:36:13.470 --> 05:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
they would need to be uh counting horses
 
05:36:17.910 --> 05:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:20.510 --> 05:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
sense representative K thank you Mr
 
05:36:22.110 --> 05:36:22.120 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
05:36:23.310 --> 05:36:23.320 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
05:36:26.510 --> 05:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
question um would the labor department
 
05:36:28.628 --> 05:36:28.638 align:start position:0%
be in charge of finding out whether or
 
05:36:30.670 --> 05:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
not the new employees had joined the
 
05:36:34.150 --> 05:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
Union uh or were paying agency fees or
 
05:36:35.670 --> 05:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
fair share agreements would it would
 
05:36:38.110 --> 05:36:38.120 align:start position:0%
that be another requirement on your
 
05:36:40.750 --> 05:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
database no they would just have just
 
05:36:42.750 --> 05:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
when they started working there and when
 
05:36:47.788 --> 05:36:47.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:50.310 --> 05:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
you seeing no further questions thank
 
05:36:51.868 --> 05:36:51.878 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
05:36:57.150 --> 05:36:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:12.708 --> 05:37:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:15.150 --> 05:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
thank you and I'm happy to see
 
05:37:16.910 --> 05:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
representative Fairington you're here
 
05:37:18.990 --> 05:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
safe and sound I heard you had an
 
05:37:21.830 --> 05:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
exciting day my name is Melissa
 
05:37:24.110 --> 05:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
Lichfield I am a state representative
 
05:37:26.390 --> 05:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
representing the towns of Brentwood
 
05:37:28.910 --> 05:37:28.920 align:start position:0%
Danville and Fremont I am a co-sponsor
 
05:37:32.070 --> 05:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
on this bill and naturally I'm here to
 
05:37:34.590 --> 05:37:34.600 align:start position:0%
support it unionized employees should
 
05:37:36.510 --> 05:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
have the power to pick which Union is
 
05:37:39.708 --> 05:37:39.718 align:start position:0%
representing them only about 7% of the
 
05:37:41.830 --> 05:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
private sector union members have ever
 
05:37:44.350 --> 05:37:44.360 align:start position:0%
had a say in which union represents them
 
05:37:45.910 --> 05:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
and the percentage for many public
 
05:37:49.110 --> 05:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
employee unions is even lower since most
 
05:37:50.788 --> 05:37:50.798 align:start position:0%
government unions were founded in the
 
05:37:54.390 --> 05:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
1960s and70s few of any of the public
 
05:37:56.548 --> 05:37:56.558 align:start position:0%
employees who voted for these unions are
 
05:37:59.670 --> 05:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
still on the job unionized employees
 
05:38:01.750 --> 05:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
should be empowered to choose on a
 
05:38:03.910 --> 05:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
regular basis what union if any will
 
05:38:07.750 --> 05:38:07.760 align:start position:0%
represent them and this is not about
 
05:38:10.750 --> 05:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
taking power away from the unions it is
 
05:38:13.708 --> 05:38:13.718 align:start position:0%
about empowering the members this is
 
05:38:16.590 --> 05:38:16.600 align:start position:0%
what the union should be all about I
 
05:38:18.430 --> 05:38:18.440 align:start position:0%
just wanted to share personally I had
 
05:38:21.150 --> 05:38:21.160 align:start position:0%
served on two different school boards
 
05:38:24.590 --> 05:38:24.600 align:start position:0%
one for nine years one for six years um
 
05:38:28.548 --> 05:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
I negotiated many collective bargaining
 
05:38:32.990 --> 05:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
agreements um and also M during Co I
 
05:38:36.230 --> 05:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
just have found that um I think many
 
05:38:39.110 --> 05:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
times the members ship was not aware of
 
05:38:41.750 --> 05:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
what the leadership was bringing to us
 
05:38:44.510 --> 05:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
whether it be um contract negotiation
 
05:38:47.390 --> 05:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
stipulations or grievances I think that
 
05:38:48.670 --> 05:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
some of the members would have been
 
05:38:50.548 --> 05:38:50.558 align:start position:0%
embarrassed or horrified to have seen
 
05:38:52.868 --> 05:38:52.878 align:start position:0%
some of that so I just think that this
 
05:38:55.430 --> 05:38:55.440 align:start position:0%
is great for accountability and as I
 
05:38:57.948 --> 05:38:57.958 align:start position:0%
said we're all about choice this is the
 
05:39:00.670 --> 05:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
United States of America thank you thank
 
05:39:04.190 --> 05:39:04.200 align:start position:0%

people also know it as the

congregational churches um and I am here
 
05:39:49.788 --> 05:39:49.798 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the economic Justice
 
05:39:52.310 --> 05:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
Ministry of the Statewide um United
 
05:39:54.230 --> 05:39:54.240 align:start position:0%
Church of Christ and also on behalf of a
 
05:39:56.708 --> 05:39:56.718 align:start position:0%
number of other clergy um throughout the
 
05:40:00.830 --> 05:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and um we we
 
05:40:03.150 --> 05:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
understand uh that some folks um don't
 
05:40:06.548 --> 05:40:06.558 align:start position:0%
like unions and that is you know that's
 
05:40:08.750 --> 05:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine it really is we all have our
 
05:40:10.628 --> 05:40:10.638 align:start position:0%
own way of sort of approaching things
 
05:40:12.910 --> 05:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
and looking at different things but um
 
05:40:15.390 --> 05:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
for this particular bill um Faith
 
05:40:18.070 --> 05:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
communities across the state are um
 
05:40:20.548 --> 05:40:20.558 align:start position:0%
vigorously opposed to House Bill 735 and
 
05:40:22.948 --> 05:40:22.958 align:start position:0%
we strongly urge um in expedient to
 
05:40:25.430 --> 05:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
legislate but I also want to put on my
 
05:40:28.390 --> 05:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
management hat um and I have uh
 
05:40:30.548 --> 05:40:30.558 align:start position:0%
previously been a part of management in
 
05:40:32.708 --> 05:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
the public sector and I would say this
 
05:40:35.430 --> 05:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
bill um as written right now from U my
 
05:40:37.788 --> 05:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
viewpoint from management
 
05:40:39.830 --> 05:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
is stunningly
 
05:40:43.070 --> 05:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
unworkable and um it also to to uh from
 
05:40:44.670 --> 05:40:44.680 align:start position:0%
my perspective again the management
 
05:40:46.548 --> 05:40:46.558 align:start position:0%
perspective and the public sector
 
05:40:49.070 --> 05:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
amounts to a really bureaucratic
 
05:40:53.708 --> 05:40:53.718 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate the idea that um the
 
05:40:56.750 --> 05:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor would have to in um
 
05:40:59.110 --> 05:40:59.120 align:start position:0%
every single one of and uh the fiscal
 
05:41:00.750 --> 05:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
note says that there are at least or
 
05:41:00.760 --> 05:41:01.948 align:start position:0%
note says that there are at least or
approximately

05:41:01.948 --> 05:41:01.958 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
05:41:04.548 --> 05:41:04.558 align:start position:0%
678 public sector bargaining units in
 
05:41:06.670 --> 05:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and that each
 
05:41:10.030 --> 05:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
one of those 678 units or even more as
 
05:41:13.030 --> 05:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
they occur have to track every single
 
05:41:16.350 --> 05:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
worker when they started and then uh the
 
05:41:18.270 --> 05:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor has to get that
 
05:41:21.150 --> 05:41:21.160 align:start position:0%
information which is constantly changing
 
05:41:23.670 --> 05:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
as there is a change over in employees
 
05:41:26.750 --> 05:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
and determine at any given point in time
 
05:41:29.468 --> 05:41:29.478 align:start position:0%
that um some of those people were not
 
05:41:32.350 --> 05:41:32.360 align:start position:0%
members when the union um came into
 
05:41:35.628 --> 05:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
existence or was recertified or or
 
05:41:39.150 --> 05:41:39.160 align:start position:0%
whatever is is it really is mindboggling
 
05:41:41.868 --> 05:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
in terms of how that would work in 678
 
05:41:43.628 --> 05:41:43.638 align:start position:0%
workplaces in the state of New Hampshire
 
05:41:45.468 --> 05:41:45.478 align:start position:0%
so the other thing that just find I want
 
05:41:48.990 --> 05:41:49.000 align:start position:0%
to say that unions are Dynamic
 
05:41:51.990 --> 05:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
organizations um unions are the workers
 
05:41:54.910 --> 05:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
the union is not a third party workers
 
05:41:57.708 --> 05:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
make up the unions workers uh the a
 
05:41:59.628 --> 05:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
majority of workers bring about a bring
 
05:42:02.468 --> 05:42:02.478 align:start position:0%
a union into being not somebody else the
 
05:42:04.230 --> 05:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
workers themselves in that particular
 
05:42:06.510 --> 05:42:06.520 align:start position:0%
workplace and they get to vote on
 
05:42:08.510 --> 05:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
whether or not those Union exists they
 
05:42:10.708 --> 05:42:10.718 align:start position:0%
get to vote on who the officers are they
 
05:42:13.468 --> 05:42:13.478 align:start position:0%
get to vote on what the contract says
 
05:42:16.310 --> 05:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
and um it's an ongoing basis of workers
 
05:42:18.628 --> 05:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
having a voice already on the job in
 
05:42:20.270 --> 05:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
every single public sector workplace
 
05:42:23.830 --> 05:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
wherever there is a union and um so the
 
05:42:27.468 --> 05:42:27.478 align:start position:0%
the bill in its totality is uh just so
 
05:42:29.990 --> 05:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
again un unworkable that if you really
 
05:42:31.548 --> 05:42:31.558 align:start position:0%
think about it if you go through the
 
05:42:33.270 --> 05:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
bill line by line and determine what
 
05:42:35.948 --> 05:42:35.958 align:start position:0%
it's really asking for uh I would hope
 
05:42:37.788 --> 05:42:37.798 align:start position:0%
that this committee would see
 
05:42:40.150 --> 05:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
that it is not workable and is not
 
05:42:42.230 --> 05:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
necessary for the workers who make up
 
05:42:43.910 --> 05:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
the unions in New Hampshire and keep
 
05:42:46.670 --> 05:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
them going so I would uh request
 
05:42:50.310 --> 05:42:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:54.788 --> 05:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
legislate okay any questions
 
05:42:57.310 --> 05:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
for Reverend
 
05:42:59.548 --> 05:42:59.558 align:start position:0%
Kenny seeing n thank you man' I

testimony and uh can I have Glenn
 
05:43:18.548 --> 05:43:18.558 align:start position:0%

International Brotherhood of Electrical
 
05:43:35.948 --> 05:43:35.958 align:start position:0%
Workers and for the last decade I've had
 
05:43:37.750 --> 05:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
the honor and the privilege of being the
 
05:43:39.590 --> 05:43:39.600 align:start position:0%
president of the New Hampshire AFL CIO
 
05:43:42.590 --> 05:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
filling some very large Sho very large
 
05:43:45.190 --> 05:43:45.200 align:start position:0%
shoes uh my organization represents over
 
05:43:47.708 --> 05:43:47.718 align:start position:0%
15 Affiliated labor unions 40,000
 
05:43:49.910 --> 05:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
workers in New Hampshire and uh
 
05:43:51.788 --> 05:43:51.798 align:start position:0%
including our First Responders postal
 
05:43:54.350 --> 05:43:54.360 align:start position:0%

05:43:56.350 --> 05:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
it's more importantly our uh Building
 
05:43:58.788 --> 05:43:58.798 align:start position:0%
Trades our school teachers and we're
 
05:44:01.590 --> 05:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
here today to oppose House Bill 735
 
05:44:04.030 --> 05:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
FN and uh I know you've had a long day
 
05:44:05.190 --> 05:44:05.200 align:start position:0%
here so I'm not going to go through my
 
05:44:06.788 --> 05:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
repaired remarks I just think that this
 
05:44:09.070 --> 05:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
is the waste of all of our time you look
 
05:44:11.468 --> 05:44:11.478 align:start position:0%
at the fiscal notes the fiscal notes are
 
05:44:13.030 --> 05:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
aggressively aggressively
 
05:44:15.750 --> 05:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
underestimating the cost of this um and
 
05:44:17.948 --> 05:44:17.958 align:start position:0%
I think we're better served moving the
 
05:44:19.468 --> 05:44:19.478 align:start position:0%
people's work into something that is
 
05:44:21.830 --> 05:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
less union busting and more proactive
 
05:44:24.150 --> 05:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman okay thank you for
 
05:44:27.190 --> 05:44:27.200 align:start position:0%

representative
 
05:44:32.708 --> 05:44:32.718 align:start position:0%
lir thank you Mr chair um president
 
05:44:34.110 --> 05:44:34.120 align:start position:0%
bracket have any of
 
05:44:36.708 --> 05:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
your members of any of the unions that
 
05:44:39.868 --> 05:44:39.878 align:start position:0%
are being being talked about here asked
 
05:44:41.788 --> 05:44:41.798 align:start position:0%
for something like this not to my
 
05:44:44.070 --> 05:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
knowledge no all right thank
 
05:44:48.548 --> 05:44:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:51.270 --> 05:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative kessing thank
 
05:44:53.110 --> 05:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair so I have a question I I
 
05:44:55.430 --> 05:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
heard it mentioned that there is there
 
05:44:56.948 --> 05:44:56.958 align:start position:0%
is a possibility there's a way for this
 
05:44:58.788 --> 05:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
to happen inside the union I know you
 
05:45:00.750 --> 05:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
represent a lot of them sure so could
 
05:45:02.910 --> 05:45:02.920 align:start position:0%
you explain that maybe a little bit well
 
05:45:05.070 --> 05:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
in in federal laws there's the ability
 
05:45:07.590 --> 05:45:07.600 align:start position:0%
to decertify a union if people don't
 
05:45:09.190 --> 05:45:09.200 align:start position:0%
want to be part of a union they fill out
 
05:45:11.110 --> 05:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
cards and they can call for Union
 
05:45:13.270 --> 05:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
election those are the processes in
 
05:45:14.868 --> 05:45:14.878 align:start position:0%
place with what this bill is calling for
 
05:45:24.230 --> 05:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:26.510 --> 05:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
place so I got a question I'm just
 
05:45:29.510 --> 05:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
trying to understand
 
05:45:33.628 --> 05:45:33.638 align:start position:0%
um so I joined for example I'm a ski
 
05:45:37.910 --> 05:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
patroller F you yeah and um
 
05:45:40.110 --> 05:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
my organization went on strike in Utah
 
05:45:41.150 --> 05:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
two weeks
 
05:45:44.190 --> 05:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
ago and so if I were to
 
05:45:47.190 --> 05:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
join that Union
 
05:45:47.200 --> 05:45:48.990 align:start position:0%
join that Union
MH

05:45:48.990 --> 05:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
MH
 
05:45:51.948 --> 05:45:51.958 align:start position:0%
and not know anyone I don't know anyone
 
05:45:54.788 --> 05:45:54.798 align:start position:0%
there I've never voted for him MH um
 
05:45:57.070 --> 05:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
I've never signed up for him but that's
 
05:46:01.150 --> 05:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
the union that's in my organization sure
 
05:46:03.030 --> 05:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
I would have to and and I was not
 
05:46:05.150 --> 05:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
satisfied with that leadership that in
 
05:46:08.030 --> 05:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
order to get rid of them I would have to
 
05:46:09.548 --> 05:46:09.558 align:start position:0%
go through a
 
05:46:13.548 --> 05:46:13.558 align:start position:0%
process um and sort of a bottomup revolt
 
05:46:16.230 --> 05:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
against that leadership is that I'm
 
05:46:17.788 --> 05:46:17.798 align:start position:0%
sorry if that seems I mean that's just
 
05:46:19.510 --> 05:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
sort of my understanding but I don't
 
05:46:21.150 --> 05:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
well that makes sense too we have to
 
05:46:22.590 --> 05:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
understand first of all unions are
 
05:46:24.510 --> 05:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
democratic organizations if you don't
 
05:46:26.030 --> 05:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
like the leadership every member every
 
05:46:28.150 --> 05:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
member of the Union gets a vote and you
 
05:46:29.510 --> 05:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
have if you have just like all of you
 
05:46:31.190 --> 05:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
sitting here if you do a lousy job your
 
05:46:33.468 --> 05:46:33.478 align:start position:0%
membership will vote you out unions are
 
05:46:35.468 --> 05:46:35.478 align:start position:0%
democratic organization that's what we
 
05:46:37.548 --> 05:46:37.558 align:start position:0%
do if you can't do that and enough
 
05:46:39.030 --> 05:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
people are on the same page as you then
 
05:46:40.910 --> 05:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
you can absolutely just desertify your
 
05:46:42.548 --> 05:46:42.558 align:start position:0%
union and you can find another Union or
 
05:46:43.788 --> 05:46:43.798 align:start position:0%
you can go
 
05:46:46.868 --> 05:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
non-union okay and so for a followup
 
05:46:49.510 --> 05:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
question then that vote you said you can
 
05:46:52.868 --> 05:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
vote them out when does that occur after
 
05:46:54.548 --> 05:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
enough cards assigned when you have
 
05:46:56.548 --> 05:46:56.558 align:start position:0%
enough members of your organization
 
05:46:57.868 --> 05:46:57.878 align:start position:0%
enough members of the Bing unit that
 
05:46:59.390 --> 05:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
want to change representation they have
 
05:47:02.390 --> 05:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
that ability yes okay and and that
 
05:47:04.670 --> 05:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
number is that in federal law or is that
 
05:47:07.110 --> 05:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
in Union rules how it's not Union rules
 
05:47:09.750 --> 05:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
it would be and I'm not I think it's in
 
05:47:11.390 --> 05:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
state law and federal law is it state
 
05:47:12.868 --> 05:47:12.878 align:start position:0%
and federal law I think it's in both
 
05:47:14.628 --> 05:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
yeah okay great thank you for the thank
 
05:47:16.708 --> 05:47:16.718 align:start position:0%
you for chairman
 
05:47:16.718 --> 05:47:18.310 align:start position:0%
you for chairman
273

05:47:18.310 --> 05:47:18.320 align:start position:0%
273
 
05:47:18.320 --> 05:47:20.390 align:start position:0%
273
273a

05:47:20.390 --> 05:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
273a
 
05:47:22.708 --> 05:47:22.718 align:start position:0%
okay and representative Kine you have
 
05:47:24.548 --> 05:47:24.558 align:start position:0%
another question thank you Mr chair so I
 
05:47:26.590 --> 05:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
have a followup to that so the question
 
05:47:27.910 --> 05:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
that i' have is how many times has that
 
05:47:31.708 --> 05:47:31.718 align:start position:0%
happened uh that in the state oh boy um
 
05:47:35.150 --> 05:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
there's it's happened um it's happened
 
05:47:37.150 --> 05:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
quite a bit in the public sector yeah
 
05:47:39.788 --> 05:47:39.798 align:start position:0%
but put a specific number on
 
05:47:43.390 --> 05:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
it great thank you representative kahill
 
05:47:45.190 --> 05:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
and then representative Schultz thank
 
05:47:47.310 --> 05:47:47.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr bracket
 
05:47:49.628 --> 05:47:49.638 align:start position:0%
the process you describe for
 
05:47:51.910 --> 05:47:51.920 align:start position:0%
decertifying is that rather similar to
 
05:47:54.468 --> 05:47:54.478 align:start position:0%
the process to certify a union yes it's
 
05:47:58.310 --> 05:47:58.320 align:start position:0%
the number of cards yep thank you okay
 
05:48:00.430 --> 05:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz thank you Mr
 
05:48:03.030 --> 05:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
chair haven't uh some unions in New
 
05:48:05.110 --> 05:48:05.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I can think of one prominent
 
05:48:08.190 --> 05:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
Union who had considered even swapping
 
05:48:11.430 --> 05:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
to a a different International yes you
 
05:48:13.830 --> 05:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
um that happens that can happen as well
 
05:48:16.070 --> 05:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
right it Happ it happens more often than
 
05:48:17.548 --> 05:48:17.558 align:start position:0%
you would think where you want to still
 
05:48:20.510 --> 05:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
have a union but not that Union there
 
05:48:22.030 --> 05:48:22.040 align:start position:0%
there's a history here in New Hampshire
 
05:48:25.628 --> 05:48:25.638 align:start position:0%
of unions um bargaining units changing
 
05:48:28.788 --> 05:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
your representation for exactly that
 
05:48:31.430 --> 05:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
reason representative
 
05:48:34.628 --> 05:48:34.638 align:start position:0%
suin thank you for taking my question um
 
05:48:37.350 --> 05:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
is it accurate to say that uh since this
 
05:48:40.070 --> 05:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
is a public sector bill that this would
 
05:48:42.670 --> 05:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
be governed this would be dealing with
 
05:48:48.070 --> 05:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:50.310 --> 05:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
273a I don't want to answer that because
 
05:48:51.910 --> 05:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the whole statute of
 
05:48:54.910 --> 05:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
273a speaks to
 
05:48:54.920 --> 05:48:56.628 align:start position:0%
273a speaks to
Brian

05:48:56.628 --> 05:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
Brian
 
05:48:59.390 --> 05:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
I since I represented public sector
 
05:49:01.868 --> 05:49:01.878 align:start position:0%
unions for 25 years I can assure you
 
05:49:04.590 --> 05:49:04.600 align:start position:0%
that RSA 273a is the
 
05:49:09.150 --> 05:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:12.868 --> 05:49:12.878 align:start position:0%
really y all right subject to any
 
05:49:14.830 --> 05:49:14.840 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir oh I'm sorry
 
05:49:14.840 --> 05:49:16.350 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir oh I'm sorry
represent

05:49:16.350 --> 05:49:16.360 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:49:20.150 --> 05:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
McKenzie so um thank you Mr President
 
05:49:20.160 --> 05:49:21.910 align:start position:0%
McKenzie so um thank you Mr President
bracket

05:49:21.910 --> 05:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
bracket
 
05:49:25.510 --> 05:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
So based on your experience the 45 years
 
05:49:28.070 --> 05:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
in in the labor movement and I know
 
05:49:30.030 --> 05:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
you've negotiated many contracts because
 
05:49:32.670 --> 05:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
I've stood next you many times so tell
 
05:49:37.230 --> 05:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
me what this would be like uh in in a
 
05:49:40.510 --> 05:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
union if every few years they're
 
05:49:41.910 --> 05:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
required to
 
05:49:44.468 --> 05:49:44.478 align:start position:0%
stand uh for an election how would this
 
05:49:44.478 --> 05:49:45.990 align:start position:0%
stand uh for an election how would this
impact

05:49:45.990 --> 05:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
impact
 
05:49:49.510 --> 05:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
bargaining uh the flow of work yeah uh
 
05:49:52.948 --> 05:49:52.958 align:start position:0%
if all this is happening constantly
 
05:49:56.750 --> 05:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
rumbling uh uh this uh this whole setup
 
05:49:58.548 --> 05:49:58.558 align:start position:0%
that we currently have what impact would
 
05:50:00.670 --> 05:50:00.680 align:start position:0%
that have on delivering Services well I
 
05:50:03.468 --> 05:50:03.478 align:start position:0%
think um the way you phrase the question
 
05:50:05.150 --> 05:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
it's apparent to all what would happen
 
05:50:07.548 --> 05:50:07.558 align:start position:0%
it would be it would be um it would be
 
05:50:08.510 --> 05:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
05:50:10.990 --> 05:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
just Quagmire I guess is the word I'd
 
05:50:13.110 --> 05:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
use nothing would move forward um but
 
05:50:15.270 --> 05:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
I'd also put it out this way you know
 
05:50:17.350 --> 05:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
what if every what if every year instead
 
05:50:18.990 --> 05:50:19.000 align:start position:0%
of every two years members of this
 
05:50:20.628 --> 05:50:20.638 align:start position:0%
legislature had to go up for re-election
 
05:50:21.948 --> 05:50:21.958 align:start position:0%
if it was every
 
05:50:24.948 --> 05:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
year well so that's the answer to my
 
05:50:24.958 --> 05:50:27.830 align:start position:0%
year well so that's the answer to my
question

05:50:27.830 --> 05:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:32.670 --> 05:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:43.110 --> 05:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:44.590 --> 05:50:44.600 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chair members of the
 
05:50:46.110 --> 05:50:46.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record once again
 
05:50:47.750 --> 05:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Brian will the president of
 
05:50:48.990 --> 05:50:49.000 align:start position:0%
the professional firefighters of New
 
05:50:51.230 --> 05:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we represent 43 local
 
05:50:54.030 --> 05:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
unions throughout the granite state um I
 
05:50:55.590 --> 05:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
will be super brief as you've seen me
 
05:50:58.070 --> 05:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
enough today I speak here today in
 
05:51:01.548 --> 05:51:01.558 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill 735 uh and just
 
05:51:03.070 --> 05:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
to Echo a couple of the remarks that
 
05:51:04.430 --> 05:51:04.440 align:start position:0%
we've already heard uh yes
 
05:51:05.948 --> 05:51:05.958 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie there is a
 
05:51:08.468 --> 05:51:08.478 align:start position:0%
decertification ation process in place
 
05:51:11.150 --> 05:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
that has worked for many years um and
 
05:51:13.430 --> 05:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's worked well um I also heard the
 
05:51:15.350 --> 05:51:15.360 align:start position:0%
question asked whether or not locals
 
05:51:17.390 --> 05:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
have decertified and exercised that
 
05:51:21.070 --> 05:51:21.080 align:start position:0%
process it has worked um we've seen it
 
05:51:24.230 --> 05:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
in our organization we've seen um folks
 
05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
decertify and move to a different labor
 
05:51:28.910 --> 05:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
organization we've seen folks decertify
 
05:51:31.070 --> 05:51:31.080 align:start position:0%
from a different labor organization and
 
05:51:33.310 --> 05:51:33.320 align:start position:0%
come with the professional firefighters
 
05:51:36.230 --> 05:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
um collabora collaboratively throughout
 
05:51:37.868 --> 05:51:37.878 align:start position:0%
the state the unions work very well
 
05:51:39.270 --> 05:51:39.280 align:start position:0%
together we have a harmonious
 
05:51:41.548 --> 05:51:41.558 align:start position:0%
relationship with one another um so we
 
05:51:45.510 --> 05:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
do not prevent any members right um from
 
05:51:46.990 --> 05:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
leaving one labor organization and
 
05:51:50.830 --> 05:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
moving on to another um the the idea
 
05:51:53.270 --> 05:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
that there may be a a strong arming of
 
05:51:55.548 --> 05:51:55.558 align:start position:0%
sorts to keep members involved in the
 
05:51:58.510 --> 05:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
union just simply does not occur um at
 
05:52:00.190 --> 05:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
least in our profession here in New
 
05:52:03.190 --> 05:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and so I just want to quell
 
05:52:05.310 --> 05:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
that rumor to begin with also I'd like
 
05:52:07.468 --> 05:52:07.478 align:start position:0%
to to say that I think it's interesting
 
05:52:10.190 --> 05:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
that we talk about empowering unions um
 
05:52:13.350 --> 05:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
and and and there was a fairly lengthy
 
05:52:15.310 --> 05:52:15.320 align:start position:0%
uh discussion on right to work uh
 
05:52:18.030 --> 05:52:18.040 align:start position:0%
previously and even many proponents of
 
05:52:20.350 --> 05:52:20.360 align:start position:0%
Right to Work say that it's about
 
05:52:23.150 --> 05:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
choosing a labor organization and
 
05:52:25.868 --> 05:52:25.878 align:start position:0%
members choose to certify as a labor
 
05:52:28.190 --> 05:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
organization with a certain Union and
 
05:52:30.070 --> 05:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
they have that right as it stands right
 
05:52:34.230 --> 05:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
now to leave um if they uh choose to
 
05:52:35.868 --> 05:52:35.878 align:start position:0%
exercise that right that's great if
 
05:52:37.270 --> 05:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
they're forced
 
05:52:40.110 --> 05:52:40.120 align:start position:0%
every so often um it's going to lead to
 
05:52:43.310 --> 05:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
a Slowdown in as representative McKenzie
 
05:52:46.270 --> 05:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh the the operations it's
 
05:52:49.110 --> 05:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
going to lead to a lack of Harmony
 
05:52:50.830 --> 05:52:50.840 align:start position:0%
within the labor and management
 
05:52:54.190 --> 05:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
collaborative and it also has unintended
 
05:52:56.430 --> 05:52:56.440 align:start position:0%
consequences of impacting the other side
 
05:52:58.948 --> 05:52:58.958 align:start position:0%
of the table so while the thought might
 
05:53:01.830 --> 05:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
be that this may weaken unions I a don't
 
05:53:03.628 --> 05:53:03.638 align:start position:0%
believe that to be true and B I believe
 
05:53:06.030 --> 05:53:06.040 align:start position:0%
the unintended consequences are that it
 
05:53:08.468 --> 05:53:08.478 align:start position:0%
affects the management side uh in that
 
05:53:10.670 --> 05:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
it's costly it's timec consuming and
 
05:53:12.910 --> 05:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
it's problematic um and it increases
 
05:53:14.948 --> 05:53:14.958 align:start position:0%
anxiety amongst the workforce so I would
 
05:53:16.948 --> 05:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
ask you all to respectfully uh oppose
 
05:53:19.070 --> 05:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
this legislation thank you thank you for
 
05:53:21.070 --> 05:53:21.080 align:start position:0%
your testimony are there any questions
 
05:53:22.868 --> 05:53:22.878 align:start position:0%
around the
 
05:53:25.310 --> 05:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
table saying no questions thank you sir
 
05:53:27.270 --> 05:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
I appreciate you long
 
05:53:42.788 --> 05:53:42.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:45.350 --> 05:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
um thank you m excuse me uh thank you Mr
 
05:53:47.190 --> 05:53:47.200 align:start position:0%
chairman for the record Brian Hawkins
 
05:53:49.190 --> 05:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
representing Nea New Hampshire uh we
 
05:53:51.110 --> 05:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
represent um over
 
05:53:54.510 --> 05:53:54.520 align:start position:0%
17,000 um Educators across the state uh
 
05:53:57.030 --> 05:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
in uh quite a few
 
05:53:59.390 --> 05:53:59.400 align:start position:0%
locals um and we're here in opposition
 
05:54:01.310 --> 05:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
to um hospit
 
05:54:04.190 --> 05:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
7:35 um a lot of what I had prepared has
 
05:54:06.430 --> 05:54:06.440 align:start position:0%
been said already so I'll I'll just
 
05:54:07.868 --> 05:54:07.878 align:start position:0%
summarize and I do have written
 
05:54:10.548 --> 05:54:10.558 align:start position:0%
testimony I can hand in please thank you
 
05:54:13.190 --> 05:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh so we we feel like House Bill
 
05:54:16.190 --> 05:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
735 is nothing more than an attack on
 
05:54:17.910 --> 05:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
collective bargaining and unions and
 
05:54:20.070 --> 05:54:20.080 align:start position:0%
would make it harder for unions to fight
 
05:54:21.430 --> 05:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
for things that make a difference for
 
05:54:24.070 --> 05:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
our members and for their students our
 
05:54:25.590 --> 05:54:25.600 align:start position:0%
members bargain for higher wages and
 
05:54:27.270 --> 05:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
benefits so we can retain and attract
 
05:54:29.510 --> 05:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
the best Educators possible to educate
 
05:54:31.628 --> 05:54:31.638 align:start position:0%
the Next Generation and we're also
 
05:54:33.830 --> 05:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
advocating to make sure that our
 
05:54:36.390 --> 05:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
workplaces which are also our CL
 
05:54:38.750 --> 05:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
classrooms and our schools are safer
 
05:54:41.948 --> 05:54:41.958 align:start position:0%
places to learn um the bill inserts
 
05:54:44.150 --> 05:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
what's already been brought up as a
 
05:54:46.750 --> 05:54:46.760 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic uh nightmare of a process
 
05:54:49.310 --> 05:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
to determine bargaining units and as was
 
05:54:51.750 --> 05:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
stated before there is already a process
 
05:54:53.948 --> 05:54:53.958 align:start position:0%
to do that and I think it's important to
 
05:54:57.548 --> 05:54:57.558 align:start position:0%
emphasize that that process is done by
 
05:55:01.708 --> 05:55:01.718 align:start position:0%
the workers it is the workers choice to
 
05:55:05.468 --> 05:55:05.478 align:start position:0%
uh form a union it should be Theirs to
 
05:55:08.190 --> 05:55:08.200 align:start position:0%
if they want to D certify their Union
 
05:55:10.310 --> 05:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
and as was described earlier there is
 
05:55:13.430 --> 05:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
already a process to do that so uh we
 
05:55:15.150 --> 05:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
would respect this bill actually has
 
05:55:16.190 --> 05:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
come before the New Hampshire
 
05:55:17.788 --> 05:55:17.798 align:start position:0%
legislature before in
 
05:55:20.350 --> 05:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
2020 um I believe it's the exact same
 
05:55:22.150 --> 05:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
language and this was
 
05:55:24.788 --> 05:55:24.798 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly uh defeated
 
05:55:28.230 --> 05:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
recommended uh by this committee um itl
 
05:55:29.750 --> 05:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
and so we would ask that uh this
 
05:55:32.110 --> 05:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
committee do that once again and we can
 
05:55:34.190 --> 05:55:34.200 align:start position:0%
move on to other things so thank you
 
05:55:35.868 --> 05:55:35.878 align:start position:0%

05:55:36.868 --> 05:55:36.878 align:start position:0%

05:55:39.910 --> 05:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions
 
05:55:39.920 --> 05:55:41.750 align:start position:0%
questions are there any questions
representative

05:55:41.750 --> 05:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:55:45.030 --> 05:55:45.040 align:start position:0%
McKenzie so the first uh the first
 
05:55:46.750 --> 05:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
sentence I believe of the Public
 
05:55:48.788 --> 05:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
Employee lab relations law is is are
 
05:55:51.830 --> 05:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
there to promote harmonious relations
 
05:55:54.590 --> 05:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
among the employees and the employers so
 
05:55:54.600 --> 05:55:55.628 align:start position:0%
among the employees and the employers so
tell

05:55:55.628 --> 05:55:55.638 align:start position:0%
tell
 
05:55:58.788 --> 05:55:58.798 align:start position:0%
me if you have a
 
05:56:02.350 --> 05:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
situation where this C this
 
05:56:05.708 --> 05:56:05.718 align:start position:0%
ongoing ongoing process is disrupting
 
05:56:08.110 --> 05:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
bargaining it's disrupting relationships
 
05:56:10.750 --> 05:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
with employees how does that meet the
 
05:56:14.190 --> 05:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
test of promoting harmonious relations
 
05:56:16.708 --> 05:56:16.718 align:start position:0%
uh for the for the organization and for
 
05:56:18.310 --> 05:56:18.320 align:start position:0%
that's the law or the land that's that's
 
05:56:20.150 --> 05:56:20.160 align:start position:0%
what we're working on thank you for the
 
05:56:23.830 --> 05:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
question um and I would say it doesn't
 
05:56:25.190 --> 05:56:25.200 align:start position:0%
promote that at all does the exact
 
05:56:27.628 --> 05:56:27.638 align:start position:0%
opposite in fact as I mentioned at the
 
05:56:28.868 --> 05:56:28.878 align:start position:0%
top of my
 
05:56:32.670 --> 05:56:32.680 align:start position:0%
testimony uh it really um moves away
 
05:56:35.070 --> 05:56:35.080 align:start position:0%
from the whole purpose uh the other
 
05:56:37.468 --> 05:56:37.478 align:start position:0%
purpose that uh unions are there for
 
05:56:40.110 --> 05:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
which is to represent and to fight for
 
05:56:44.910 --> 05:56:44.920 align:start position:0%
their members and this um uh uh takes up
 
05:56:49.670 --> 05:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
um resources bandwidth time um uh rather
 
05:56:51.628 --> 05:56:51.638 align:start position:0%
than uh trying to make sure that their
 
05:56:58.628 --> 05:56:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:01.670 --> 05:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
so okay see no further questions please
 
05:57:02.788 --> 05:57:02.798 align:start position:0%
uh if you could give the clerk the
 
05:57:04.468 --> 05:57:04.478 align:start position:0%
testimony that would be
 
05:57:10.990 --> 05:57:11.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:25.150 --> 05:57:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:27.350 --> 05:57:27.360 align:start position:0%
next good afternoon Mr chairman
 
05:57:28.670 --> 05:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee for
 
05:57:30.390 --> 05:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Richard gulla
 
05:57:31.628 --> 05:57:31.638 align:start position:0%
president of the state employees
 
05:57:34.628 --> 05:57:34.638 align:start position:0%
Association of New Hampshire I represent
 
05:57:36.750 --> 05:57:36.760 align:start position:0%
10,000 hardworking newshire for public
 
05:57:39.190 --> 05:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
employees and
 
05:57:41.230 --> 05:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
retirees I'll be brief I know it's been
 
05:57:43.468 --> 05:57:43.478 align:start position:0%
a long day for all you folks and I have
 
05:57:45.948 --> 05:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
uh written testimony that I can submit I
 
05:57:47.868 --> 05:57:47.878 align:start position:0%
just want to highlight a few things from
 
05:57:51.390 --> 05:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
it um let me start with two blunt
 
05:57:53.548 --> 05:57:53.558 align:start position:0%
questions why would this bill be a
 
05:57:56.310 --> 05:57:56.320 align:start position:0%
priority for elected officials why would
 
05:57:57.948 --> 05:57:57.958 align:start position:0%
someone want to Target and restrict
 
05:57:59.830 --> 05:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
freedom of people simply because they
 
05:58:02.510 --> 05:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
are members of the Union given the
 
05:58:04.788 --> 05:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
complexities and challenges we are all
 
05:58:07.390 --> 05:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
facing this legislative session we are
 
05:58:09.468 --> 05:58:09.478 align:start position:0%
now especially in need to be working
 
05:58:12.708 --> 05:58:12.718 align:start position:0%
together not advocating breaking people
 
05:58:15.030 --> 05:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
apart some of you may know that this
 
05:58:17.190 --> 05:58:17.200 align:start position:0%
past weekend the New Hampshire GOP
 
05:58:19.110 --> 05:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
passed a resolution relating to union
 
05:58:21.628 --> 05:58:21.638 align:start position:0%
members it was passed with broad support
 
05:58:23.230 --> 05:58:23.240 align:start position:0%
by those present for the New Hampshire
 
05:58:26.230 --> 05:58:26.240 align:start position:0%
gop's annual meeting the resolution
 
05:58:30.110 --> 05:58:30.120 align:start position:0%
stated the following be it resolved that
 
05:58:31.910 --> 05:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire GOP welcomes
 
05:58:34.590 --> 05:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
workingclass Granite Staters including
 
05:58:36.708 --> 05:58:36.718 align:start position:0%
union members
 
05:58:39.350 --> 05:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
into our expanding big tent as we make
 
05:58:41.230 --> 05:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
America great
 
05:58:44.708 --> 05:58:44.718 align:start position:0%
again the intent and contents of House
 
05:58:47.868 --> 05:58:47.878 align:start position:0%
Bill 735 is a complete contradiction to
 
05:58:50.468 --> 05:58:50.478 align:start position:0%
welcoming working Granite stators which
 
05:58:53.548 --> 05:58:53.558 align:start position:0%
is most certainly includes union
 
05:58:56.350 --> 05:58:56.360 align:start position:0%
members supporters of this bill are
 
05:58:59.590 --> 05:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
trying to restrict the freedom of nurses
 
05:59:02.350 --> 05:59:02.360 align:start position:0%
teachers firefighters police officers
 
05:59:04.830 --> 05:59:04.840 align:start position:0%
and other public employees to come
 
05:59:07.628 --> 05:59:07.638 align:start position:0%
together to have their voice heard these
 
05:59:09.350 --> 05:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
folks who serve our community have the
 
05:59:11.030 --> 05:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
right to protect their retirement and
 
05:59:14.230 --> 05:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
health care as they see fit and anti-un
 
05:59:16.190 --> 05:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
extremists in our state capital are
 
05:59:20.350 --> 05:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
trying to restrict to that end our right
 
05:59:21.750 --> 05:59:21.760 align:start position:0%
we know that we have worked in good
 
05:59:24.190 --> 05:59:24.200 align:start position:0%
faith with numerous sponsors of this
 
05:59:26.110 --> 05:59:26.120 align:start position:0%
bill and we hope we can quickly return
 
05:59:28.150 --> 05:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
to that Dynamic and work together to
 
05:59:30.590 --> 05:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
deliver on our promises to the Granite
 
05:59:33.030 --> 05:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
State and with that I'll conclude I'll
 
05:59:35.548 --> 05:59:35.558 align:start position:0%
pass this in and I would ask you to uh
 
05:59:38.230 --> 05:59:38.240 align:start position:0%
pass this in expedient to legislate
 
05:59:39.350 --> 05:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your input and your
 
05:59:41.110 --> 05:59:41.120 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Schultz do you
 
05:59:44.708 --> 05:59:44.718 align:start position:0%
have a question this will be quick um I
 
05:59:48.788 --> 05:59:48.798 align:start position:0%
know be in recent years it that the
 
05:59:51.230 --> 05:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
breakdown of your membership essentially
 
05:59:53.830 --> 05:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
matched the proportion of party
 
05:59:55.830 --> 05:59:55.840 align:start position:0%
representation as the whole state is
 
05:59:58.350 --> 05:59:58.360 align:start position:0%
that still the case uh pretty it's
 
06:00:00.270 --> 06:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
changed it used to be a third third and
 
06:00:03.628 --> 06:00:03.638 align:start position:0%
a third um I I now have more registered
 
06:00:05.590 --> 06:00:05.600 align:start position:0%
Republicans that I represent than
 
06:00:08.948 --> 06:00:08.958 align:start position:0%
Democrat rats and then more Independence
 
06:00:10.670 --> 06:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
which does follow the state there are
 
06:00:12.310 --> 06:00:12.320 align:start position:0%
more registered Independence now but
 
06:00:14.190 --> 06:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
it's Independence Republicans and
 
06:00:16.190 --> 06:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
Democrats I have a lot of Republican
 
06:00:19.430 --> 06:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
members that are active that um it's
 
06:00:21.468 --> 06:00:21.478 align:start position:0%
like sticking a poking their eye with a
 
06:00:23.030 --> 06:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
stick with these type of pieces of
 
06:00:25.910 --> 06:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
legislation they're hardworking citizens
 
06:00:27.990 --> 06:00:28.000 align:start position:0%
and they're taxpayers and they're
 
06:00:28.000 --> 06:00:32.030 align:start position:0%
and they're taxpayers and they're

06:01:21.150 --> 06:01:21.160 align:start position:0%
something that would tie up our public

employee unions in uh a mountain of red
 
06:01:26.788 --> 06:01:26.798 align:start position:0%
tape and it it would make it harder for

us to do our job representing our
 
06:01:32.590 --> 06:01:32.600 align:start position:0%

the way supports unions we recently

conducted uh we recently got information
 
06:02:30.190 --> 06:02:30.200 align:start position:0%
from a bipartisan poll from Raba
 
06:02:32.670 --> 06:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
research that said Granite State voters
 
06:02:35.590 --> 06:02:35.600 align:start position:0%
this poll was just conducted last week
 
06:02:40.110 --> 06:02:40.120 align:start position:0%
at finished um yesterday and 90% of
 
06:02:42.750 --> 06:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
Granite State voters approve of the
 
06:02:46.590 --> 06:02:46.600 align:start position:0%
right to join a union and similarly 90%
 
06:02:50.070 --> 06:02:50.080 align:start position:0%
disapprove of any action by legislators
 
06:02:51.868 --> 06:02:51.878 align:start position:0%
that would interfere with the right to
 
06:02:53.910 --> 06:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
collectively bargain this bill
 
06:02:55.350 --> 06:02:55.360 align:start position:0%
definitely interferes with the right to
 
06:02:56.990 --> 06:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
collectively bargain because it makes it
 
06:02:59.468 --> 06:02:59.478 align:start position:0%
harder for public sector unions to focus
 
06:03:01.788 --> 06:03:01.798 align:start position:0%
on their job of
 
06:03:05.628 --> 06:03:05.638 align:start position:0%
improving wages working conditions and
 
06:03:05.638 --> 06:03:06.270 align:start position:0%
improving wages working conditions and
uh

06:03:06.270 --> 06:03:06.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:03:09.110 --> 06:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
benefits for our
 
06:03:12.910 --> 06:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
members and uh the ability to serve our
 
06:03:14.590 --> 06:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
communities whether it's you know
 
06:03:16.788 --> 06:03:16.798 align:start position:0%
through our schools or through our town
 
06:03:20.150 --> 06:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
Services um couple more things the red
 
06:03:22.670 --> 06:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
tape this would cause and the difficulty
 
06:03:26.510 --> 06:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
administering it is grossly understated
 
06:03:29.270 --> 06:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
in in the very brief Bill someone would
 
06:03:32.390 --> 06:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
have to keep track of where all these
 
06:03:34.990 --> 06:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
employees are and it's hard enough for
 
06:03:36.910 --> 06:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
us to find out who is in the covered
 
06:03:39.468 --> 06:03:39.478 align:start position:0%
Workforce when we want to go and bargain
 
06:03:41.910 --> 06:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
a contract getting that list out of the
 
06:03:43.788 --> 06:03:43.798 align:start position:0%
public employer is very difficult
 
06:03:45.590 --> 06:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot of change in our
 
06:03:47.670 --> 06:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
Workforce we're talking day-to-day week
 
06:03:49.390 --> 06:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
to week finding out who all the
 
06:03:52.270 --> 06:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
employees are and who of them are by the
 
06:03:54.310 --> 06:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
way permanent employees as opposed to
 
06:03:56.990 --> 06:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
contracted employees in these days of
 
06:04:00.070 --> 06:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
Workforce shortage when we can't fill
 
06:04:02.070 --> 06:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
positions finding out who's actually an
 
06:04:04.750 --> 06:04:04.760 align:start position:0%
employee and versus versus a temporary
 
06:04:07.110 --> 06:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
is very difficult so you're creating
 
06:04:10.548 --> 06:04:10.558 align:start position:0%
work for the local school district or
 
06:04:14.468 --> 06:04:14.478 align:start position:0%
town um personnel office you're creating
 
06:04:16.468 --> 06:04:16.478 align:start position:0%
work for is it the Department of Labor
 
06:04:18.510 --> 06:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
or the public employees labor relation
 
06:04:20.948 --> 06:04:20.958 align:start position:0%
board the bill was a little unclear on
 
06:04:22.548 --> 06:04:22.558 align:start position:0%
that one thing in the taxt another thing
 
06:04:24.948 --> 06:04:24.958 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note um someone's going to
 
06:04:26.310 --> 06:04:26.320 align:start position:0%
keep track of that someone's going to go
 
06:04:27.788 --> 06:04:27.798 align:start position:0%
back and compare that to the list of
 
06:04:29.430 --> 06:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
people who were eligible at the time the
 
06:04:31.590 --> 06:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
union was certified some of our locals
 
06:04:34.150 --> 06:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
have been around for 75 years and
 
06:04:36.310 --> 06:04:36.320 align:start position:0%
there's no great
 
06:04:36.320 --> 06:04:38.430 align:start position:0%
there's no great
evidence

06:04:38.430 --> 06:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
06:04:42.910 --> 06:04:42.920 align:start position:0%
that employees in covered workplaces are
 
06:04:45.990 --> 06:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
dissatisfied with the unions that are
 
06:04:48.830 --> 06:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
there um there are already mechanisms if
 
06:04:50.868 --> 06:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
they are they can work within the union
 
06:04:53.910 --> 06:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
if they're a member and try and change
 
06:04:56.510 --> 06:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
the way the union is run they can uh go
 
06:04:58.270 --> 06:04:58.280 align:start position:0%
through the desertification process
 
06:05:00.310 --> 06:05:00.320 align:start position:0%
that's already been talked about but
 
06:05:03.670 --> 06:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
according to the Bureau of Labor
 
06:05:06.788 --> 06:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
Statistics in work places that have
 
06:05:08.830 --> 06:05:08.840 align:start position:0%
unions about
 
06:05:13.190 --> 06:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
90% of workers choose to be members cuz
 
06:05:15.390 --> 06:05:15.400 align:start position:0%
you can't force anyone to be a member we
 
06:05:17.190 --> 06:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
had a whole big long hearing about that
 
06:05:20.310 --> 06:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
last week we already know that so they
 
06:05:24.270 --> 06:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
choose to join they choose to pay into a
 
06:05:26.468 --> 06:05:26.478 align:start position:0%
union in New
 
06:05:30.390 --> 06:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so um yeah we oppose this bill
 
06:05:32.310 --> 06:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
it would tie us up in red tape it would
 
06:05:35.628 --> 06:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
keep us from doing our job which is rep
 
06:05:37.830 --> 06:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
representing our members bargaining for
 
06:05:42.190 --> 06:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
better wages working conditions benefits
 
06:05:44.830 --> 06:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
and resources to help us do our jobs
 
06:05:46.590 --> 06:05:46.600 align:start position:0%
well for the people of the communities
 
06:05:49.310 --> 06:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
of the Granite State um that's why we
 
06:05:51.788 --> 06:05:51.798 align:start position:0%
oppose HB 735 we hope you'll find it an
 
06:05:54.430 --> 06:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate and if you have
 
06:05:56.270 --> 06:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
questions I will try and take them but
 
06:06:01.030 --> 06:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah they probably areer questions
 
06:06:03.548 --> 06:06:03.558 align:start position:0%
yeah seeing none thank you ma'am
 
06:06:06.628 --> 06:06:06.638 align:start position:0%
appreciate your your testimony
 
06:06:23.990 --> 06:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:26.030 --> 06:06:26.040 align:start position:0%

Doug

06:06:32.310 --> 06:06:32.320 align:start position:0%
Doug
 
06:06:34.868 --> 06:06:34.878 align:start position:0%
ingersol I'm the executive director of
 
06:06:36.590 --> 06:06:36.600 align:start position:0%
the public employee Labor Relations
 
06:06:40.548 --> 06:06:40.558 align:start position:0%
Board I've worked for the board since
 
06:06:43.830 --> 06:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
2006 uh I'm not here to take a position
 
06:06:47.548 --> 06:06:47.558 align:start position:0%
on the bill I'm here to give a hopefully
 
06:06:51.628 --> 06:06:51.638 align:start position:0%
a very brief overview of processes that
 
06:06:54.708 --> 06:06:54.718 align:start position:0%
are in the existing law so that you have
 
06:06:57.948 --> 06:06:57.958 align:start position:0%
that context when you make a decision uh
 
06:07:00.190 --> 06:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
or recommendation on this
 
06:07:03.230 --> 06:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
bill um and also maybe to offer a
 
06:07:06.030 --> 06:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
comment about the references to to the
 
06:07:07.430 --> 06:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
06:07:10.230 --> 06:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
Labor um starting with the number of
 
06:07:12.990 --> 06:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
bargaining units there are about 678 in
 
06:07:17.350 --> 06:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
the state 39 state two two Judiciary
 
06:07:19.590 --> 06:07:19.600 align:start position:0%
three Community College three Plymouth
 
06:07:22.670 --> 06:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
State five University system of New
 
06:07:26.548 --> 06:07:26.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 69 City that are not school
 
06:07:31.310 --> 06:07:31.320 align:start position:0%
district or law enforcement 40 county
 
06:07:35.230 --> 06:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
332 education 75 law enforcement and by
 
06:07:35.240 --> 06:07:35.990 align:start position:0%
332 education 75 law enforcement and by
that

06:07:35.990 --> 06:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:07:39.190 --> 06:07:39.200 align:start position:0%
uh I mean any any bargaining unit that
 
06:07:42.788 --> 06:07:42.798 align:start position:0%
is strictly police officers or employees
 
06:07:44.190 --> 06:07:44.200 align:start position:0%
of police
 
06:07:47.350 --> 06:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
departments uh Municipal 104 which does
 
06:07:48.990 --> 06:07:49.000 align:start position:0%
not include the school district or the
 
06:07:50.910 --> 06:07:50.920 align:start position:0%
law enforcement but which which does
 
06:07:50.920 --> 06:07:52.430 align:start position:0%
law enforcement but which which does
include

06:07:52.430 --> 06:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
include
 
06:07:54.670 --> 06:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
firefighters uh and then Keen State
 
06:07:57.868 --> 06:07:57.878 align:start position:0%
College uh six so according to my math
 
06:08:01.868 --> 06:08:01.878 align:start position:0%
that comes out to 678 bargaining units
 
06:08:04.708 --> 06:08:04.718 align:start position:0%
the board uh has been in operation since
 
06:08:07.390 --> 06:08:07.400 align:start position:0%
197 6 there were some bargaining units
 
06:08:10.270 --> 06:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
that were grandfathered in at that time
 
06:08:12.628 --> 06:08:12.638 align:start position:0%
but the vast majority have been
 
06:08:15.110 --> 06:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
established through elections that we
 
06:08:17.350 --> 06:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
have conducted since
 
06:08:19.788 --> 06:08:19.798 align:start position:0%
1976 and elections for new bargaining
 
06:08:22.350 --> 06:08:22.360 align:start position:0%
units are ongoing every year we probably
 
06:08:24.510 --> 06:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
run elections for new bargaining units
 
06:08:28.350 --> 06:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
at the rate of 5 to eight a year uh the
 
06:08:30.990 --> 06:08:31.000 align:start position:0%
other kinds of Elections we run our
 
06:08:32.830 --> 06:08:32.840 align:start position:0%
decertification elections which you've
 
06:08:36.150 --> 06:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
heard about and challenge uh
 
06:08:38.270 --> 06:08:38.280 align:start position:0%
elections uh so starting with a
 
06:08:40.468 --> 06:08:40.478 align:start position:0%
decertification election employees have
 
06:08:42.070 --> 06:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
the right under the
 
06:08:45.468 --> 06:08:45.478 align:start position:0%
statute to file a petition supported by
 
06:08:47.510 --> 06:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
what we call authorization cards signed
 
06:08:50.070 --> 06:08:50.080 align:start position:0%
by 30% of the employees in the
 
06:08:52.430 --> 06:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit saying they would like
 
06:08:54.070 --> 06:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
us to conduct the decertification
 
06:08:57.190 --> 06:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
election if necessary we have a hearing
 
06:08:59.750 --> 06:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
to resolve any objections and and there
 
06:09:01.670 --> 06:09:01.680 align:start position:0%
can be some legal objections and some
 
06:09:04.830 --> 06:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
factual objections so it's not a simple
 
06:09:06.948 --> 06:09:06.958 align:start position:0%
matter of filing paperwork and then
 
06:09:10.230 --> 06:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
ordering an election um if an election's
 
06:09:12.670 --> 06:09:12.680 align:start position:0%
in order we then start the election
 
06:09:15.030 --> 06:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
process the employer is involved
 
06:09:17.310 --> 06:09:17.320 align:start position:0%
throughout the union is involved
 
06:09:19.830 --> 06:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
throughout um we have a pre-election
 
06:09:21.390 --> 06:09:21.400 align:start position:0%
conference where we set a date and a
 
06:09:24.190 --> 06:09:24.200 align:start position:0%
time for the election many elections are
 
06:09:28.788 --> 06:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
done uh on the job site uh for uh
 
06:09:31.230 --> 06:09:31.240 align:start position:0%
employers who have employees at multiple
 
06:09:34.430 --> 06:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
work locations mail ballot elections are
 
06:09:36.230 --> 06:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
another option
 
06:09:38.350 --> 06:09:38.360 align:start position:0%
uh then we have a posting period of
 
06:09:40.310 --> 06:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
usually two to three weeks so that
 
06:09:43.110 --> 06:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
employees are informed and aware that an
 
06:09:45.670 --> 06:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
election is is pending they'll see
 
06:09:47.548 --> 06:09:47.558 align:start position:0%
information about the election that we
 
06:09:50.390 --> 06:09:50.400 align:start position:0%
provide including the ballot uh there
 
06:09:52.628 --> 06:09:52.638 align:start position:0%
are there are always at least two
 
06:09:55.110 --> 06:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
choices on the ballot if it's a dessert
 
06:09:57.948 --> 06:09:57.958 align:start position:0%
election uh the name of the incumbent
 
06:10:01.110 --> 06:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
Union uh as well as no representative
 
06:10:03.830 --> 06:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
and the no representative option is on
 
06:10:06.548 --> 06:10:06.558 align:start position:0%
the ballot of every uh election that we
 
06:10:08.830 --> 06:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
conduct and the outcome of the election
 
06:10:11.070 --> 06:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
is determined by the majority of the
 
06:10:13.830 --> 06:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
ballots cast not by the number of
 
06:10:15.548 --> 06:10:15.558 align:start position:0%
employees in the bargaining unit so if
 
06:10:17.510 --> 06:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
employees are interested in
 
06:10:20.350 --> 06:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
participating they show up to vote uh
 
06:10:22.270 --> 06:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
and then based on the number that vote
 
06:10:25.830 --> 06:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
we see how the the uh ballots play out
 
06:10:28.830 --> 06:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
and we declare the outcome um if there
 
06:10:31.150 --> 06:10:31.160 align:start position:0%
is a majority vote for decertification
 
06:10:34.110 --> 06:10:34.120 align:start position:0%
it means that for the next 12 months
 
06:10:36.468 --> 06:10:36.478 align:start position:0%
there cannot be a ition filed to try to
 
06:10:38.750 --> 06:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
reestablish that bargaining unit after
 
06:10:41.868 --> 06:10:41.878 align:start position:0%
12 months uh a petition can be filed and
 
06:10:44.468 --> 06:10:44.478 align:start position:0%
it would follow the same process that's
 
06:10:46.270 --> 06:10:46.280 align:start position:0%
followed for the formation of new
 
06:10:48.548 --> 06:10:48.558 align:start position:0%
bargaining units it would be simple
 
06:10:52.830 --> 06:10:52.840 align:start position:0%
majority vote of the U number of the uh
 
06:10:53.990 --> 06:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
the ballots
 
06:10:58.628 --> 06:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
cast uh the other election that occurs
 
06:11:01.548 --> 06:11:01.558 align:start position:0%
and I don't have exact numbers with me
 
06:11:04.430 --> 06:11:04.440 align:start position:0%
today but decertification elections are
 
06:11:06.548 --> 06:11:06.558 align:start position:0%
not a common occur
 
06:11:09.910 --> 06:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
um so the other election process that we
 
06:11:12.990 --> 06:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
hold is is known as a challenge election
 
06:11:15.350 --> 06:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
and that's an opportunity um and a
 
06:11:18.548 --> 06:11:18.558 align:start position:0%
mechanism that employees can use if they
 
06:11:21.110 --> 06:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
want to move from one Union to another
 
06:11:23.510 --> 06:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
Union um and it can be done in a couple
 
06:11:26.390 --> 06:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
of ways it can be done with respect to
 
06:11:29.030 --> 06:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
the existing bargaining unit and if we
 
06:11:30.590 --> 06:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
approve it the election will have three
 
06:11:32.510 --> 06:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
choices on the ballot the incumbent
 
06:11:35.670 --> 06:11:35.680 align:start position:0%
Union the proposed new Union and no rep
 
06:11:37.350 --> 06:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
representative uh the other way
 
06:11:40.070 --> 06:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
challenge uh elections happen is if a
 
06:11:41.750 --> 06:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
group of employees covered by an
 
06:11:44.230 --> 06:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
existing bargaining unit want to form
 
06:11:46.150 --> 06:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
their own independent bargaining unit
 
06:11:47.708 --> 06:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
and we've seen that a couple times this
 
06:11:49.628 --> 06:11:49.638 align:start position:0%
year with firefighters who have been in
 
06:11:52.510 --> 06:11:52.520 align:start position:0%
with other Town employees uh but they
 
06:11:54.230 --> 06:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
decide they want to be independent and
 
06:11:56.468 --> 06:11:56.478 align:start position:0%
they want to be associated with uh for
 
06:11:59.310 --> 06:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
example the iaff they will file
 
06:12:01.270 --> 06:12:01.280 align:start position:0%
paperwork to remove their their
 
06:12:03.150 --> 06:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
positions from the existing bargaining
 
06:12:05.708 --> 06:12:05.718 align:start position:0%
unit we may have hearings if it's
 
06:12:08.030 --> 06:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
approved they have a separate pending
 
06:12:09.868 --> 06:12:09.878 align:start position:0%
request to run an election and then we
 
06:12:12.590 --> 06:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
will run an election the incumbent Union
 
06:12:14.468 --> 06:12:14.478 align:start position:0%
will still be on the ballot there the
 
06:12:16.270 --> 06:12:16.280 align:start position:0%
proposed new Union and the no
 
06:12:18.350 --> 06:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
representative choice will be on the
 
06:12:20.830 --> 06:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
ballot uh the other thing that can
 
06:12:23.868 --> 06:12:23.878 align:start position:0%
happen uh with bargaining units uh is a
 
06:12:26.510 --> 06:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
surrender of a certification and that's
 
06:12:29.708 --> 06:12:29.718 align:start position:0%
done by the union and we see that happen
 
06:12:33.070 --> 06:12:33.080 align:start position:0%
when there is uh although we don't probe
 
06:12:35.350 --> 06:12:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh when there's a lack of interest uh by
 
06:12:36.708 --> 06:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
employees who are covered by the
 
06:12:39.190 --> 06:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit and join the joining the
 
06:12:41.948 --> 06:12:41.958 align:start position:0%
the union and paying dues if that
 
06:12:44.468 --> 06:12:44.478 align:start position:0%
happens it doesn't make a lot of sense
 
06:12:47.230 --> 06:12:47.240 align:start position:0%
for the union to continue to represent
 
06:12:47.240 --> 06:12:48.070 align:start position:0%
for the union to continue to represent
and

06:12:48.070 --> 06:12:48.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:12:50.990 --> 06:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
if you know we probably get a handful of
 
06:12:54.030 --> 06:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
these a year so there is a those those
 
06:12:55.948 --> 06:12:55.958 align:start position:0%
bargaining units sort of Wither on the
 
06:12:58.468 --> 06:12:58.478 align:start position:0%
vine uh so that's the high level
 
06:13:03.390 --> 06:13:03.400 align:start position:0%
overview of the election uh process um
 
06:13:06.670 --> 06:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
06:13:09.830 --> 06:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
the the current proposal um and the role
 
06:13:12.150 --> 06:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Labor um I think
 
06:13:13.990 --> 06:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's been recognized here that the
 
06:13:15.788 --> 06:13:15.798 align:start position:0%
Public Employee Labor Relations Board
 
06:13:18.270 --> 06:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
has exclusive jurisdiction over the
 
06:13:21.430 --> 06:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
administration of 273a which is where
 
06:13:23.910 --> 06:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
all bargaining units are the law that
 
06:13:25.590 --> 06:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
covers all the formation of all
 
06:13:27.750 --> 06:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
bargaining units and elections and the
 
06:13:29.430 --> 06:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor is not involved at
 
06:13:31.070 --> 06:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
all in that
 
06:13:31.080 --> 06:13:33.150 align:start position:0%
all in that
process

06:13:33.150 --> 06:13:33.160 align:start position:0%
process
 
06:13:36.670 --> 06:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
um the idea that it may be necessary to
 
06:13:38.830 --> 06:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
involve the Department of Labor to get
 
06:13:40.868 --> 06:13:40.878 align:start position:0%
employee lists for different points in
 
06:13:43.190 --> 06:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
time is not something that I had thought
 
06:13:47.590 --> 06:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
about um it's if this uh bill becomes
 
06:13:49.990 --> 06:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
law they could certainly serve as a
 
06:13:53.110 --> 06:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
resource uh I'm not sure that they would
 
06:13:56.750 --> 06:13:56.760 align:start position:0%
need legislatively to be uh in place
 
06:13:58.070 --> 06:13:58.080 align:start position:0%
because I think there could be some
 
06:14:00.990 --> 06:14:01.000 align:start position:0%
potential confusion in conflict between
 
06:14:04.270 --> 06:14:04.280 align:start position:0%
the plrb and the Department of Labor and
 
06:14:06.430 --> 06:14:06.440 align:start position:0%
my sense say a Department of Labor isn't
 
06:14:09.310 --> 06:14:09.320 align:start position:0%
looking for more work um the other thing
 
06:14:11.830 --> 06:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
I wanted to point out on employee lists
 
06:14:15.990 --> 06:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
is we don't keep a record of what
 
06:14:18.670 --> 06:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
employees show up to vote uh but we do
 
06:14:23.190 --> 06:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
have a a record of our list of eligible
 
06:14:25.030 --> 06:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
employees certainly going
 
06:14:28.390 --> 06:14:28.400 align:start position:0%
comprehensively going back 20 years and
 
06:14:30.628 --> 06:14:30.638 align:start position:0%
we have scanned in all of the old
 
06:14:33.310 --> 06:14:33.320 align:start position:0%
certification files and decertification
 
06:14:33.320 --> 06:14:35.190 align:start position:0%
certification files and decertification
files

06:14:35.190 --> 06:14:35.200 align:start position:0%
files
 
06:14:37.350 --> 06:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
which are mostly complete and a lot of
 
06:14:39.910 --> 06:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
those files actually have employee lists
 
06:14:42.270 --> 06:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
in them tick sheets that are at the
 
06:14:45.830 --> 06:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
polling place that we use when we uh
 
06:14:48.070 --> 06:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
conduct the election so that would be a
 
06:14:51.430 --> 06:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
starting point uh but I anticipate the
 
06:14:55.548 --> 06:14:55.558 align:start position:0%
major way to figure out if the are the
 
06:14:59.150 --> 06:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
trigger has been uh has occurred here
 
06:15:01.990 --> 06:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
would be Communications between uh the
 
06:15:06.190 --> 06:15:06.200 align:start position:0%
plrb and the employer in question uh
 
06:15:08.390 --> 06:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
asking them to research their records we
 
06:15:09.708 --> 06:15:09.718 align:start position:0%
would look at our
 
06:15:11.948 --> 06:15:11.958 align:start position:0%
records uh we would then make a
 
06:15:13.830 --> 06:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
determination we would probably send out
 
06:15:16.548 --> 06:15:16.558 align:start position:0%
a notice which would uh provide an
 
06:15:18.310 --> 06:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity for
 
06:15:20.110 --> 06:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
objections uh and then we'd go to
 
06:15:22.110 --> 06:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
hearing if necessary to resolve those
 
06:15:24.110 --> 06:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
objections and if the case got cleared
 
06:15:26.548 --> 06:15:26.558 align:start position:0%
for election uh then we would go through
 
06:15:26.558 --> 06:15:27.430 align:start position:0%
for election uh then we would go through
that

06:15:27.430 --> 06:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:15:32.430 --> 06:15:32.440 align:start position:0%
process um this bill does uh call for
 
06:15:35.150 --> 06:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
the election outcome to be determined
 
06:15:37.670 --> 06:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
differently than other elections that we
 
06:15:39.628 --> 06:15:39.638 align:start position:0%
run which I think would has the
 
06:15:42.510 --> 06:15:42.520 align:start position:0%
potential to create confusion um but
 
06:15:45.868 --> 06:15:45.878 align:start position:0%
instead of just determining based on the
 
06:15:48.948 --> 06:15:48.958 align:start position:0%
votes actually cast we would look at the
 
06:15:52.270 --> 06:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
entire list of eligible uh voters so if
 
06:15:54.830 --> 06:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
we had a unit with 100 eligible voters
 
06:15:57.628 --> 06:15:57.638 align:start position:0%
but only 20 showed up to vote then
 
06:16:00.830 --> 06:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
obviously uh that particular unit would
 
06:16:02.830 --> 06:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
would not meet this recertification
 
06:16:05.190 --> 06:16:05.200 align:start position:0%
requirement even if the 20 who showed up
 
06:16:08.110 --> 06:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
or unanimous to continue
 
06:16:10.310 --> 06:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
representation and then I I think on
 
06:16:10.320 --> 06:16:11.548 align:start position:0%
representation and then I I think on
rebound

06:16:11.548 --> 06:16:11.558 align:start position:0%
rebound
 
06:16:14.788 --> 06:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
elections um I think the wording is a
 
06:16:17.430 --> 06:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
little unclear but I think the intent is
 
06:16:18.990 --> 06:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
to have the same Arrangement that we
 
06:16:21.070 --> 06:16:21.080 align:start position:0%
currently have with dessert that there's
 
06:16:24.190 --> 06:16:24.200 align:start position:0%
a 12-month uh period when uh no attempt
 
06:16:26.830 --> 06:16:26.840 align:start position:0%
to form the bargaining unit and have an
 
06:16:31.110 --> 06:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
election uh can be uh held but after
 
06:16:33.948 --> 06:16:33.958 align:start position:0%
that the any vote that's held would be
 
06:16:36.390 --> 06:16:36.400 align:start position:0%
for a unit that was didn't meet the
 
06:16:38.948 --> 06:16:38.958 align:start position:0%
recertification requirement uh they
 
06:16:42.190 --> 06:16:42.200 align:start position:0%
would be subject to that majority of the
 
06:16:45.510 --> 06:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
entire list as opposed to uh the process
 
06:16:48.868 --> 06:16:48.878 align:start position:0%
we find we follow for a regular dessert
 
06:16:50.230 --> 06:16:50.240 align:start position:0%
which would be the majority of the
 
06:16:52.468 --> 06:16:52.478 align:start position:0%
employees who actually show up to
 
06:16:56.150 --> 06:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
vote um so something to be said for
 
06:16:58.230 --> 06:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
maybe having consistency between the
 
06:17:00.868 --> 06:17:00.878 align:start position:0%
election procedures that we use now uh
 
06:17:03.708 --> 06:17:03.718 align:start position:0%
and any procedures that are in this
 
06:17:06.350 --> 06:17:06.360 align:start position:0%
statute um
 
06:17:08.788 --> 06:17:08.798 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to go into the the
 
06:17:10.990 --> 06:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
details of how we conduct the elections
 
06:17:13.990 --> 06:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
and how much time is involved I did my
 
06:17:17.990 --> 06:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
best uh in our fiscal note to uh
 
06:17:20.948 --> 06:17:20.958 align:start position:0%
determine a a financial impact I think
 
06:17:24.430 --> 06:17:24.440 align:start position:0%
for us uh it would mean some additional
 
06:17:28.548 --> 06:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
funding uh to reestablish a position to
 
06:17:30.590 --> 06:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
have somebody sort of working
 
06:17:32.390 --> 06:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
administratively almost full-time on
 
06:17:34.990 --> 06:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
this to keep the ball rolling uh and and
 
06:17:38.110 --> 06:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
then on the employer side um depending
 
06:17:40.788 --> 06:17:40.798 align:start position:0%
on how complicated a particular case is
 
06:17:43.468 --> 06:17:43.478 align:start position:0%
depending on how much the employers use
 
06:17:43.478 --> 06:17:44.670 align:start position:0%
depending on how much the employers use
outside

06:17:44.670 --> 06:17:44.680 align:start position:0%
outside
 
06:17:48.910 --> 06:17:48.920 align:start position:0%
Council uh they could encounter expenses
 
06:17:51.310 --> 06:17:51.320 align:start position:0%
in my estimate that the option I had was
 
06:17:55.150 --> 06:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
0 to 10,000 or 10,000 to 100,000 given
 
06:17:57.548 --> 06:17:57.558 align:start position:0%
the rates that I think the private
 
06:17:59.990 --> 06:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
attorneys charge who come to my office I
 
06:18:02.750 --> 06:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
think it wouldn't take much before
 
06:18:05.190 --> 06:18:05.200 align:start position:0%
there's a $10,000 legal bill in a
 
06:18:07.468 --> 06:18:07.478 align:start position:0%
particular year especially if there are
 
06:18:09.190 --> 06:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
multiple uh
 
06:18:12.310 --> 06:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
recertification elections uh being
 
06:18:15.150 --> 06:18:15.160 align:start position:0%
addressed so I'm sure I'm forgetting uh
 
06:18:16.468 --> 06:18:16.478 align:start position:0%
some things I think you got a good
 
06:18:19.350 --> 06:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
overview of the situation from the other
 
06:18:21.548 --> 06:18:21.558 align:start position:0%
speakers today but what why don't I stop
 
06:18:23.628 --> 06:18:23.638 align:start position:0%
there I'll answer any questions and you
 
06:18:25.628 --> 06:18:25.638 align:start position:0%
can always email me and I'll Supply any
 
06:18:27.868 --> 06:18:27.878 align:start position:0%
additional information if
 
06:18:30.628 --> 06:18:30.638 align:start position:0%
necessary I appreciate good testimony uh
 
06:18:33.070 --> 06:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
representa lry thank you Mr chair this
 
06:18:35.750 --> 06:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
will be quick um could you get us the
 
06:18:37.468 --> 06:18:37.478 align:start position:0%
information for resert desert and
 
06:18:39.310 --> 06:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
surrender for like the last two years is
 
06:18:40.590 --> 06:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
that possible to submit that to the
 
06:18:42.430 --> 06:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
committee yep okay thank you great
 
06:18:43.910 --> 06:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative
 
06:18:46.310 --> 06:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
Schultz thank you Mr chair I have a dumb
 
06:18:47.868 --> 06:18:47.878 align:start position:0%
question and I should know the answer to
 
06:18:50.788 --> 06:18:50.798 align:start position:0%
this but who hires you who
 
06:18:54.990 --> 06:18:55.000 align:start position:0%
chooses um who does this work I'll
 
06:18:56.670 --> 06:18:56.680 align:start position:0%
answer that in a second but you asked
 
06:18:58.788 --> 06:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
for resert desert and surrender So
 
06:19:02.070 --> 06:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
currently there is no research procedure
 
06:19:03.990 --> 06:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
right so there's new bargaining units
 
06:19:06.708 --> 06:19:06.718 align:start position:0%
why don't I just do new bargaining units
 
06:19:09.030 --> 06:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
any deserts and surrenders last two
 
06:19:14.708 --> 06:19:14.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:16.510 --> 06:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
clarification so I'm going to answer the
 
06:19:18.430 --> 06:19:18.440 align:start position:0%
next question so the the answer is I'm
 
06:19:19.510 --> 06:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
hired by the
 
06:19:23.670 --> 06:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
board yep okay and represent
 
06:19:27.030 --> 06:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
McKenzie thank you Mr Mr
 
06:19:29.270 --> 06:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
chairman so you've been doing this for
 
06:19:30.510 --> 06:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
for a
 
06:19:33.430 --> 06:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
while my question to you
 
06:19:36.910 --> 06:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:38.868 --> 06:19:38.878 align:start position:0%
the process rolls along collective
 
06:19:41.750 --> 06:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
bargaining rolls along we have an
 
06:19:43.190 --> 06:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
obligation of the
 
06:19:46.750 --> 06:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
law to provide uh once we're certified
 
06:19:48.868 --> 06:19:48.878 align:start position:0%
to have the opportunity to
 
06:19:50.830 --> 06:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
negotiate given
 
06:19:54.548 --> 06:19:54.558 align:start position:0%
that what kind of impact would during
 
06:19:56.030 --> 06:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
the middle of
 
06:19:57.948 --> 06:19:57.958 align:start position:0%
negotiations all of a sudden this
 
06:20:01.150 --> 06:20:01.160 align:start position:0%
triggers this this thing how how is the
 
06:20:03.910 --> 06:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
the right to bargain collectively
 
06:20:06.350 --> 06:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
balanced against against this particular
 
06:20:09.590 --> 06:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh law which would be on the on at on
 
06:20:12.868 --> 06:20:12.878 align:start position:0%
the best day disruptive as anything to
 
06:20:15.510 --> 06:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
to the process yeah I mean clearly at a
 
06:20:18.110 --> 06:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
minimum it would create uncertainty so
 
06:20:19.670 --> 06:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
for example in the case of a school
 
06:20:23.628 --> 06:20:23.638 align:start position:0%
district usually bargaining starts uh in
 
06:20:26.230 --> 06:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
September uh in a perfect world
 
06:20:27.788 --> 06:20:27.798 align:start position:0%
sometimes it doesn't really get rolling
 
06:20:30.868 --> 06:20:30.878 align:start position:0%
until October November the objective for
 
06:20:33.628 --> 06:20:33.638 align:start position:0%
all bargaining is to get a contract
 
06:20:36.190 --> 06:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
negotiated in advance of the budget
 
06:20:38.390 --> 06:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
submission date so all the necessary
 
06:20:40.390 --> 06:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
paperwork can be completed so in the
 
06:20:41.350 --> 06:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
case of a
 
06:20:43.910 --> 06:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
municipality if there are new cost items
 
06:20:46.070 --> 06:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
in a contract that gets in front of the
 
06:20:48.468 --> 06:20:48.478 align:start position:0%
voters at the state level obviously
 
06:20:51.070 --> 06:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
February 15th is the budget submission
 
06:20:54.708 --> 06:20:54.718 align:start position:0%
date uh so there's already pressure and
 
06:20:56.910 --> 06:20:56.920 align:start position:0%
there's been hearings in the past that
 
06:20:59.910 --> 06:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
have talked about that
 
06:21:04.150 --> 06:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
um we if an issue came up our if we had
 
06:21:07.270 --> 06:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
a complaint about it and we also conduct
 
06:21:08.948 --> 06:21:08.958 align:start position:0%
contested hearings on unfair Labor
 
06:21:12.430 --> 06:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
practice complaints among other things I
 
06:21:16.430 --> 06:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
anticipate our Direction and instruction
 
06:21:18.948 --> 06:21:18.958 align:start position:0%
to the involved parties would
 
06:21:22.628 --> 06:21:22.638 align:start position:0%
be uh you know until this bargaining the
 
06:21:24.868 --> 06:21:24.878 align:start position:0%
status of this bargaining unit changes
 
06:21:26.590 --> 06:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
you have to negotiate just like you've
 
06:21:26.600 --> 06:21:27.590 align:start position:0%
you have to negotiate just like you've
always

06:21:27.590 --> 06:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
always
 
06:21:31.708 --> 06:21:31.718 align:start position:0%
negotiated um but on a day-to-day basis
 
06:21:33.948 --> 06:21:33.958 align:start position:0%
whether that would be true I I I don't
 
06:21:36.628 --> 06:21:36.638 align:start position:0%
know we are not out there in the field
 
06:21:39.670 --> 06:21:39.680 align:start position:0%
at the bargaining table we only tend to
 
06:21:42.230 --> 06:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
hear about things when things go wrong
 
06:21:45.468 --> 06:21:45.478 align:start position:0%
or we get calls uh from unions and
 
06:21:48.310 --> 06:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
employers asking for guidance uh because
 
06:21:50.750 --> 06:21:50.760 align:start position:0%
maybe they're in tough negotiations and
 
06:21:52.670 --> 06:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
our basic advice is look here's the
 
06:21:54.270 --> 06:21:54.280 align:start position:0%
framework and you have to kind of work
 
06:21:57.548 --> 06:21:57.558 align:start position:0%
your way through it and most of them
 
06:22:01.190 --> 06:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
do followup for followup sir thank you
 
06:22:04.350 --> 06:22:04.360 align:start position:0%
uh can you uh respond to uh what would
 
06:22:07.070 --> 06:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
Happ happened uh under the failure to
 
06:22:10.430 --> 06:22:10.440 align:start position:0%
represent if there was a a person a
 
06:22:13.510 --> 06:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
member that came forward and said we I
 
06:22:15.548 --> 06:22:15.558 align:start position:0%
was discriminated against or I wasn't
 
06:22:18.310 --> 06:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
properly represented what is a
 
06:22:21.230 --> 06:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
consequence the ultimate consequence for
 
06:22:23.230 --> 06:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
that kind of behavior by a local union
 
06:22:26.150 --> 06:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
so there is a unfair Labor practice
 
06:22:28.910 --> 06:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
known as a a violation of Duty of fair
 
06:22:31.070 --> 06:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
representation and we've had a few of
 
06:22:33.390 --> 06:22:33.400 align:start position:0%
those over the last 10 years probably
 
06:22:35.270 --> 06:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
less than five
 
06:22:38.110 --> 06:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
uh and it's usually the result of an
 
06:22:40.390 --> 06:22:40.400 align:start position:0%
employee who's unhappy with how the
 
06:22:42.990 --> 06:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
union handled a grievance and the fact
 
06:22:45.468 --> 06:22:45.478 align:start position:0%
that a union had decided not to advance
 
06:22:48.350 --> 06:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
a grievance to binding arbitration which
 
06:22:51.468 --> 06:22:51.478 align:start position:0%
is an expense both to the union and to
 
06:22:53.868 --> 06:22:53.878 align:start position:0%
the employer uh and there's a legal
 
06:22:57.190 --> 06:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
standard we use to evaluate uh those
 
06:23:00.990 --> 06:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
cases uh I think in all of those cases
 
06:23:03.150 --> 06:23:03.160 align:start position:0%
the the board's determination was that
 
06:23:05.270 --> 06:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
the duty had not been viol ated but if
 
06:23:06.788 --> 06:23:06.798 align:start position:0%
the duty is
 
06:23:09.868 --> 06:23:09.878 align:start position:0%
violated uh we publish written decisions
 
06:23:11.788 --> 06:23:11.798 align:start position:0%
all of the decisions and orders that the
 
06:23:14.510 --> 06:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
board has issued back to 1976 are on our
 
06:23:17.030 --> 06:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
website uh we also require certain
 
06:23:19.110 --> 06:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
decisions to be posted in the workplace
 
06:23:22.150 --> 06:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
to make sure uh the employees are aware
 
06:23:23.830 --> 06:23:23.840 align:start position:0%
of the board's
 
06:23:26.590 --> 06:23:26.600 align:start position:0%
determination um and depending on on how
 
06:23:29.310 --> 06:23:29.320 align:start position:0%
egregious the conduct is we might keep
 
06:23:32.270 --> 06:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
that case open so that we can monitor uh
 
06:23:34.670 --> 06:23:34.680 align:start position:0%
the behavior of the the union to to make
 
06:23:37.310 --> 06:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
sure that appropriate Corrections have
 
06:23:37.320 --> 06:23:41.110 align:start position:0%
sure that appropriate Corrections have
been

06:23:41.110 --> 06:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:44.788 --> 06:23:44.798 align:start position:0%
made repres representative AV Ling thank
 
06:23:46.430 --> 06:23:46.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um we've heard a lot of
 
06:23:48.390 --> 06:23:48.400 align:start position:0%
talk about um bargaining and everything
 
06:23:51.110 --> 06:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
else um it only triggers between line
 
06:23:53.708 --> 06:23:53.718 align:start position:0%
two and four can you explain to us what
 
06:24:05.430 --> 06:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:07.350 --> 06:24:07.360 align:start position:0%
so you're looking at the proposed Bill
 
06:24:10.390 --> 06:24:10.400 align:start position:0%
correct yes yes sir page one
 
06:24:16.230 --> 06:24:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:20.350 --> 06:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
yes well if if the board
 
06:24:26.070 --> 06:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:29.910 --> 06:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
met then long story short we would start
 
06:24:31.830 --> 06:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
the process to conduct an
 
06:24:35.150 --> 06:24:35.160 align:start position:0%
election if if that's the question
 
06:24:39.030 --> 06:24:39.040 align:start position:0%
asking but to to make that determination
 
06:24:41.708 --> 06:24:41.718 align:start position:0%
there a lot of work would be necessary
 
06:24:43.708 --> 06:24:43.718 align:start position:0%
to determine that the particular
 
06:24:45.468 --> 06:24:45.478 align:start position:0%
bargaining unit is subject to the
 
06:24:48.750 --> 06:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
recertification election process and we
 
06:24:50.990 --> 06:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
don't currently have data in place that
 
06:24:53.628 --> 06:24:53.638 align:start position:0%
would allow us easily to do that I
 
06:24:56.110 --> 06:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
anticipate that we would have rulem so
 
06:24:58.830 --> 06:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
that everybody would understand how that
 
06:25:00.788 --> 06:25:00.798 align:start position:0%
process would
 
06:25:03.830 --> 06:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
unfold and you know if we were to do
 
06:25:08.230 --> 06:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
this I'm sure down the road it
 
06:25:11.708 --> 06:25:11.718 align:start position:0%
would the unions may not like it and
 
06:25:13.670 --> 06:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
public employers may not like it but we
 
06:25:15.750 --> 06:25:15.760 align:start position:0%
would have a system in place that we
 
06:25:17.750 --> 06:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
would consistently use which is what we
 
06:25:20.270 --> 06:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
try to do in everything we want to be
 
06:25:23.350 --> 06:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
consistent and predictable but we're not
 
06:25:27.190 --> 06:25:27.200 align:start position:0%
there yet I'm I anticipate nine months
 
06:25:29.150 --> 06:25:29.160 align:start position:0%
if this bill becomes law starting July
 
06:25:31.990 --> 06:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
1st I anticipate probably nine months of
 
06:25:33.430 --> 06:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
coming up with a system and going
 
06:25:35.468 --> 06:25:35.478 align:start position:0%
through rul Mak
 
06:25:37.430 --> 06:25:37.440 align:start position:0%
um to get something up and running I
 
06:25:39.708 --> 06:25:39.718 align:start position:0%
don't think we can just start the
 
06:25:43.788 --> 06:25:43.798 align:start position:0%
process with just this bill language in
 
06:25:46.590 --> 06:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
place for
 
06:25:48.868 --> 06:25:48.878 align:start position:0%
followup notwithstanding the department
 
06:25:50.868 --> 06:25:50.878 align:start position:0%
of uh labor notation would Department of
 
06:25:53.548 --> 06:25:53.558 align:start position:0%
Employment Securities be a more adequate
 
06:25:55.788 --> 06:25:55.798 align:start position:0%
place to find employment information for
 
06:25:59.030 --> 06:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:02.230 --> 06:26:02.240 align:start position:0%
state not in my area but I assume that
 
06:26:04.750 --> 06:26:04.760 align:start position:0%
one of those departments for various
 
06:26:07.628 --> 06:26:07.638 align:start position:0%
reasons may have inventories of
 
06:26:09.708 --> 06:26:09.718 align:start position:0%
employees at particular locations at
 
06:26:11.150 --> 06:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
different points in time but I don't
 
06:26:13.310 --> 06:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
know that for a fact thank you thank you
 
06:26:14.910 --> 06:26:14.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman good
 
06:26:17.628 --> 06:26:17.638 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
06:26:20.230 --> 06:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
Sullivan would I be correct in thinking
 
06:26:24.548 --> 06:26:24.558 align:start position:0%
that almost all public sector unions um
 
06:26:26.548 --> 06:26:26.558 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire would be sub subject to
 
06:26:29.110 --> 06:26:29.120 align:start position:0%
this recertification at least you know
 
06:26:30.788 --> 06:26:30.798 align:start position:0%
in in the short
 
06:26:33.230 --> 06:26:33.240 align:start position:0%
term sooner or
 
06:26:36.510 --> 06:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
later followup a
 
06:26:39.390 --> 06:26:39.400 align:start position:0%
followup but wouldn't most of these U
 
06:26:43.070 --> 06:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
public sector unions be old enough that
 
06:26:45.590 --> 06:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of their employees
 
06:26:48.788 --> 06:26:48.798 align:start position:0%
were not around during the original
 
06:26:50.788 --> 06:26:50.798 align:start position:0%
certification I think I may have
 
06:26:52.750 --> 06:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
estimated in the fiscal note that there
 
06:26:56.110 --> 06:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
could be as many as 400 bargaining units
 
06:27:00.590 --> 06:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
as of today that may be immediately
 
06:27:02.948 --> 06:27:02.958 align:start position:0%
subject to the reer recertification
 
06:27:06.070 --> 06:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
election requirement but I haven't uh
 
06:27:08.390 --> 06:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
gone through our certifications and
 
06:27:10.310 --> 06:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
looked at the
 
06:27:13.230 --> 06:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
date probably a certification that's at
 
06:27:16.590 --> 06:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
least 20 years old would fit into the
 
06:27:18.270 --> 06:27:18.280 align:start position:0%
category you're talking about but there
 
06:27:20.430 --> 06:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
have been a lot of new bargaining units
 
06:27:24.230 --> 06:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
established over the last 20 years thank
 
06:27:27.030 --> 06:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
you okay seeing no further questions
 
06:27:28.350 --> 06:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
thank you sir for your testimony I
 
06:27:29.350 --> 06:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate your
 
06:27:32.270 --> 06:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
time and we've got about 34 minutes
 
06:27:35.070 --> 06:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
before we turn into pumpkin so you could
 
06:27:38.310 --> 06:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
manage your questions and testimony as
 
06:27:41.468 --> 06:27:41.478 align:start position:0%
such I appreciate that
 
06:27:51.990 --> 06:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:54.310 --> 06:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
please Mr chairman member of this
 
06:27:56.270 --> 06:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Scott Gober I
 
06:27:57.468 --> 06:27:57.478 align:start position:0%
represent the teamsters here in New
 
06:27:59.110 --> 06:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we to oppose this piece of
 
06:28:01.030 --> 06:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
legislation I will be
 
06:28:04.468 --> 06:28:04.478 align:start position:0%
quick it's anti-worker
 
06:28:06.390 --> 06:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
right from the
 
06:28:08.948 --> 06:28:08.958 align:start position:0%
rip no one in this room is fooled by it
 
06:28:10.310 --> 06:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
I don't
 
06:28:10.320 --> 06:28:13.190 align:start position:0%
I don't
believe

06:28:13.190 --> 06:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
believe
 
06:28:15.270 --> 06:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
two I just went through an election in
 
06:28:17.270 --> 06:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
my local
 
06:28:19.750 --> 06:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
union so we have some accountability at
 
06:28:22.390 --> 06:28:22.400 align:start position:0%
the local level already we are already
 
06:28:24.708 --> 06:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
policing ourselves along with a lot of
 
06:28:26.628 --> 06:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
outside agencies that look at us
 
06:28:29.230 --> 06:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
regularly so theart of
 
06:28:32.910 --> 06:28:32.920 align:start position:0%
accountability uh Falls to my membership
 
06:28:34.708 --> 06:28:34.718 align:start position:0%
and my membership holds me accountable
 
06:28:37.270 --> 06:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
as a recording Secretary of the
 
06:28:40.868 --> 06:28:40.878 align:start position:0%
local I am also a working member for UPS
 
06:28:42.868 --> 06:28:42.878 align:start position:0%
I've been there for 37 years I've
 
06:28:44.430 --> 06:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
probably been to your home on multiple
 
06:28:46.110 --> 06:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
occasions delivering multiple packages
 
06:28:46.120 --> 06:28:47.510 align:start position:0%
occasions delivering multiple packages
to

06:28:47.510 --> 06:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:28:50.310 --> 06:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
you and those people that we represent
 
06:28:53.590 --> 06:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
our ups members as well as well as
 
06:28:55.868 --> 06:28:55.878 align:start position:0%
anheiser Bush as well as the department
 
06:28:58.230 --> 06:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
of corrections as well as multiple
 
06:29:01.390 --> 06:29:01.400 align:start position:0%
police agencies within the
 
06:29:04.788 --> 06:29:04.798 align:start position:0%
state this piece of legisl
 
06:29:06.628 --> 06:29:06.638 align:start position:0%
as outlined by the Department of Labor
 
06:29:07.868 --> 06:29:07.878 align:start position:0%
and I really wanted to get up here and
 
06:29:09.628 --> 06:29:09.638 align:start position:0%
speak to that but that was done by them
 
06:29:12.190 --> 06:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
very well covered I believe has been
 
06:29:14.868 --> 06:29:14.878 align:start position:0%
brought up many times that there isn't a
 
06:29:17.430 --> 06:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
problem with the current resolution if
 
06:29:21.548 --> 06:29:21.558 align:start position:0%
someone has a problem with their Union
 
06:29:23.910 --> 06:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire there's a
 
06:29:28.190 --> 06:29:28.200 align:start position:0%
process in place that process works and
 
06:29:30.708 --> 06:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
that process has probably been used
 
06:29:32.788 --> 06:29:32.798 align:start position:0%
within the past
 
06:29:36.590 --> 06:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
month to two uh in our organization
 
06:29:40.830 --> 06:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
already so it does work the members are
 
06:29:43.110 --> 06:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
heard the people that you're concerned
 
06:29:47.510 --> 06:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
about are heard as was already outlined
 
06:29:50.230 --> 06:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
by the department and how to use that
 
06:29:52.230 --> 06:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
process and I guess that's why I wanted
 
06:29:53.910 --> 06:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
to come up and let you know that it is
 
06:29:57.310 --> 06:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
working and it and it continues to work
 
06:30:00.190 --> 06:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
and so we urge you to vote and expedient
 
06:30:01.990 --> 06:30:02.000 align:start position:0%
to legislate thank you for your time
 
06:30:03.030 --> 06:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your testimony I
 
06:30:04.910 --> 06:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate you waiting around
 
06:30:04.920 --> 06:30:06.590 align:start position:0%
appreciate you waiting around
any

06:30:06.590 --> 06:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:30:10.350 --> 06:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you sir appreciate
 
06:30:14.070 --> 06:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
it and John Kemp
 
06:30:21.390 --> 06:30:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:24.628 --> 06:30:24.638 align:start position:0%
yes good afternoon Mr chairman um by way
 
06:30:27.150 --> 06:30:27.160 align:start position:0%
of introduction my name is John krupsky
 
06:30:28.708 --> 06:30:28.718 align:start position:0%
I'm an attorney here in conquered I've
 
06:30:31.590 --> 06:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
been practicing law since 1995 almost
 
06:30:34.030 --> 06:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
exclusively for labor and employment and
 
06:30:35.468 --> 06:30:35.478 align:start position:0%
have been practicing in front of the
 
06:30:37.388 --> 06:30:37.398 align:start position:0%
plrb uh since
 
06:30:39.750 --> 06:30:39.760 align:start position:0%
1995 I have the distinct honor and
 
06:30:42.190 --> 06:30:42.200 align:start position:0%
privilege of testifying on behalf of the
 
06:30:43.990 --> 06:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Troopers Association and
 
06:30:45.510 --> 06:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Troopers Association
 
06:30:51.030 --> 06:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
Command Staff and we stand opposed uh to
 
06:30:52.150 --> 06:30:52.160 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
06:30:56.150 --> 06:30:56.160 align:start position:0%
735 because it is in essence as said by
 
06:30:58.510 --> 06:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
other people who have testified a
 
06:31:01.670 --> 06:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
solution looking for a problem since
 
06:31:04.670 --> 06:31:04.680 align:start position:0%
1976 almost 50 years
 
06:31:08.750 --> 06:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
um the plrb has had a mechanism which
 
06:31:11.350 --> 06:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
allows for certification desertification
 
06:31:13.430 --> 06:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
and changing of certification and has
 
06:31:17.468 --> 06:31:17.478 align:start position:0%
worked well over those 50
 
06:31:19.750 --> 06:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
years if you wish to follow a petition
 
06:31:21.948 --> 06:31:21.958 align:start position:0%
for certification any individual can do
 
06:31:25.670 --> 06:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
that getting 30% of other people and why
 
06:31:28.430 --> 06:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
do we do that think about it instead of
 
06:31:30.670 --> 06:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
having elections just to have elections
 
06:31:34.150 --> 06:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
to bring in bureaucracy expend money
 
06:31:36.868 --> 06:31:36.878 align:start position:0%
expend time just to do it doesn't make
 
06:31:39.510 --> 06:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
sense but if you have to have a majority
 
06:31:41.468 --> 06:31:41.478 align:start position:0%
and you have 30% who say I'd at least
 
06:31:43.750 --> 06:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
like to get a hearing then you get a
 
06:31:47.388 --> 06:31:47.398 align:start position:0%
hearing and it makes sense it's not just
 
06:31:50.430 --> 06:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
do it to do it but rather when there's a
 
06:31:51.510 --> 06:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
showing of
 
06:31:54.030 --> 06:31:54.040 align:start position:0%
Interest second part and and I think
 
06:31:57.230 --> 06:31:57.240 align:start position:0%
that needs to be um brought up is that
 
06:31:59.230 --> 06:31:59.240 align:start position:0%
individual union members as well as
 
06:32:01.628 --> 06:32:01.638 align:start position:0%
collectively have a way to either
 
06:32:04.150 --> 06:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
decertify or address if they think their
 
06:32:06.468 --> 06:32:06.478 align:start position:0%
Union isn't doing something correctly
 
06:32:10.750 --> 06:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
for example and I I'd like to um uh Leap
 
06:32:14.868 --> 06:32:14.878 align:start position:0%
Frog over uh executive director angol um
 
06:32:16.190 --> 06:32:16.200 align:start position:0%
I just want to let you know that if you
 
06:32:19.990 --> 06:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
discriminate as a union if um you
 
06:32:21.708 --> 06:32:21.718 align:start position:0%
violate the duty of fair representation
 
06:32:23.510 --> 06:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
in an egregious manner you will be
 
06:32:27.150 --> 06:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
desertified that desertification will go
 
06:32:30.750 --> 06:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
away okay the other thing is that if an
 
06:32:32.628 --> 06:32:32.638 align:start position:0%
individual on an individual basis does
 
06:32:34.468 --> 06:32:34.478 align:start position:0%
not want to support a union
 
06:32:36.230 --> 06:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
they have a right and it's actually been
 
06:32:37.548 --> 06:32:37.558 align:start position:0%
in our law since
 
06:32:40.150 --> 06:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
1976 that you cannot discriminate
 
06:32:41.190 --> 06:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
against somebody for membership or
 
06:32:42.868 --> 06:32:42.878 align:start position:0%
non-membership you're in the union and
 
06:32:44.030 --> 06:32:44.040 align:start position:0%
in fact in
 
06:32:47.190 --> 06:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
2018 the United States Supreme Court in
 
06:32:50.070 --> 06:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
in the case of Janice said directly that
 
06:32:52.548 --> 06:32:52.558 align:start position:0%
you can't even require contributions as
 
06:32:55.230 --> 06:32:55.240 align:start position:0%
a fair share so individuals don't have
 
06:33:00.230 --> 06:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
to contribute economically or be a
 
06:33:03.150 --> 06:33:03.160 align:start position:0%
member as I said um this is a completely
 
06:33:06.150 --> 06:33:06.160 align:start position:0%
unworkable bill um it's unworkable on a
 
06:33:07.628 --> 06:33:07.638 align:start position:0%
lot of levels that I think has already
 
06:33:10.110 --> 06:33:10.120 align:start position:0%
been addressed um and I'm happy to talk
 
06:33:12.830 --> 06:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
offline to people on why it's further
 
06:33:16.030 --> 06:33:16.040 align:start position:0%
unworkable but the one of the biggest
 
06:33:17.990 --> 06:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
issues that two bit two last points I'd
 
06:33:19.830 --> 06:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
like to make is one of the biggest
 
06:33:22.150 --> 06:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
issues is it conflates the jurisdiction
 
06:33:24.868 --> 06:33:24.878 align:start position:0%
of the do Department of Labor with the
 
06:33:27.230 --> 06:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
Public Employee Labor Relations Board
 
06:33:28.750 --> 06:33:28.760 align:start position:0%
the Public Employee Labor Relations
 
06:33:30.948 --> 06:33:30.958 align:start position:0%
Board has exclusive
 
06:33:34.110 --> 06:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over certifications and D
 
06:33:36.468 --> 06:33:36.478 align:start position:0%
certifications exclusive jurisdiction
 
06:33:38.708 --> 06:33:38.718 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor has no expertise
 
06:33:40.548 --> 06:33:40.558 align:start position:0%
nor quite frankly knows what happens
 
06:33:41.468 --> 06:33:41.478 align:start position:0%
over at the
 
06:33:43.788 --> 06:33:43.798 align:start position:0%
plrb you've heard the director say they
 
06:33:45.990 --> 06:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
don't have the data to do this why don't
 
06:33:47.310 --> 06:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
they have the data because when you use
 
06:33:49.868 --> 06:33:49.878 align:start position:0%
words like a majority of the people what
 
06:33:52.868 --> 06:33:52.878 align:start position:0%
does that mean for example there are
 
06:33:54.548 --> 06:33:54.558 align:start position:0%
sometimes elections where somebody will
 
06:33:56.830 --> 06:33:56.840 align:start position:0%
be certified uh and I'll use the
 
06:33:58.910 --> 06:33:58.920 align:start position:0%
Troopers as an example the troopers were
 
06:34:01.590 --> 06:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
certified um I believe uh in the latter
 
06:34:04.270 --> 06:34:04.280 align:start position:0%
' 70s early 60s and became an
 
06:34:07.430 --> 06:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
independent Union in 1990 thereafter
 
06:34:09.708 --> 06:34:09.718 align:start position:0%
they became another Union and broke off
 
06:34:12.230 --> 06:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
and be became Command Staff and this so
 
06:34:14.750 --> 06:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
which was the majority was it back in
 
06:34:18.190 --> 06:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
1970 was it back in 1990 was it most
 
06:34:19.388 --> 06:34:19.398 align:start position:0%
recently in the
 
06:34:23.350 --> 06:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
2000s that's not addressed here okay the
 
06:34:25.510 --> 06:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
other thing that um I'd like to address
 
06:34:27.510 --> 06:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
and I think is important is we are
 
06:34:29.270 --> 06:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
looking at and I've seen throughout uh
 
06:34:31.708 --> 06:34:31.718 align:start position:0%
the state I represent locals throughout
 
06:34:34.150 --> 06:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire I do negotiate and I
 
06:34:36.510 --> 06:34:36.520 align:start position:0%
will tell you that this will stagnate
 
06:34:38.388 --> 06:34:38.398 align:start position:0%
negotiations because if I don't know who
 
06:34:40.468 --> 06:34:40.478 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be negotiating with I'm not
 
06:34:42.548 --> 06:34:42.558 align:start position:0%
going to negotiate in Earnest because it
 
06:34:44.388 --> 06:34:44.398 align:start position:0%
may be a new thing and you'll often see
 
06:34:45.788 --> 06:34:45.798 align:start position:0%
that and I'll hear this from towns and
 
06:34:48.110 --> 06:34:48.120 align:start position:0%
cities where they'll say hey can we hold
 
06:34:49.868 --> 06:34:49.878 align:start position:0%
off on negotiations because we're having
 
06:34:52.590 --> 06:34:52.600 align:start position:0%
a new board uh a new board being sworn
 
06:34:55.190 --> 06:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
in here in the state they've said to us
 
06:34:56.948 --> 06:34:56.958 align:start position:0%
in regards to State negotiations hey
 
06:35:00.510 --> 06:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
let's wait to see um what governor aot
 
06:35:02.708 --> 06:35:02.718 align:start position:0%
appoints to her written so it does
 
06:35:04.868 --> 06:35:04.878 align:start position:0%
negatively impact and if that changes on
 
06:35:08.030 --> 06:35:08.040 align:start position:0%
a regular basis then that will inhibit
 
06:35:10.868 --> 06:35:10.878 align:start position:0%
the ability to reach Collective bargain
 
06:35:12.990 --> 06:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
and and lastly which I think um needs to
 
06:35:14.868 --> 06:35:14.878 align:start position:0%
be addressed um by this board and this
 
06:35:18.948 --> 06:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
is uh right now and and uh executive
 
06:35:21.030 --> 06:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
director Inus will hit on it and it's
 
06:35:21.040 --> 06:35:23.230 align:start position:0%
director Inus will hit on it and it's
extremely

06:35:23.230 --> 06:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
06:35:25.990 --> 06:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
important the way that the that 735
 
06:35:29.230 --> 06:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
reads you have to have a majority of the
 
06:35:32.350 --> 06:35:32.360 align:start position:0%
whole bargaining unit okay so if there's
 
06:35:35.270 --> 06:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
200 people you you have to have 101
 
06:35:38.708 --> 06:35:38.718 align:start position:0%
people vote to
 
06:35:41.750 --> 06:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
recertify I'm asking you to look at your
 
06:35:43.670 --> 06:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
experience look at the presidential
 
06:35:46.350 --> 06:35:46.360 align:start position:0%
elections look at your elections were
 
06:35:49.868 --> 06:35:49.878 align:start position:0%
you voted to represent your constituency
 
06:35:52.708 --> 06:35:52.718 align:start position:0%
by 51% of everyone in your
 
06:35:54.948 --> 06:35:54.958 align:start position:0%
District the answer is
 
06:35:57.948 --> 06:35:57.958 align:start position:0%
no but that's what you're requiring
 
06:36:00.430 --> 06:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
unions to do whether people want to vote
 
06:36:01.708 --> 06:36:01.718 align:start position:0%
whether they want to exercise their
 
06:36:04.190 --> 06:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
right not to exercise their franchise
 
06:36:05.910 --> 06:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
and right now the way that it's worked
 
06:36:08.830 --> 06:36:08.840 align:start position:0%
for 50 years over approximately 50 years
 
06:36:10.708 --> 06:36:10.718 align:start position:0%
is that it's a majority of the people
 
06:36:14.468 --> 06:36:14.478 align:start position:0%
who vote that's who makes the
 
06:36:16.750 --> 06:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
decision if you change it to this manner
 
06:36:18.628 --> 06:36:18.638 align:start position:0%
it makes it almost insurmountable
 
06:36:20.628 --> 06:36:20.638 align:start position:0%
because I will tell you that public
 
06:36:23.590 --> 06:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
employees um who serve this state work a
 
06:36:26.670 --> 06:36:26.680 align:start position:0%
variety of different schedules they work
 
06:36:28.990 --> 06:36:29.000 align:start position:0%
a variety of different times and quite
 
06:36:33.670 --> 06:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
frankly some are disenchanted um with
 
06:36:35.510 --> 06:36:35.520 align:start position:0%
participating in anything not just
 
06:36:37.990 --> 06:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
unions how do you get that
 
06:36:41.548 --> 06:36:41.558 align:start position:0%
51% you're setting this up for
 
06:36:45.110 --> 06:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
failure that does not produce harmonious
 
06:36:47.110 --> 06:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
Labor Management
 
06:36:49.990 --> 06:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
relations the current law does and it's
 
06:36:53.388 --> 06:36:53.398 align:start position:0%
been proven and it's happened over 50
 
06:36:55.708 --> 06:36:55.718 align:start position:0%
years some of the discussions earlier
 
06:36:57.468 --> 06:36:57.478 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make clear and I
 
06:37:00.190 --> 06:37:00.200 align:start position:0%
think uh uh executive inou already said
 
06:37:02.548 --> 06:37:02.558 align:start position:0%
it the Public Employee Labor Relations
 
06:37:04.590 --> 06:37:04.600 align:start position:0%
Board only deals with public employees
 
06:37:06.030 --> 06:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
in the state of New
 
06:37:07.868 --> 06:37:07.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all the other things that
 
06:37:09.468 --> 06:37:09.478 align:start position:0%
they're talking about that's through the
 
06:37:12.270 --> 06:37:12.280 align:start position:0%
NL or something else because we don't
 
06:37:14.270 --> 06:37:14.280 align:start position:0%
that the Public Employee Labor Relations
 
06:37:16.030 --> 06:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
Board does not have jurisdiction over
 
06:37:16.040 --> 06:37:17.628 align:start position:0%
Board does not have jurisdiction over
private

06:37:17.628 --> 06:37:17.638 align:start position:0%
private
 
06:37:20.070 --> 06:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
employees um I will tell you too that
 
06:37:22.708 --> 06:37:22.718 align:start position:0%
the other problem is thinking of uh and
 
06:37:24.590 --> 06:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I'll end there I think I've made my
 
06:37:26.270 --> 06:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
point if there's any questions or
 
06:37:28.070 --> 06:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
clarifications I can provide I'd be
 
06:37:29.830 --> 06:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
happy to do so Mr chairman or other
 
06:37:32.110 --> 06:37:32.120 align:start position:0%
members of the board thank you for your
 
06:37:35.788 --> 06:37:35.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:38.750 --> 06:37:38.760 align:start position:0%
saying none please uh thank you thank
 
06:37:49.310 --> 06:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:51.430 --> 06:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
please always great to be between a
 
06:37:53.150 --> 06:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
committee and uh going home so I'll try
 
06:37:55.430 --> 06:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
to be quick uh for the record my name is
 
06:37:57.270 --> 06:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
Greg Mo I'm the state director with u
 
06:37:58.548 --> 06:37:58.558 align:start position:0%
Regal director with Americans for
 
06:38:01.110 --> 06:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
Prosperity and here today testify in
 
06:38:03.788 --> 06:38:03.798 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 735 of will say
 
06:38:05.230 --> 06:38:05.240 align:start position:0%
there was a similar Bill brought forward
 
06:38:07.788 --> 06:38:07.798 align:start position:0%
in 2020 as an earlier speaker mentioned
 
06:38:09.628 --> 06:38:09.638 align:start position:0%
I am glad that the sponsor didn't give
 
06:38:12.628 --> 06:38:12.638 align:start position:0%
me one day's notice like in 20120 so I'm
 
06:38:15.468 --> 06:38:15.478 align:start position:0%
happy about that piece uh but I will say
 
06:38:17.548 --> 06:38:17.558 align:start position:0%
about uh in addition to what the the
 
06:38:18.948 --> 06:38:18.958 align:start position:0%
representatives who brought the bill in
 
06:38:20.708 --> 06:38:20.718 align:start position:0%
said I would just add that the one
 
06:38:23.430 --> 06:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
distinction with uh public sector unions
 
06:38:27.030 --> 06:38:27.040 align:start position:0%
is that they don't go away businesses go
 
06:38:29.388 --> 06:38:29.398 align:start position:0%
away uh there's a great book called
 
06:38:31.590 --> 06:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
built to last by Jerry porus and Jim
 
06:38:33.510 --> 06:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
Collins and it talks about what makes
 
06:38:34.948 --> 06:38:34.958 align:start position:0%
enduringly great companies and in it
 
06:38:37.110 --> 06:38:37.120 align:start position:0%
they raised a point that less than one
 
06:38:38.830 --> 06:38:38.840 align:start position:0%
half of 1% of businesses that are around
 
06:38:40.830 --> 06:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
today were around 50 years ago so this
 
06:38:43.468 --> 06:38:43.478 align:start position:0%
is a natural cycle going through in the
 
06:38:45.110 --> 06:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
private sector that doesn't happen in
 
06:38:47.468 --> 06:38:47.478 align:start position:0%
the public sector in the public sector
 
06:38:49.150 --> 06:38:49.160 align:start position:0%
um I expect that the unions that were
 
06:38:51.388 --> 06:38:51.398 align:start position:0%
here today will be most of them will
 
06:38:53.948 --> 06:38:53.958 align:start position:0%
still be here 50 years from now and at
 
06:38:56.030 --> 06:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
that point undoubtedly none of the
 
06:38:57.548 --> 06:38:57.558 align:start position:0%
people in those bargaining units will
 
06:38:59.270 --> 06:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
have ever had a a chance to choose
 
06:39:01.990 --> 06:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
between which Union they might think
 
06:39:05.548 --> 06:39:05.558 align:start position:0%
prefer they prefer as the one that uh
 
06:39:07.230 --> 06:39:07.240 align:start position:0%
best represents
 
06:39:09.150 --> 06:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
them I'll tell you that there's an
 
06:39:10.708 --> 06:39:10.718 align:start position:0%
interesting experience I was I have a
 
06:39:13.230 --> 06:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
friend who's wife is a is a public
 
06:39:14.910 --> 06:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
school teacher uh they live in
 
06:39:17.070 --> 06:39:17.080 align:start position:0%
Manchester she had been working in in
 
06:39:20.548 --> 06:39:20.558 align:start position:0%
nashaa uh which is a aft
 
06:39:24.388 --> 06:39:24.398 align:start position:0%
represented uh board um district and uh
 
06:39:26.388 --> 06:39:26.398 align:start position:0%
she had a chance to come to work in
 
06:39:28.230 --> 06:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
Manchester which given to commute from
 
06:39:29.830 --> 06:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
driving down from Manchester to as every
 
06:39:32.310 --> 06:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
day I would make that choice too uh and
 
06:39:34.708 --> 06:39:34.718 align:start position:0%
she and she found out that were an Nea
 
06:39:37.788 --> 06:39:37.798 align:start position:0%
affiliate and uh she expressed to me
 
06:39:39.388 --> 06:39:39.398 align:start position:0%
that that she liked what she was getting
 
06:39:40.548 --> 06:39:40.558 align:start position:0%
in Nashville better than what she's
 
06:39:42.708 --> 06:39:42.718 align:start position:0%
getting in Manchester and she said do we
 
06:39:44.430 --> 06:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
vote on that and I said there was a vote
 
06:39:46.430 --> 06:39:46.440 align:start position:0%
but it was before you were born uh so
 
06:39:47.590 --> 06:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that I would
 
06:39:49.708 --> 06:39:49.718 align:start position:0%
just encourage people to consider and
 
06:39:51.548 --> 06:39:51.558 align:start position:0%
that part doesn't change in in public
 
06:39:53.510 --> 06:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
sector because because governments stay
 
06:39:56.110 --> 06:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
around they don't go out of business uh
 
06:39:58.868 --> 06:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
as for the actual language in the bill
 
06:40:00.510 --> 06:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
there are a number of states that do
 
06:40:03.750 --> 06:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
public sector uh recertification none of
 
06:40:06.788 --> 06:40:06.798 align:start position:0%
them do do them this way um none of them
 
06:40:08.110 --> 06:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
none of them do this way I'm not sure
 
06:40:11.350 --> 06:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
that this is uh necessarily the best way
 
06:40:13.270 --> 06:40:13.280 align:start position:0%
to do it not just because of the
 
06:40:14.590 --> 06:40:14.600 align:start position:0%
additional burden it would add to the
 
06:40:16.590 --> 06:40:16.600 align:start position:0%
employers to track all the information
 
06:40:18.830 --> 06:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
as to when someone's start date was and
 
06:40:20.590 --> 06:40:20.600 align:start position:0%
when the certification was or most
 
06:40:24.590 --> 06:40:24.600 align:start position:0%
recent certification was uh but also uh
 
06:40:26.750 --> 06:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
but also be because it creates a level
 
06:40:28.628 --> 06:40:28.638 align:start position:0%
of uncertainty and almost as
 
06:40:30.030 --> 06:40:30.040 align:start position:0%
representative selvan pointed out almost
 
06:40:31.990 --> 06:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
all the union or good a good chunk of
 
06:40:33.990 --> 06:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
the Unions would immediately implicated
 
06:40:36.310 --> 06:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
and it would probably overwhelm the
 
06:40:39.430 --> 06:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
plrb uh so I would say that that as
 
06:40:41.110 --> 06:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
you're considering this legislation you
 
06:40:43.270 --> 06:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
need to consider an orderly fashion in
 
06:40:45.190 --> 06:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
which if you're going to go through this
 
06:40:46.788 --> 06:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
route an orderly fashion so you break
 
06:40:48.910 --> 06:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
the work up so you're not suddenly
 
06:40:52.590 --> 06:40:52.600 align:start position:0%
deluging the plrb with with um hundreds
 
06:40:55.468 --> 06:40:55.478 align:start position:0%
potentially uh of of recertification
 
06:40:57.670 --> 06:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
elections uh just goes with some with
 
06:41:00.350 --> 06:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
some what other states do the State of
 
06:41:02.468 --> 06:41:02.478 align:start position:0%
Florida it's it's 10 years so once every
 
06:41:04.270 --> 06:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
10 years they have recertification the
 
06:41:06.150 --> 06:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
state of Missouri is every 3 years the
 
06:41:08.270 --> 06:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
state of Iowa has recertification
 
06:41:11.070 --> 06:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
whenever there's a new contract uh
 
06:41:14.910 --> 06:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
probably the easiest and simplest one of
 
06:41:16.910 --> 06:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
all those is the state of Wisconsin
 
06:41:19.750 --> 06:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
which goes through the annual election
 
06:41:21.030 --> 06:41:21.040 align:start position:0%
process so when you're going through
 
06:41:23.830 --> 06:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
your annual benefits and you're deciding
 
06:41:25.190 --> 06:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
what benefits you what payroll
 
06:41:26.388 --> 06:41:26.398 align:start position:0%
deductions in other words you're picking
 
06:41:27.830 --> 06:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
your health plan and picking your other
 
06:41:31.670 --> 06:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
benefits it adds paying union dues and
 
06:41:34.788 --> 06:41:34.798 align:start position:0%
uh if the number of employees who opt to
 
06:41:37.190 --> 06:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
pay to pay Union who dropped below 50%
 
06:41:38.510 --> 06:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
then that automatically triggers a
 
06:41:40.868 --> 06:41:40.878 align:start position:0%
recertification election so this is I'm
 
06:41:42.628 --> 06:41:42.638 align:start position:0%
just just talking about what some other
 
06:41:45.430 --> 06:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
states do in terms of the me the
 
06:41:47.868 --> 06:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
triggering mechanism uh to begin the
 
06:41:50.590 --> 06:41:50.600 align:start position:0%
recertification so just wanted I know
 
06:41:52.310 --> 06:41:52.320 align:start position:0%
the the the prime sponsor mentioned that
 
06:41:54.270 --> 06:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
he's not hung up on this particular
 
06:41:55.430 --> 06:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
method so I just wanted to offer the
 
06:41:57.670 --> 06:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
committee a few other ideas as to what
 
06:41:59.350 --> 06:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
some other states do so happy to take
 
06:41:59.360 --> 06:42:01.670 align:start position:0%
some other states do so happy to take
any

06:42:01.670 --> 06:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:04.070 --> 06:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
06:42:05.590 --> 06:42:05.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr Moore
 
06:42:07.830 --> 06:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
um so does the in dist just St Wisconsin
 
06:42:09.350 --> 06:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
does the Department of Labor
 
06:42:11.670 --> 06:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
track would you know if the Department
 
06:42:14.230 --> 06:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
of Labor tracks the uh union membership
 
06:42:16.830 --> 06:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
or if it's another department so the uh
 
06:42:18.628 --> 06:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
as I recall state of Wisconsin doing a
 
06:42:20.830 --> 06:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
little bit of of research uh in advance
 
06:42:23.510 --> 06:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
of this bill what they do is they have
 
06:42:26.350 --> 06:42:26.360 align:start position:0%
basically their annual Open Season so
 
06:42:27.510 --> 06:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
like a lot of businesses you have an
 
06:42:30.948 --> 06:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
open season and and the IND individual
 
06:42:32.750 --> 06:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
employees will come through and they'll
 
06:42:35.150 --> 06:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
fill what their payroll deductions are
 
06:42:37.388 --> 06:42:37.398 align:start position:0%
other which which category Health Plan
 
06:42:38.830 --> 06:42:38.840 align:start position:0%
do they take so how much takes that
 
06:42:40.948 --> 06:42:40.958 align:start position:0%
takes out of it of a deduction out their
 
06:42:43.830 --> 06:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
pay check and one of the one of the the
 
06:42:46.230 --> 06:42:46.240 align:start position:0%
fields they fill out is uh paying union
 
06:42:49.388 --> 06:42:49.398 align:start position:0%
dues and the way that works is so when
 
06:42:51.388 --> 06:42:51.398 align:start position:0%
the employer sees that that fewer than
 
06:42:52.548 --> 06:42:52.558 align:start position:0%
half of the bargaining unit have
 
06:42:54.590 --> 06:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
selected union dues that triggers
 
06:42:57.868 --> 06:42:57.878 align:start position:0%
notification to their U Public Employee
 
06:42:59.110 --> 06:42:59.120 align:start position:0%
Labor Relations
 
06:43:02.350 --> 06:43:02.360 align:start position:0%
Board follow please so it would be
 
06:43:04.070 --> 06:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
basically an intern inter issue that the
 
06:43:07.150 --> 06:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
union would have to un the union would
 
06:43:08.750 --> 06:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
or the employer would have to report
 
06:43:12.350 --> 06:43:12.360 align:start position:0%
right the employer thank you thank you
 
06:43:15.468 --> 06:43:15.478 align:start position:0%
Mr okay Mr Moore thank you so much oh
 
06:43:18.510 --> 06:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry John L representative L uh
 
06:43:21.110 --> 06:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
sorry and thank you Mr Moore um I asked
 
06:43:23.270 --> 06:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
president Brackett earlier if he had
 
06:43:27.270 --> 06:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
anybody that was um looking for this
 
06:43:29.788 --> 06:43:29.798 align:start position:0%
legislation for something like this if
 
06:43:31.350 --> 06:43:31.360 align:start position:0%
you have people at are where are they
 
06:43:33.510 --> 06:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
how come we don't have more people here
 
06:43:37.430 --> 06:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
I would love to hear testimony from
 
06:43:40.868 --> 06:43:40.878 align:start position:0%
folks uh representative I
 
06:43:44.270 --> 06:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how many people are able
 
06:43:46.388 --> 06:43:46.398 align:start position:0%
to to take off work at 3:30 on on a
 
06:43:48.830 --> 06:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
Tuesday afternoon it we find this as a
 
06:43:50.430 --> 06:43:50.440 align:start position:0%
challenge where if we wanted to get
 
06:43:52.830 --> 06:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
people together at 7:30 somewhere we can
 
06:43:54.350 --> 06:43:54.360 align:start position:0%
get lots of our activists together try
 
06:43:55.708 --> 06:43:55.718 align:start position:0%
to get people together during the work
 
06:43:58.548 --> 06:43:58.558 align:start position:0%
day it's it's a challenge for a followup
 
06:44:02.830 --> 06:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um well to your point the
 
06:44:05.590 --> 06:44:05.600 align:start position:0%
right to work people we had people here
 
06:44:08.150 --> 06:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
all day that were opposed to the bill
 
06:44:09.468 --> 06:44:09.478 align:start position:0%
and they came and spoke is that a
 
06:44:11.468 --> 06:44:11.478 align:start position:0%
statement or a question so why would
 
06:44:13.670 --> 06:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
that be any
 
06:44:16.230 --> 06:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
different I'm I'm I'm not sure I follow
 
06:44:18.510 --> 06:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
but but look if people people obviously
 
06:44:20.030 --> 06:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
can take their time in the manner that
 
06:44:21.430 --> 06:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
they see
 
06:44:24.310 --> 06:44:24.320 align:start position:0%
fit thank you Mr thank you m uh
 
06:44:26.430 --> 06:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie thank you thank
 
06:44:26.440 --> 06:44:27.628 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie thank you thank
Mr

06:44:27.628 --> 06:44:27.638 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
06:44:30.030 --> 06:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
chairman so you've heard about all the
 
06:44:33.030 --> 06:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
mechanisms currently in the law the
 
06:44:35.310 --> 06:44:35.320 align:start position:0%
allow employees to make decisions to
 
06:44:37.830 --> 06:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
decertify their Union to challenge the
 
06:44:42.868 --> 06:44:42.878 align:start position:0%
leadership to uh you know to be be uh
 
06:44:45.548 --> 06:44:45.558 align:start position:0%
reprimanded uh for their inability to
 
06:44:47.750 --> 06:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
properly represent their their people so
 
06:44:49.750 --> 06:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
we have all of this structure within the
 
06:44:52.868 --> 06:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
current law that is working we've heard
 
06:44:54.830 --> 06:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
from the from the chair of the of the
 
06:44:56.670 --> 06:44:56.680 align:start position:0%
committee of the uh
 
06:45:01.590 --> 06:45:01.600 align:start position:0%
plrb so tell me what more do we need to
 
06:45:04.230 --> 06:45:04.240 align:start position:0%
do in New Hampshire
 
06:45:06.910 --> 06:45:06.920 align:start position:0%
without disrupting everything what more
 
06:45:09.310 --> 06:45:09.320 align:start position:0%
would you think we need to do when when
 
06:45:11.190 --> 06:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
all of these things are in place and all
 
06:45:14.110 --> 06:45:14.120 align:start position:0%
this mechanism in place for us to do all
 
06:45:16.230 --> 06:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
the things that you're talking about let
 
06:45:18.310 --> 06:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
employees make the choices why do we
 
06:45:21.750 --> 06:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
need this legislation right now as I as
 
06:45:24.948 --> 06:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
I said uh excuse me I'm lose my voice uh
 
06:45:27.270 --> 06:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
as I said there are going to be a number
 
06:45:29.070 --> 06:45:29.080 align:start position:0%
of bargaining units across New Hampshire
 
06:45:31.388 --> 06:45:31.398 align:start position:0%
where literally no member of that of
 
06:45:32.670 --> 06:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
that bargaining unit had a chance to
 
06:45:35.750 --> 06:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
choose which Union would be representing
 
06:45:37.948 --> 06:45:37.958 align:start position:0%
them now that's not
 
06:45:40.910 --> 06:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
sure well they wouldn't have a chance to
 
06:45:43.510 --> 06:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
certify and ultimately they don't know
 
06:45:45.110 --> 06:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
if the grass is any Greener because they
 
06:45:46.628 --> 06:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
don't have they don't have the choice to
 
06:45:51.030 --> 06:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
determine that Mr chairman just one one
 
06:45:53.510 --> 06:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
correction here okay so is there a
 
06:45:56.388 --> 06:45:56.398 align:start position:0%

uh the employees wouldn't have the right
 
06:46:03.230 --> 06:46:03.240 align:start position:0%

McKenzie yes on you so G given the the
 
06:47:11.030 --> 06:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
charge that you have under the
 
06:47:14.350 --> 06:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
law um do you have either the capacity
 
06:47:18.548 --> 06:47:18.558 align:start position:0%
or the legal uh framework to be able to
 
06:47:21.830 --> 06:47:21.840 align:start position:0%
take on the responsibility of managing
 
06:47:24.590 --> 06:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
what this uh legislation is
 
06:47:27.830 --> 06:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
saying uh the bill would require new
 
06:47:29.708 --> 06:47:29.718 align:start position:0%
Personnel new work
 
06:47:32.230 --> 06:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
processes um it would uh require new
 
06:47:35.150 --> 06:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction for us in order to obtain
 
06:47:37.310 --> 06:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
these records store these records um
 
06:47:39.388 --> 06:47:39.398 align:start position:0%
review these records um and take
 
06:47:40.990 --> 06:47:41.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement action if necessary if
 
06:47:43.670 --> 06:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
records weren't forthcoming um and to
 
06:47:47.310 --> 06:47:47.320 align:start position:0%
then um process them internally
 
06:47:50.270 --> 06:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
so okay good representative avalani that
 
06:47:51.548 --> 06:47:51.558 align:start position:0%
was half my question representative
 
06:47:54.910 --> 06:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
McKenzie um the follow-up to that is uh
 
06:47:57.548 --> 06:47:57.558 align:start position:0%
would Employment Services be a better
 
06:48:00.150 --> 06:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
resource that already has those process
 
06:48:01.868 --> 06:48:01.878 align:start position:0%
half or more those processes in place
 
06:48:05.948 --> 06:48:05.958 align:start position:0%
that you would have to R for uh I I I I
 
06:48:08.310 --> 06:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
can't speak to their capacity or
 
06:48:10.388 --> 06:48:10.398 align:start position:0%
processes I do know they do track
 
06:48:12.708 --> 06:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
employee numbers as part of of their
 
06:48:14.548 --> 06:48:14.558 align:start position:0%
role and employee wages as part of their
 
06:48:17.990 --> 06:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
role um regulating their systems I don't
 
06:48:19.750 --> 06:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
know to what granular degree they do
 
06:48:22.590 --> 06:48:22.600 align:start position:0%
