00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:37.150 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to go ahead and get
 
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 align:start position:0%
219 and I'd like to call on Senator
 
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
Murphy to introduce his bill good
 
00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
morning Madam chair members of the
 
00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
committee Senator Keith Murphy
 
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
presenting the towns of hookit gtown
 
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.840 align:start position:0%
Raymond Candia and Manchester's First
 
00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 align:start position:0%
Ward um this bill is a taxpayer
 
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 align:start position:0%
transparency bill um I'm sure that being
 
00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 align:start position:0%
an education committee you know better
 
00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
than I uh the issue that this bill
 
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
attempts to address but in essence the
 
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 align:start position:0%
last two decades our cost per pupil has
 
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.030 align:start position:0%
last two decades our cost per pupil has
increased

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 align:start position:0%
increased
 
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 align:start position:0%
77% adjusting for inflation while our
 
00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 align:start position:0%
teacher salaries are only up
 
00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 align:start position:0%
1% in the same 20 year period our
 
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
non-teaching staff is up
 
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
80% the number of teachers is up only
 
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.469 align:start position:0%
80% the number of teachers is up only
23%

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
23%
 
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 align:start position:0%
11.2% so we're spending more than ever
 
00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:51.079 align:start position:0%
to educate fewer
 
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 align:start position:0%
children so the bill in front of you
 
00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
essentially says that the school board
 
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 align:start position:0%
every year School District
 
00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 align:start position:0%
would produce
 
00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 align:start position:0%
charts now I know that someone else has
 
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 align:start position:0%
handed out some copies for you to look
 
00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
at but here's what one of those charts
 
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
would look like it lays out the cost per
 
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 align:start position:0%
pupil the average teacher
 
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.830 align:start position:0%
pupil the average teacher
salary

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
salary
 
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
top y thank you forgive me I forgot the
 
00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
prohibition there are copies in front of
 
00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 align:start position:0%
you and the administrator salaries
 
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
so again this is for taxpayer
 
00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
transparency it's so taxpayers can see
 
00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 align:start position:0%
where the money is going in their
 
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
districts if you believe in taxpayer
 
00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 align:start position:0%
transparency I believe that this is a
 
00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 align:start position:0%
common sense bill
 
00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 align:start position:0%
um um some may say well can't you dig
 
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
into the reports and find the
 
00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 align:start position:0%
information and the answer would be yes
 
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
if taxpayers had three or four hours to
 
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
go dig the reports dig out the numbers
 
00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 align:start position:0%
pull out an Excel spreadsheet and had
 
00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 align:start position:0%
the the uh experience necessary to
 
00:03:03.789 --> 00:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
produce those reports they could put the
 
00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 align:start position:0%
formulas in and come out with the same
 
00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
report which indicates exactly how easy
 
00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 align:start position:0%
it is for somebody in the school
 
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 align:start position:0%
district school district office to
 
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
produce this makes it very very
 
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 align:start position:0%
straightforward and simple and taxpayers
 
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
have the right to know where their money
 
00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 align:start position:0%
is going and that's all the bill does
 
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
and that conclud concludes my comments
 
00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 align:start position:0%
if anyone has any questions I'm happy to
 
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
answer them are there any questions from
 
00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.390 align:start position:0%
answer them are there any questions from
the

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and please just
 
00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 align:start position:0%
give me a sec so I can find what the
 
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
line is on
 
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.070 align:start position:0%
line is on
it

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
um or you tell me I'm concerned about
 
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
several things but particularly I'm
 
00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 align:start position:0%
concerned on page
 
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 align:start position:0%
three Roman numeral 6 prohibiting any
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
additional commentary or other texts so
 
00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 align:start position:0%
a district can't decide to include
 
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 align:start position:0%
information that would inform
 
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
citizens um possible explanations for
 
00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
whatever the chart might be presenting I
 
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
don't I don't understand why we'd
 
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
prohibit that information so I believe
 
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
you're referring to lines 5 and six on
 
00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 align:start position:0%
page three the correct thank you and
 
00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question the reason
 
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
that text is there is simply that the
 
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
information is meant to be presented
 
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
with no judgment for or against it's not
 
00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 align:start position:0%
meant to endorse or not endorse the
 
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 align:start position:0%
school's policies or spending it is
 
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 align:start position:0%
simply to convey the spending in terms
 
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
of where the money is going it's not
 
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
meant to impose judgment and the school
 
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
district frankly shouldn't be including
 
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 align:start position:0%
chart followup yes RIP followup thank
 
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 align:start position:0%
you could you please expand on your last
 
00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
statement that the school district
 
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be
 
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
making comment well if they want to
 
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 align:start position:0%
address those comments or if they want
 
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 align:start position:0%
to um explain the chart in Greater
 
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
detail there's nothing stopping them
 
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
from doing so at a Schoolboard meeting
 
00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
or hearing this is the report as
 
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
chart representative
 
00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
Tanner thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
question yes ma'am and I I asked this
 
00:05:31.309 --> 00:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
every time I see this as the uh
 
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 align:start position:0%
finishing Salvo on one of these bills it
 
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
uh line on page three line 16 through
 
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:38.909 align:start position:0%
uh line on page three line 16 through
through

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:38.919 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
19 um could you point out what part of
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional such invalidity or not
 
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.430 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional such invalidity or not
other

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
Provisions it's difficult for me to
 
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
predict necessarily which part of it
 
00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:02.360 align:start position:0%
might in the future be somehow not
 
00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
upheld um there is for
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
example um the Civil remedy section
 
00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
which is just above it lines 9 through
 
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
14 basically saying that any taxpayer in
 
00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 align:start position:0%
that school district agreed by violation
 
00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
District May petition Superior Court so
 
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
if in the future Superior Court ever
 
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
were to say that
 
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
um the attorney's fees can't be
 
00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
awarded for example then the rest of the
 
00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:31.479 align:start position:0%
bill would still stand the rest of it
 
00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:32.469 align:start position:0%
bill would still stand the rest of it
would

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
law just
 
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
followup um I'd also like to know um on
 
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560 align:start position:0%

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
believe that the original bill the
 
00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
original Bill 219 as presented from the
 
00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:35.959 align:start position:0%
committee was came out inexpedient to
 
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:38.800 align:start position:0%
legislate by 4 to zero vote and then on
 
00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:42.719 align:start position:0%
the floor of the other chamber um a
 
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
floor amendment was introduced that
 
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
changed the complexion of the um
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
original 219 bill without public hearing
 
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:51.800 align:start position:0%
or without any input which is
 
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
unfortunate because we may have been
 
00:08:57.269 --> 00:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
able to advise um part of this process
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh had we had that opportunity so I'm
 
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
going take that opportunity today uh to
 
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
offer some suggestions
 
00:09:07.069 --> 00:09:07.079 align:start position:0%
perhaps would you believe that posting
 
00:09:09.389 --> 00:09:09.399 align:start position:0%
requirements already exist for school
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
district budgets and the detail that
 
00:09:15.269 --> 00:09:15.279 align:start position:0%
local taxpayers can access and that
 
00:09:16.829 --> 00:09:16.839 align:start position:0%
information is required to be in
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
newspapers and notice of hearings um are
 
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
already accessible to taxpayers who are
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
interested in pursuing and getting that
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
information and at district meetings
 
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
that information is typically handed out
 
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:33.160 align:start position:0%
and discussed in depth would you
 
00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
believe that the average cost per pupil
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
for over 10 years is already accessible
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
data on the New Hampshire education
 
00:09:43.389 --> 00:09:43.399 align:start position:0%
department website would you also
 
00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
believe that the average teacher
 
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:47.720 align:start position:0%
salaries for 10 years is already
 
00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
accessible to the public on the New
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire education department website
 
00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
in addition would you believe that the
 
00:09:55.949 --> 00:09:55.959 align:start position:0%
average minimum teacher salaries for
 
00:09:58.230 --> 00:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
over 10 years is accessible to the
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
public on new Hampshire education
 
00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
department website in addition would you
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
believe that the salaries for
 
00:10:07.509 --> 00:10:07.519 align:start position:0%
superintendant assistant superintendents
 
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:09.640 align:start position:0%
business officials principles and
 
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
assistant principles are also accessible
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
to every taxpayer on the New Hampshire
 
00:10:17.389 --> 00:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
education department website it's a
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
click and perhaps um well in addition to
 
00:10:24.750 --> 00:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
that would you believe that the 10-year
 
00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:27.959 align:start position:0%
based adequacy amount per student is
 
00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:30.160 align:start position:0%
also included on the New Hampshire
 
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
Department of Education website as are
 
00:10:35.629 --> 00:10:35.639 align:start position:0%
the ad adequacy Grant payments made to
 
00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
each district for 10 years accessible
 
00:10:42.310 --> 00:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
from the same report in the same manner
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
on a on the website if
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
um any of you are interested at a break
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
I could show you how to access that it's
 
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
simple it's simple and you have all of
 
00:10:55.629 --> 00:10:55.639 align:start position:0%
the information for all of the districts
 
00:10:57.509 --> 00:10:57.519 align:start position:0%
all the superintendent salaries all the
 
00:10:59.069 --> 00:10:59.079 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent salaries all
 
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
the business official salaries you have
 
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.560 align:start position:0%
all this
 
00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
information this
 
00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:07.639 align:start position:0%
prescriptive legislation which would
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
require line graphs biog graphs and
 
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
other types of setups are just one more
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
administrative burden on local school
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
districts to produce an additional
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
duplicative piece of information that
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
access and so if I sound frustrated for
 
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:30.720 align:start position:0%
our members am because the the
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
information is
 
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
available this adds one more piece one
 
00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
more duplication of effort and then
 
00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
there are members in this body and the
 
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
other body that will that will criticize
 
00:11:46.949 --> 00:11:46.959 align:start position:0%
the administrative bloat and costs of
 
00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:48.560 align:start position:0%
having to administer school districts
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
because we have to produce additional
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
information that already is in
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
existence civil remedies would you
 
00:11:59.629 --> 00:11:59.639 align:start position:0%
believe civil remedies would be
 
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
necessary if this piece of burdensome
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
and duplicative legislation that's
 
00:12:06.870 --> 00:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
costly to local taxpayers were passed
 
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:10.160 align:start position:0%
civil remedies I might suggest that
 
00:12:14.189 --> 00:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
through the pbass system the input-based
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
accountability system that I believe
 
00:12:18.509 --> 00:12:18.519 align:start position:0%
this uh there's a work session with this
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
committee this
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
afternoon the remedy for for including
 
00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160 align:start position:0%
this report uh could be part of the
 
00:12:30.189 --> 00:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
pbass system there needs to be no civil
 
00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
remedy and and it's accountability for
 
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:34.040 align:start position:0%
district if the interest is making sure
 
00:12:36.389 --> 00:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
a district has the information available
 
00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
then that could be part of the the pbass
 
00:12:40.629 --> 00:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
system just like policies just like fire
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
safety inspections just like health
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
safety inspections and uh is there is
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
this uh information available and I
 
00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:50.680 align:start position:0%
might suggest through an amendment that
 
00:12:53.829 --> 00:12:53.839 align:start position:0%
if indeed the uh the interest is
 
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayer transparency and ease of
 
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
accessing this information that perhaps
 
00:13:00.509 --> 00:13:00.519 align:start position:0%
the legislation could amended to
 
00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440 align:start position:0%
say that each School
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
District might be required on their web
 
00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:09.399 align:start position:0%
home website to have a link to the
 
00:13:13.509 --> 00:13:13.519 align:start position:0%
Department of Education reports that's
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
simple you have a link to the Department
 
00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:17.360 align:start position:0%
of Education reports on the website so
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
that anyone who wants to access this
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
information can develop all the charts
 
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
all the Biograph all the line graphs all
 
00:13:24.269 --> 00:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
the information that they want to
 
00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:27.160 align:start position:0%
develop that the obligation of the local
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
school district would be to post have a
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
link on the website saves local taxpayer
 
00:13:34.949 --> 00:13:34.959 align:start position:0%
money it's efficient provides the
 
00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
transparency that sponsors are looking
 
00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:38.839 align:start position:0%
for and it's very informative to be
 
00:13:44.069 --> 00:13:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
informative this legislation isn't
 
00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:50.800 align:start position:0%
necessary and it should be determined
 
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
itl or amended to include uh different
 
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
pieces that I alluded to and we would be
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
happy to work with um any language
 
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
regarding the Amendments that we um
 
00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.269 align:start position:0%
regarding the Amendments that we um
would

00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
propose and with that I'll conclude and
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any questions thank
 
00:14:10.749 --> 00:14:10.759 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any questions
 
00:14:10.759 --> 00:14:12.550 align:start position:0%
you very much are there any questions
representative

00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:14:16.189 --> 00:14:16.199 align:start position:0%
you for being here this morning I wanted
 
00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
to look at the opening part of your
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
argument which could potentially be
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
compelling which is the idea that um
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
this is a local control issue but I want
 
00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
to I want to look at that just a little
 
00:14:28.189 --> 00:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
bit because despite that we have
 
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:30.240 align:start position:0%
generally local control for school
 
00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
districts in New Hampshire it's not
 
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:34.600 align:start position:0%
totally locally funded we have a
 
00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:36.920 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of funding coming at
 
00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
the state level and we're actually
 
00:14:40.470 --> 00:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
facing a
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
pending a Supreme Court decision based
 
00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:45.440 align:start position:0%
on a a decision that was rendered ear
 
00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:47.560 align:start position:0%
last year that could
 
00:14:50.069 --> 00:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
substantially increase the amount of
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
money state taxpayers are being forced
 
00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
to allocate that would be then
 
00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:56.480 align:start position:0%
distributed to the local level so given
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
the fact that yes we do have local
 
00:15:01.030 --> 00:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
control but but we also have substantial
 
00:15:03.069 --> 00:15:03.079 align:start position:0%
state level funding can you speak a
 
00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:05.600 align:start position:0%
little bit as to why the the state level
 
00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
funding issue does not override and and
 
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:10.680 align:start position:0%
suggest that people at the general state
 
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:12.120 align:start position:0%
level should have an idea of how the
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
money is being spent that they're
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
allocating thank you for the question
 
00:15:19.389 --> 00:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
representative beler um I would submit
 
00:15:21.629 --> 00:15:21.639 align:start position:0%
that that level of state level funding
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
is also part of what this legislation
 
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
could include I think it would be
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
important for the taxpayers to see what
 
00:15:30.990 --> 00:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
the base amount is that that has been
 
00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:33.360 align:start position:0%
paid per student over 10 years to their
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
local District so that they can
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
determine what the state contribution to
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
children's education has been what has
 
00:15:40.509 --> 00:15:40.519 align:start position:0%
been had to be raised at the local level
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
I think that's a great point in addition
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
the adequacy of uh grants that are made
 
00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:47.399 align:start position:0%
to the districts uh should also be
 
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:49.959 align:start position:0%
included as part of that so that once
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
again people can see the cost of
 
00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
Education cost per pupil of their
 
00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
students in their District as it relates
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
to the relative state contribution and
 
00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:01.720 align:start position:0%
so I think that is an important piece
 
00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.150 align:start position:0%
so I think that is an important piece
thank

00:16:03.150 --> 00:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:16:07.470 --> 00:16:07.480 align:start position:0%
you representative Woodcock thank you um
 
00:16:08.829 --> 00:16:08.839 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning thank you for
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question i' like to follow up
 
00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
on uh the gentleman it's my last
 
00:16:15.389 --> 00:16:15.399 align:start position:0%
question uh he he indicated that there
 
00:16:17.949 --> 00:16:17.959 align:start position:0%
is a significant amount of uh State
 
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
funding uh that comes at a local level
 
00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:22.519 align:start position:0%
and as you had said would be uh could be
 
00:16:26.749 --> 00:16:26.759 align:start position:0%
shown as as the uh equal on that on that
 
00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:31.120 align:start position:0%
website would it be fair would be a fair
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh statement to say that the state
 
00:16:35.949 --> 00:16:35.959 align:start position:0%
support of public education is almost
 
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
minuscule as compared to local property
 
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers support thank you for the
 
00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
question representative Woodcock um I
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
believe that would be fair to say thank
 
00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
questions representative Tanner thank
 
00:16:54.509 --> 00:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
you thank you for ask um answering my
 
00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
question I want to go back to um page
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
two uh the cost per pupil and um one of
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
the the a says the total expenditure
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
associated with the daily operation of
 
00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
schools divided by the ADM in attendance
 
00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
and I just um wanted to know if you
 
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
think that's a fair assessment of what
 
00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:21.799 align:start position:0%
it costs per pupil or whether there are
 
00:17:24.669 --> 00:17:24.679 align:start position:0%
certain things in the operational budget
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
of a school that um really skews
 
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:31.280 align:start position:0%
the cost per pupil thank you for the
 
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.270 align:start position:0%
the cost per pupil thank you for the
question

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
representative if I may interrupt excuse
 
00:17:36.549 --> 00:17:36.559 align:start position:0%
me um I'm sorry represent over here we
 
00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear what line we're talking
 
00:17:41.909 --> 00:17:41.919 align:start position:0%
about if that's possible I'm on page two
 
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
um at the top of the page the cost per
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
pupil okay thank you sorry to interrupt
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
mam chair thank
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the question
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
00:17:55.870 --> 00:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
um all expenditures should be included
 
00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
in the cost for people whether it's
 
00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.350 align:start position:0%
in the cost for people whether it's
transportation

00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:02.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's uh administrative costs it
 
00:18:04.590 --> 00:18:04.600 align:start position:0%
should all factor into the cost of
 
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
Education um for kids I think that's the
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
interest of the public follow so if you
 
00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
if you take all the costs like the
 
00:18:17.669 --> 00:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
special ed cost the transportation cost
 
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
which in some schools like karge was
 
00:18:23.789 --> 00:18:23.799 align:start position:0%
tremendous um and you add that in it
 
00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
really doesn't does it does it really
 
00:18:31.549 --> 00:18:31.559 align:start position:0%
give a cost per pupil uh in other words
 
00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
we're talking about how the the attend
 
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
the attendance the population of schools
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
is going
 
00:18:41.310 --> 00:18:41.320 align:start position:0%
down um but we also know that for
 
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
example some of the students that need
 
00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
more services is actually going up in
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
most of the school districts so how does
 
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
how does this cost per pupil really
 
00:18:54.909 --> 00:18:54.919 align:start position:0%
reflect that thank you for that question
 
00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
and and uh for bringing up that point
 
00:18:59.590 --> 00:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
that cost for pupil
 
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
um needs of students have increased
 
00:19:04.909 --> 00:19:04.919 align:start position:0%
needs of Staff have increased uh since
 
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
um the pandemic and
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
so we continually hear enrollments have
 
00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
declined enrollments have declined um
 
00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:15.549 align:start position:0%
declined enrollments have declined um
true

00:19:15.549 --> 00:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
statement what seems to be lost in those
 
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
statements are the individual needs that
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
have grown individual student needs that
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
have grown um and again I'm going to
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
repeat the invitation that I made
 
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:29.480 align:start position:0%
earlier if you haven't had the
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity to spend some time in your
 
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
local schools uh spend more than an hour
 
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
spend a week and see what those folks
 
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
are dealing with and you'll see um the
 
00:19:44.310 --> 00:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how better to say
 
00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:50.440 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
00:19:52.789 --> 00:19:52.799 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you thank you for taking my
 
00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
question I actually have two unrelated
 
00:19:59.270 --> 00:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
questions so the first one following up
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
on representative Tanner's inquiry about
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
the cost per people at the top of page
 
00:20:08.149 --> 00:20:08.159 align:start position:0%
two could you speak
 
00:20:08.159 --> 00:20:09.950 align:start position:0%
two could you speak
to

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
um the B and C Alternatives
 
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
there how would a district make a
 
00:20:20.870 --> 00:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable and good faith estimate or
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
how would doe do that that uh would you
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
agree that doesn't sound objective I
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
would agree that good faith is in beauty
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
is in the eyes of the beholder um you
 
00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
have information and and as a school
 
00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:37.640 align:start position:0%
leadership team or District leadership
 
00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
team we can say we've made a good Fe
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
good faith effort but um what what does
 
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.669 align:start position:0%
good faith effort but um what what does
that

00:20:44.669 --> 00:20:44.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
mean we can outline the pieces that have
 
00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
that have contributed to our effort but
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
we can't explain a
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
narrative because you can only do line
 
00:20:59.590 --> 00:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
graphs P line graphs and um our
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
charts representative Heath thank you
 
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:04.840 align:start position:0%

question representative Heath I would
 
00:21:32.149 --> 00:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
respectfully suggest that would be a
 
00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
question that the sponsors would need to
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
answer because I'm not certain um how
 
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:39.279 align:start position:0%

apologize representative I would have to
 
00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:12.679 align:start position:0%
consult with somebody in a higher pay
 
00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:14.480 align:start position:0%
grade than I to come up with the answer
 
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:16.600 align:start position:0%

questions representative Miler Madam
 
00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
chair could I encourage the members of
 
00:22:26.029 --> 00:22:26.039 align:start position:0%
the committee to pull the microphone
 
00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:29.440 align:start position:0%
close because of the noise over here
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
it's hard to hear so if we can get close
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
that would be good thank
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%

page
 
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.590 align:start position:0%
page
one

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:56.840 align:start position:0%
um I have some concerns about the
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
accuracy of the data that's presented
 
00:23:02.350 --> 00:23:02.360 align:start position:0%
there as a foundation for the bill um
 
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
for instance perhaps you have some
 
00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:07.640 align:start position:0%
awareness I'm looking at lines 11
 
00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:10.760 align:start position:0%
to13 which states that over two decades
 
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
cost per pupil has increased by 77%
 
00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:15.000 align:start position:0%
adjusted for inflation while teacher
 
00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:17.240 align:start position:0%
salaries have increased by only
 
00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
1% I wondering if you have any
 
00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
information on
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the question I did
 
00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
not back check that um so I I would be
 
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
comfortable commenting on it uh I would
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
suggest that maybe more research could
 
00:23:37.549 --> 00:23:37.559 align:start position:0%
be done with that I could say in a level
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
of with a level of confidence that the
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
adequacy cost per P per pupil uh over
 
00:23:47.909 --> 00:23:47.919 align:start position:0%
that same 10-year period
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
um didn't increase by a whole lot
 
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
either any further
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much Dr Fu
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.679 --> 00:24:15.510 align:start position:0%

00:24:19.310 --> 00:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
welcome oh can you turn your mic on
 
00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
please thank you chairman and members of
 
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:23.480 align:start position:0%
the education committee I appreciate
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
your time this morning thank you for
 
00:24:26.669 --> 00:24:26.679 align:start position:0%
mentioning about talking louder because
 
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
it is really hard to hear my name is
 
00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
Shannon McGinley I'm the executive
 
00:24:32.350 --> 00:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
director of Cornerstone action here in
 
00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:33.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and I come before you
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
today to ask for your support of
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
sb29 I'm going to jump to address some
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
of the comments and questions that have
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
been made here today uh this bill adds
 
00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:45.880 align:start position:0%
no great burden or inconvenience to
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
school districts RSA
 
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
991a colon 2 Roman numeral 2 already
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
requires that notice of meetings be
 
00:24:57.149 --> 00:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
physically posted in at least one place
 
00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
and RSA 991
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
1A colon 7 already provides injunctive
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
relief if that notice is not posted
 
00:25:06.549 --> 00:25:06.559 align:start position:0%
nothing about this procedure is
 
00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:07.990 align:start position:0%
nothing about this procedure is
fundamentally

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
fundamentally
 
00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:10.919 align:start position:0%
new our team has tested this process and
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
are able to create mockups for school
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
districts manually using info available
 
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:18.440 align:start position:0%
on the New Hampshire doe website in
 
00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:20.600 align:start position:0%
about 10 or 20 minutes by copying and
 
00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
pasting numbers into Excel any
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
suggestion that this will take up time
 
00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
and resources is simply false the
 
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:30.440 align:start position:0%
reality is is it will save Resources by
 
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:33.640 align:start position:0%
notifying the voters of
 
00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
waste it was mentioned earlier about um
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
the cost of the administration being
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
settled by the local school district but
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
much of that expense is also covered at
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
the state level so it is relevant for us
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
to engage in this
 
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
conversation it was also said that the
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
information that is provided on these
 
00:25:56.950 --> 00:25:56.960 align:start position:0%
chart charts is
 
00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
redundant no it is not the school
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
district presents does not present clear
 
00:26:04.909 --> 00:26:04.919 align:start position:0%
line graphs like this this information
 
00:26:07.389 --> 00:26:07.399 align:start position:0%
that is provided on the charts indicates
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
Trends over the course of time which the
 
00:26:12.789 --> 00:26:12.799 align:start position:0%
information on the State website does
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
not this the the bill is written to
 
00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
prevent the information from being
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
presented in a way that obscures the
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
reality of where the money is going why
 
00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:25.320 align:start position:0%
would we not want to make it easier for
 
00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:27.360 align:start position:0%
the voters to be able to see this
 
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
information and the
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
Trends if the only problem with this
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
bill is that the information is
 
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:34.840 align:start position:0%
redundant and that districts will have
 
00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
to spend 20 extra minutes making and
 
00:26:39.909 --> 00:26:39.919 align:start position:0%
printing the graph why did the teachers
 
00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:42.720 align:start position:0%
unions and other lobbyists so work so
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
hard against this bill in the Senate
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
because they know that this information
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
is new to the people it is clear to the
 
00:26:51.389 --> 00:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
people and to the
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
voters so I would suggest that it is not
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
any greater effort to be able to provide
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
this information in a way that is not in
 
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
the same way presented on the State
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
website I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
00:27:12.549 --> 00:27:12.559 align:start position:0%
and with that we conclude the hearing on
 
00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:16.320 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 219 and our next bill is
 
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:19.320 align:start position:0%
hearing is not scheduled until 10:15 so
 
00:27:27.149 --> 00:27:27.159 align:start position:0%

so today I'm here again to introduce 379
 
00:45:08.549 --> 00:45:08.559 align:start position:0%
this bill establishes a requirement for
 
00:45:10.990 --> 00:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
the placement and maintenance of our
 
00:45:12.829 --> 00:45:12.839 align:start position:0%
automatic external defibrillators and
 
00:45:16.150 --> 00:45:16.160 align:start position:0%
requires individuals trained in CPR to
 
00:45:20.549 --> 00:45:20.559 align:start position:0%
supervise School sponsored events so the
 
00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
school sponsored sports sporting events
 
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
by way of background I'm a paramedic and
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
actually my entrance into medicine
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
outside of the hospital where I spent my
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
career was actually in high school um I
 
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
had this interest I wasn't sure exactly
 
00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to do and so I started
 
00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
working as a student athletic trainer uh
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
got basic first aid responding to
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
emergencies on the field um and that was
 
00:45:49.109 --> 00:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
I mean that was in what 198 you know
 
00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
1979 1980 showing my age now things have
 
00:45:55.309 --> 00:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
really um matured and progressed since
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
then and what we are able to do outside
 
00:46:00.069 --> 00:46:00.079 align:start position:0%
the hospital and do as a team and as a
 
00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:03.400 align:start position:0%
community so I have witnessed with that
 
00:46:05.069 --> 00:46:05.079 align:start position:0%
experience as well as my experience as a
 
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:08.920 align:start position:0%
paramedic and as as developing and
 
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:10.760 align:start position:0%
operating trauma systems of care
 
00:46:13.230 --> 00:46:13.240 align:start position:0%
including trauma trauma resuscitations
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
I've witnessed the value of the training
 
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
firsthand when managing these situations
 
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
that require a resuscitation of a
 
00:46:23.069 --> 00:46:23.079 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrest someone whose heart has
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
stopped beating and they are not
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
breathing each member of the responding
 
00:46:32.109 --> 00:46:32.119 align:start position:0%
team needs to know their role knows what
 
00:46:33.870 --> 00:46:33.880 align:start position:0%
the life-saving objectives that need to
 
00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:36.119 align:start position:0%
be achieved and work in a coordinated
 
00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
effort proven to be lifes saving and a
 
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:42.559 align:start position:0%
example that we can put right on the
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
table and uh you know I'm a late in life
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
football fan and a late in life coffee
 
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
drinker but I was watching the game on
 
00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
January was January 2 of a Monday Night
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
Football when Demar Hamlin suffered his
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrest and I have this kind of
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
place in my kitchen I call it the perch
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
where I watch from the breakfast bar my
 
00:47:01.349 --> 00:47:01.359 align:start position:0%
husband's in front of the TV and I
 
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
remember the way he went down and I said
 
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:05.680 align:start position:0%
that's not you know like he's
 
00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:08.200 align:start position:0%
unconscious okay he was unconscious his
 
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
heart stopped beating he was not
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
breathing and we've heard the story
 
00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
since then but what this proved to us is
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
that that whole medical team everybody
 
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
knew what they needed to do when this
 
00:47:21.670 --> 00:47:21.680 align:start position:0%
type of situation happened it's the
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
worst situation it is unexpected but
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
when it does happen if everybody lines
 
00:47:29.630 --> 00:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
up and knows what they need to do we can
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
actually save lives and there's a just a
 
00:47:35.069 --> 00:47:35.079 align:start position:0%
perfect example of how this happened and
 
00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
this athlete is not only back on the
 
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
field but he's talking about how these
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
coordinated efforts make a difference
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
now I know I have folks here from the
 
00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:44.640 align:start position:0%
Heart Association today that will shed
 
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
more light on cardiac arrest and cardiac
 
00:47:49.710 --> 00:47:49.720 align:start position:0%
arrest resuscitation uh but just a few
 
00:47:52.589 --> 00:47:52.599 align:start position:0%
other things before um I wrap and take
 
00:47:55.270 --> 00:47:55.280 align:start position:0%
questions is that um you may recall that
 
00:47:59.549 --> 00:47:59.559 align:start position:0%
in 2021 Senator G Canon um put to he he
 
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:01.400 align:start position:0%
passed legislation and I was actually a
 
00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
new Senator and worked with him that put
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
Lo he put local boards or school
 
00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
districts and their boards or the
 
00:48:11.190 --> 00:48:11.200 align:start position:0%
governing body of each of each body of
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
each public and nonpublic school that
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
includes grades 4 through 12 that they
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
have an emergency action plan so they
 
00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
have a plan I was also back in my days
 
00:48:22.829 --> 00:48:22.839 align:start position:0%
when I was the chief of Emergency
 
00:48:25.549 --> 00:48:25.559 align:start position:0%
Medical Services we had an initiative
 
00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
here and I sat on the AED commission
 
00:48:29.390 --> 00:48:29.400 align:start position:0%
which was established by the legislature
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
and has now since sunsetted to make sure
 
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:35.240 align:start position:0%
to find ways to fund we had a large gift
 
00:48:37.790 --> 00:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
to get this started but but on top of
 
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
that to fund putting automatic external
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
defibrillators I clearly have not had
 
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
enough coffee I was with my daughter at
 
00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
the Boston Marathon yesterday so it was
 
00:48:47.670 --> 00:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
a little bit of a long day very proud
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
she ran that 26 miles um to put an AED
 
00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
in every school okay and we were able to
 
00:48:58.190 --> 00:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
accomplish that and actually even though
 
00:48:59.910 --> 00:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
this isn't a school setting there's an
 
00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
AED on every floor and I believe that
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
you representative leakas were
 
00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
responsible for getting that done we
 
00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:08.680 align:start position:0%
have them in the state house um and we
 
00:49:10.990 --> 00:49:11.000 align:start position:0%
have them you know almost everywhere
 
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
It's Not Unusual to see them in an
 
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
airport but the reason is because we
 
00:49:17.349 --> 00:49:17.359 align:start position:0%
know that time matters okay so I've had
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
this experience of working to get these
 
00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
into the schools we have a plan but
 
00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
taking this just one step further is
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
that when you have a plan you actually
 
00:49:28.430 --> 00:49:28.440 align:start position:0%
have to drill that plan so we know at
 
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
schools that there are fire drills so
 
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
that folks the children and the staff
 
00:49:35.230 --> 00:49:35.240 align:start position:0%
and the teachers know how to respond we
 
00:49:36.829 --> 00:49:36.839 align:start position:0%
also know unfortunately we have active
 
00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
shooter drills so again people know how
 
00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
to respond in my business as a paramedic
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
and working in trauma resuscitation we
 
00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
would practice our responses so that we
 
00:49:49.910 --> 00:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
could say you know take we would save
 
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:53.720 align:start position:0%
time execute identify where we needed if
 
00:49:56.030 --> 00:49:56.040 align:start position:0%
we needed any changes or updates
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
additional training and then move
 
00:50:00.549 --> 00:50:00.559 align:start position:0%
forward so if this ever happened which
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
we don't want it to happen we were ready
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
to go so the aeds are there we have the
 
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:09.559 align:start position:0%
staff and as I understand that there's
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
some athletic trainers that are here
 
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
with us but they are coaching staff
 
00:50:14.309 --> 00:50:14.319 align:start position:0%
there's somebody within the coaching
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
staff and the athletic training staff
 
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:18.559 align:start position:0%
that already are required to have CPR so
 
00:50:21.069 --> 00:50:21.079 align:start position:0%
we have folks that are CPR trained and
 
00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:23.960 align:start position:0%
we have a plan and we have the AED so
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
now let's put all of these things
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
together make sure everybody knows what
 
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%
to do so I appreciate the opportunity to
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
introduce 379 I'm hoping that we can
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
bring this um I can gain your support
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
and we can get this out of committee
 
00:50:40.150 --> 00:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
with an a to pass certainly I'm open to
 
00:50:42.670 --> 00:50:42.680 align:start position:0%
any questions you might have thank you
 
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:45.720 align:start position:0%

Apprentice uh are you willing to take
 
00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:53.240 align:start position:0%
questions absolutely represent
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
leus can you ex oh first thank you for
 
00:50:58.789 --> 00:50:58.799 align:start position:0%
taking my question and thank you for
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
putting this in and I absolutely
 
00:51:04.750 --> 00:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
love not locked in a whatever within one
 
00:51:07.190 --> 00:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
you know it's awesome I just have a
 
00:51:10.829 --> 00:51:10.839 align:start position:0%
question about H which is require that
 
00:51:14.589 --> 00:51:14.599 align:start position:0%
an individual trained in CPR supervise
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
organized School sponsored sports
 
00:51:18.549 --> 00:51:18.559 align:start position:0%
activities and I'm wondering if you can
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
tell me what you mean by that supervise
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
the activities so thank you U
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative leas for the question and
 
00:51:28.390 --> 00:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
that's come up before and that might be
 
00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:30.880 align:start position:0%
an area that uh we need to Tinker with
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
because the I the the process is that
 
00:51:36.789 --> 00:51:36.799 align:start position:0%
there needs to be or the thinking is
 
00:51:38.990 --> 00:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
that there needs to be somebody who is
 
00:51:42.150 --> 00:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
CPR trained who is at a school sponsored
 
00:51:45.309 --> 00:51:45.319 align:start position:0%
sporting event that can be part of not
 
00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
only conducting the training but you
 
00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:50.960 align:start position:0%
know responsible for at least initiating
 
00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:52.480 align:start position:0%
the resuscitation efforts until the
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
medical folks get there but there seems
 
00:51:55.750 --> 00:51:55.760 align:start position:0%
to be this question that's come up
 
00:51:57.990 --> 00:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
before about what exactly are these
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
events and what should this look like
 
00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
okay so I don't think it fully answers
 
00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
your question but it is on my mind thank
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome further questions
 
00:52:09.789 --> 00:52:09.799 align:start position:0%
from the committee represent Miler thank
 
00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:11.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for being here
 
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
could you tell us how much does one of
 
00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
these units cost thank you
 
00:52:17.349 --> 00:52:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative Miler for your question
 
00:52:21.710 --> 00:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
so you can a an AED can run anywhere
 
00:52:23.789 --> 00:52:23.799 align:start position:0%
from $1,000 to
 
00:52:28.030 --> 00:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
$1,500 up to $ 3500 00 they are very
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
public friendly in fact I don't know if
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
the state does this anymore but for a
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
number of years the department of safety
 
00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
working with purchase and um plants
 
00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
purchase and property had they would go
 
00:52:42.630 --> 00:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
out every year and they would bid for um
 
00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
the defibrillator contract and then
 
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
publicize this so that entities could
 
00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
come in like school systems and get a
 
00:52:51.549 --> 00:52:51.559 align:start position:0%
defibrillator automatic exteral
 
00:52:55.190 --> 00:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
defibrillator that was safe ready to go
 
00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
at the at a at a reasonable price thank
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
penell thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I just want to um
 
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
this came up in the last hearing I just
 
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
want to make a quick reminder that it's
 
00:53:10.990 --> 00:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
hard to hear over the noise it was
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
easier when I was chering U anyway my
 
00:53:16.789 --> 00:53:16.799 align:start position:0%
question is how do you envision this
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
looking on a at a school where multiple
 
00:53:22.390 --> 00:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
practices are occurring because I'm sure
 
00:53:24.349 --> 00:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
these emergency events occur during
 
00:53:27.630 --> 00:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
practice as well as during a game
 
00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:29.799 align:start position:0%
thank you representative P
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
Pon real Pell P I know you schooled me
 
00:53:35.549 --> 00:53:35.559 align:start position:0%
last week and see we're already not
 
00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:38.440 align:start position:0%
there um great question I'm going to ask
 
00:53:40.150 --> 00:53:40.160 align:start position:0%
that the athletic trainers help to
 
00:53:42.030 --> 00:53:42.040 align:start position:0%
answer that question because you're you
 
00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:44.000 align:start position:0%
know a smaller school might have you
 
00:53:45.710 --> 00:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
know one practice taking place but there
 
00:53:47.829 --> 00:53:47.839 align:start position:0%
are larger schools that will have
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
multiple um and so it's my I don't it's
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
my intention and understanding that
 
00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
there is a plan to manage that entire
 
00:53:58.870 --> 00:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
field but I think that they can speak
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
best from the firsthand experience so if
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
you can hold that that would be great
 
00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:05.720 align:start position:0%
further questions represented Tanner
 
00:54:07.190 --> 00:54:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for bringing
 
00:54:10.109 --> 00:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
this forward I think it's really a an
 
00:54:14.829 --> 00:54:14.839 align:start position:0%
important um Bill we at school districts
 
00:54:17.750 --> 00:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
we have been doing emergency planning a
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
lot of emergency planning for evacuation
 
00:54:22.789 --> 00:54:22.799 align:start position:0%
fire drills and that sort of thing and
 
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
and to a certain extent I think that
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
that um sports injuries have been um
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
really uh addressed a lot by uh
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
certifying coaches and and certainly an
 
00:54:38.910 --> 00:54:38.920 align:start position:0%
athletic trainer that over oversees the
 
00:54:40.829 --> 00:54:40.839 align:start position:0%
extracurricular or
 
00:54:44.309 --> 00:54:44.319 align:start position:0%
co-curricular um sporting program um but
 
00:54:46.589 --> 00:54:46.599 align:start position:0%
I think as uh representative petrell has
 
00:54:48.309 --> 00:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
said that you know there are a lot of
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
sporting events that go on at a at a
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
school and other events like theater and
 
00:54:54.270 --> 00:54:54.280 align:start position:0%
and you know where you get the outside
 
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
public and sometimes we've had I know
 
00:54:58.829 --> 00:54:58.839 align:start position:0%
when I was teaching we had um couple
 
00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:01.799 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrests that that uh came from
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
people coming into the building as well
 
00:55:05.190 --> 00:55:05.200 align:start position:0%
as people in the building as well as
 
00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
staff or students so you know it's it's
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
pretty um pretty comprehensive so I
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
think that um the plan should include
 
00:55:16.470 --> 00:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
the AED you know throughout the whole
 
00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:19.040 align:start position:0%
building not just the this the sports
 
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
aspect um I I noticed that you had the
 
00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.430 align:start position:0%
aspect um I I noticed that you had the
the

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:27.400 align:start position:0%
main the main purpose of this or the
 
00:55:30.029 --> 00:55:30.039 align:start position:0%
main direction of this was to the to the
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
local school board but I would say that
 
00:55:34.510 --> 00:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
the school nurse and the athletic
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
director are probably the two key people
 
00:55:39.230 --> 00:55:39.240 align:start position:0%
and um maybe the local school board
 
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
would would have them you know as as the
 
00:55:44.270 --> 00:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
people that they direct to set up this
 
00:55:45.870 --> 00:55:45.880 align:start position:0%
program but certainly they're the most
 
00:55:48.029 --> 00:55:48.039 align:start position:0%
qualified within the in the school
 
00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:50.960 align:start position:0%
district to do that and I'd almost say
 
00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
that um I would like to see that pointed
 
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:57.280 align:start position:0%
out as far as the local school board
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
with the direction of the school nursing
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
staff and the school nurse staff and the
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
athletic director um so that it's it's
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
uh you know comprehensive okay okay you
 
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if that's a question or
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
not but
 
00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
that thank you yeah are you are you
 
00:56:19.029 --> 00:56:19.039 align:start position:0%
finished Senator all all's just G may I
 
00:56:20.589 --> 00:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
just quickly respond back briefly thank
 
00:56:22.349 --> 00:56:22.359 align:start position:0%
you so much representative L um
 
00:56:24.109 --> 00:56:24.119 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner one of the things
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
that this so I think your points about
 
00:56:28.349 --> 00:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
um you know School nurses and athletic
 
00:56:30.510 --> 00:56:30.520 align:start position:0%
directors how that go Works down and
 
00:56:32.230 --> 00:56:32.240 align:start position:0%
coordinates at their level many times
 
00:56:33.789 --> 00:56:33.799 align:start position:0%
the School nurses are there just
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
respectfully it's a big job during the
 
00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
day where the athletic uh staff is there
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
more so after hours and on weekends and
 
00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:42.039 align:start position:0%
that can be different given the district
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
but something you point out it's
 
00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
addressed in this bill but I think it's
 
00:56:47.750 --> 00:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
important to note um that the AED can't
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
be locked up in one particular place um
 
00:56:52.950 --> 00:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
and because these have become so
 
00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:55.000 align:start position:0%
incredibly affordable we're finding
 
00:56:56.990 --> 00:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
multiple aeds at school so the athletic
 
00:56:58.670 --> 00:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
staff may have one that just goes with
 
00:57:01.950 --> 00:57:01.960 align:start position:0%
them but it's very U during my tenure in
 
00:57:03.789 --> 00:57:03.799 align:start position:0%
doing this type of work I tried to
 
00:57:06.549 --> 00:57:06.559 align:start position:0%
respect the um the you know the I call
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
it like the brick and mor of the
 
00:57:09.549 --> 00:57:09.559 align:start position:0%
building but really encourage that folks
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
don't lock up like life-saving equipment
 
00:57:13.789 --> 00:57:13.799 align:start position:0%
in places where people can't get to it
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
when they need it so I thank you for
 
00:57:17.349 --> 00:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
raising that point represent Damon you
 
00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
had your hand up and then represent
 
00:57:21.069 --> 00:57:21.079 align:start position:0%
Terry thank you Mr chair my question
 
00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:22.880 align:start position:0%
follows thank you for taking my question
 
00:57:24.750 --> 00:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
Senator follows what you were just
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
saying which the bill language says if
 
00:57:31.789 --> 00:57:31.799 align:start position:0%
the school has aeds can you inform us
 
00:57:36.309 --> 00:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
about how common is it to all have aeds
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
and if not would you entertain an
 
00:57:40.349 --> 00:57:40.359 align:start position:0%
amendment requiring schools to have them
 
00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:43.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you representative Damon so
 
00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:45.760 align:start position:0%
there is an AED so we don't require
 
00:57:48.069 --> 00:57:48.079 align:start position:0%
schools to have aeds but what we did is
 
00:57:50.430 --> 00:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
set up a commission um it was in
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
2002 um and I was working back as the
 
00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:54.640 align:start position:0%
chief of Emergency Medical Services
 
00:57:56.549 --> 00:57:56.559 align:start position:0%
during that time this Commission was set
 
00:57:58.069 --> 00:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
up to take a large gift given to the
 
00:58:00.630 --> 00:58:00.640 align:start position:0%
state as well as look for other funding
 
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:03.559 align:start position:0%
to put aeds in schools so that everybody
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
had access to one because you know at
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
that time even though it was still there
 
00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
were these very affordable units it's
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
was a reach for some of the smaller
 
00:58:15.309 --> 00:58:15.319 align:start position:0%
districts so uh we worked to get an AED
 
00:58:18.109 --> 00:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
in every school stepping short of
 
00:58:22.109 --> 00:58:22.119 align:start position:0%
mandating that now the a every AED
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
including in a school has to be
 
00:58:26.710 --> 00:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
registered with 911 and that's the best
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
place to locate the list of automatic
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
external defibrillators and there's
 
00:58:33.910 --> 00:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
somebody that actually works at the New
 
00:58:36.190 --> 00:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire fire academy who supports the
 
00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
school systems in this so it's I'm
 
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
comfortable in saying that they exist in
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
every school I just can't tell you
 
00:58:47.150 --> 00:58:47.160 align:start position:0%
exactly where they're located 911 could
 
00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh but the purpose I think it's
 
00:58:50.349 --> 00:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
important to get out of the the building
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
and make sure it's on the field and
 
00:58:56.910 --> 00:58:56.920 align:start position:0%
available thank you represent Terry so
 
00:58:59.069 --> 00:58:59.079 align:start position:0%
do I understand uh just a follow and
 
00:59:01.710 --> 00:59:01.720 align:start position:0%
then my own question if I might so do I
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
understand your response to
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
representative Damon's question that
 
00:59:10.470 --> 00:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
aeds are not required by state law but
 
00:59:13.270 --> 00:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
that it is your view that most school
 
00:59:16.910 --> 00:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
districts have aeds as a matter of good
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
policy shall we say that is my
 
00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
understanding okay so thank you my um I
 
00:59:24.870 --> 00:59:24.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the illustration that you
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
gave with respect to the football league
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
and um sure that um we're all aware that
 
00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
the a sports professional sports
 
00:59:35.430 --> 00:59:35.440 align:start position:0%
organization such as the NFL would have
 
00:59:37.589 --> 00:59:37.599 align:start position:0%
such a policy in place I would expect
 
00:59:38.990 --> 00:59:39.000 align:start position:0%
the same for the other professional
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
sports uh leagues and uh to the the NCAA
 
00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:47.960 align:start position:0%
as well so um my question to you is with
 
00:59:50.870 --> 00:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
what you're proposing in this uh in this
 
00:59:54.109 --> 00:59:54.119 align:start position:0%
legislation would would this make uh New
 
00:59:57.150 --> 00:59:57.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a a leader or or a follower
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
shall we say in terms of of uh enacting
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
these kinds of requirements and I'm all
 
01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:06.079 align:start position:0%
in favor of uh being a leader when uh
 
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
something good is about to happen but
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering uh have you been in
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
conversation or done any research with
 
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
respect to how these kinds of concerns
 
01:00:16.670 --> 01:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
are being addressed in um in other
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
states in the country thank you for the
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
question representative Terry um yes and
 
01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:24.559 align:start position:0%
in fact we would become the leader um
 
01:00:27.549 --> 01:00:27.559 align:start position:0%
and you'll I believe we'll hear from the
 
01:00:31.270 --> 01:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
Corey Stringer Institute that is you
 
01:00:33.630 --> 01:00:33.640 align:start position:0%
know the lead you know a leading um
 
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
organization in our country around
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
Sports safety and with all of the
 
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:40.280 align:start position:0%
different pieces now together having
 
01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
aeds C you know CPR training and action
 
01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
plan and requiring the drilling of that
 
01:00:47.829 --> 01:00:47.839 align:start position:0%
plan puts us in puts us out as the
 
01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
leader in this country thank you you're
 
01:00:52.029 --> 01:00:52.039 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you represent
 
01:00:54.349 --> 01:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
belshire thank you Mr chair and thank
 
01:00:57.029 --> 01:00:57.039 align:start position:0%
you for being here this morning um first
 
01:00:59.309 --> 01:00:59.319 align:start position:0%
off I'm I'm hugely supportive of the
 
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:02.200 align:start position:0%
concept of of getting aeds out
 
01:01:04.190 --> 01:01:04.200 align:start position:0%
especially linking in the sports teams
 
01:01:06.349 --> 01:01:06.359 align:start position:0%
especially given the the apparent
 
01:01:07.950 --> 01:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
increase in cardiac conditions we've
 
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
seen in young athletes in recent years
 
01:01:12.150 --> 01:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
so my question though is a little bit of
 
01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:14.440 align:start position:0%
language might it seems to me might be
 
01:01:15.870 --> 01:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
cleaned up a little bit so I wanted to
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
ask you about what methodology you would
 
01:01:20.710 --> 01:01:20.720 align:start position:0%
you envision when it comes to um the
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
three minute within the three minute
 
01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:24.520 align:start position:0%
rule of being available what what kind
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
of methodology do you think should be
 
01:01:29.470 --> 01:01:29.480 align:start position:0%
employed to establish whether that can
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
be on site is it is it uh should they
 
01:01:34.069 --> 01:01:34.079 align:start position:0%
physically going through a test where
 
01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:36.039 align:start position:0%
they're walking from one location to
 
01:01:38.309 --> 01:01:38.319 align:start position:0%
another with a stopwatch or or what what
 
01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
do you envision there thank you
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
representative beler so we use the three
 
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
minute Mark as you know start like where
 
01:01:47.430 --> 01:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
the clock starts on our ability to save
 
01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:49.400 align:start position:0%
lives number one so thank you for
 
01:01:51.309 --> 01:01:51.319 align:start position:0%
bringing that up um in cardiac breast
 
01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:55.119 align:start position:0%
situations number two is by taking
 
01:01:57.349 --> 01:01:57.359 align:start position:0%
making sure that the
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
naed is available in the athletic
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
setting first of all in the schools but
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
in the athletic setting and having it
 
01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
close by will start to start to again
 
01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
methodology drive that window down and
 
01:02:12.589 --> 01:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
lastly if everybody knows what they have
 
01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
to do where it is and what they have to
 
01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:18.039 align:start position:0%
do it will also from a methodology
 
01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:20.279 align:start position:0%
perspective start to keep that as close
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
as we can to three minutes does that
 
01:02:24.549 --> 01:02:24.559 align:start position:0%
answer your question if I may that
 
01:02:26.109 --> 01:02:26.119 align:start position:0%
that's all good information but I I was
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
thinking more nuts and bolts is how do
 
01:02:30.430 --> 01:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
we establish if it's actually capable of
 
01:02:32.109 --> 01:02:32.119 align:start position:0%
getting there in 3 minutes so if it's if
 
01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
it's somewhere in a building in a room
 
01:02:37.269 --> 01:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
and the school is going to say well that
 
01:02:38.269 --> 01:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
we can get that there within three
 
01:02:39.870 --> 01:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
minutes how should they test that should
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
they actually get the stopwatch out and
 
01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
watch walk it over thank you uh
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
represent beler great question again
 
01:02:47.710 --> 01:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
making sure first of all that it's not
 
01:02:50.309 --> 01:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
in a room and bringing it to where it
 
01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be is going to be is going to
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
be the first point but they can they can
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
test any way they want including using a
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
stopwatch I mean it is if I may just
 
01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:02.839 align:start position:0%
give illustrate ever so quickly that you
 
01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:05.240 align:start position:0%
know in doing so um trauma
 
01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
resuscitations so that's been the work
 
01:03:10.589 --> 01:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
that I do is you know managing systems
 
01:03:13.269 --> 01:03:13.279 align:start position:0%
of trauma care and when we would
 
01:03:15.829 --> 01:03:15.839 align:start position:0%
actually drill in either the simulation
 
01:03:17.589 --> 01:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
lab or actually in the emergency
 
01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
department and we would time our
 
01:03:22.470 --> 01:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
responses from when the ambulance hit
 
01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
the door to getting them in the bed to
 
01:03:27.510 --> 01:03:27.520 align:start position:0%
when the tests were ordered to make sure
 
01:03:29.190 --> 01:03:29.200 align:start position:0%
that the standards that were put forward
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
that we were able to meet those so that
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
is an example of how it's done because
 
01:03:35.789 --> 01:03:35.799 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's been well that's
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
been the standard in that setting so
 
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
it's bringing that to this setting in
 
01:03:43.589 --> 01:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
the athletic and on the athletic FS so I
 
01:03:44.789 --> 01:03:44.799 align:start position:0%
think between both of those questions
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully are answers I got you where
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
you need to be but I I appreciate your
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
question welcome Senator Apprentice um
 
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:54.839 align:start position:0%
we we can't hear on this side when
 
01:03:58.029 --> 01:03:58.039 align:start position:0%
you're not speaking into the mic so I am
 
01:03:59.789 --> 01:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
so sorry so just we were talking about
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
different ways to actually
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
test but it was difficult so sorry
 
01:04:07.950 --> 01:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
because of the we got I know across the
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
street sorry represent
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
Woodcock good morning Senator thank you
 
01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:14.920 align:start position:0%
for for being here um I appreciate the
 
01:04:17.109 --> 01:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
bill others if I could follow up on what
 
01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:19.480 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner highlighted um I
 
01:04:22.269 --> 01:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
say that because having been a college
 
01:04:24.750 --> 01:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
athletic director for a while um I
 
01:04:26.269 --> 01:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
understand the issues
 
01:04:27.950 --> 01:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh and also being high school principal
 
01:04:30.870 --> 01:04:30.880 align:start position:0%
that what happen to school and most the
 
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
ones I've seen at last summer at the JB
 
01:04:35.549 --> 01:04:35.559 align:start position:0%
football scrimmage uh it was the
 
01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:37.720 align:start position:0%
grandfather went down yeah when I saw at
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
the high school was the grandfather or
 
01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:41.599 align:start position:0%
grandmother in the watching this the
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
performance in the auditorium so I'm
 
01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
wondering if this and I I support
 
01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
athletic part I'm with you I'm just
 
01:04:50.390 --> 01:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if we shouldn't have it at all
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
events instead of say just all sports
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
activities all School sponsor events
 
01:04:56.390 --> 01:04:56.400 align:start position:0%
because I'm guessing that the of those
 
01:04:59.309 --> 01:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
injur that that would require an AED are
 
01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
not necessarily athletes at the junior
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
high and high school level there may be
 
01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:05.240 align:start position:0%
an occasional hot issue but um these are
 
01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
probably The Spectators and parents and
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
grandparents that are there still in the
 
01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:09.480 align:start position:0%
building or teacher the staff
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
considering how they aging and some
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
places um so may maybe that's that's a
 
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
thought and the second one is that if
 
01:05:17.430 --> 01:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
that was so you what you're thinking of
 
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
that that was sort of that addressment
 
01:05:23.269 --> 01:05:23.279 align:start position:0%
the line H and the the other one was um
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned if I may follow up Mr
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
chair yes thank you um I'm concerned
 
01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
about the uh in 18 sen other words the
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
school will regular check um it reminds
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
me of the regulation we have now the
 
01:05:36.870 --> 01:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
principal walks around the brilliant end
 
01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
of the year and checks on the HVAC
 
01:05:40.349 --> 01:05:40.359 align:start position:0%
system and they just check it off until
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
you know we still have air coming in um
 
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm wondering if there if there
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
shouldn't I don't know who that is who
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
what that means who in the school or
 
01:05:50.910 --> 01:05:50.920 align:start position:0%
agency I'm not sure anyone in our school
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
uh would be able to do anything with the
 
01:05:54.870 --> 01:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturers the train is absolutely
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
they know what they're doing the top
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
notch I mean in a regular school setting
 
01:06:00.789 --> 01:06:00.799 align:start position:0%
um if that's an annual piece I don't
 
01:06:02.230 --> 01:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
know how we Define that do you have any
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
thoughts on that just trying to make it
 
01:06:06.309 --> 01:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
better I'm not trying to kill no no so
 
01:06:08.829 --> 01:06:08.839 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Woodcock and
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh one of the most important things that
 
01:06:13.510 --> 01:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
we actually can do besides putting the
 
01:06:17.029 --> 01:06:17.039 align:start position:0%
system in place tying all of these uh
 
01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
pieces together is making sure that when
 
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
the equipment is needed it's ready to go
 
01:06:24.269 --> 01:06:24.279 align:start position:0%
um and just like at the beginning of
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
like every ambulance shift you would
 
01:06:28.269 --> 01:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
make sure that you know everything was
 
01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
working and if it wasn't then you made
 
01:06:32.549 --> 01:06:32.559 align:start position:0%
sure that it was so that you could
 
01:06:35.990 --> 01:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately respond I mean we so we
 
01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:40.039 align:start position:0%
could drill down and you know require
 
01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
that the school is part of their action
 
01:06:43.150 --> 01:06:43.160 align:start position:0%
plan I and I might need to go back and
 
01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:46.200 align:start position:0%
look at the plan um has a specific
 
01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
design so if we want to put that
 
01:06:49.750 --> 01:06:49.760 align:start position:0%
language in there that it just becomes I
 
01:06:52.750 --> 01:06:52.760 align:start position:0%
am I I've never been a school teacher
 
01:06:55.109 --> 01:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
God God bless um and but I have been a
 
01:06:58.029 --> 01:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
student an athletic trainer shouldn't we
 
01:07:01.870 --> 01:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
uh make sure like give them the uh the
 
01:07:03.789 --> 01:07:03.799 align:start position:0%
guard rails to get this done without
 
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
telling them exactly when they can you
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
do it but put somebody in charge and
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
what the basic requirements are one of
 
01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
the things I found with the schools is
 
01:07:12.269 --> 01:07:12.279 align:start position:0%
that they all share this information
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
like some schools have an actual
 
01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:15.400 align:start position:0%
checklist and they you know there's
 
01:07:17.349 --> 01:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
things that they go in terms of checking
 
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:18.640 align:start position:0%
lock you know certain doors that need to
 
01:07:21.549 --> 01:07:21.559 align:start position:0%
be locked um alarm systems are in place
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
and oh stop at the AED and make sure the
 
01:07:27.510 --> 01:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
pads have not expired that the machine
 
01:07:29.789 --> 01:07:29.799 align:start position:0%
is accessible that the batteries are in
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
date and are ready to go and they have
 
01:07:33.390 --> 01:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
like a checklist that they go through
 
01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
and then that checklist could be saved
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
and kept in a in a nurse's office or in
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
a athletic trainer's office wherever the
 
01:07:42.789 --> 01:07:42.799 align:start position:0%
AED ends up being I don't know if that
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
helps get there but I think we could I'm
 
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
keeping a list of the things that we
 
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
could maybe be more directive on um and
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to work with the member of
 
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
this committee and getting that done
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your comments
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
you're welcome thank you Senator penis I
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
have a couple questions for you here uh
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
in previous testimony did you was there
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
anything given to this bill from
 
01:08:05.470 --> 01:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
nhiaa New Hampshire inter Scholastic
 
01:08:08.470 --> 01:08:08.480 align:start position:0%
Athletic Association did they testify be
 
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:11.720 align:start position:0%
for or against really testing my memory
 
01:08:14.349 --> 01:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
back to early January I can pull the he
 
01:08:15.430 --> 01:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
oh you know what wait a minute I have
 
01:08:18.110 --> 01:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
the hearing report so I don't remember
 
01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:20.480 align:start position:0%
them being here being there but that
 
01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:23.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean let's see Cory Stringer
 
01:08:25.110 --> 01:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
Institute athletic trainer kobby Sawyer
 
01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.829 align:start position:0%
Institute athletic trainer kobby Sawyer
College

01:08:26.829 --> 01:08:26.839 align:start position:0%
College
 
01:08:28.510 --> 01:08:28.520 align:start position:0%
uh government relations for the Heart
 
01:08:31.510 --> 01:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
Association so I'm not they did not
 
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
testify um okay although they may have
 
01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
signed in I just don't have a list of
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
the individuals okay so I have some
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
followup questions then um I'm looking
 
01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:43.000 align:start position:0%
at if the school has a
 
01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
aeds um so that just wipes out those
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
that don't and that's that's a concern
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
to me I think this is an important issue
 
01:08:54.110 --> 01:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
where there should be aeds beable period
 
01:08:57.149 --> 01:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
um and I noticed not that on item number
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
three on line 24 the AED should be on
 
01:09:05.309 --> 01:09:05.319 align:start position:0%
site I would say it shall be on site and
 
01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
the reasoning behind that is you're very
 
01:09:09.590 --> 01:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
familiar with the town that I'm
 
01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
from and been there and probably got a
 
01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:14.600 align:start position:0%
lot of training there the community
 
01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
Athletic Field is not part of the high
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
school and so it's a separate facility
 
01:09:21.030 --> 01:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
you're never going to get up that school
 
01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
within three minutes um so that's one
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
issue should it be
 
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
on site where and the other issue I have
 
01:09:32.229 --> 01:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
you the third question would be why is
 
01:09:35.829 --> 01:09:35.839 align:start position:0%
this to be initiated in September 1 2024
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
after the athletic season starts August
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
1 and that's when it's the hottest out
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
there that's when it's likely to have
 
01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:45.400 align:start position:0%
some issues going on um so that's that's
 
01:09:48.789 --> 01:09:48.799 align:start position:0%
a consideration we may want to and I
 
01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
realize this is
 
01:09:53.829 --> 01:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
a kind of a you might say unfunded
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
mandate if you require it but from what
 
01:09:59.149 --> 01:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
I gather from your initial conversation
 
01:10:03.229 --> 01:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
at $1,000 to $1,500 per
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
AED uh maybe at Max of
 
01:10:09.189 --> 01:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
$3,500 I I think that it might be
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
Pennywise pound foolish you know not go
 
01:10:14.110 --> 01:10:14.120 align:start position:0%
that direction of requiring them so if
 
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:15.239 align:start position:0%
you could ask the other questions I
 
01:10:16.750 --> 01:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate it
 
01:10:19.350 --> 01:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
so would your question so I think we've
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
got the Scholastic Association who got
 
01:10:23.590 --> 01:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
to find get their position on this and
 
01:10:26.070 --> 01:10:26.080 align:start position:0%
they may be here to testified today I
 
01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at the sheet I wouldn't I
 
01:10:30.669 --> 01:10:30.679 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know or it would be hard for me
 
01:10:32.030 --> 01:10:32.040 align:start position:0%
to understand why they wouldn't be
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
supportive of this where many of the
 
01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
sports medicine School sports medicine
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
organizations are but In fairness I will
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
check on that second is should versus
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
shall so uh representative lad I think
 
01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:45.719 align:start position:0%
they should be they sh I think there
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
should be a shall but I'm also sensitive
 
01:10:50.070 --> 01:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
to saying you shall have an AED you
 
01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:52.120 align:start position:0%
shall put it here we know that this
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
works it is being um
 
01:10:58.030 --> 01:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
it's like being cautious around the
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
Mandate issue but at the same time these
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
have become much more affordable and
 
01:11:07.110 --> 01:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
they are in New Hampshire schools so we
 
01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:12.280 align:start position:0%
could put sh versus should um that um
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
that is you know I think that's up for
 
01:11:16.030 --> 01:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
discussion U and then the startup time
 
01:11:17.310 --> 01:11:17.320 align:start position:0%
on this I was just trying to build
 
01:11:19.669 --> 01:11:19.679 align:start position:0%
you're right the the season where
 
01:11:21.630 --> 01:11:21.640 align:start position:0%
student athletes in particular are
 
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
getting ready for football field hockey
 
01:11:26.910 --> 01:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
soccer whatever it is they're doing in
 
01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:28.920 align:start position:0%
the hottest time of year it would make
 
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
the most sense to have this in place uh
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
but I was trying to be respective of a
 
01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:33.880 align:start position:0%
ramp up period depending on the side of
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
the sides of the school district to get
 
01:11:37.669 --> 01:11:37.679 align:start position:0%
the message out to coordinate the plan
 
01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
and get this going so I think there's um
 
01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:42.400 align:start position:0%
I'd love to hear I would like to hear
 
01:11:44.110 --> 01:11:44.120 align:start position:0%
from the athletic trainers on what they
 
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
think this might look like and I hope
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
that helps okay thank you further
 
01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
question representative Tanner thank you
 
01:11:52.310 --> 01:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
I just Paul I just want to uh go back to
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
the three minute um rule uh I think
 
01:11:57.189 --> 01:11:57.199 align:start position:0%
that's going to be difficult
 
01:11:59.669 --> 01:11:59.679 align:start position:0%
particularly you know we we had multiple
 
01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
fields in multiple places um offsite
 
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
onsite all over the place um and I think
 
01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
the the key is at least from my training
 
01:12:12.790 --> 01:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
was that CPR be started as soon as
 
01:12:14.350 --> 01:12:14.360 align:start position:0%
possible as soon as it's recognized
 
01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:18.120 align:start position:0%
there's no pulse no no breathing and um
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
you know we've had situations where we
 
01:12:25.870 --> 01:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
had CPR going for you know 3 minutes and
 
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
then an AED show up or even longer than
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
that and an AED show up and still be
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
effective so um you know I and schools
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
can afford one but you know they in a
 
01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
big school like Manchester or even even
 
01:12:44.390 --> 01:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
curar where you've got you know seven
 
01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
schools feeding into that seven or eight
 
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
schools feeding into that you've got a
 
01:12:51.669 --> 01:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
lot of activities going on do and so I
 
01:12:54.629 --> 01:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
think I think that three minute might be
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
uh something that we want to be as a s
 
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:00.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion rather than you know a hard
 
01:13:03.669 --> 01:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
fast Rule and and really stress that I
 
01:13:06.430 --> 01:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
would stress that all staff all
 
01:13:11.350 --> 01:13:11.360 align:start position:0%
teachers all coaches all theater people
 
01:13:13.030 --> 01:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
anybody that deals with the public
 
01:13:15.229 --> 01:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
through the public school system be
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
trained in CPR in first aid um just
 
01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:19.990 align:start position:0%
trained in CPR in first aid um just
basic

01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
basic
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
so that's my two
 
01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
cents thank you representative Tanner
 
01:13:26.629 --> 01:13:26.639 align:start position:0%
much appreciate it represent
 
01:13:29.030 --> 01:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you thank you and thank you
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so as a
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
supervisor and coach of many clubs and
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
teams I had to do the training every two
 
01:13:38.270 --> 01:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
years but I have to say I thank God
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
nobody ever had a heart attack on my
 
01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
watch because in those trainings you're
 
01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
learning about you know EP pens and
 
01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
broken arms and CPR and that's one piece
 
01:13:49.750 --> 01:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
of it I I wouldn't want to be that
 
01:13:52.229 --> 01:13:52.239 align:start position:0%
person that had to do it so I guess I'm
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
asking about lines 29 and 30 is there
 
01:13:58.990 --> 01:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
more than that CP that American Red
 
01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
Cross certificate you would get after
 
01:14:02.669 --> 01:14:02.679 align:start position:0%
this training like I would feel much
 
01:14:05.149 --> 01:14:05.159 align:start position:0%
more comfortable with a the trainer
 
01:14:06.990 --> 01:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
being on site than me being on site you
 
01:14:08.189 --> 01:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to have a heart attack on
 
01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:11.320 align:start position:0%
my watch um so I'm just curious on not
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
29 and 30 is it that two every twoyear
 
01:14:18.430 --> 01:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
card and that's the person is that what
 
01:14:22.590 --> 01:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
would qualify me to be this person y
 
01:14:25.390 --> 01:14:25.400 align:start position:0%
okay representative PA yes and I'll
 
01:14:27.149 --> 01:14:27.159 align:start position:0%
don't underestimate what you could do
 
01:14:29.709 --> 01:14:29.719 align:start position:0%
with your training in an emergency I in
 
01:14:32.629 --> 01:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
all of my years doing U this work I've
 
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:34.280 align:start position:0%
just been so proud of the members of the
 
01:14:37.590 --> 01:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
public who step up uh you know they took
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
that CPR class and they learned how to
 
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
use deed and it just K you know they and
 
01:14:45.629 --> 01:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
they're you know so glad that they took
 
01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
the time to do that because they were
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
equipped so don't underestimate what you
 
01:14:50.790 --> 01:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
exactly could do when there was an
 
01:14:52.750 --> 01:14:52.760 align:start position:0%
emergency okay well that's good because
 
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
they took the class probably 15 times
 
01:14:57.629 --> 01:14:57.639 align:start position:0%
every 30 years 15 times I took that
 
01:14:59.430 --> 01:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
let's get a new one for
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you okay thank you very much
 
01:15:05.189 --> 01:15:05.199 align:start position:0%
we have five more cards all right and I
 
01:15:06.110 --> 01:15:06.120 align:start position:0%
think I'm going to have to go to the
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
three minute rule on that as well but
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
are there any more questions of Senator
 
01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
yes represent
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr shair thank you we we
 
01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:16.000 align:start position:0%
kind of between us came up with a
 
01:15:17.669 --> 01:15:17.679 align:start position:0%
thought that might possibly need to be
 
01:15:19.470 --> 01:15:19.480 align:start position:0%
addressed I I would suggest in the bill
 
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I want to see if you would be
 
01:15:23.470 --> 01:15:23.480 align:start position:0%
supportive of um so with an AED being
 
01:15:25.510 --> 01:15:25.520 align:start position:0%
available one thought might be to okay
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
well we're going to take the ad that
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
exists and bring it out to the location
 
01:15:30.310 --> 01:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
on site to be at the athletic field but
 
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:31.880 align:start position:0%
I would be of the opinion that you
 
01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:34.719 align:start position:0%
should never remove in AED from an
 
01:15:36.629 --> 01:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
advertised location as long as that
 
01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
building is occupied by anyone because
 
01:15:41.229 --> 01:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
they would expect it to be there so this
 
01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:42.760 align:start position:0%
may require the purchasing of
 
01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
substantial numbers of new aeds so what
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
what what would you suggest as far as
 
01:15:49.709 --> 01:15:49.719 align:start position:0%
the the money piece on this and whether
 
01:15:52.030 --> 01:15:52.040 align:start position:0%
do you think that's feasible um to put
 
01:15:54.189 --> 01:15:54.199 align:start position:0%
on local schools or does there need to
 
01:15:55.470 --> 01:15:55.480 align:start position:0%
be some sort of
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
some sort of modification here to
 
01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
actually draw something from the uh the
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
education trust fund or or or what for
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
this so thank you for your question
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
representative belter I'm going to make
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
sure to speak into the microphone for
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:15.189 --> 01:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
so the the number one point here in this
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
legislation is it shouldn't be locked up
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
in respectfully the school nurse's
 
01:16:21.629 --> 01:16:21.639 align:start position:0%
office and we used to see that it could
 
01:16:23.550 --> 01:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
be this could be the opportunity for
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
schools to reevaluate cuz I agree with
 
01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
you like if it's an advertis that
 
01:16:28.030 --> 01:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
there's an AED going to be there and
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
there's a crisis and you go look for the
 
01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
AED because somebody in the who is
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
watching the you know is at the school
 
01:16:35.950 --> 01:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
play or in another event has a cardiac
 
01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
arrest it's out on the athletic field so
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
there may be U I'd like to think about
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
how to address that in this language
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
where there's strategic location I don't
 
01:16:48.030 --> 01:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
think this requires additional purchases
 
01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to speak to that in a
 
01:16:51.070 --> 01:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
second but just thinking about
 
01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
strategically where it's located and
 
01:16:56.310 --> 01:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
making sure it's not um locked anywhere
 
01:16:58.470 --> 01:16:58.480 align:start position:0%
and that if it is moved that everybody
 
01:17:00.189 --> 01:17:00.199 align:start position:0%
knows where it's gone but let me say
 
01:17:02.510 --> 01:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
this about the the financial side of
 
01:17:05.550 --> 01:17:05.560 align:start position:0%
this is I don't it's been my experience
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
since we've started working in this area
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
that charitable organizations Kanas
 
01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
clubs rotary clubs U the one in one
 
01:17:15.390 --> 01:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
Community I worked with the GU the
 
01:17:17.910 --> 01:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
gardening club raised the money and
 
01:17:20.310 --> 01:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
bought the bought an AED to put it in a
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
specific location so I think that we can
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
address strategically located making
 
01:17:27.189 --> 01:17:27.199 align:start position:0%
sure where the that everybody knows
 
01:17:28.990 --> 01:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
where this is so they can get it when
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
they need it without actually adding you
 
01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:34.440 align:start position:0%
know a fiscal note to this and helping
 
01:17:36.189 --> 01:17:36.199 align:start position:0%
the locals get it
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
done represent Terry thank you so as we
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
continue to talk about this and envision
 
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
different scenarios under which the aeds
 
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
may be
 
01:17:51.350 --> 01:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
needed I'm thinking to my own personal
 
01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
experience when um I was on my high
 
01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:55.560 align:start position:0%
school baseball member of my high school
 
01:17:58.350 --> 01:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
baseball team back in the last century
 
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the last century uh I'm so
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
old but uh we were it the field would
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
not have been uh within 3 minutes of the
 
01:18:11.550 --> 01:18:11.560 align:start position:0%
school building which would therefore
 
01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
require that an an AED would have been
 
01:18:18.030 --> 01:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
on site at that particular location for
 
01:18:20.590 --> 01:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
the game same thing with my college
 
01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
where my college baseball team the home
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
field was actually 50 15 minutes away in
 
01:18:30.070 --> 01:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
the city park and not on campus so there
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
would need to be an
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
AED uh that's on site for that
 
01:18:38.910 --> 01:18:38.920 align:start position:0%
particular event and you need somebody
 
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
who was uh somebody or somebody's who
 
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
were trained uh to do that and this kind
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
of feeds off of Representative bel's
 
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
concern so it would seemed to me that
 
01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
each school then would have to assess
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
how many aeds would be needed the
 
01:18:57.390 --> 01:18:57.400 align:start position:0%
maximum number that would be needed and
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
the maximum number of persons that would
 
01:19:01.430 --> 01:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
needed to be trained but practically
 
01:19:05.189 --> 01:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
speaking we're we're probably looking at
 
01:19:07.870 --> 01:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
maybe two or three on average and not
 
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
just one does that make sense have I got
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
this the the the field is located 5
 
01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:17.560 align:start position:0%
minutes away or 10 minutes away or 15
 
01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
minutes away where the school is the
 
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:22.560 align:start position:0%
home team and therefore is required to
 
01:19:25.350 --> 01:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
have the AED on site so now we don't
 
01:19:27.950 --> 01:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
have an AED for another team that may be
 
01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
playing on campus and it's a volleyball
 
01:19:32.510 --> 01:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
game and then we have the concern about
 
01:19:35.430 --> 01:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
the one being you in the school so there
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
would be a need for multiple aeds and
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
multiple persons who would be trained to
 
01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
know how to use them so correct correct
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you represent I don't see
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
this as an impediment I'm just trying to
 
01:19:50.310 --> 01:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
drill down on here is anybody who would
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
think that maybe you'd only need one per
 
01:19:55.709 --> 01:19:55.719 align:start position:0%
school is not being realistic you you're
 
01:19:57.030 --> 01:19:57.040 align:start position:0%
going to you're going to have schools
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
where you're going to require multiple
 
01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
aeds and persons who are trained which
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
is fine yeah thank you very thank you
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
for the question and I look forward um
 
01:20:08.229 --> 01:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
although I have to get back to S
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
education and I really like to stay
 
01:20:11.590 --> 01:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
because I'm passionate about this I
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
think that between the Heart Association
 
01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
and the athletic trainers we can get a
 
01:20:17.950 --> 01:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
better feeling for or understanding of
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
how the logistics are currently working
 
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
and where we may have to build in some
 
01:20:24.709 --> 01:20:24.719 align:start position:0%
guard rails to this to give flexibility
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
to the to the schools and the school
 
01:20:28.350 --> 01:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
systems while still achieving the goal
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
of working to reduce the time to get 911
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
called CPR started an AED in place and
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
everyone know what to do thank you thank
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%

to impose a three minute rule that means
 
01:21:12.750 --> 01:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
you have three minutes to present and
 
01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:14.920 align:start position:0%
then you have questions following that
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:24.350 --> 01:21:24.360 align:start position:0%
Knight good morning everyone thank you

so much for hearing my voice here today
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
my name is Emily Knight I am a resident
 
01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:31.480 align:start position:0%
of straford New Hampshire I am a nurse
 
01:21:34.750 --> 01:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
of 30 years in wles hospital I run the
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
American Heart Association training
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
center there I am on the board of
 
01:21:40.470 --> 01:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
directors for American Heart Association
 
01:21:42.390 --> 01:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
I sit on the state committee for sudden
 
01:21:46.189 --> 01:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
Youth and infant death I um go to DC to
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
talk about these issues as well and I'm
 
01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
extremely passionate about saving
 
01:21:53.470 --> 01:21:53.480 align:start position:0%
children's lives I also have two
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
children of my own that were student
 
01:21:56.990 --> 01:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
athletes that went to cobon high school
 
01:21:59.590 --> 01:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
here in the state and I just want to
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
speak very quickly about the importance
 
01:22:05.310 --> 01:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
of aeds I'm hearing you all um talking
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
about the importance of CPR which is the
 
01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:10.719 align:start position:0%
first step of saving lives however as we
 
01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
are learning at my state committee um
 
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
the incidence of congenital anomalies
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
that are causing sudden cardiac death in
 
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:21.719 align:start position:0%
children is on the rise it's not going
 
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
to be at some point just the
 
01:22:25.709 --> 01:22:25.719 align:start position:0%
grandparents having cardiac arrests in
 
01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
these sports stadiums it's going to be
 
01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:29.480 align:start position:0%
the students having cardiac arrests
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
because of these congenital anomalies
 
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
that they have um and the only way to
 
01:22:37.629 --> 01:22:37.639 align:start position:0%
save them is not CPR we need
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
defibrillation we need aeds we need
 
01:22:43.070 --> 01:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
these kids to get energy and that is how
 
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:45.880 align:start position:0%
we save them and we save them into
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
beautiful souls like Piper or other
 
01:22:50.590 --> 01:22:50.600 align:start position:0%
children that I have seen in the
 
01:22:53.709 --> 01:22:53.719 align:start position:0%
community in my hospital and across the
 
01:22:57.950 --> 01:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
state at our Community um that it really
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
really does make a
 
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
difference um I want to tell you that I
 
01:23:05.310 --> 01:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
understand I hear you talking about the
 
01:23:08.669 --> 01:23:08.679 align:start position:0%
financial piece of this and I agree uh
 
01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:11.480 align:start position:0%
that we have many many ways to raise
 
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
money for this important equipment um
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
and I definitely support this bill and
 
01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:21.400 align:start position:0%
I'm open to any questions you might have
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you very much other quit represent
 
01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:25.400 align:start position:0%
Myer thank you Mr jar thank you for
 
01:23:28.270 --> 01:23:28.280 align:start position:0%
being here uh you indicate that the
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
issue the incident rate of heart issues
 
01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
and young people is on the increase uh
 
01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the reason for that so
 
01:23:39.950 --> 01:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
we don't know exactly but I will tell
 
01:23:41.790 --> 01:23:41.800 align:start position:0%
you this when I started on the sudden
 
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
youth death committee about 7 years ago
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
we could test for 45 of what we felt was
 
01:23:50.790 --> 01:23:50.800 align:start position:0%
150 congenital anomalies that cause
 
01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
sudden cardiac death in infants and
 
01:23:56.430 --> 01:23:56.440 align:start position:0%
children we can now test for about 95
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
but we believe there to be over 450 in 7
 
01:24:03.189 --> 01:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
years we've seen that much of an
 
01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
increase in the genetics that are
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
changing in humans that will cause these
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
sudden cardiac deaths thank you further
 
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
questions from the
 
01:24:16.189 --> 01:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
committee thank you very
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
McDougall welcome Molly
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Molly McDougall I
 
01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
am currently the certified athletic
 
01:24:31.750 --> 01:24:31.760 align:start position:0%
trainer at kirar Regional High School um
 
01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to share my support
 
01:24:37.550 --> 01:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
for this bill in August of 2021 in the
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
first no disregard not me yet operator
 
01:24:45.070 --> 01:24:45.080 align:start position:0%
air go ahead um in August of 2021 in the
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
first 20 minutes of a field hockey
 
01:24:48.669 --> 01:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
practice during preseason we had an
 
01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
athlete collapse she was not breathing
 
01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
she had no pulse and she had obviously
 
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:55.040 align:start position:0%
suffered a sudden cardiac emergency
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
thankfully our coaches knew how to enact
 
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
our emergency action plan while one
 
01:25:01.790 --> 01:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
coach started CPR another called 911 and
 
01:25:03.350 --> 01:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
the last one called me which was the
 
01:25:05.709 --> 01:25:05.719 align:start position:0%
most critical point because I came with
 
01:25:05.719 --> 01:25:06.430 align:start position:0%
most critical point because I came with
the

01:25:06.430 --> 01:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:25:10.390 --> 01:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
AED within 45 seconds of the a athlete
 
01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
collapsing the AED was placed and myself
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
and the coaches were able to revive the
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
athlete between the AED and the
 
01:25:18.950 --> 01:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
sufficient the efficient CPR between
 
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
myself and our Coach Piper here was able
 
01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
to be revived on the field and is able
 
01:25:24.910 --> 01:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
to be with here with us today Piper
 
01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
needed two rounds of CPR and constant
 
01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring from the AED to stabilize her
 
01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:31.719 align:start position:0%
this process took no more than 4 minutes
 
01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
but was enough to save her life karge is
 
01:25:36.189 --> 01:25:36.199 align:start position:0%
approximately 12 minutes from New London
 
01:25:38.830 --> 01:25:38.840 align:start position:0%
Hospital which is a small facility um on
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
the day of Piper's accident we waited 17
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
minutes for an ambulance to
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
arrive so I firmly believe that due to
 
01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:48.199 align:start position:0%
our up-to-date emergency action plans
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
the and the components of s SP 379 that
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
we already have in place uh that we
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
would not have had the same outcome for
 
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
Piper our success and Piper's life all
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
hinged on a written document the access
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
to an AED and individuals that knew how
 
01:26:04.030 --> 01:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
to do CPR uh my coaches and I were able
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
to save a life that day with nothing
 
01:26:06.990 --> 01:26:07.000 align:start position:0%
more than that knowledge and we were
 
01:26:08.590 --> 01:26:08.600 align:start position:0%
able to get someone's child home to them
 
01:26:10.830 --> 01:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
that day so I am in full support of this
 
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
bill and think we should all think
 
01:26:13.629 --> 01:26:13.639 align:start position:0%
carefully about it thank you very much
 
01:26:16.189 --> 01:26:16.199 align:start position:0%
other questions yes represent
 
01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
pel thank you I was told to hold this
 
01:26:21.629 --> 01:26:21.639 align:start position:0%
question for you so it's about a large
 
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
camp we have a large campus where
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
multiple athletes are practicing we do
 
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
have a our athletic trainer does have a
 
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:30.280 align:start position:0%
gator that he drives around however we
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
also have the um track team that
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
practices at a different
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
location um with the so I guess I have
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
two what would you do about the cross
 
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
country team that's not necessarily on
 
01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
campus and the students are athletes are
 
01:26:48.390 --> 01:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
spread out
 
01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
running you might not the coach might
 
01:26:53.149 --> 01:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
not even be able to get to the athlete
 
01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
who's down in 3 minutes
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
of course um it's a very tricky
 
01:26:58.910 --> 01:26:58.920 align:start position:0%
situation because if you're like our
 
01:27:01.149 --> 01:27:01.159 align:start position:0%
school they run in the woods sometimes
 
01:27:04.310 --> 01:27:04.320 align:start position:0%
too so part of that is making sure that
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
everybody knows what the plan is um so
 
01:27:09.070 --> 01:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
our coaches run with a phone on them so
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
that they can call 911 but also say that
 
01:27:13.350 --> 01:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
they can call me and meeting in the
 
01:27:15.550 --> 01:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
middle can get that AED to someone
 
01:27:18.030 --> 01:27:18.040 align:start position:0%
quicker um so that is a big part of it
 
01:27:20.310 --> 01:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
as well I know we all assume that it's
 
01:27:22.149 --> 01:27:22.159 align:start position:0%
going to be someone coming from the
 
01:27:24.470 --> 01:27:24.480 align:start position:0%
situation to the AED and then coming
 
01:27:26.990 --> 01:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
back in that 3-minute window um but a
 
01:27:28.830 --> 01:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
lot of the times like in Piper situation
 
01:27:30.229 --> 01:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
it was me coming to them and that's why
 
01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
we got the AED so quickly so knowing
 
01:27:34.870 --> 01:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
where that team is going and knowing how
 
01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
to get to them as quickly as possible
 
01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:37.960 align:start position:0%
it's part of the reason that I run our
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
cross country trail every year to make
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
sure I know where we are and the best
 
01:27:43.629 --> 01:27:43.639 align:start position:0%
way to get to them um but having both
 
01:27:46.229 --> 01:27:46.239 align:start position:0%
stationary and mobile aeds is really the
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
the key component there thank you
 
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:50.520 align:start position:0%
further question representative
 
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
Woodcock good morning thank you so much
 
01:27:55.310 --> 01:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
for being here um to follow up on your
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
your K size experiment experience uh in
 
01:28:00.750 --> 01:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
when the um typical trainer in the
 
01:28:03.310 --> 01:28:03.320 align:start position:0%
typical high school uh today are
 
01:28:06.109 --> 01:28:06.119 align:start position:0%
students uh screened at all for the
 
01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:08.360 align:start position:0%
congenital anomalies or bringing
 
01:28:10.350 --> 01:28:10.360 align:start position:0%
information like that that uh Miss night
 
01:28:12.990 --> 01:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
was talking about or is it just is just
 
01:28:16.390 --> 01:28:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh the typical athletic physical of old
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
days more often than not it is the
 
01:28:20.310 --> 01:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
typical physical that we get however
 
01:28:21.990 --> 01:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
there are some schools in the state that
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
do host these screenings um and they are
 
01:28:26.870 --> 01:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
you know based school by school you can
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
have someone come in and and do these
 
01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:30.639 align:start position:0%
screenings which could also be a part of
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
keeping our athletes safer absolutely
 
01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:34.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much further
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:28:39.070 --> 01:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
Tanner hi thanks so much for being here
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
and thank you for what you do um do you
 
01:28:44.189 --> 01:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
have any idea how many approximately how
 
01:28:45.870 --> 01:28:45.880 align:start position:0%
many schools in New Hampshire actually
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
have an athletic trainer like your
 
01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
Serge I don't know the exact number off
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
the top of my head we do have a running
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
list of secondary school which is how we
 
01:28:57.070 --> 01:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
all keep in touch with each other um I'd
 
01:28:58.790 --> 01:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
say it's pretty split down the middle
 
01:29:00.350 --> 01:29:00.360 align:start position:0%
with what schools do and don't have them
 
01:29:01.750 --> 01:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
at this
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
point further questions thank you very
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
much thank you like to invite Piper
 
01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
Moran we've heard your name spoken to
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
already today welcome Piper thank you so
 
01:29:17.109 --> 01:29:17.119 align:start position:0%
my name is Piper Moran I want to thank
 
01:29:19.390 --> 01:29:19.400 align:start position:0%
all of you for hearing me today and I
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
just wanted to reiterate the importance
 
01:29:24.790 --> 01:29:24.800 align:start position:0%
of having an AED on our school and the
 
01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
athletic trainer um I guess I'm just
 
01:29:29.629 --> 01:29:29.639 align:start position:0%
kind of living proof of the example of
 
01:29:32.510 --> 01:29:32.520 align:start position:0%
why we need it um if we didn't have an
 
01:29:35.149 --> 01:29:35.159 align:start position:0%
amazing action plan or athletic director
 
01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
like or athletic trainer like Molly um I
 
01:29:40.910 --> 01:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't be here today so it is
 
01:29:44.590 --> 01:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
very important to just keep that in mind
 
01:29:47.590 --> 01:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
about why we need the AED and everything
 
01:29:51.390 --> 01:29:51.400 align:start position:0%
so yeah thank you Piper yeah are there
 
01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:55.229 align:start position:0%
so yeah thank you Piper yeah are there
questions

01:29:55.229 --> 01:29:55.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we're just very
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
happy that you're still here with
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
us uh Rebecca
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.750 --> 01:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning good
 
01:30:13.229 --> 01:30:13.239 align:start position:0%
morning I'm Becca Sterns I'm an athletic
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
trainer and I'm also the CEO of the
 
01:30:17.550 --> 01:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
Corey Stringer Institute we were founded
 
01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:18.430 align:start position:0%
Corey Stringer Institute we were founded
in

01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:18.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
2010 in honor of Cory Stringer who was a
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
Minnesota Vikings who passed away from
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
an exertional heat stroke
 
01:30:26.910 --> 01:30:26.920 align:start position:0%
we were founded with the mission to
 
01:30:29.870 --> 01:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
provide research advocacy uh
 
01:30:33.109 --> 01:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
consultation and to prevent uh sudden
 
01:30:35.390 --> 01:30:35.400 align:start position:0%
death in the athlete war fighter and
 
01:30:37.550 --> 01:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
laborer and sudden Cardiac Arrest as
 
01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
you've already heard today accounts for
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh the greatest number of athlete deaths
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
for any condition so uh on average it
 
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
accounts for 60% of all the deaths we
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
see every year in athletes which results
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
in about one athlete collapsing every 3
 
01:30:55.229 --> 01:30:55.239 align:start position:0%
days from a sudden cardia
 
01:30:58.750 --> 01:30:58.760 align:start position:0%
arrest and so the fact is that time is
 
01:31:00.149 --> 01:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
of the essence with sudden Cardiac
 
01:31:02.310 --> 01:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
Arrest that's why it is so deadly and
 
01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
why it is the number one cause of death
 
01:31:06.109 --> 01:31:06.119 align:start position:0%
in athletes so for every minute that
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
passes without the application of an AED
 
01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
that chance of survival goes down by 10%
 
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
so by the time you hit five minutes the
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
chance of survival is a flip of a coin
 
01:31:19.229 --> 01:31:19.239 align:start position:0%
okay so so that is why we're talking
 
01:31:21.390 --> 01:31:21.400 align:start position:0%
today about the location of these aeds
 
01:31:22.990 --> 01:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
this bill just to answer a few of the
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
questions that have already come come up
 
01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily require aeds though
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
I would love to see that but it does
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
require strategic placement and
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance of those
 
01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
aeds and to put it in perspective as
 
01:31:37.629 --> 01:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
well the cost of an AED is about the
 
01:31:40.990 --> 01:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.430 align:start position:0%
 
helmets

01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
helmets
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
so what I want to also impress upon
 
01:31:47.470 --> 01:31:47.480 align:start position:0%
everyone today is that we know that the
 
01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
survival rates can be as high as
 
01:31:51.870 --> 01:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
89% when you have these items in place
 
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
when you have an AED within 1 3 minutes
 
01:31:56.550 --> 01:31:56.560 align:start position:0%
and when you have somebody trained to
 
01:31:58.990 --> 01:31:59.000 align:start position:0%
apply that AED these are the two
 
01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
critical components that this bill
 
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:05.400 align:start position:0%
provides New Hampshire has are already
 
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
implemented many programs that have also
 
01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
enhanced steps critical to address
 
01:32:11.669 --> 01:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
sudden cardiac arrest so it does include
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
that distribution of the aeds in the
 
01:32:16.510 --> 01:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
early 2000s which I think was around 450
 
01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
aeds it also provides negotiated uh ACC
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
or access to lowcost aeds through the
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
state negotiated plan that you've heard
 
01:32:27.669 --> 01:32:27.679 align:start position:0%
of today as well as well as a
 
01:32:29.830 --> 01:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
coordination between the 911 calls that
 
01:32:31.149 --> 01:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
come in and the location of those
 
01:32:33.470 --> 01:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
registered aeds to ensure that the
 
01:32:36.310 --> 01:32:36.320 align:start position:0%
closest AED is accessed when that
 
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:44.109 --> 01:32:44.119 align:start position:0%
in so in general an AED is a basic
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
health and safety protection that I
 
01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
believe all student athletes deserve
 
01:32:49.310 --> 01:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
access to it's similar for other health
 
01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
and safety uh equipment for other safety
 
01:32:54.189 --> 01:32:54.199 align:start position:0%
Provisions that we have schools do have
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
to fund various aspects of sports
 
01:32:58.070 --> 01:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
programs it includes equipment
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the fields Transportation
 
01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
coaching so the cost of an AED the cost
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
of having someone trained to use that
 
01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
AED is really dwarfed in comparison to
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
budget the passage of the predecessor to
 
01:33:17.950 --> 01:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
this bill in 2001 or sorry
 
01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
2021 uh put New Hampshire among the top
 
01:33:22.510 --> 01:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
five states to prioritize High School
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
sport athlete health and safety
 
01:33:27.070 --> 01:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
the passage of this bill would continue
 
01:33:29.470 --> 01:33:29.480 align:start position:0%
to propel that trajectory forward and
 
01:33:31.550 --> 01:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
established New Hampshire as a model for
 
01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
many other states to
 
01:33:37.350 --> 01:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
follow so thank you for your time today
 
01:33:38.669 --> 01:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:33:41.629 --> 01:33:41.639 align:start position:0%
thank you very much yes representative
 
01:33:43.790 --> 01:33:43.800 align:start position:0%
Woodcock good morning good morning

01:33:51.070 --> 01:33:51.080 align:start position:0%
of just telling represent people under
 
01:33:51.080 --> 01:33:52.109 align:start position:0%
of just telling represent people under
under

01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:52.119 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
under underpaid
 
01:33:57.310 --> 01:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
overworked um have seen repres Woodcock
 
01:33:58.830 --> 01:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
we can't hear what you're saying can you
 
01:34:01.430 --> 01:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
move your mic closer please good morning
 
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay that helps anyhow so my my going
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
back to your comment on if I'm want sure
 
01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
I heard this correctly one athletic one
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
athlete uh collapsing every three
 
01:34:16.270 --> 01:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
days currently is this a nationwide or
 
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
Statewide that's a Nationwide Nationwide
 
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
okay that's a little better um uh follow
 
01:34:24.229 --> 01:34:24.239 align:start position:0%
up please thank you
 
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
um couple other things are are the
 
01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:29.199 align:start position:0%
trainer not trainers are the coaches in
 
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire at the secondary level um
 
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
required to have uh AED training I
 
01:34:38.910 --> 01:34:38.920 align:start position:0%
believe the head coaches are not all
 
01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:41.199 align:start position:0%
coaches are required though okay so if
 
01:34:42.950 --> 01:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
that coach is out that day it leaves the
 
01:34:45.390 --> 01:34:45.400 align:start position:0%
team vulnerable and just one last
 
01:34:48.270 --> 01:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
question if I may uh typically do the
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
high schools in the secondary level that
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
have aeds uh at the by with the trainer
 
01:34:56.189 --> 01:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
they typically travel on GES with them
 
01:34:58.510 --> 01:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
as well besides one to school yeah great
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
question so um there are portable and
 
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
they're also stationary ads so in terms
 
01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
of the pl placements in uh strategic
 
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
locations um we do encourage and it is
 
01:35:10.189 --> 01:35:10.199 align:start position:0%
really typical to have a portable AED so
 
01:35:11.830 --> 01:35:11.840 align:start position:0%
that AED could realistically cover
 
01:35:13.229 --> 01:35:13.239 align:start position:0%
multiple sites if they're close to each
 
01:35:14.669 --> 01:35:14.679 align:start position:0%
other right so you don't have to have an
 
01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
AED specifically for every single field
 
01:35:19.470 --> 01:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
of course larger programs are going to
 
01:35:21.750 --> 01:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
need more but uh the smaller programs
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
could probably have one or two that
 
01:35:25.470 --> 01:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
would be able to cover the fields
 
01:35:26.709 --> 01:35:26.719 align:start position:0%
because that one could be mobile and it
 
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
could be on the active site thank you so
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
much M are there further yes
 
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
representative Damon thank you Mr chair
 
01:35:37.229 --> 01:35:37.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here um I recall
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
being trained on how to use an
 
01:35:43.310 --> 01:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
AED when they were first being placed in
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
in community places and it was in the
 
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
office building that I worked in I'm
 
01:35:49.149 --> 01:35:49.159 align:start position:0%
wondering for if you would share for
 
01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
folks who didn't ever do a training and
 
01:35:53.950 --> 01:35:53.960 align:start position:0%
are not MediCal providers and just have
 
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
no experience with
 
01:35:58.310 --> 01:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
this what that training is like and and
 
01:36:01.189 --> 01:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
what the uh time frame for it is thank
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
you yeah great question too um there's
 
01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
been so many advances recently with the
 
01:36:08.550 --> 01:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
training that's available you can take a
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
CPR AED training online the nfhs
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
actually has that course online and
 
01:36:16.750 --> 01:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
offers it um for High School uh programs
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
for this very reason so the options are
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
are Bountiful I would say and so I think
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
you can take a course that might be in
 
01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:27.520 align:start position:0%
the realm of 15 to 20 minutes it can be
 
01:36:29.470 --> 01:36:29.480 align:start position:0%
as reasonable as $10 I think there's
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
even some programs that you could find
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
it free um and uh I think one of the
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
greatest advantages um because we're not
 
01:36:38.430 --> 01:36:38.440 align:start position:0%
expecting everyone to be a medical
 
01:36:41.310 --> 01:36:41.320 align:start position:0%
provider the purpose of this is to allow
 
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:42.960 align:start position:0%
someone to recognize when something is
 
01:36:44.669 --> 01:36:44.679 align:start position:0%
terribly wrong and know the first steps
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
so that further care can be
 
01:36:49.830 --> 01:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
summoned great answer thank you thank
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
you further questions from the committee
 
01:36:54.229 --> 01:36:54.239 align:start position:0%
not see thank you very much thank you
 
01:37:02.350 --> 01:37:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
vaugh good morning chairman lad
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
honorable members of the committee um
 
01:37:08.350 --> 01:37:08.360 align:start position:0%
for the record I am Nancy Bond

government relations director for the
 
01:37:13.229 --> 01:37:13.239 align:start position:0%
American Heart Association um and I uh I
 
01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
worked closely with SRA prenis to uh to
 
01:37:17.629 --> 01:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
craft this piece of legislation this
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
year um I am uh I'm humbled by the
 
01:37:24.030 --> 01:37:24.040 align:start position:0%
expertise of the people who have come um
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
before you today other than myself on
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
this issue um and I would would say
 
01:37:31.229 --> 01:37:31.239 align:start position:0%
definitely to um to let us know if you
 
01:37:33.790 --> 01:37:33.800 align:start position:0%
have any questions Beyond today um I'm
 
01:37:36.070 --> 01:37:36.080 align:start position:0%
sure they'd be happy to answer um answer
 
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
your questions I do have written
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
testimony so I will try my best not to
 
01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
read through this but I'm trying to find
 
01:37:45.030 --> 01:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
um some of the questions that were asked
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
but again we are obviously in support of
 
01:37:50.350 --> 01:37:50.360 align:start position:0%
this policy um what you have heard um
 
01:37:52.629 --> 01:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
today is there you know in this
 
01:37:55.189 --> 01:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
situation of is currently available for
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
aeds um we do feel that there is um you
 
01:38:01.830 --> 01:38:01.840 align:start position:0%
know a a good amount of coverage of aeds
 
01:38:04.510 --> 01:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
in schools in New Hampshire I would be
 
01:38:06.669 --> 01:38:06.679 align:start position:0%
very happy to work with any of you next
 
01:38:09.310 --> 01:38:09.320 align:start position:0%
year on putting through a bill to seek
 
01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
funding for schools for this issue um
 
01:38:13.950 --> 01:38:13.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's cost of CPR training for
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
all teachers whether it is cost of aeds
 
01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:20.920 align:start position:0%
um that um schools might need to add to
 
01:38:23.070 --> 01:38:23.080 align:start position:0%
um because next year is a budget year um
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
but would ask that we not pass on what
 
01:38:28.270 --> 01:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
is a good policy um for this year for
 
01:38:30.709 --> 01:38:30.719 align:start position:0%
the ideal pal policy at this point so I
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
urge you um to pass this bill um I
 
01:38:39.149 --> 01:38:39.159 align:start position:0%
also um I think really what this bill
 
01:38:42.189 --> 01:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
accomplishes um is uh for those that
 
01:38:44.030 --> 01:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
currently have aeds the training is
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
already required of um of these teams
 
01:38:49.910 --> 01:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
for the Emergency action plans um but it
 
01:38:52.470 --> 01:38:52.480 align:start position:0%
is really you know having these steps
 
01:38:54.390 --> 01:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
that not all schools may have in place
 
01:38:56.229 --> 01:38:56.239 align:start position:0%
in their emergency action plan for
 
01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrest um to make sure that they
 
01:39:00.990 --> 01:39:01.000 align:start position:0%
do have these in place if you have an
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
AED according to current state law um
 
01:39:05.830 --> 01:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
you really need to follow the
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
maintenance on this there needs to be a
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
person and expected user that is trained
 
01:39:13.550 --> 01:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
um on the AED so that would be the point
 
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
person for making sure that these aeds
 
01:39:17.629 --> 01:39:17.639 align:start position:0%
are maintained and that the batteries
 
01:39:19.709 --> 01:39:19.719 align:start position:0%
are working and all of that um it's not
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
really left to the school board or the
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
school principal to do that unless the
 
01:39:25.229 --> 01:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
school principal is also the uh the
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
person for for School athletics um and
 
01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh I would also say that um because
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
these emergency action plans need to be
 
01:39:36.910 --> 01:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
coordinated with your local EMS the
 
01:39:39.629 --> 01:39:39.639 align:start position:0%
local fire rescue are great resources to
 
01:39:41.950 --> 01:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
schools to all of us actually um and
 
01:39:44.430 --> 01:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
they usually are very open to coming to
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
locations and offering trainings but
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
also that schools should rely on their
 
01:39:52.470 --> 01:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
Fire EMS rescue um to talk about
 
01:39:54.189 --> 01:39:54.199 align:start position:0%
placement and how many aeds that that
 
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
school might need um for that's not
 
01:39:58.750 --> 01:39:58.760 align:start position:0%
something that this group is is alone in
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
in planning um planning out how many
 
01:40:03.830 --> 01:40:03.840 align:start position:0%
that they need and um you know we we
 
01:40:06.910 --> 01:40:06.920 align:start position:0%
would be um one of the the um early
 
01:40:09.950 --> 01:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
states to pass this legislation um this
 
01:40:12.310 --> 01:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
year and it really is about these these
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
steps being in place the rehearsing of
 
01:40:15.990 --> 01:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
the plan this is how we know whether we
 
01:40:18.149 --> 01:40:18.159 align:start position:0%
can get that AED within 3 minutes to the
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
side of the person or the the rehearsals
 
01:40:22.910 --> 01:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
that the teams would be doing um leading
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
up it really should be something that
 
01:40:25.870 --> 01:40:25.880 align:start position:0%
they do throughout the school year but
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
at least once a year to be able to do
 
01:40:31.550 --> 01:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
that so um in in um uh in respect for
 
01:40:33.589 --> 01:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
time and your time I am going to turn in
 
01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:35.639 align:start position:0%
my written testimony and I'm happy to
 
01:40:37.709 --> 01:40:37.719 align:start position:0%
follow up with any of you beyond today
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
but if you have any questions for me
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
today obviously I'll try to answer them
 
01:40:41.550 --> 01:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any
 
01:40:43.709 --> 01:40:43.719 align:start position:0%
questions today represent
 
01:40:48.070 --> 01:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much so um so um
 
01:40:50.950 --> 01:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
Nancy you rais a really good point about
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
next year but given the incidences um
 
01:40:56.109 --> 01:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
and things I'm not sure why we wouldn't
 
01:40:59.470 --> 01:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
consider um uh consider a state
 
01:41:02.189 --> 01:41:02.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation on that this year through
 
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
through the um the you know the the
 
01:41:10.310 --> 01:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
finance um committee and and we we've
 
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
heard testimony right that that an AED
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
is about
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
$1,500 they are but I understand through
 
01:41:19.189 --> 01:41:19.199 align:start position:0%
the state um uh Department of Safety
 
01:41:21.149 --> 01:41:21.159 align:start position:0%
Bureau of EMS that these are actually
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
available at more like under a
 
01:41:26.070 --> 01:41:26.080 align:start position:0%
I've heard about 800 so then so then
 
01:41:29.870 --> 01:41:29.880 align:start position:0%
these numbers would be a conservative um
 
01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
$1,500 time five aeds at each School
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
times 300 schools across the state we're
 
01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
talking a little over $2 million okay
 
01:41:41.950 --> 01:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
yep why wouldn't we put that in this
 
01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
bill I I think as as a direct State
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation yes I think if if there
 
01:41:49.149 --> 01:41:49.159 align:start position:0%
was the the funding to do that I would
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
feel you know I would definitely support
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
it no matter what um because I do think
 
01:41:54.669 --> 01:41:54.679 align:start position:0%
think the sooner we can get this done
 
01:41:57.030 --> 01:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
the better I just wouldn't like to see
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
this this Bill end up um you know dying
 
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
in early death because there's a fiscal
 
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
note that that couldn't be be covered
 
01:42:05.070 --> 01:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
this year the these steps that don't
 
01:42:07.229 --> 01:42:07.239 align:start position:0%
require costs are really important for
 
01:42:09.390 --> 01:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
for them to have in their plans this
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
this year so so so just for just for
 
01:42:15.550 --> 01:42:15.560 align:start position:0%
background followup yeah um there's uh
 
01:42:18.310 --> 01:42:18.320 align:start position:0%
there's over $200 million in Surplus in
 
01:42:21.149 --> 01:42:21.159 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund okay and and
 
01:42:23.550 --> 01:42:23.560 align:start position:0%
the um the legislature passed bills last
 
01:42:25.750 --> 01:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
week to use 100 million of that for
 
01:42:28.550 --> 01:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
Equitable grants this seems like a very
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
good use would you agree that this seems
 
01:42:33.109 --> 01:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
like a very good use I think this is an
 
01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:36.360 align:start position:0%
excellent use of funds um whether we
 
01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
have them or don't have them this is an
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
excellent use of funds this is the lives
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
of children so yes I agree with you
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much are there any other
 
01:42:46.350 --> 01:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee yes
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher thank you Mr
 
01:42:50.070 --> 01:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for being here and I
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
I just want to ask you uh if you would
 
01:42:54.430 --> 01:42:54.440 align:start position:0%
support a little bit of a a a different
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
idea but I think it meets the the the
 
01:42:58.510 --> 01:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
needs of what we're looking at here
 
01:43:00.030 --> 01:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
because I honestly I don't think there's
 
01:43:01.870 --> 01:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
any way to do this without more EDS ads
 
01:43:06.189 --> 01:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
being involved um if we were to uh draw
 
01:43:09.950 --> 01:43:09.960 align:start position:0%
from the uh the available funds we have
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
to instead of Furnishing these directly
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
to each individual school if we were to
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
do it let's say by District um in a way
 
01:43:20.709 --> 01:43:20.719 align:start position:0%
that accounts for the different student
 
01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
populations by District so that they can
 
01:43:24.790 --> 01:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
sh be shared between schools because if
 
01:43:26.790 --> 01:43:26.800 align:start position:0%
you provide it to a school it it may you
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
know four days out of the week just be
 
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
locked you know in an office somewhere
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
but in the district level it seems to me
 
01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
that we might be able to get this done
 
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
for well under a million dollars do you
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
think that would be something that might
 
01:43:39.510 --> 01:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
be again I I would definitely support
 
01:43:42.589 --> 01:43:42.599 align:start position:0%
that that um that idea y thank you
 
01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:45.440 align:start position:0%
definitely further question repres
 
01:43:47.709 --> 01:43:47.719 align:start position:0%
Woodcock good morning thank you for
 
01:43:51.189 --> 01:43:51.199 align:start position:0%
being here miss f u I'm trying to think
 
01:43:53.990 --> 01:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
about from the civilian walking by the
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
ad as we have here uh if I recall and
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
it's not accurate I'm sure at one point
 
01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:06.040 align:start position:0%
it was the ads that that I had seen were
 
01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:08.719 align:start position:0%
pretty much self toage as you needed
 
01:44:11.229 --> 01:44:11.239 align:start position:0%
them yes um are they still is that mode
 
01:44:12.629 --> 01:44:12.639 align:start position:0%
so people understand what we're talking
 
01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
about we're not talking about a you know
 
01:44:18.270 --> 01:44:18.280 align:start position:0%
highly just thank you yeah no thank you
 
01:44:20.270 --> 01:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
for that question aeds are incredibly
 
01:44:23.350 --> 01:44:23.360 align:start position:0%
easy to use they basically you hit the
 
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
on button and the AED will tell you the
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
rest it will tell you um you know to
 
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
apply the pads to the individual's chest
 
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
it will then do an assessment of that
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
patient is a shock advised and then it
 
01:44:39.109 --> 01:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
will tell you a shock is is advised and
 
01:44:40.669 --> 01:44:40.679 align:start position:0%
basically you know take your hands off
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
the patient and the device will do the
 
01:44:46.149 --> 01:44:46.159 align:start position:0%
the the shock you will not be able to
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
shock a person who doesn't need to have
 
01:44:51.589 --> 01:44:51.599 align:start position:0%
that that shock um and the important
 
01:44:54.350 --> 01:44:54.360 align:start position:0%
part of calling 911 is there is a person
 
01:44:55.510 --> 01:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
who will be on the other end of the
 
01:44:56.950 --> 01:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
phone telling you everything that you
 
01:44:59.310 --> 01:44:59.320 align:start position:0%
need to know as well because sometimes
 
01:45:00.990 --> 01:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
things go out of our heads when the
 
01:45:02.510 --> 01:45:02.520 align:start position:0%
emergency happens you know the more we
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
practice the better we get at it but yes
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
very easy to use f question yeah thank
 
01:45:08.750 --> 01:45:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and I just wanted to
 
01:45:10.589 --> 01:45:10.599 align:start position:0%
dispells people hear that a and they're
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
like oh my goodness how can we do that
 
01:45:13.629 --> 01:45:13.639 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you so much appreciate it oh
 
01:45:15.390 --> 01:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
thank you are there further
 
01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for coming

01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
Association good morning good morning my
 
01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
name is marir I am the President of the
 
01:45:34.430 --> 01:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire athletic trainers
 
01:45:36.030 --> 01:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
Association thank you for allowing me
 
01:45:38.070 --> 01:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
some time this morning I do have written
 
01:45:40.709 --> 01:45:40.719 align:start position:0%
testimony but I will submit that for you
 
01:45:42.910 --> 01:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
um and I just wanted to address some of
 
01:45:44.109 --> 01:45:44.119 align:start position:0%
the questions that have come up that
 
01:45:45.629 --> 01:45:45.639 align:start position:0%
have not yet been answered by my
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
colleagues or um to embellish on them a
 
01:45:49.629 --> 01:45:49.639 align:start position:0%
little bit further uh so great question
 
01:45:53.070 --> 01:45:53.080 align:start position:0%
about um does the AED tell us what to do
 
01:45:55.870 --> 01:45:55.880 align:start position:0%
a and AED stands for automated um so
 
01:45:57.790 --> 01:45:57.800 align:start position:0%
there are certainly defibrillators in
 
01:45:59.830 --> 01:45:59.840 align:start position:0%
hospital settings that do not prompt you
 
01:46:01.390 --> 01:46:01.400 align:start position:0%
what to do but the ones that are out in
 
01:46:03.510 --> 01:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
the community um certainly do and walk
 
01:46:04.950 --> 01:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
you through those steps as well as the
 
01:46:07.310 --> 01:46:07.320 align:start position:0%
dispatcher um in contacting with
 
01:46:10.510 --> 01:46:10.520 align:start position:0%
911 um our folks at uh the Cory Stringer
 
01:46:13.189 --> 01:46:13.199 align:start position:0%
Institute with Becca um the data tells
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
us that in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
approximately 60% of schools have access
 
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
to an athletic trainer um so it's the um
 
01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:23.560 align:start position:0%
it's the athletic IC training
 
01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
association standpoint number one of
 
01:46:27.709 --> 01:46:27.719 align:start position:0%
course we're in favor of this bill um
 
01:46:30.830 --> 01:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
but furthermore we want to think about
 
01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:34.360 align:start position:0%
um Equity across the state in getting
 
01:46:36.070 --> 01:46:36.080 align:start position:0%
support to students at schools that do
 
01:46:38.390 --> 01:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
not have access to specially trained
 
01:46:40.109 --> 01:46:40.119 align:start position:0%
individuals uh like myself and my
 
01:46:42.589 --> 01:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
colleagues so um it's just important to
 
01:46:44.470 --> 01:46:44.480 align:start position:0%
realize that when we talk about our
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
examples with how the athletic training
 
01:46:48.950 --> 01:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
staff is going to get an AED to folks
 
01:46:50.709 --> 01:46:50.719 align:start position:0%
there is a number of schools inside our
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
state that the AED is not going to be
 
01:46:55.109 --> 01:46:55.119 align:start position:0%
coming from the athletic training staff
 
01:46:57.310 --> 01:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
and we're going to lean on other
 
01:46:59.390 --> 01:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in those schools in order
 
01:47:02.589 --> 01:47:02.599 align:start position:0%
to get this work done um so again that
 
01:47:05.070 --> 01:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
speaks to the multi-practice question um
 
01:47:06.750 --> 01:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
that was that was asked before what do
 
01:47:08.430 --> 01:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
we do when there's multiple things going
 
01:47:10.510 --> 01:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
on what do we do when there is not an
 
01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:12.320 align:start position:0%
athletic trainer that speaks to the
 
01:47:13.950 --> 01:47:13.960 align:start position:0%
importance of having those emergency
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
action plans be very very comprehensive
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
in their list of stakeholders part of
 
01:47:20.830 --> 01:47:20.840 align:start position:0%
the very first thing we have to do is
 
01:47:24.189 --> 01:47:24.199 align:start position:0%
identify who exactly who is present at
 
01:47:26.589 --> 01:47:26.599 align:start position:0%
these um at these events you know
 
01:47:28.950 --> 01:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's extra or co-curricular um
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
is clear on exactly what their job is
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
right down to who opens the gates to be
 
01:47:36.109 --> 01:47:36.119 align:start position:0%
able to get the ambulance onto a planing
 
01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
surface so there's a number of people
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
who are involved um who would be
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
identified and then of course um as
 
01:47:45.070 --> 01:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
we'll see in uh in that line 14 on part
 
01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
two they have to be rehearsed and the
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
rehearsal is really what I I many of our
 
01:47:50.030 --> 01:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
colleagues will tell you is the most
 
01:47:52.350 --> 01:47:52.360 align:start position:0%
important part the plan just can't exist
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
and be Lo locked away in a drawer we
 
01:47:55.189 --> 01:47:55.199 align:start position:0%
have to know what it is and we have to
 
01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
be able to do it um so spontaneous
 
01:47:59.950 --> 01:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
drilling is um is encouraged when we're
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
learning about emergency action plans um
 
01:48:03.990 --> 01:48:04.000 align:start position:0%
and follow up on the maintenance
 
01:48:05.950 --> 01:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
question where it said you know
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
maintenance would be required and we we
 
01:48:09.430 --> 01:48:09.440 align:start position:0%
were questioning who exactly is
 
01:48:12.109 --> 01:48:12.119 align:start position:0%
responsible for that maintenance um the
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
language here allows for the entity that
 
01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
needs to come up with that plan to have
 
01:48:18.629 --> 01:48:18.639 align:start position:0%
some autonomy in choosing who that
 
01:48:20.669 --> 01:48:20.679 align:start position:0%
person is based on their available
 
01:48:22.950 --> 01:48:22.960 align:start position:0%
resources um those of us who have
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
experience inside educational um
 
01:48:26.910 --> 01:48:26.920 align:start position:0%
facilities realized that most of us wear
 
01:48:28.990 --> 01:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
multiple hats um and we're pulled in
 
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
many many different directions so it
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely will depend on the
 
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
organization what those resources may or
 
01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
may not look like so I I appreciate that
 
01:48:39.310 --> 01:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
the language allows the school to have
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
or or the organization to have the
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
autonomy to make that choice um and
 
01:48:46.189 --> 01:48:46.199 align:start position:0%
lastly there was a question about um the
 
01:48:49.310 --> 01:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
nhi aa's um involvement so on the last
 
01:48:52.510 --> 01:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
iteration of this um we did work sorry
 
01:48:54.589 --> 01:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
go ahead thank you collaboratively with
 
01:48:57.589 --> 01:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
the nhiaa they are aware that we're here
 
01:48:59.510 --> 01:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
today as well as well as the New
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Ada um and last time the nhiaa
 
01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
was neutral on The Stance but they do um
 
01:49:08.750 --> 01:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
they do encourage this type of work um
 
01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
they do require that their coaches are
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
first aid CPR and AED trained so any um
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
any school that participates in the NHA
 
01:49:21.709 --> 01:49:21.719 align:start position:0%
is under that framework of expectation
 
01:49:23.470 --> 01:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
but again it's important to note that we
 
01:49:26.189 --> 01:49:26.199 align:start position:0%
have many um educational facilities and
 
01:49:28.070 --> 01:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
organizations that fall outside the
 
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the nhiaa so work like
 
01:49:34.270 --> 01:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
this also supports that schools in in
 
01:49:36.470 --> 01:49:36.480 align:start position:0%
those situations have access to the
 
01:49:38.430 --> 01:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
education and the resource and also
 
01:49:40.870 --> 01:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
their those requirements for training
 
01:49:42.030 --> 01:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time thank you very
 
01:49:44.030 --> 01:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
much other questions yes representative
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
being here and informing us um I think
 
01:49:52.709 --> 01:49:52.719 align:start position:0%
your statement was 60% of schools have
 
01:49:55.270 --> 01:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
athletic trainers and if I have that
 
01:49:57.030 --> 01:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
number correct is that a New Hampshire
 
01:49:59.870 --> 01:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
statistic and is it what grade level
 
01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
schools um I believe that the um the
 
01:50:07.030 --> 01:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
atlas survey does include some of the um
 
01:50:09.470 --> 01:50:09.480 align:start position:0%
Middle School aged so it probably starts
 
01:50:12.510 --> 01:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
around seventh grade I could be is that
 
01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
correct six okay yeah 7 through 12 um
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
and that is 60% is our own state number
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
yes thank you you're welcome further
 
01:50:23.550 --> 01:50:23.560 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee not see
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you so that I
 
01:50:27.629 --> 01:50:27.639 align:start position:0%
don't have any more pink cards so that
 
01:50:30.430 --> 01:50:30.440 align:start position:0%
closes this hearing for
 
01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
379 we'll take uh five minutes and start
 
01:50:36.109 --> 01:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
the next one up for those that need to
 
01:50:51.629 --> 01:50:51.639 align:start position:0%

eligibility for Education Freedom
 
02:02:01.109 --> 02:02:01.119 align:start position:0%

daily membership and residence
 
02:02:16.229 --> 02:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
representative or Senator Lang I'm back
 
02:02:17.709 --> 02:02:17.719 align:start position:0%
you read that title all over again it
 
02:02:20.310 --> 02:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
sounded really good no uh so I'm Senator
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
Tim Lang I serve Senate District 2 which
 
02:02:24.709 --> 02:02:24.719 align:start position:0%
is the Lakes Region on the west side of
 
02:02:27.109 --> 02:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
the lake uh CER Bradley covers the east
 
02:02:30.030 --> 02:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
side of the lake and Center Gray the
 
02:02:32.709 --> 02:02:32.719 align:start position:0%
south side of the lake anyway um so
 
02:02:34.830 --> 02:02:34.840 align:start position:0%
going talk about our favorite topic uh
 
02:02:38.750 --> 02:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
efas um this bill does four basic things
 
02:02:40.430 --> 02:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
um the first thing it does is raises
 
02:02:43.669 --> 02:02:43.679 align:start position:0%
eligibility from 350% to 400% of pover
 
02:02:45.510 --> 02:02:45.520 align:start position:0%
federal poverty level just to give you
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
an idea what that means and I'm sure
 
02:02:50.470 --> 02:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
you've all seen the uh the numbers but
 
02:02:55.390 --> 02:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
currently um for a family of two uh 350%
 
02:03:09.229 --> 02:03:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:12.990 --> 02:03:13.000 align:start position:0%
71,543 1800 to put that in
 
02:03:15.270 --> 02:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
perspective median incomes in the state
 
02:03:16.990 --> 02:03:17.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and this is by age
 
02:03:18.149 --> 02:03:18.159 align:start position:0%
population which is important because
 
02:03:19.709 --> 02:03:19.719 align:start position:0%
we're talking about families and you
 
02:03:21.310 --> 02:03:21.320 align:start position:0%
know probably under 25 we're not talking
 
02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
about a whole lot of families but over
 
02:03:26.229 --> 02:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
25 uh we are so the median 2024 income
 
02:03:34.390 --> 02:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:37.189 align:start position:0%
 
58,221

02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
58,221
 
02:03:43.270 --> 02:03:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:45.790 --> 02:03:45.800 align:start position:0%
14,313 and for 65 and all their median
 
02:03:48.589 --> 02:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:50.549 --> 02:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
$59,950 so again to give you a
 
02:03:52.950 --> 02:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
perspective um thinking about uh
 
02:03:56.030 --> 02:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
families uh two family households or two
 
02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
kids and and two parents as a
 
02:03:59.750 --> 02:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
four-person household again the meeting
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
incomes 101 um the um this bill would
 
02:04:06.830 --> 02:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
raise the EFA eligibility level to
 
02:04:09.709 --> 02:04:09.719 align:start position:0%
124 uh 800 so again we're aiming for
 
02:04:13.629 --> 02:04:13.639 align:start position:0%
that middle uh element uh 50% of the uh
 
02:04:17.629 --> 02:04:17.639 align:start position:0%
population median income um and making
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
them available I could you know that's
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
working poor if you're a family of four
 
02:04:24.270 --> 02:04:24.280 align:start position:0%
making a uh
 
02:04:28.109 --> 02:04:28.119 align:start position:0%
103,2 180 124,000 you have two kids
 
02:04:30.790 --> 02:04:30.800 align:start position:0%
that's a tight budget um having raised
 
02:04:32.910 --> 02:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
four kids myself so the first thing this
 
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
bill does is raise it to 400% the second
 
02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:37.679 align:start position:0%
thing this bill does is change the
 
02:04:39.350 --> 02:04:39.360 align:start position:0%
scholarship organizations um
 
02:04:41.310 --> 02:04:41.320 align:start position:0%
administrative costs dropping it from
 
02:04:43.470 --> 02:04:43.480 align:start position:0%
10% to
 
02:04:46.709 --> 02:04:46.719 align:start position:0%
8% the next thing this does is is to
 
02:04:48.629 --> 02:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
deal with the phase out grants as many
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
of you know in the first year of a phase
 
02:04:51.149 --> 02:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
out School gets a certain amount of
 
02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
money then next year when a student
 
02:04:55.030 --> 02:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
leaves for and participates in the EA
 
02:04:56.910 --> 02:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
program that public school still gets
 
02:04:59.950 --> 02:04:59.960 align:start position:0%
money um it gets 50% of of it and then
 
02:05:02.149 --> 02:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
the second year gets 25% even though the
 
02:05:03.950 --> 02:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
student doesn't go to that school any
 
02:05:06.310 --> 02:05:06.320 align:start position:0%
longer um this extends those phase out
 
02:05:10.790 --> 02:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
grants from ending in 2026 out to
 
02:05:13.069 --> 02:05:13.079 align:start position:0%
2029 the next thing this bill does is
 
02:05:14.709 --> 02:05:14.719 align:start position:0%
create a reporting requirement on
 
02:05:18.109 --> 02:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to um report out
 
02:05:21.709 --> 02:05:21.719 align:start position:0%
uh to the uh uh executive Governor's
 
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
Council uh and Council as well as a
 
02:05:25.350 --> 02:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee how much
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
money is being spent in the phase out
 
02:05:28.910 --> 02:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
Grant so how many public how much money
 
02:05:30.510 --> 02:05:30.520 align:start position:0%
are public schools getting for students
 
02:05:31.870 --> 02:05:31.880 align:start position:0%
that no longer exist because they've
 
02:05:33.950 --> 02:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
left the public school and and joined
 
02:05:37.310 --> 02:05:37.320 align:start position:0%
the EFA program
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
um sorry I apologize the next thing we
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
we do in this bill is just expanding uh
 
02:05:46.589 --> 02:05:46.599 align:start position:0%
again four public schools that we know
 
02:05:49.109 --> 02:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
that while efas are are very successful
 
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
there are some topics that are hard to
 
02:05:52.189 --> 02:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
teach in an EFA program
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to use high school physics
 
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
as an example um so if you have a
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
physics program what this would allow is
 
02:05:59.990 --> 02:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
an EFA student to attend to public
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
school and and give credit to that
 
02:06:05.149 --> 02:06:05.159 align:start position:0%
public school for 15% of a full-time
 
02:06:07.790 --> 02:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
student um in additional Revenue to that
 
02:06:09.149 --> 02:06:09.159 align:start position:0%
school to be able to support those
 
02:06:11.310 --> 02:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
programs that allow EFA students to come
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
in and it extends it as in a previous
 
02:06:15.069 --> 02:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
Bill uh all the way down to seventh
 
02:06:18.790 --> 02:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
grade through 12th grade um that's the
 
02:06:21.229 --> 02:06:21.239 align:start position:0%
Fast and the uh Furious of it I'm happy
 
02:06:22.830 --> 02:06:22.840 align:start position:0%
to take questions thank you very much
 
02:06:25.390 --> 02:06:25.400 align:start position:0%
Senator are there questions from the
 
02:06:28.109 --> 02:06:28.119 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing any thank you very
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
much represent Woodcock thank
 
02:06:36.229 --> 02:06:36.239 align:start position:0%
you sen Lang welcome um I'm looking at
 
02:06:39.030 --> 02:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
the uh physical
 
02:06:43.709 --> 02:06:43.719 align:start position:0%
note and it doesn't say what the cost
 
02:06:45.510 --> 02:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
would be raising it to
 
02:06:48.430 --> 02:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
400% it doesn't say
 
02:06:50.430 --> 02:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
anything can you give us an idea what
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
that might be
 
02:06:54.910 --> 02:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
uh so again my understanding and and
 
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
back of the envelope conversation so to
 
02:06:59.109 --> 02:06:59.119 align:start position:0%
speak is it would increase the cost of
 
02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
bfas by uh the current budget amount by
 
02:07:05.109 --> 02:07:05.119 align:start position:0%
about 25% and that may Mr go ahead and
 
02:07:08.589 --> 02:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
that would be what uh I'm doing again
 
02:07:10.109 --> 02:07:10.119 align:start position:0%
I'm hoping you know hold me hard to this
 
02:07:13.189 --> 02:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
number if the current cost is I would
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
say by $10 million roughly how much
 
02:07:18.430 --> 02:07:18.440 align:start position:0%
about $10 million
 
02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:19.990 align:start position:0%
about $10 million
roughly

02:07:19.990 --> 02:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
roughly
 
02:07:22.470 --> 02:07:22.480 align:start position:0%
oh again that's just trying to do math
 
02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:23.679 align:start position:0%
in my head really fast when you're
 
02:07:24.910 --> 02:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
asking me the questions so I could be
 
02:07:30.589 --> 02:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
off okay um just yeah thank you
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
uh is that is this budget in the budget
 
02:07:36.950 --> 02:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
for this year well again because this
 
02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:38.360 align:start position:0%
bill wouldn't take effect till next year
 
02:07:40.189 --> 02:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
be next year's budget so it has to
 
02:07:42.310 --> 02:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
budget and remember the you know as as
 
02:07:43.750 --> 02:07:43.760 align:start position:0%
the chairman of ways and means and the
 
02:07:45.229 --> 02:07:45.239 align:start position:0%
Senate I pay attention to revenues and
 
02:07:46.669 --> 02:07:46.679 align:start position:0%
what's going on remember the education
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
trust fund will have an estimate at the
 
02:07:52.229 --> 02:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
end of this year uh $212 million
 
02:07:54.669 --> 02:07:54.679 align:start position:0%
Surplus and that's still funding all of
 
02:07:56.470 --> 02:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
the current education funding costs that
 
02:07:59.229 --> 02:07:59.239 align:start position:0%
we have relative to EFA so uh even
 
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
though we've increased the cost of that
 
02:08:03.069 --> 02:08:03.079 align:start position:0%
has gone up we're still ending with a
 
02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
surplus in the in the education chest
 
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
fund and if I the last question thank
 
02:08:09.310 --> 02:08:09.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I I bring this up
 
02:08:11.390 --> 02:08:11.400 align:start position:0%
because of the Surplus in the education
 
02:08:13.549 --> 02:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
trust fund and the need as you're
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
indicating to moving this to 400% I'm
 
02:08:19.589 --> 02:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm wondering why particularly on
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means and you're happen to be
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
here the questions are terrific um why
 
02:08:29.470 --> 02:08:29.480 align:start position:0%
the meals Bill died in the table uh and
 
02:08:31.750 --> 02:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
was not funded for student meals when
 
02:08:34.709 --> 02:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
they're looking at 200 or 300% for kids
 
02:08:36.750 --> 02:08:36.760 align:start position:0%
who need as this is that came to your
 
02:08:39.030 --> 02:08:39.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh thank you for your question
 
02:08:40.430 --> 02:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that bill came to my
 
02:08:42.350 --> 02:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
committee that would have probably went
 
02:08:44.430 --> 02:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
to I don't recall oh it did actually but
 
02:08:45.629 --> 02:08:45.639 align:start position:0%
not as ways and means I'm like that
 
02:08:47.149 --> 02:08:47.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't in my ways of means that was my
 
02:08:49.510 --> 02:08:49.520 align:start position:0%
education committee side right education
 
02:08:52.390 --> 02:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
committee again um if you remember we
 
02:08:54.870 --> 02:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
had a commission that studied that and
 
02:08:56.990 --> 02:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
recommended future legislation that bill
 
02:08:58.229 --> 02:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
that was brought forward wasn't
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the recommendations of
 
02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:01.470 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with the recommendations of
that

02:09:01.470 --> 02:09:01.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:09:05.390 --> 02:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative Heath
 
02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have a a question
 
02:09:10.790 --> 02:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr representative
 
02:09:14.229 --> 02:09:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative L
 
02:09:17.589 --> 02:09:17.599 align:start position:0%
um we've had efas in in place for a
 
02:09:20.950 --> 02:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
while as we have probably over 10,000
 
02:09:22.470 --> 02:09:22.480 align:start position:0%
children being
 
02:09:26.069 --> 02:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
homeschooled and um I'm a long-term
 
02:09:28.189 --> 02:09:28.199 align:start position:0%
educator and over the years I've seen
 
02:09:31.709 --> 02:09:31.719 align:start position:0%
many unfortunate things come across the
 
02:09:33.390 --> 02:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
the roles
 
02:09:38.549 --> 02:09:38.559 align:start position:0%
um can you explain to me how in fact you
 
02:09:40.910 --> 02:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
can assure the safety of all the
 
02:09:43.950 --> 02:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
children participating in an EFA that
 
02:09:45.629 --> 02:09:45.639 align:start position:0%
you know that they're in a safe and
 
02:09:47.910 --> 02:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
healthy environment and indeed they're
 
02:09:52.030 --> 02:09:52.040 align:start position:0%
getting the kind of objective education
 
02:09:55.350 --> 02:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
that that we would like our public
 
02:09:57.950 --> 02:09:57.960 align:start position:0%
taxpayer money being spent on so thank
 
02:10:00.229 --> 02:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
you for your question so again I think
 
02:10:01.950 --> 02:10:01.960 align:start position:0%
first off if you look at the court right
 
02:10:04.870 --> 02:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
the court the court presumption in the
 
02:10:06.189 --> 02:10:06.199 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire is that every
 
02:10:08.589 --> 02:10:08.599 align:start position:0%
parent's a fit parent so as legislators
 
02:10:11.030 --> 02:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
we should take that same um as a
 
02:10:12.549 --> 02:10:12.559 align:start position:0%
legislative body at branch of government
 
02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
we should take that same position that
 
02:10:16.470 --> 02:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
the presumption is that every parent is
 
02:10:18.030 --> 02:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
a fit parent it's up to the state to
 
02:10:22.270 --> 02:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
prove otherwise um so I would argue that
 
02:10:24.350 --> 02:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
I every parent is a fit parent just just
 
02:10:26.669 --> 02:10:26.679 align:start position:0%
as the court says every on a Case by
 
02:10:29.629 --> 02:10:29.639 align:start position:0%
case Cas students do have under in home
 
02:10:32.390 --> 02:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
school as well as uh public private
 
02:10:34.390 --> 02:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
school there are some standards they
 
02:10:35.990 --> 02:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
have to meet it's not just a free-for
 
02:10:37.870 --> 02:10:37.880 align:start position:0%
all there are assessments that have to
 
02:10:41.709 --> 02:10:41.719 align:start position:0%
be met or um and I apologize I don't
 
02:10:43.109 --> 02:10:43.119 align:start position:0%
remember off the top of what it's called
 
02:10:45.390 --> 02:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
but there's a where an educator will go
 
02:10:47.390 --> 02:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
in and look at a portfolio of a child
 
02:10:48.990 --> 02:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
and certify that the child's meet and
 
02:10:51.270 --> 02:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
need the educational requirements are
 
02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
remind you that New Hampshire has a
 
02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
compulsory education requirement right
 
02:10:57.709 --> 02:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
we require every student has to go to
 
02:10:59.870 --> 02:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
school right so the question you're
 
02:11:02.510 --> 02:11:02.520 align:start position:0%
asking is do I think that that only
 
02:11:04.669 --> 02:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
means public school and that when we
 
02:11:06.229 --> 02:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
talk about the word cherished in our
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution that we talk about only
 
02:11:09.709 --> 02:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
cherishing for public school purposes or
 
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
do we just cherish the child in general
 
02:11:13.270 --> 02:11:13.280 align:start position:0%
and all children in the state of New
 
02:11:14.629 --> 02:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire regardless of their family's
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
income and for me I I I cherish all
 
02:11:19.950 --> 02:11:19.960 align:start position:0%
children so I think the state because it
 
02:11:22.430 --> 02:11:22.440 align:start position:0%
set the obligation to have a mandatory
 
02:11:24.830 --> 02:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
compulsory education should cherish all
 
02:11:26.750 --> 02:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
students in all forms of Education that
 
02:11:28.430 --> 02:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
works for that child because that's
 
02:11:30.549 --> 02:11:30.559 align:start position:0%
what's in the best interest of that
 
02:11:32.510 --> 02:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
child further questions from the
 
02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
02:11:36.910 --> 02:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
02:11:39.310 --> 02:11:39.320 align:start position:0%
Senator L for being here um to follow up
 
02:11:40.629 --> 02:11:40.639 align:start position:0%
just a little bit on the last question
 
02:11:42.430 --> 02:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
when it comes to uh oversight of
 
02:11:44.990 --> 02:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
homeschooling communities and whatnot of
 
02:11:46.709 --> 02:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
course we have to look to our ultimate
 
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
law which is the constitution in New
 
02:11:50.350 --> 02:11:50.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm trying to remember the
 
02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
exact phrasing but would you suggest
 
02:11:55.870 --> 02:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
that the constitution of the State of
 
02:11:58.189 --> 02:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire says that we the
 
02:12:00.549 --> 02:12:00.559 align:start position:0%
government must maintain a constant
 
02:12:03.069 --> 02:12:03.079 align:start position:0%
oversight of the people or does it
 
02:12:05.470 --> 02:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
suggest that the people should actually
 
02:12:07.589 --> 02:12:07.599 align:start position:0%
have a constant oversight of the
 
02:12:09.990 --> 02:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
government I'm sorry I don't quite
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
understand your question I the general
 
02:12:13.910 --> 02:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
the general principle is that people
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
oversight government not government
 
02:12:19.109 --> 02:12:19.119 align:start position:0%
oversight people thank you repr Miler
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Lang
 
02:12:24.830 --> 02:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
for being here I'm sure you're
 
02:12:27.229 --> 02:12:27.239 align:start position:0%
aware that in the last three years of
 
02:12:27.239 --> 02:12:28.030 align:start position:0%
aware that in the last three years of
this

02:12:28.030 --> 02:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:12:31.510 --> 02:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
program that the EFA program has been
 
02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
$28 million over budget are you aware of
 
02:12:37.470 --> 02:12:37.480 align:start position:0%
that I'm aware that's been a very
 
02:12:39.189 --> 02:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
successful program we had more children
 
02:12:40.910 --> 02:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
apply than we thought were going to
 
02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:42.840 align:start position:0%
apply but you're aware that it is over
 
02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
budget each of those years thank you the
 
02:12:47.990 --> 02:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
next question I have is are you aware
 
02:12:51.669 --> 02:12:51.679 align:start position:0%
that the uh Commissioner of Education is
 
02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
not allowing the LBA to do a full audit
 
02:12:58.589 --> 02:12:58.599 align:start position:0%
of how this money is being expended
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
through the uh agent that is monitoring
 
02:13:04.069 --> 02:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
this program are you aware of that thank
 
02:13:05.589 --> 02:13:05.599 align:start position:0%
you big question so I serve on that
 
02:13:07.589 --> 02:13:07.599 align:start position:0%
committee the the that that hearing was
 
02:13:09.229 --> 02:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
held in front of and the audit the audit
 
02:13:11.229 --> 02:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
committee I was present in the room when
 
02:13:13.069 --> 02:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
the commissioner spoke and I was pres in
 
02:13:14.589 --> 02:13:14.599 align:start position:0%
the room when the LBA spoke and I was
 
02:13:16.990 --> 02:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
presid in the room when the AG
 
02:13:19.629 --> 02:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
spoke what the commissioner said was he
 
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
will fulfill the law 1135 that was done
 
02:13:23.950 --> 02:13:23.960 align:start position:0%
he will provide the information within
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
his control that he's he's authorized to
 
02:13:28.870 --> 02:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
release also within the contract law of
 
02:13:30.669 --> 02:13:30.679 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire um that he's
 
02:13:32.390 --> 02:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
authorized to release the Attorney
 
02:13:34.030 --> 02:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
General backed him up on there are
 
02:13:36.549 --> 02:13:36.559 align:start position:0%
certain data that by contract law we we
 
02:13:38.790 --> 02:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
can't do however what I will tell you in
 
02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
the latest update is Mike kanaine and
 
02:13:42.990 --> 02:13:43.000 align:start position:0%
the lb's office and the commission of
 
02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
Education have come to an agreement and
 
02:13:46.270 --> 02:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
that audit will be done and the audit
 
02:13:47.830 --> 02:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
will be completed so again the
 
02:13:49.549 --> 02:13:49.559 align:start position:0%
Commissioners always said that based on
 
02:13:51.870 --> 02:13:51.880 align:start position:0%
law both both the stat law and the
 
02:13:54.830 --> 02:13:54.840 align:start position:0%
contract law he will do the audit he
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
will provide all the information he's
 
02:13:58.750 --> 02:13:58.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to by law and by contract law
 
02:14:00.510 --> 02:14:00.520 align:start position:0%
that was clear in the public hearing it
 
02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:02.280 align:start position:0%
was just misrepresented everywhere else
 
02:14:03.910 --> 02:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
there are some things he does not have
 
02:14:06.030 --> 02:14:06.040 align:start position:0%
the authority to release and we can't
 
02:14:09.390 --> 02:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
force him to release that data so again
 
02:14:11.229 --> 02:14:11.239 align:start position:0%
I will say that the commissioner said
 
02:14:13.830 --> 02:14:13.840 align:start position:0%
clearly the law that the information he
 
02:14:15.830 --> 02:14:15.840 align:start position:0%
has that's within his control he will
 
02:14:17.669 --> 02:14:17.679 align:start position:0%
release the information that's
 
02:14:19.270 --> 02:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
contractually he's allowed to release he
 
02:14:21.149 --> 02:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
will release and that audit is going
 
02:14:22.790 --> 02:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
forward and there should be a letter
 
02:14:24.430 --> 02:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
coming from the LBA and the exe and the
 
02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner stating that
 
02:14:30.510 --> 02:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
clearly representative uh yes
 
02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
representative uh cascaden thank you Mr
 
02:14:34.430 --> 02:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
chair uh thank you for being here
 
02:14:37.790 --> 02:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang um you talk about on line
 
02:14:42.350 --> 02:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
19 of page one talks about reporting
 
02:14:45.629 --> 02:14:45.639 align:start position:0%
requirements and I guess my question is
 
02:14:48.310 --> 02:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
we are all very um interested in making
 
02:14:52.069 --> 02:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
sure all our kids make good Pro progress
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
why wouldn't you have a bullet there to
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
report out academic achievement if these
 
02:14:59.990 --> 02:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
students are receiving public
 
02:15:02.430 --> 02:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
monies so thank you big question again
 
02:15:03.870 --> 02:15:03.880 align:start position:0%
this was relative to phase out the
 
02:15:05.270 --> 02:15:05.280 align:start position:0%
extension of the phase out grants we
 
02:15:07.390 --> 02:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
felt if we were extending the phas out
 
02:15:09.669 --> 02:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
grants that the Department of Education
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
should let us know how much money is
 
02:15:13.229 --> 02:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
being spent on that topic on on the
 
02:15:14.990 --> 02:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
phase out grants so this was to create a
 
02:15:17.030 --> 02:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
clear reporting process because in fact
 
02:15:19.750 --> 02:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
we're changing that law um and that as
 
02:15:21.390 --> 02:15:21.400 align:start position:0%
we extend out the phase out grants that
 
02:15:23.669 --> 02:15:23.679 align:start position:0%
will give give Public Schools money for
 
02:15:24.910 --> 02:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
kids that are no longer in their
 
02:15:27.629 --> 02:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
District um that have moved on will
 
02:15:29.030 --> 02:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
continue to give them money we want to
 
02:15:30.510 --> 02:15:30.520 align:start position:0%
know how much money that was that looked
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
like follow up follow up um so that
 
02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't my question my question is why
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
would you not want to make academic
 
02:15:40.149 --> 02:15:40.159 align:start position:0%
achievement public in a reporting for
 
02:15:42.229 --> 02:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
students who access these funds so thank
 
02:15:43.790 --> 02:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
you for that again it wasn't a focus of
 
02:15:47.709 --> 02:15:47.719 align:start position:0%
the Bill thank you further questions yes
 
02:15:50.030 --> 02:15:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative pno thank you Mr chair
 
02:15:51.950 --> 02:15:51.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you for my question Senator
 
02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:54.310 align:start position:0%
and thank you for my question Senator
Lang

Lang
 
02:15:56.629 --> 02:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
um it's come to my attention that there
 
02:15:58.750 --> 02:15:58.760 align:start position:0%
are several families who are waiting for
 
02:16:01.510 --> 02:16:01.520 align:start position:0%
the um income cap on efas to be
 
02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
increased so that they can participate
 
02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any families that are
 
02:16:08.910 --> 02:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
waiting for this to occur considering
 
02:16:10.910 --> 02:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
literally I just left a couple minutes
 
02:16:13.069 --> 02:16:13.079 align:start position:0%
ago the 500% Bill downstairs and the
 
02:16:14.470 --> 02:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
testimony that was going on with that
 
02:16:16.910 --> 02:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
yes I've heard from families that uh are
 
02:16:18.910 --> 02:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
are in waiting list to be able to get to
 
02:16:21.149 --> 02:16:21.159 align:start position:0%
schools that meet their child's needs
 
02:16:23.310 --> 02:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
and because and they're waiting for the
 
02:16:25.470 --> 02:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
uh income verification to move up again
 
02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:26.920 align:start position:0%
these are working families there were
 
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
some good examples down there about a
 
02:16:30.830 --> 02:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
dental hygienist and a janitor who might
 
02:16:32.469 --> 02:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
be married and how much money they make
 
02:16:33.990 --> 02:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
and whether they're eligible to be able
 
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
to provide an education that fits their
 
02:16:38.110 --> 02:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
child other than a public school uh
 
02:16:41.870 --> 02:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
model and um and again the testimony was
 
02:16:44.669 --> 02:16:44.679 align:start position:0%
that this bill even the 400% I think
 
02:16:46.070 --> 02:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
would have done it but the 500% would
 
02:16:48.230 --> 02:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
definitely do it um move those families
 
02:16:50.589 --> 02:16:50.599 align:start position:0%
that I consider you know you know the
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
old oldfashioned middle class we used to
 
02:16:54.509 --> 02:16:54.519 align:start position:0%
talk about the Working Families that
 
02:16:56.309 --> 02:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
probably still are maybe not quite
 
02:16:57.910 --> 02:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
paycheck to paycheck but pretty darn
 
02:16:59.990 --> 02:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
close to paycheck to paycheck type of it
 
02:17:01.469 --> 02:17:01.479 align:start position:0%
would give them that flexibility to be
 
02:17:03.709 --> 02:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
able to go and and one thing I'd remind
 
02:17:05.629 --> 02:17:05.639 align:start position:0%
everybody is that again when we give
 
02:17:07.549 --> 02:17:07.559 align:start position:0%
assistance to these families and we take
 
02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
away that cost to the family that just
 
02:17:12.230 --> 02:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
increases again if they're living
 
02:17:14.389 --> 02:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
paycheck to paycheck it gives them
 
02:17:16.150 --> 02:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
better food security better better
 
02:17:17.669 --> 02:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
housing security because there's more
 
02:17:19.990 --> 02:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
money freed up for them to be able to
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
provide food for their children and
 
02:17:23.230 --> 02:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
housing for their children they may have
 
02:17:25.150 --> 02:17:25.160 align:start position:0%
sacrificed um in order to get their
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
child into an an education service that
 
02:17:28.870 --> 02:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
works for them and the parents have
 
02:17:30.950 --> 02:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
sacrifice just just eases that burden in
 
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
that sacrifice just a little bit again
 
02:17:34.629 --> 02:17:34.639 align:start position:0%
increasing the ability for them to put
 
02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:36.399 align:start position:0%
food on their table for their
 
02:17:36.399 --> 02:17:38.389 align:start position:0%
food on their table for their
children

02:17:38.389 --> 02:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:17:41.469 --> 02:17:41.479 align:start position:0%
yes thank you so your your examples are
 
02:17:43.469 --> 02:17:43.479 align:start position:0%
families who are already making
 
02:17:46.349 --> 02:17:46.359 align:start position:0%
sacrifices by working two jobs to put
 
02:17:48.549 --> 02:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
food on their tables for their children
 
02:17:51.429 --> 02:17:51.439 align:start position:0%
absolutely representa Tanner thank you
 
02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking mine does this
 
02:17:53.160 --> 02:17:54.270 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking mine does this
still

02:17:54.270 --> 02:17:54.280 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:17:56.950 --> 02:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
remain uh that they only have to make
 
02:17:59.790 --> 02:17:59.800 align:start position:0%
that qualification of income level when
 
02:18:03.870 --> 02:18:03.880 align:start position:0%
they initially apply and if their fiscal
 
02:18:06.870 --> 02:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
or their income changes over the period
 
02:18:09.389 --> 02:18:09.399 align:start position:0%
of time that that the child can take the
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
parents can take the voucher for the
 
02:18:13.629 --> 02:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
child um which goes up I believe until
 
02:18:13.639 --> 02:18:14.790 align:start position:0%
child um which goes up I believe until
they're

02:18:14.790 --> 02:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:18:18.389 --> 02:18:18.399 align:start position:0%
21 um it doesn't ever recheck that so
 
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
they may start out at at the the 400%
 
02:18:24.509 --> 02:18:24.519 align:start position:0%
level but if their income increases it
 
02:18:27.429 --> 02:18:27.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't above that it doesn't make any
 
02:18:29.110 --> 02:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
difference they continue on the voucher
 
02:18:32.110 --> 02:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
program thank you
 
02:18:34.830 --> 02:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
yes further represent
 
02:18:37.030 --> 02:18:37.040 align:start position:0%
Damon thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
02:18:40.389 --> 02:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question excuse me so at the
 
02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
beginning of your introduction I believe
 
02:18:45.990 --> 02:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
your statement was we know efas are very
 
02:18:47.950 --> 02:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
successful I would like you to please
 
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
tell us um what your definition of
 
02:18:53.070 --> 02:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
successful in this context is and how
 
02:18:55.070 --> 02:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
we're measuring that sure thank you for
 
02:18:57.429 --> 02:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
the question so again I think the
 
02:19:00.910 --> 02:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
original statement of um the fact that
 
02:19:02.990 --> 02:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
families are are recognizing the need
 
02:19:05.629 --> 02:19:05.639 align:start position:0%
for this program right they they see the
 
02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
need for this program and it's helping
 
02:19:09.549 --> 02:19:09.559 align:start position:0%
it's helping them again if you've had
 
02:19:11.230 --> 02:19:11.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm sure this committee has had EFA
 
02:19:13.230 --> 02:19:13.240 align:start position:0%
testimony and had child after child come
 
02:19:16.469 --> 02:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
up and talk about how successful their
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
um actual implementation of efas have
 
02:19:21.309 --> 02:19:21.319 align:start position:0%
been for them how they how they've done
 
02:19:22.669 --> 02:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
and what they've done we just had it
 
02:19:24.190 --> 02:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
again we just had a 500 Bill downstairs
 
02:19:25.910 --> 02:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
and we had several children come in and
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
speak about how it made a difference to
 
02:19:30.669 --> 02:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
them moving from a public school to a to
 
02:19:33.429 --> 02:19:33.439 align:start position:0%
a a a a different school that worked for
 
02:19:35.469 --> 02:19:35.479 align:start position:0%
them that was unique that fit their
 
02:19:37.790 --> 02:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
unique model um and their unique needs
 
02:19:39.990 --> 02:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
and so I'd argue that a I'm sure you've
 
02:19:41.669 --> 02:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
heard that testimony so that's
 
02:19:43.549 --> 02:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
successful to me when a kid walks in and
 
02:19:47.190 --> 02:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
says I like school um that is hugely
 
02:19:48.349 --> 02:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
different than a kid who walks to a
 
02:19:49.510 --> 02:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
public school and says I wish I could
 
02:19:52.870 --> 02:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
leave here um and and that testimony so
 
02:19:56.190 --> 02:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
um again I'd argue that successful to me
 
02:19:57.630 --> 02:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
is the fact that we're having students
 
02:20:01.150 --> 02:20:01.160 align:start position:0%
engaged in um in this program parents
 
02:20:02.630 --> 02:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
are engaging in this program and that
 
02:20:05.230 --> 02:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
makes it successful and then again we
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
have an oversight committee that's
 
02:20:08.349 --> 02:20:08.359 align:start position:0%
that's working and I met yesterday as a
 
02:20:09.750 --> 02:20:09.760 align:start position:0%
matter of fact again the Ed the
 
02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account oversight
 
02:20:13.309 --> 02:20:13.319 align:start position:0%
committee met yesterday um we do have
 
02:20:15.150 --> 02:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
standards in place for these schools
 
02:20:16.910 --> 02:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
again that they have to take they either
 
02:20:18.750 --> 02:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
have to have a portfolio reviewed by a
 
02:20:21.510 --> 02:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
certified teacher um uh and I there's
 
02:20:22.990 --> 02:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
three mechanisms I can't remember I'm
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
sure the chairman could site them off
 
02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
the top of his head but I don't remember
 
02:20:28.469 --> 02:20:28.479 align:start position:0%
them off the top of my head um that
 
02:20:30.550 --> 02:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
review student portfolios at the end of
 
02:20:31.870 --> 02:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
the year to show that the students
 
02:20:34.590 --> 02:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
making progress are
 
02:20:37.429 --> 02:20:37.439 align:start position:0%
successful yeah the three are you have a
 
02:20:39.750 --> 02:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
portfolio review by a certified teacher
 
02:20:42.389 --> 02:20:42.399 align:start position:0%
or or a teacher that's working with kids
 
02:20:44.309 --> 02:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
the other one is you have the Statewide
 
02:20:46.349 --> 02:20:46.359 align:start position:0%
assessment and the other one is a norm
 
02:20:48.030 --> 02:20:48.040 align:start position:0%
referenced assessment which is a
 
02:20:49.750 --> 02:20:49.760 align:start position:0%
nationally Norm referenced assessment
 
02:20:52.230 --> 02:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
those are the three so those those those
 
02:20:54.349 --> 02:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
are metrics underneath that which a
 
02:20:56.270 --> 02:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
student is measured uh outside of the
 
02:20:58.469 --> 02:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
public school system uh reps and
 
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you uh s Lang just more
 
02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
on the EFA and not on the food question
 
02:21:09.950 --> 02:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
if I may uh you you U answered
 
02:21:11.670 --> 02:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative Damon here that your
 
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
determination of success was that the
 
02:21:16.429 --> 02:21:16.439 align:start position:0%
students were engaged and the parents
 
02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
were engaged so that was
 
02:21:21.750 --> 02:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
successful um is accurate assessment to
 
02:21:25.550 --> 02:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
say that around 80% of the of the
 
02:21:27.830 --> 02:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
families that are participating
 
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
initially in the efas were already
 
02:21:35.550 --> 02:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:38.429 --> 02:21:38.439 align:start position:0%
schools so I I don't know the exact
 
02:21:39.710 --> 02:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
numbers I won't say a percentage because
 
02:21:41.110 --> 02:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
I don't I haven't reviewed it recently
 
02:21:42.429 --> 02:21:42.439 align:start position:0%
to see what this year's numbers were I
 
02:21:43.670 --> 02:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
remember last year's numbers but not
 
02:21:47.110 --> 02:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
this year's um I I'll remind you again
 
02:21:49.790 --> 02:21:49.800 align:start position:0%
right these are all families and again
 
02:21:51.950 --> 02:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
last year was 300% of poverty this year
 
02:21:54.990 --> 02:21:55.000 align:start position:0%
is at 350% of poverty next year if this
 
02:21:56.710 --> 02:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
bill passes be 400% but we're talking
 
02:21:59.190 --> 02:21:59.200 align:start position:0%
about families at 300% of poverty level
 
02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:01.720 align:start position:0%
right so again any money we give them to
 
02:22:03.030 --> 02:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
help them with their educational need
 
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
even if they are sacrificing now only
 
02:22:08.270 --> 02:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
goes to make that child's home life
 
02:22:11.710 --> 02:22:11.720 align:start position:0%
better just follow up Mr chairman yes
 
02:22:15.469 --> 02:22:15.479 align:start position:0%
follow please so the question C Lang was
 
02:22:17.469 --> 02:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
even using last year's numbers the
 
02:22:20.630 --> 02:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
things we heard from the doe we're still
 
02:22:24.429 --> 02:22:24.439 align:start position:0%
looking last year at 350 at 80% of those
 
02:22:26.230 --> 02:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
youngsters enrolled I'm not suggesting
 
02:22:29.710 --> 02:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
they aren't happy uh in their parochial
 
02:22:33.030 --> 02:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
schools but these aren't students who
 
02:22:34.469 --> 02:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
came from public schools because they
 
02:22:36.830 --> 02:22:36.840 align:start position:0%
were dissatisfied I'm not kind of homes
 
02:22:38.070 --> 02:22:38.080 align:start position:0%
school students that are whole different
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
pieces you're talking about so it's not
 
02:22:41.710 --> 02:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
like the when you're using the
 
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
measurement that the only criteria is
 
02:22:46.070 --> 02:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
students engaged and successful parents
 
02:22:48.550 --> 02:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
engaged successful but they were already
 
02:22:49.830 --> 02:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
engaged they were already going
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
somewhere else Cana public school so so
 
02:22:56.070 --> 02:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
again I'm just going to say that you're
 
02:22:58.550 --> 02:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
right that they were that that a portion
 
02:22:59.910 --> 02:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
of the students current in the current
 
02:23:01.950 --> 02:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
EFA program were going but again last
 
02:23:03.190 --> 02:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
year's numbers would have been years
 
02:23:05.230 --> 02:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
before numbers based some 300% of
 
02:23:07.950 --> 02:23:07.960 align:start position:0%
poverty not 350 so remember reporting
 
02:23:10.910 --> 02:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
requirements so it's up 300% of poverty
 
02:23:13.790 --> 02:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
again um and I don't have the number for
 
02:23:17.429 --> 02:23:17.439 align:start position:0%
go ahead 300% poverty but again I'd I'd
 
02:23:20.870 --> 02:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
argue and say that those parents were
 
02:23:22.670 --> 02:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
sacrifices and they were doing it
 
02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
because in the best interest of their
 
02:23:25.950 --> 02:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
child and we made those sacrifices a
 
02:23:28.110 --> 02:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
little bit softer by allowing them to be
 
02:23:29.910 --> 02:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
able to participate again making the
 
02:23:31.750 --> 02:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
likelihood that they were able to put
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
food on their table that much easier
 
02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
which I think is something we should you
 
02:23:37.469 --> 02:23:37.479 align:start position:0%
know help with we did try to put food in
 
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
the table and that wasn't successful
 
02:23:41.230 --> 02:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
downstairs is that a followup
 
02:23:43.950 --> 02:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
question is that a follow-up question no
 
02:23:46.110 --> 02:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
just a statement thank you thank you uh
 
02:23:48.670 --> 02:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
representative Pam thank you and thank
 
02:23:50.429 --> 02:23:50.439 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question again this is
 
02:23:52.590 --> 02:23:52.600 align:start position:0%
in regards to the phase out grants have
 
02:23:54.990 --> 02:23:55.000 align:start position:0%
we seen and and the need to extend them
 
02:23:57.269 --> 02:23:57.279 align:start position:0%
have we seen any school districts that
 
02:23:59.550 --> 02:23:59.560 align:start position:0%
have had such significant numbers of
 
02:24:02.750 --> 02:24:02.760 align:start position:0%
students fleeing for to utilize the
 
02:24:04.750 --> 02:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts that it's
 
02:24:08.950 --> 02:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
significantly affecting their funding we
 
02:24:12.590 --> 02:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
have not um but um again as some of you
 
02:24:13.870 --> 02:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
know I was the author of the education
 
02:24:15.230 --> 02:24:15.240 align:start position:0%
funding formula this year and we were
 
02:24:17.150 --> 02:24:17.160 align:start position:0%
looking at at student reductions and
 
02:24:18.790 --> 02:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
looking forward next 10 years we're
 
02:24:21.590 --> 02:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
anticipating 1% per year going forward
 
02:24:24.830 --> 02:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
um just a normal um decrements of of
 
02:24:27.030 --> 02:24:27.040 align:start position:0%
Education of Public School attendance um
 
02:24:29.590 --> 02:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
never mind that this additional uh where
 
02:24:31.309 --> 02:24:31.319 align:start position:0%
where things might move so again we want
 
02:24:32.950 --> 02:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
to be respectful of the fact that you
 
02:24:35.269 --> 02:24:35.279 align:start position:0%
can't turn on a dime uh public education
 
02:24:37.230 --> 02:24:37.240 align:start position:0%
government doesn't work that way and so
 
02:24:38.670 --> 02:24:38.680 align:start position:0%
we're giving a little bit of breathing
 
02:24:40.510 --> 02:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
room to allow these public schools to be
 
02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
able to adapt their um spending to match
 
02:24:45.910 --> 02:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
to match their actual enrollment but
 
02:24:47.910 --> 02:24:47.920 align:start position:0%
we're not trying to make them turn on a
 
02:24:50.910 --> 02:24:50.920 align:start position:0%
dime yes representative B Bon
 
02:24:52.269 --> 02:24:52.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:24:54.469 --> 02:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
taking my question I have a question
 
02:24:56.990 --> 02:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
about actually the funding mechanism
 
02:24:59.389 --> 02:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about um and when
 
02:25:03.429 --> 02:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
you talk about the 0.15 per people uh so
 
02:25:06.510 --> 02:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
if somebody takes an EFA Grant which on
 
02:25:07.950 --> 02:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
the average is uh
 
02:25:12.030 --> 02:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
$5,200 right now I think um if I I'm
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out the is that what
 
02:25:18.630 --> 02:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
the um the adma amount would be so at
 
02:25:22.309 --> 02:25:22.319 align:start position:0%
0.15 of 5 $200 is
 
02:25:26.269 --> 02:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
$780 uh per course um and does that
 
02:25:28.990 --> 02:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
money is that come is that additional
 
02:25:30.750 --> 02:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
money that the Department of Education
 
02:25:33.550 --> 02:25:33.560 align:start position:0%
is going to pay or does that come out of
 
02:25:36.590 --> 02:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
the awarded uh EFA So currently that
 
02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
would be additional money the Department
 
02:25:40.429 --> 02:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
of Education would have to pay um it
 
02:25:44.590 --> 02:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
would it would again be attached to um
 
02:25:47.070 --> 02:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
their annual ad Rick knows this number I
 
02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
I'm drawn off the blank but the ADM or
 
02:25:51.670 --> 02:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
adma the um or admr I don't remember
 
02:25:54.550 --> 02:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
which it is but um it allows that at the
 
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
end of the school year um for the
 
02:25:57.910 --> 02:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
because we all know that everything's
 
02:25:59.710 --> 02:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
reported off one year one budget cycle
 
02:26:02.710 --> 02:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
off one one year off um the reported
 
02:26:04.590 --> 02:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
number of full-time students or eligible
 
02:26:07.230 --> 02:26:07.240 align:start position:0%
students would be incremented by by 15%
 
02:26:09.030 --> 02:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
of the student for an EFA student that
 
02:26:10.710 --> 02:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
attended a public school so they would
 
02:26:14.429 --> 02:26:14.439 align:start position:0%
get an increased share of uh education
 
02:26:17.429 --> 02:26:17.439 align:start position:0%
funding and that would be based on um
 
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
again all of the metrics okay repr
 
02:26:23.469 --> 02:26:23.479 align:start position:0%
um so just to confirm that's additional
 
02:26:25.870 --> 02:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
money so the EFA would remain that
 
02:26:30.750 --> 02:26:30.760 align:start position:0%
amount what is there any um cap on how
 
02:26:34.030 --> 02:26:34.040 align:start position:0%
many classes uh one of these students
 
02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:37.790 align:start position:0%
many classes uh one of these students
could

02:26:37.790 --> 02:26:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:40.110 --> 02:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
take I get where you going with this I
 
02:26:42.469 --> 02:26:42.479 align:start position:0%
don't know the answer to your question
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't I think in order the
 
02:26:45.790 --> 02:26:45.800 align:start position:0%
qualify again I just I think I don't
 
02:26:47.950 --> 02:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
know what the rules say at what point a
 
02:26:49.550 --> 02:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
student becomes a full-time student and
 
02:26:51.710 --> 02:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
therefore would be knowledable for an
 
02:26:55.950 --> 02:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
EA just to so my where I was going and
 
02:26:57.750 --> 02:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
as you probably understand is that
 
02:27:00.389 --> 02:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
there's really no loss of the EA money
 
02:27:02.510 --> 02:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
that would be going to the family and
 
02:27:05.429 --> 02:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
yet uh the department would be providing
 
02:27:07.510 --> 02:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
additional funds to the school district
 
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
per course we want correct we want to
 
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
support our Public Schools as best we
 
02:27:14.150 --> 02:27:14.160 align:start position:0%
can further further
 
02:27:16.429 --> 02:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
questions not see any thank you very
 
02:27:20.469 --> 02:27:20.479 align:start position:0%
much Senator have a good afternoon uh
 
02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
Tim Horgan and I'm going to Institute
 
02:27:24.349 --> 02:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
the three minute rule from this point
 
02:27:27.150 --> 02:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
forward because the prime sponsor has
 
02:27:30.110 --> 02:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
presented y probably standing between
 
02:27:32.910 --> 02:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
you and lunch so I'm represent Timothy
 
02:27:35.230 --> 02:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
Horgan for straford County District 10
 
02:27:38.349 --> 02:27:38.359 align:start position:0%
which is the town of Duram so and I'm
 
02:27:40.309 --> 02:27:40.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill actually there's
 
02:27:42.630 --> 02:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
two sections that I like one
 
02:27:46.510 --> 02:27:46.520 align:start position:0%
um section three the uh reporting uh
 
02:27:48.550 --> 02:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
about the reporting oh well part about
 
02:27:50.389 --> 02:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
the reporting requirements um I'm not
 
02:27:51.990 --> 02:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
sure about the details but that seems
 
02:27:56.190 --> 02:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
like a reasonable idea um and actually
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
section two I really like which is it
 
02:28:02.110 --> 02:28:02.120 align:start position:0%
reduces the uh cut that the scholarship
 
02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
organization which is the children's
 
02:28:05.309 --> 02:28:05.319 align:start position:0%
scholarship fund of New Hampshire takes
 
02:28:08.429 --> 02:28:08.439 align:start position:0%
from 10% to 8% so I definitely applaud
 
02:28:10.230 --> 02:28:10.240 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of money we're
 
02:28:12.510 --> 02:28:12.520 align:start position:0%
giving giving them to administer the
 
02:28:14.830 --> 02:28:14.840 align:start position:0%
program they um don't seem to be
 
02:28:16.510 --> 02:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
struggling too much they were they're
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
their lobbyist was downstairs handing
 
02:28:19.870 --> 02:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
out those orange scarves although maybe
 
02:28:22.110 --> 02:28:22.120 align:start position:0%
they printed up tens of thousands of
 
02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
scars and just it's a sunk cost I don't
 
02:28:25.349 --> 02:28:25.359 align:start position:0%
know for sure but they were handing out
 
02:28:28.190 --> 02:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
those scars they bust those uh children
 
02:28:31.389 --> 02:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
ref Ling uh mentioned we're bust in from
 
02:28:33.870 --> 02:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
from L from from a school in lonia which
 
02:28:36.950 --> 02:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
is one of the major users of uh of of
 
02:28:39.070 --> 02:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
EFA grants certainly I think it's may
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
even be the largest non-religious user
 
02:28:45.150 --> 02:28:45.160 align:start position:0%
of EFA grants um so my main objection is
 
02:28:48.349 --> 02:28:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh first of all for reducing um
 
02:28:51.469 --> 02:28:51.479 align:start position:0%
increasing the uh reducing the uh income
 
02:28:55.870 --> 02:28:55.880 align:start position:0%
threshold from 350 to 400% um cuz I I
 
02:28:57.830 --> 02:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
and and I know any anywhere you anywhere
 
02:28:58.990 --> 02:28:59.000 align:start position:0%
you set this there going to be some
 
02:29:00.670 --> 02:29:00.680 align:start position:0%
families that are on the wrong side of
 
02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
the uh of the threshold that's
 
02:29:03.349 --> 02:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
unavoidable for any you know any
 
02:29:05.190 --> 02:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
entitlement program like this but I
 
02:29:08.190 --> 02:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
think uh raising it just given the many
 
02:29:11.230 --> 02:29:11.240 align:start position:0%
many problems with the program um which
 
02:29:13.870 --> 02:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
I think uh I think we go down the road
 
02:29:15.309 --> 02:29:15.319 align:start position:0%
we're going we're going to have a fiscal
 
02:29:17.230 --> 02:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
disaster you know we have this uh
 
02:29:19.429 --> 02:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
program that we keep ex keep expanding
 
02:29:21.870 --> 02:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
without much thought there's like a very
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
minimal oversight of it a lot of the
 
02:29:24.550 --> 02:29:24.560 align:start position:0%
oversight is turned over to this
 
02:29:26.469 --> 02:29:26.479 align:start position:0%
organization which even though it has
 
02:29:28.110 --> 02:29:28.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's name is in fact based in
 
02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
New York City in Midtown Manhattan um
 
02:29:34.030 --> 02:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
and which seems not to be hurting too
 
02:29:37.990 --> 02:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
much for money um and I also
 
02:29:40.150 --> 02:29:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh I think I just think that's a bad
 
02:29:41.670 --> 02:29:41.680 align:start position:0%
idea it's mostly just the whole program
 
02:29:43.469 --> 02:29:43.479 align:start position:0%
I think is a disaster waiting to happen
 
02:29:45.469 --> 02:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
and also there are a couple things you
 
02:29:47.710 --> 02:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
can but even that first section you
 
02:29:49.550 --> 02:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
could use that as a vehicle for fixing
 
02:29:52.510 --> 02:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
the problem that a family qualifies you
 
02:29:53.550 --> 02:29:53.560 align:start position:0%
you could get a kid probably in
 
02:29:55.950 --> 02:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
kindergarten qualify them and then 12
 
02:29:57.510 --> 02:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
years later they're still eligible even
 
02:29:59.710 --> 02:29:59.720 align:start position:0%
though in most cases the parents will be
 
02:30:02.750 --> 02:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
making uh more money than they did when
 
02:30:04.030 --> 02:30:04.040 align:start position:0%
when the kid was little since their
 
02:30:05.630 --> 02:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
lives are evolving their careers are
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
expanding along as the kids go through
 
02:30:10.710 --> 02:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
school and um this of course is also
 
02:30:12.510 --> 02:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
that would be that would be a gerain
 
02:30:13.830 --> 02:30:13.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment you could just pass it on your
 
02:30:16.910 --> 02:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
own if you want to do it and also this
 
02:30:18.510 --> 02:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
is a vehicle that would be appropriate
 
02:30:20.950 --> 02:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
if you have if you have second thoughts
 
02:30:23.790 --> 02:30:23.800 align:start position:0%
about how we treated the um hb212 the
 
02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
late art Ellison's lunch bill
 
02:30:29.150 --> 02:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
um that uh that's also a vehicle you
 
02:30:30.910 --> 02:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
could use if you feel like going ahead
 
02:30:32.429 --> 02:30:32.439 align:start position:0%
and uh and passing that because that was
 
02:30:35.790 --> 02:30:35.800 align:start position:0%
certainly um I suppose at least in my
 
02:30:37.190 --> 02:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
opinion that was just sort of an
 
02:30:39.590 --> 02:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
embarrassing situation there that we so
 
02:30:40.630 --> 02:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
I would I
 
02:30:42.830 --> 02:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
would anyway I oppos to build but there
 
02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
are a couple of things that are pretty
 
02:30:46.550 --> 02:30:46.560 align:start position:0%
good especially um reducing the amount
 
02:30:49.309 --> 02:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
of money that the CSF of of New
 
02:30:50.910 --> 02:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire gets so I guess i' be happy to
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you very much
 
02:30:54.469 --> 02:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative are there questions from
 
02:30:54.479 --> 02:30:55.590 align:start position:0%
representative are there questions from
the

02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:30:58.870 --> 02:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
committee oh repres yes represent wock
 
02:31:02.030 --> 02:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh president Hogan
 
02:31:04.070 --> 02:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
you seem to be pretty well versed uh
 
02:31:06.190 --> 02:31:06.200 align:start position:0%
every time you come here in uh the
 
02:31:07.910 --> 02:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
background of the bill and particularly
 
02:31:10.110 --> 02:31:10.120 align:start position:0%
entitlement programs do you know of any
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
entitlement programs that people can
 
02:31:14.309 --> 02:31:14.319 align:start position:0%
qualify for one year and safe for life
 
02:31:16.990 --> 02:31:17.000 align:start position:0%
oh absolutely not all of them I think
 
02:31:18.309 --> 02:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
all of them you do have to qualify at
 
02:31:20.190 --> 02:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
least once a year and you're required if
 
02:31:22.070 --> 02:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
your income increases you're supposed to
 
02:31:24.469 --> 02:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
usually supposed to report to the agency
 
02:31:26.309 --> 02:31:26.319 align:start position:0%
that's administering it which is um
 
02:31:28.950 --> 02:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
usually a government agency usually
 
02:31:30.790 --> 02:31:30.800 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah thanks further questions
 
02:31:32.469 --> 02:31:32.479 align:start position:0%

opposition of Senate Bill

442 um we represent K through2 Educators

across the state uh as well as public
university

02:32:17.910 --> 02:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
university
 
02:32:19.870 --> 02:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
employees private university employ
 
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
employees and town employees we are
 
02:32:23.750 --> 02:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
parents and grandparents of school
 
02:32:25.550 --> 02:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
children in New Hampshire as well as
 
02:32:27.630 --> 02:32:27.640 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers and we do oppose this
 
02:32:30.190 --> 02:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
bill uh every Grant State student has a
 
02:32:31.870 --> 02:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional right to a robust
 
02:32:33.630 --> 02:32:33.640 align:start position:0%
education through a public school
 
02:32:36.230 --> 02:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
district um this is not just our opinion
 
02:32:37.950 --> 02:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
this is something that has come down
 
02:32:39.710 --> 02:32:39.720 align:start position:0%
through court cases over the past 30
 
02:32:42.269 --> 02:32:42.279 align:start position:0%
years and that is a robust education
 
02:32:43.870 --> 02:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
with professional certified teachers and
 
02:32:46.150 --> 02:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
special Educators small class sizes
 
02:32:47.830 --> 02:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
school nurse and counselors and behavior
 
02:32:49.950 --> 02:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
Specialists well stocked School library
 
02:32:51.429 --> 02:32:51.439 align:start position:0%
plenty of opportunity for Hands-On
 
02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
experiential learning this must be
 
02:32:55.190 --> 02:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
equally robust in Berlin Franklin
 
02:32:57.150 --> 02:32:57.160 align:start position:0%
Claremont as it is in Bedford Windam and
 
02:32:59.230 --> 02:32:59.240 align:start position:0%
Hanover and the state has to fund this
 
02:33:01.030 --> 02:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
and the reason I'm bringing this up is
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
because as we all know tax revenue is
 
02:33:05.349 --> 02:33:05.359 align:start position:0%
limited and as the courts have found
 
02:33:07.670 --> 02:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
they put a number on this the state is
 
02:33:11.150 --> 02:33:11.160 align:start position:0%
short about 537 million a year in how it
 
02:33:13.950 --> 02:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
funds its public education so that that
 
02:33:16.349 --> 02:33:16.359 align:start position:0%
robust education is equally real for
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
students no matter what district they're
 
02:33:21.590 --> 02:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
in so funding and any Voucher
 
02:33:24.150 --> 02:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
Program gets in the way of making sure
 
02:33:25.910 --> 02:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
that opportunity is just as real for
 
02:33:27.269 --> 02:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
every single student no matter what
 
02:33:29.950 --> 02:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
district they're end expanding voucher
 
02:33:32.309 --> 02:33:32.319 align:start position:0%
programs will make it harder to fulfill
 
02:33:34.349 --> 02:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
your constitutional duty to all of those
 
02:33:36.309 --> 02:33:36.319 align:start position:0%
grand State students who have a right to
 
02:33:39.190 --> 02:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
a robust public education so raising the
 
02:33:43.389 --> 02:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
income cap from 350 to 400% as nice as
 
02:33:45.110 --> 02:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
it might be as much as you might want to
 
02:33:47.349 --> 02:33:47.359 align:start position:0%
do it just is not affordable just like
 
02:33:50.230 --> 02:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
we can't afford so we heard last week
 
02:33:54.110 --> 02:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
to free to feed kids free lunch in
 
02:33:55.790 --> 02:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
school no matter how hungry they might
 
02:34:00.309 --> 02:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
be we can't afford to do this um SB
 
02:34:04.309 --> 02:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
442 would increase spending on
 
02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
vouchers to 53.4 million a year
 
02:34:10.870 --> 02:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
potentially if all the people who are
 
02:34:13.469 --> 02:34:13.479 align:start position:0%
eligible under that new cap took it up
 
02:34:15.309 --> 02:34:15.319 align:start position:0%
with 30 million of that being new
 
02:34:18.309 --> 02:34:18.319 align:start position:0%
spending and um for students who are
 
02:34:19.990 --> 02:34:20.000 align:start position:0%
already in some kind of PR private
 
02:34:21.349 --> 02:34:21.359 align:start position:0%
educational setting whether that's
 
02:34:24.110 --> 02:34:24.120 align:start position:0%
private school home school or some
 
02:34:26.269 --> 02:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
learning pod or whatever setting they're
 
02:34:30.030 --> 02:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
in at a time when State revenues are
 
02:34:32.990 --> 02:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
already not coming in at projections so
 
02:34:35.870 --> 02:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
they're softening and um the existing
 
02:34:39.150 --> 02:34:39.160 align:start position:0%
surpluses are rapidly being spoken for
 
02:34:41.950 --> 02:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
with many important priorities we can't
 
02:34:45.590 --> 02:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
afford to expand this
 
02:34:48.070 --> 02:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
program is it a good use of our limited
 
02:34:50.790 --> 02:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
tax money that's a great question
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
because the record of educational
 
02:34:58.670 --> 02:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
achievement is not publicly reviewable I
 
02:35:00.469 --> 02:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
understand there are you know reviews
 
02:35:02.469 --> 02:35:02.479 align:start position:0%
being done but we the public don't get
 
02:35:06.030 --> 02:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
to see that so you can see how students
 
02:35:07.550 --> 02:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
at a public school not the individual
 
02:35:08.910 --> 02:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
students but can see overwhel how
 
02:35:11.070 --> 02:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
they're doing with this program we don't
 
02:35:13.910 --> 02:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
get to see what the success rate or
 
02:35:16.469 --> 02:35:16.479 align:start position:0%
non-success rate is and in other voucher
 
02:35:17.950 --> 02:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
programs when the data has been allowed
 
02:35:20.870 --> 02:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
to be studied the ACH achievement has
 
02:35:24.190 --> 02:35:24.200 align:start position:0%
been shown to be um academically
 
02:35:27.110 --> 02:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
disastrous worse than even the um
 
02:35:30.429 --> 02:35:30.439 align:start position:0%
disruptions of Hurricane Katrina or the
 
02:35:32.710 --> 02:35:32.720 align:start position:0%
disruptions of Co on schools and with
 
02:35:35.150 --> 02:35:35.160 align:start position:0%
that I will close here but I will email
 
02:35:36.830 --> 02:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
the testimony you can read the closing
 
02:35:38.590 --> 02:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph thank you very much are there
 
02:35:40.469 --> 02:35:40.479 align:start position:0%
questions representative dry then
 
02:35:41.710 --> 02:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
represent thank you very much thank you
 
02:35:44.269 --> 02:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um and how can we
 
02:35:46.349 --> 02:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
increase funding to vouchers if the only
 
02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
voucher program was repealed decades ago
 
02:35:50.349 --> 02:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
well we've had this conversation before
 
02:35:53.150 --> 02:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
and you know it's still a
 
02:35:56.510 --> 02:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
v represent Bel thank you Mr chair and
 
02:35:58.870 --> 02:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um you
 
02:36:01.790 --> 02:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
you estimate that this bill could um
 
02:36:04.630 --> 02:36:04.640 align:start position:0%
increase our spending on efas to roughly
 
02:36:07.710 --> 02:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
50 some odd million yep um you've
 
02:36:10.510 --> 02:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
described that as uh unaffordable we're
 
02:36:13.230 --> 02:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
currently awaiting a Supreme Court
 
02:36:14.990 --> 02:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
decision which may or may not uphold a
 
02:36:16.710 --> 02:36:16.720 align:start position:0%
lower court decision with a fiscal
 
02:36:20.190 --> 02:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
impact for taxpayers well north of a
 
02:36:22.790 --> 02:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
billion dollars which is perhaps 30 40
 
02:36:24.590 --> 02:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
50 times as much as this amount would
 
02:36:27.230 --> 02:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
you consider that to be affordable are
 
02:36:28.550 --> 02:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
you talking about the school funding
 
02:36:30.670 --> 02:36:30.680 align:start position:0%
lawsuit yes which is your constitutional
 
02:36:35.070 --> 02:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
children are you saying you you
 
02:36:40.710 --> 02:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
um want to
 
02:36:43.150 --> 02:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
D asking you the question would you
 
02:36:45.030 --> 02:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
consider that to be
 
02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
affordable I I'm saying you have
 
02:36:48.230 --> 02:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional obligation I expect you
 
02:36:52.830 --> 02:36:52.840 align:start position:0%
to meet it thank you very much uh repres
 
02:36:55.070 --> 02:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
luno thank you very much Mr chairman
 
02:36:57.070 --> 02:36:57.080 align:start position:0%
good timing for this question given the
 
02:37:00.269 --> 02:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
last one um you uh you refer to around
 
02:37:04.070 --> 02:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
$53 million of all the students um
 
02:37:05.790 --> 02:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
available you're talking about all the
 
02:37:07.389 --> 02:37:07.399 align:start position:0%
students who are currently attending
 
02:37:09.030 --> 02:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
private schools I'm talking all the
 
02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
students who would fit the demographic
 
02:37:12.230 --> 02:37:12.240 align:start position:0%
regardless of where they're attending
 
02:37:13.670 --> 02:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
whether they're in public school or in
 
02:37:17.190 --> 02:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
private school or in or in any sort of
 
02:37:19.269 --> 02:37:19.279 align:start position:0%
private educational setting I mean I I I
 
02:37:21.190 --> 02:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
just want to sort of follow on on that a
 
02:37:26.030 --> 02:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
little bit so if 400% is is roughly you
 
02:37:28.950 --> 02:37:28.960 align:start position:0%
know a little you know a little above a
 
02:37:30.990 --> 02:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
little around right around median
 
02:37:33.870 --> 02:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
household income
 
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
Statewide um I no no but yeah I I I do
 
02:37:40.990 --> 02:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
not know for sure if that is an accurate
 
02:37:42.910 --> 02:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
statement so I will not stipulate that
 
02:37:46.990 --> 02:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
but so so so it it's it's it's a round
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
media household uh income state and
 
02:37:52.790 --> 02:37:52.800 align:start position:0%
we've got 165,000 kids so half of them
 
02:37:54.269 --> 02:37:54.279 align:start position:0%
are on one side of that number half of
 
02:37:56.910 --> 02:37:56.920 align:start position:0%
them on the other side of that number so
 
02:38:01.110 --> 02:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
um so if all the students in that
 
02:38:04.950 --> 02:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
demographic it would be closer to like
 
02:38:09.870 --> 02:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
500 or $600 million if 80,000 kids
 
02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
82,000 kids uh went into the program the
 
02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
53 million my understanding is these
 
02:38:17.309 --> 02:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
These are kids that are that are already
 
02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
attending private schools and I mean
 
02:38:21.590 --> 02:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's where that numbered from that's
 
02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
been most of the experience so far
 
02:38:26.230 --> 02:38:26.240 align:start position:0%
though is that it's been but if but if
 
02:38:29.429 --> 02:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
but if every school every student who
 
02:38:32.349 --> 02:38:32.359 align:start position:0%
fell into that that that demographic
 
02:38:34.990 --> 02:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
left their private school public their
 
02:38:37.670 --> 02:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
public school and took a took an EFA
 
02:38:40.910 --> 02:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about adequacy the the
 
02:38:45.030 --> 02:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
$5,200 average cost for 82,000 students
 
02:38:47.550 --> 02:38:47.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be about right okay yeah
 
02:38:49.309 --> 02:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
true I mean that that's actually thank
 
02:38:53.269 --> 02:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
you than you for um you know correcting
 
02:38:56.510 --> 02:38:56.520 align:start position:0%
my unclear statement so we are not
 
02:38:58.670 --> 02:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
expecting all of these students who
 
02:38:58.680 --> 02:38:59.790 align:start position:0%
expecting all of these students who
could

02:38:59.790 --> 02:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:39:02.550 --> 02:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
possibly take it to leave public schools
 
02:39:06.389 --> 02:39:06.399 align:start position:0%
because most families want their kids in
 
02:39:08.870 --> 02:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
a public school where they're with all
 
02:39:10.830 --> 02:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
the children from their Community from
 
02:39:13.269 --> 02:39:13.279 align:start position:0%
their neighborhood where they are uh you
 
02:39:14.670 --> 02:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
with their friends from down the street
 
02:39:16.469 --> 02:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
and across the town where they're having
 
02:39:20.110 --> 02:39:20.120 align:start position:0%
these common experiences in community
 
02:39:24.349 --> 02:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
with other students from around them um
 
02:39:26.510 --> 02:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
most families want that common
 
02:39:29.469 --> 02:39:29.479 align:start position:0%
experience and they trust their local
 
02:39:31.110 --> 02:39:31.120 align:start position:0%
neighborhood public schools to educate
 
02:39:33.110 --> 02:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
their children and they are happy to
 
02:39:36.389 --> 02:39:36.399 align:start position:0%
have that so um the worst case scenario
 
02:39:38.630 --> 02:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
you're right is assuming that most of
 
02:39:41.790 --> 02:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
the students are already taking a u a
 
02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
private educational option in that
 
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
demographic between 350 and 400 would
 
02:39:52.590 --> 02:39:52.600 align:start position:0%
take up the option of getting money to
 
02:39:54.630 --> 02:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
help them with that option they're
 
02:39:56.630 --> 02:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
already exercising great thank you very
 
02:39:58.469 --> 02:39:58.479 align:start position:0%
much yeah further questions from the
 
02:40:00.990 --> 02:40:01.000 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing it thank you very
 
02:40:14.429 --> 02:40:14.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:17.349 --> 02:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
Hawkins thank you Mr chairman good
 
02:40:19.630 --> 02:40:19.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon I'll try and I know right
 
02:40:21.429 --> 02:40:21.439 align:start position:0%
before lunch so I'll try and be
 
02:40:26.030 --> 02:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
cognizant of that um I and not repeat uh
 
02:40:27.429 --> 02:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
what others have said for the record
 
02:40:29.190 --> 02:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
Brian Hawkins representing Nea New
 
02:40:32.150 --> 02:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today um first off I just like
 
02:40:34.110 --> 02:40:34.120 align:start position:0%
to say you know we just expanded the
 
02:40:35.790 --> 02:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility for this program not even
 
02:40:38.510 --> 02:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
one year ago um and here we are looking
 
02:40:41.830 --> 02:40:41.840 align:start position:0%
to expand again um it was already
 
02:40:41.840 --> 02:40:42.990 align:start position:0%
to expand again um it was already
mentioned

02:40:42.990 --> 02:40:43.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
02:40:45.309 --> 02:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
that there has not been an estimate for
 
02:40:47.750 --> 02:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
this program that has come in under or
 
02:40:51.190 --> 02:40:51.200 align:start position:0%
at budget um we're already over uh if
 
02:40:53.990 --> 02:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
you include um some of the most recent
 
02:40:55.990 --> 02:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
numbers we're probably at about $24.5
 
02:40:59.550 --> 02:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year on spending um
 
02:41:04.349 --> 02:41:04.359 align:start position:0%
and so uh and yesterday at the uh EFA
 
02:41:06.510 --> 02:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
oversight committee the from the
 
02:41:07.710 --> 02:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund they
 
02:41:09.190 --> 02:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
indicated at this point in the year
 
02:41:11.030 --> 02:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
there's an additional 500 applicants
 
02:41:12.110 --> 02:41:12.120 align:start position:0%
coming for the
 
02:41:14.750 --> 02:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
fall this is just April uh I'll just
 
02:41:16.710 --> 02:41:16.720 align:start position:0%
remind the committee this is a rolling
 
02:41:19.750 --> 02:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
application process and so that uh so
 
02:41:22.030 --> 02:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
we're there's still room to grow there
 
02:41:24.309 --> 02:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
and that is under the current uh budget
 
02:41:26.950 --> 02:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
and current um
 
02:41:30.349 --> 02:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
eligibility uh one other thing I just
 
02:41:32.710 --> 02:41:32.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned Senator Lang mentioned I think
 
02:41:35.750 --> 02:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
in his testimony that this would take
 
02:41:38.269 --> 02:41:38.279 align:start position:0%
effect in the next budget um this as I
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
read it unless I have the wrong version
 
02:41:43.190 --> 02:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
of this it says 60 days after passage um
 
02:41:45.550 --> 02:41:45.560 align:start position:0%
so we will be in the current budget
 
02:41:51.670 --> 02:41:51.680 align:start position:0%
until July excuse me June 30th of 20 25
 
02:41:55.429 --> 02:41:55.439 align:start position:0%
um uh performance was mentioned um I
 
02:41:57.750 --> 02:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
think it is premature to expand the
 
02:41:59.950 --> 02:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
program before we've seen the
 
02:42:02.230 --> 02:42:02.240 align:start position:0%
performance audit that was mentioned but
 
02:42:04.630 --> 02:42:04.640 align:start position:0%
also uh there were several things that
 
02:42:08.550 --> 02:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
um the uh education Freedom account
 
02:42:10.469 --> 02:42:10.479 align:start position:0%
oversight committee mentioned for their
 
02:42:13.110 --> 02:42:13.120 align:start position:0%
recommendations in their in their recent
 
02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
um report that the scholarship fund
 
02:42:17.469 --> 02:42:17.479 align:start position:0%
should be required to provide an endof
 
02:42:19.510 --> 02:42:19.520 align:start position:0%
year report and that that commit should
 
02:42:20.990 --> 02:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
Define what that is they haven't done
 
02:42:23.190 --> 02:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
that yet the committee should Define who
 
02:42:24.750 --> 02:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
are the program stakeholders they just
 
02:42:26.830 --> 02:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
started talking about that yesterday
 
02:42:29.110 --> 02:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
three identify current and future tool
 
02:42:31.230 --> 02:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
metrics for student performance and
 
02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
accountability including how the school
 
02:42:35.429 --> 02:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
and educational setting demonstrate
 
02:42:37.670 --> 02:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
accountability we haven't done that yet
 
02:42:40.030 --> 02:42:40.040 align:start position:0%
number four Define successful graduation
 
02:42:42.469 --> 02:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
versus program completion that has not
 
02:42:44.510 --> 02:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
been done and then an annual check for
 
02:42:47.510 --> 02:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
program eligibility number five and the
 
02:42:49.590 --> 02:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
Senate did talk about inserting
 
02:42:51.070 --> 02:42:51.080 align:start position:0%
something like that into this bill but
 
02:42:56.030 --> 02:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
they uh they did not um last thing I
 
02:42:56.040 --> 02:42:56.950 align:start position:0%
they uh they did not um last thing I
will

02:42:56.950 --> 02:42:56.960 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:43:00.070 --> 02:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
mention is there was a mention about the
 
02:43:02.950 --> 02:43:02.960 align:start position:0%
portfolio the portfolio can be looked at
 
02:43:06.269 --> 02:43:06.279 align:start position:0%
by a non-public school teacher as well
 
02:43:09.670 --> 02:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
as certified teacher so it uh it can be
 
02:43:11.630 --> 02:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
by a non-certified and that is selected
 
02:43:14.030 --> 02:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
by the parent so just wanted to close
 
02:43:16.870 --> 02:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
with a couple clarifying points and I
 
02:43:19.830 --> 02:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
will conclude there happy to take any
 
02:43:24.110 --> 02:43:24.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
questions uh represent
 
02:43:28.910 --> 02:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
belshire thank you Mr chair and thank
 
02:43:30.030 --> 02:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
you for being here and taking my
 
02:43:32.349 --> 02:43:32.359 align:start position:0%
question you mentioned that we we've
 
02:43:34.269 --> 02:43:34.279 align:start position:0%
recently expanded this program the CFA
 
02:43:36.670 --> 02:43:36.680 align:start position:0%
program and that's absolutely correct um
 
02:43:37.830 --> 02:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm I'm looking to kind of get to
 
02:43:40.670 --> 02:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
the heart of the issue of expanding the
 
02:43:43.710 --> 02:43:43.720 align:start position:0%
EFA program so given the fact that
 
02:43:45.950 --> 02:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
courts have upheld the fact that the EFA
 
02:43:48.309 --> 02:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
program is one leg or plank or whatever
 
02:43:51.150 --> 02:43:51.160 align:start position:0%
you want to call it of the methods by
 
02:43:52.790 --> 02:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
which New Hampshire residents can
 
02:43:54.670 --> 02:43:54.680 align:start position:0%
receive a public education because it's
 
02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
publicly funded what is the either legal
 
02:44:00.750 --> 02:44:00.760 align:start position:0%
principle or philosophical principle for
 
02:44:03.429 --> 02:44:03.439 align:start position:0%
limiting the funding of a public
 
02:44:06.190 --> 02:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
education to one group of citizens but
 
02:44:08.190 --> 02:44:08.200 align:start position:0%
not to another group of
 
02:44:12.150 --> 02:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
citizens um so I would have to uh go
 
02:44:14.230 --> 02:44:14.240 align:start position:0%
back and look at the uh Court decision
 
02:44:16.190 --> 02:44:16.200 align:start position:0%
there was a recent dismissal of a court
 
02:44:18.710 --> 02:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
decision that we were not a part of but
 
02:44:21.710 --> 02:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
um I don't believe that it stated that
 
02:44:23.710 --> 02:44:23.720 align:start position:0%
the that this
 
02:44:28.670 --> 02:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
program um met the obligation for um a
 
02:44:31.830 --> 02:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
an adequate education uh or or a public
 
02:44:34.510 --> 02:44:34.520 align:start position:0%
education in fact I think that was part
 
02:44:36.510 --> 02:44:36.520 align:start position:0%
of the reason that they Justified
 
02:44:38.510 --> 02:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
dismissing the case was that this
 
02:44:40.630 --> 02:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
program is an optional program it's not
 
02:44:43.670 --> 02:44:43.680 align:start position:0%
the required constitutional obligation
 
02:44:45.750 --> 02:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
um that we have to meet to every student
 
02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
and every student can uh cannot be
 
02:44:50.190 --> 02:44:50.200 align:start position:0%
discriminated by a public school like
 
02:44:53.429 --> 02:44:53.439 align:start position:0%
they can an EFA
 
02:44:55.469 --> 02:44:55.479 align:start position:0%
provider if I may just a real quick
 
02:44:56.990 --> 02:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
follow up on that given given that
 
02:44:59.349 --> 02:44:59.359 align:start position:0%
argument which I think is you know in
 
02:45:00.750 --> 02:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
keeping and logically consistent would
 
02:45:03.070 --> 02:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
you then argue that the EFA program
 
02:45:07.349 --> 02:45:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:10.710 --> 02:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
program I well not being a judge I'm not
 
02:45:12.590 --> 02:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
sure I can answer that question but I do
 
02:45:13.950 --> 02:45:13.960 align:start position:0%
have a lot of concerns about this
 
02:45:15.309 --> 02:45:15.319 align:start position:0%
program that I think I've mentioned
 
02:45:18.429 --> 02:45:18.439 align:start position:0%
before when testifying on this bill one
 
02:45:19.750 --> 02:45:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh Central
 
02:45:24.190 --> 02:45:24.200 align:start position:0%
constitutional uh question is um Can a
 
02:45:27.190 --> 02:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
state agency uh delegate rulemaking
 
02:45:30.429 --> 02:45:30.439 align:start position:0%
authority to a private entity and and at
 
02:45:34.110 --> 02:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
least uh as it appears they the state
 
02:45:37.030 --> 02:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
has given the department the ability to
 
02:45:39.870 --> 02:45:39.880 align:start position:0%
do that because it is the scholarship
 
02:45:42.590 --> 02:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
organization which can determine what is
 
02:45:47.230 --> 02:45:47.240 align:start position:0%
an educational expense and that very in
 
02:45:49.830 --> 02:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
my view would fall under
 
02:45:51.550 --> 02:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh something that should fall under the
 
02:45:53.670 --> 02:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
state's purview in in deciding that
 
02:45:56.349 --> 02:45:56.359 align:start position:0%
because we're spending uh public dollars
 
02:45:58.830 --> 02:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
so I guess there's one example where I
 
02:46:01.510 --> 02:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
would at the very least question the
 
02:46:05.469 --> 02:46:05.479 align:start position:0%
constitutionality of this program um not
 
02:46:07.750 --> 02:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
to mention the fact that uh president
 
02:46:09.150 --> 02:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
house mentioned early we we haven't
 
02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
fulfilled the Constitutional obligation
 
02:46:15.389 --> 02:46:15.399 align:start position:0%
for uh a public adequate education um
 
02:46:17.550 --> 02:46:17.560 align:start position:0%
yet and we're still working on that so I
 
02:46:18.990 --> 02:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
think we need to address that first
 
02:46:24.190 --> 02:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
first uh before we um continue to expand
 
02:46:27.070 --> 02:46:27.080 align:start position:0%
this uh this program thank you very much
 
02:46:27.080 --> 02:46:28.150 align:start position:0%
this uh this program thank you very much
represent

02:46:28.150 --> 02:46:28.160 align:start position:0%
represent
 
02:46:30.630 --> 02:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
Woodcock Mr H good afternoon good
 
02:46:33.150 --> 02:46:33.160 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you for being here uh
 
02:46:35.230 --> 02:46:35.240 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang in his
 
02:46:38.710 --> 02:46:38.720 align:start position:0%
presentation uh when was asked to Define
 
02:46:40.110 --> 02:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
if the program
 
02:46:42.230 --> 02:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
successful uh he said the students
 
02:46:43.870 --> 02:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
engaged in the parents are engaged and
 
02:46:47.070 --> 02:46:47.080 align:start position:0%
we know based on his numbers that 80%
 
02:46:49.950 --> 02:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
minimally have know come to public
 
02:46:52.590 --> 02:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
school um and I know that you have a
 
02:46:54.670 --> 02:46:54.680 align:start position:0%
background in public education and and
 
02:46:57.230 --> 02:46:57.240 align:start position:0%
in metrics would you seem that that' be
 
02:47:00.469 --> 02:47:00.479 align:start position:0%
a reasonable measurement of success in a
 
02:47:01.990 --> 02:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
public school program to say if the kids
 
02:47:05.070 --> 02:47:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:07.670 --> 02:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
engaged I think that if I understand
 
02:47:11.309 --> 02:47:11.319 align:start position:0%
your question correctly um we have a
 
02:47:14.710 --> 02:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
broad array of ways in which we define
 
02:47:18.990 --> 02:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
success in public education and
 
02:47:21.389 --> 02:47:21.399 align:start position:0%
it um while I mentioned assessments it
 
02:47:25.550 --> 02:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't fall only on test scores um and
 
02:47:28.870 --> 02:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
I think that is the central benefit to
 
02:47:30.110 --> 02:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
being able to
 
02:47:32.910 --> 02:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
offer uh a free public education to all
 
02:47:36.990 --> 02:47:37.000 align:start position:0%
students is that uh it can encor it can
 
02:47:41.510 --> 02:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
Encompass um more uh it can Encompass
 
02:47:46.590 --> 02:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
serving um that child and that family um
 
02:47:49.990 --> 02:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
Beyond just um you know in a assessment
 
02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
thank Youk you further questions from
 
02:47:54.190 --> 02:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
the committee represent
 
02:47:56.990 --> 02:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
luus I want to go back to something that
 
02:47:59.469 --> 02:47:59.479 align:start position:0%
you said thank you for answering my
 
02:48:03.150 --> 02:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
question if if a business isn't
 
02:48:05.349 --> 02:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
budgeting correctly do you blame the
 
02:48:07.950 --> 02:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
customers or the person who budgeted and
 
02:48:09.710 --> 02:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
would it not make sense instead of
 
02:48:12.750 --> 02:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
saying oh this was under budgeted to
 
02:48:15.150 --> 02:48:15.160 align:start position:0%
instead come up with a more reasonable
 
02:48:17.269 --> 02:48:17.279 align:start position:0%
budget I think the legislature should do
 
02:48:19.030 --> 02:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
more due diligence when it comes to this
 
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
program I um you know one of the things
 
02:48:24.670 --> 02:48:24.680 align:start position:0%
that uh I think many people in the
 
02:48:26.870 --> 02:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
public have struggled with was the fact
 
02:48:30.309 --> 02:48:30.319 align:start position:0%
that uh we we sent um the bill that was
 
02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
heard in the Senate um this morning um
 
02:48:35.870 --> 02:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
without it having gone to the house
 
02:48:37.870 --> 02:48:37.880 align:start position:0%
finance committee in fact I don't think
 
02:48:39.710 --> 02:48:39.720 align:start position:0%
there has been an EFA Bill since its
 
02:48:41.710 --> 02:48:41.720 align:start position:0%
Inception which has gone to the house
 
02:48:44.150 --> 02:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
finance committee um as a standalone
 
02:48:47.870 --> 02:48:47.880 align:start position:0%
Bill uh and I think that is partly why
 
02:48:50.269 --> 02:48:50.279 align:start position:0%
we're in the position that we're in is
 
02:48:52.910 --> 02:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
that there hasn't been that fiscal
 
02:48:56.070 --> 02:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
analysis that has been done by previous
 
02:48:59.469 --> 02:48:59.479 align:start position:0%
um legislatures prior to that because
 
02:49:02.630 --> 02:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
once they did delve into it uh they
 
02:49:07.030 --> 02:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
found that it it you know these were uh
 
02:49:08.590 --> 02:49:08.600 align:start position:0%
they were concerned about the numbers
 
02:49:10.750 --> 02:49:10.760 align:start position:0%
and how it would impact uh not only
 
02:49:12.349 --> 02:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers but public schools and
 
02:49:16.030 --> 02:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
students and so I think that um we need
 
02:49:18.910 --> 02:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
to start sending these types of bills to
 
02:49:21.750 --> 02:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
the finance committee for that kind of
 
02:49:23.710 --> 02:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
analysis further questions from the
 
02:49:25.630 --> 02:49:25.640 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing it thank you very
 
02:49:26.830 --> 02:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
much thank you very much have a good
 
02:49:34.389 --> 02:49:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:37.150 --> 02:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
wkey thank you for hanging in there
 
02:49:39.710 --> 02:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for hanging in there now I
 
02:49:41.309 --> 02:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
know I better really talk fast because
 
02:49:43.910 --> 02:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
lunch is waiting um I'm Mary Wilkey from
 
02:49:48.030 --> 02:49:48.040 align:start position:0%
conquer and um I'm against the expansion
 
02:49:50.150 --> 02:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
of the eligib eligibility requirements
 
02:49:52.429 --> 02:49:52.439 align:start position:0%
in this bill um I've talked about
 
02:49:54.190 --> 02:49:54.200 align:start position:0%
similar bills here so I won't repeat
 
02:49:56.309 --> 02:49:56.319 align:start position:0%
what I've said in the past but um one
 
02:49:58.990 --> 02:49:59.000 align:start position:0%
point I did make in the past is that um
 
02:50:00.990 --> 02:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
it would be prudent to wait at least
 
02:50:03.110 --> 02:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
until the legislatively mandated audit
 
02:50:05.990 --> 02:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
takes place before expanding the program
 
02:50:07.750 --> 02:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
because uh let's make sure that there
 
02:50:09.269 --> 02:50:09.279 align:start position:0%
aren't what if they come up with some
 
02:50:11.110 --> 02:50:11.120 align:start position:0%
problems or some risks that haven't been
 
02:50:13.110 --> 02:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
addressed we should address those before
 
02:50:15.750 --> 02:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
sending even more millions of dollars uh
 
02:50:17.990 --> 02:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
to the voucher program um I still
 
02:50:19.750 --> 02:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
believe that and I believe it even more
 
02:50:22.910 --> 02:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
so having uh watched the testimony that
 
02:50:24.710 --> 02:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
was given at the legislative at that
 
02:50:27.150 --> 02:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
joint committee where the
 
02:50:31.309 --> 02:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
um the the LBA was concerned about not
 
02:50:32.670 --> 02:50:32.680 align:start position:0%
being able to get the data they needed
 
02:50:34.670 --> 02:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
to do the audit that you all as
 
02:50:37.910 --> 02:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
legislators required and I'm not privy
 
02:50:40.510 --> 02:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
to whatever negotiations have gone on
 
02:50:42.389 --> 02:50:42.399 align:start position:0%
since then that Senator langry referred
 
02:50:44.229 --> 02:50:44.239 align:start position:0%
to so maybe they've agreed to a full and
 
02:50:46.550 --> 02:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
complete audit I would applaud that I
 
02:50:48.150 --> 02:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
don't know why it would have to get to
 
02:50:50.870 --> 02:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
negotiate to do that um but you could
 
02:50:53.030 --> 02:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
say I watched the hearing online and you
 
02:50:54.990 --> 02:50:55.000 align:start position:0%
could certainly say at a minimum that
 
02:50:57.110 --> 02:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
the commissioner was not eager to have
 
02:51:00.309 --> 02:51:00.319 align:start position:0%
the audit and I don't know why it's a
 
02:51:02.670 --> 02:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
public money it's a public program we
 
02:51:05.190 --> 02:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
all pay for it we want it we want our
 
02:51:07.070 --> 02:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
children in the program to be doing well
 
02:51:09.510 --> 02:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
whether we agree with the policy or not
 
02:51:12.030 --> 02:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
why not want a full audit why not put a
 
02:51:13.710 --> 02:51:13.720 align:start position:0%
little daylight on it so that was
 
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
concerning and then yesterday I went to
 
02:51:17.389 --> 02:51:17.399 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee meeting and uh
 
02:51:18.910 --> 02:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
it came to light that the department has
 
02:51:20.469 --> 02:51:20.479 align:start position:0%
been taking down from its website
 
02:51:22.349 --> 02:51:22.359 align:start position:0%
reports about what where some of the
 
02:51:24.550 --> 02:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
money is going in the audit in the uh
 
02:51:27.070 --> 02:51:27.080 align:start position:0%
voucher program and reports about what
 
02:51:28.550 --> 02:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
vendors are getting money and how much
 
02:51:30.950 --> 02:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
they're getting the representative from
 
02:51:33.510 --> 02:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
the doe explained that the reason for
 
02:51:35.870 --> 02:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
that was because that information really
 
02:51:38.590 --> 02:51:38.600 align:start position:0%
was brought up by the scholarship
 
02:51:39.670 --> 02:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
organization they're the ones that
 
02:51:41.830 --> 02:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
collected that information but it's been
 
02:51:44.349 --> 02:51:44.359 align:start position:0%
online for a year and a half two years
 
02:51:46.429 --> 02:51:46.439 align:start position:0%
why suddenly is it going offline and
 
02:51:47.870 --> 02:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
it's nowhere else that the public can
 
02:51:49.269 --> 02:51:49.279 align:start position:0%
find it at the
 
02:51:51.790 --> 02:51:51.800 align:start position:0%
why not and so all of this raises
 
02:51:53.790 --> 02:51:53.800 align:start position:0%
questions in my mind and I would hope in
 
02:51:55.710 --> 02:51:55.720 align:start position:0%
yours it seems like this information
 
02:51:58.630 --> 02:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
that's being obscured is not being
 
02:52:01.150 --> 02:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
wanted why not why don't we want to have
 
02:52:03.790 --> 02:52:03.800 align:start position:0%
a full picture of this program before we
 
02:52:06.910 --> 02:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
even commit more money to it and that's
 
02:52:09.269 --> 02:52:09.279 align:start position:0%
basically my question and I I feel that
 
02:52:12.110 --> 02:52:12.120 align:start position:0%
the public relies on you all to
 
02:52:14.870 --> 02:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
carefully Steward public funds and
 
02:52:17.790 --> 02:52:17.800 align:start position:0%
choosing to expand it this program when
 
02:52:20.309 --> 02:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
the department is seems to be hiding
 
02:52:22.469 --> 02:52:22.479 align:start position:0%
information and not wanting it to be
 
02:52:24.670 --> 02:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
very carefully looked at would be
 
02:52:26.389 --> 02:52:26.399 align:start position:0%
irresponsible and it would undermine the
 
02:52:28.590 --> 02:52:28.600 align:start position:0%
Public's trust in all of you and for
 
02:52:31.150 --> 02:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
that reason I'm uh concerned about it
 
02:52:33.070 --> 02:52:33.080 align:start position:0%
and since if I have a couple one more
 
02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
minute I would say that I agree with the
 
02:52:36.510 --> 02:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
idea of reducing the scholarship
 
02:52:39.510 --> 02:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
organization's fee from 10% to 8% I
 
02:52:41.510 --> 02:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
would suggest looking into doing the
 
02:52:44.110 --> 02:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
same with the education tax credit uh
 
02:52:46.309 --> 02:52:46.319 align:start position:0%
scholarship program because a lot of
 
02:52:48.910 --> 02:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
these students overlap they're they're
 
02:52:51.590 --> 02:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
get putting together data about the same
 
02:52:54.269 --> 02:52:54.279 align:start position:0%
families it can't cost as
 
02:52:57.110 --> 02:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
much per family you know when you when
 
02:52:59.550 --> 02:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
you when you you get you get what I mean
 
02:53:00.670 --> 02:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
I don't want to keep you from lunch I
 
02:53:02.670 --> 02:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
hope you understand what I meant by that
 
02:53:04.550 --> 02:53:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much uh
 
02:53:05.750 --> 02:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative dry and then
 
02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:06.990 align:start position:0%
representative dry and then
representative

02:53:06.990 --> 02:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:53:08.830 --> 02:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
luckus thank you and thank you for
 
02:53:10.830 --> 02:53:10.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I listened to your
 
02:53:13.070 --> 02:53:13.080 align:start position:0%
testimony this morning in the Senate and
 
02:53:15.790 --> 02:53:15.800 align:start position:0%
when you talked about um finding the
 
02:53:17.590 --> 02:53:17.600 align:start position:0%
information from the scholarship
 
02:53:20.110 --> 02:53:20.120 align:start position:0%
organization uh correct me if I'm wrong
 
02:53:22.150 --> 02:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
I thought you said that information
 
02:53:24.150 --> 02:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
could be gotten from the
 
02:53:26.870 --> 02:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization yes it's not
 
02:53:28.510 --> 02:53:28.520 align:start position:0%
posted anywhere what I'm saying the only
 
02:53:30.190 --> 02:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
reason I got it was I kept looking on
 
02:53:32.469 --> 02:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
the website for the updated report for
 
02:53:34.030 --> 02:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
the year that ended last school you know
 
02:53:36.510 --> 02:53:36.520 align:start position:0%
last school year last June of vendors
 
02:53:39.150 --> 02:53:39.160 align:start position:0%
all we've ever seen publicly is the
 
02:53:41.030 --> 02:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
first year we're in the we're almost at
 
02:53:42.630 --> 02:53:42.640 align:start position:0%
the end of the third year so I kept
 
02:53:44.349 --> 02:53:44.359 align:start position:0%
looking for it and it was never posted
 
02:53:46.429 --> 02:53:46.439 align:start position:0%
so I finally emailed Kate Baker deur and
 
02:53:48.429 --> 02:53:48.439 align:start position:0%
asked for it and she did provide it um
 
02:53:50.070 --> 02:53:50.080 align:start position:0%
it said draft I said why does it say
 
02:53:52.070 --> 02:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
draft and she said because it hasn't yet
 
02:53:53.990 --> 02:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
I've sent it to the doe but they haven't
 
02:53:55.349 --> 02:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
posted it yet and I want to make sure
 
02:53:57.150 --> 02:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
they're fine with it it's still not
 
02:53:59.389 --> 02:53:59.399 align:start position:0%
posted and it's not available so yes I
 
02:54:00.990 --> 02:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
happen to know because I come here all
 
02:54:03.150 --> 02:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
the time who to call when I want that
 
02:54:04.910 --> 02:54:04.920 align:start position:0%
you can't get online and find it as far
 
02:54:06.030 --> 02:54:06.040 align:start position:0%
as I can
 
02:54:09.469 --> 02:54:09.479 align:start position:0%
tell yes okay so just to clarify it is
 
02:54:11.269 --> 02:54:11.279 align:start position:0%
available it's just not available online
 
02:54:13.269 --> 02:54:13.279 align:start position:0%
like it was last year because you said
 
02:54:14.870 --> 02:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
differently I'm sorry I didn't mean that
 
02:54:17.269 --> 02:54:17.279 align:start position:0%
it's not available I meant it's not it's
 
02:54:19.710 --> 02:54:19.720 align:start position:0%
not publicly posted where the average
 
02:54:21.830 --> 02:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
person could find it bya Google search
 
02:54:23.950 --> 02:54:23.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you very much
 
02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:27.710 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you very much
representa

02:54:27.710 --> 02:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:32.229 --> 02:54:32.239 align:start position:0%
leus you had mentioned um in talking
 
02:54:35.990 --> 02:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
about doing
 
02:54:36.000 --> 02:54:37.830 align:start position:0%
about doing
the

02:54:37.830 --> 02:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
audit um risk Etc and I was wondering if
 
02:54:44.790 --> 02:54:44.800 align:start position:0%
you were aware that an a risk audit has
 
02:54:47.389 --> 02:54:47.399 align:start position:0%
been done every year and they have
 
02:54:48.910 --> 02:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
passed every year
 
02:54:51.030 --> 02:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's just not the full
 
02:54:54.110 --> 02:54:54.120 align:start position:0%
audit that has been completed yet but
 
02:54:56.429 --> 02:54:56.439 align:start position:0%
the risk audit it has been done every
 
02:54:59.990 --> 02:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
year if I what I'm the only audit I've
 
02:55:02.070 --> 02:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
ever been able to find is the financial
 
02:55:04.469 --> 02:55:04.479 align:start position:0%
audit of the entire New York City based
 
02:55:08.110 --> 02:55:08.120 align:start position:0%
organization that has uh offices in 18
 
02:55:10.030 --> 02:55:10.040 align:start position:0%
or 21 different states something like
 
02:55:13.110 --> 02:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
that um that doesn't look specifically
 
02:55:17.429 --> 02:55:17.439 align:start position:0%
at um are people care I don't as I read
 
02:55:18.910 --> 02:55:18.920 align:start position:0%
that report
 
02:55:22.710 --> 02:55:22.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look at things like um our
 
02:55:24.790 --> 02:55:24.800 align:start position:0%
parents they didn't do like a random
 
02:55:26.429 --> 02:55:26.439 align:start position:0%
sample of parents to make sure that the
 
02:55:28.030 --> 02:55:28.040 align:start position:0%
money is actually being spent on what
 
02:55:31.269 --> 02:55:31.279 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to be spent on or uh that
 
02:55:33.309 --> 02:55:33.319 align:start position:0%
the various qualifications that people
 
02:55:34.830 --> 02:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
have to have to get in that kind of
 
02:55:37.070 --> 02:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
thing and that's what this legislative
 
02:55:38.990 --> 02:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
that's why as I understand it why the
 
02:55:40.750 --> 02:55:40.760 align:start position:0%
legislature wanted to have this audit to
 
02:55:43.429 --> 02:55:43.439 align:start position:0%
get into finding those kinds of risks
 
02:55:45.070 --> 02:55:45.080 align:start position:0%
that wasn't called a risk-based audit
 
02:55:47.269 --> 02:55:47.279 align:start position:0%
that was a regular Financial audit done
 
02:55:50.070 --> 02:55:50.080 align:start position:0%
for the large
 
02:55:50.080 --> 02:55:51.670 align:start position:0%
for the large
organization

02:55:51.670 --> 02:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
organization
 
02:55:54.309 --> 02:55:54.319 align:start position:0%
yes I was talking to the LBA when they
 
02:55:56.630 --> 02:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
were here last week and they said they
 
02:55:59.429 --> 02:55:59.439 align:start position:0%
had done a risk-based audit every year
 
02:56:01.870 --> 02:56:01.880 align:start position:0%
and it had passed completely oh I'm not
 
02:56:03.670 --> 02:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
aware of that and it's not maybe I'm
 
02:56:06.870 --> 02:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
mistaken I'm sorry I'm not aware of it
 
02:56:08.670 --> 02:56:08.680 align:start position:0%
when you look on the uh scholarship
 
02:56:10.349 --> 02:56:10.359 align:start position:0%
organization's website that says
 
02:56:12.790 --> 02:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
financials and then it says it has their
 
02:56:15.710 --> 02:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
990 form and it has the financial audit
 
02:56:17.630 --> 02:56:17.640 align:start position:0%
of the big company I've never been able
 
02:56:19.389 --> 02:56:19.399 align:start position:0%
to find any other Audits and I actually
 
02:56:21.309 --> 02:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
asked the doe if there were any other
 
02:56:22.750 --> 02:56:22.760 align:start position:0%
Audits and they said here's the audit
 
02:56:24.190 --> 02:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
and it was that big Financial one so
 
02:56:25.750 --> 02:56:25.760 align:start position:0%
I've never seen any other audit and I've
 
02:56:28.389 --> 02:56:28.399 align:start position:0%
looked okay maybe they would thank you
 
02:56:31.110 --> 02:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
very much represent belard thank you Mr
 
02:56:32.870 --> 02:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for being here to take
 
02:56:34.110 --> 02:56:34.120 align:start position:0%
my question yeah I know the speaker is
 
02:56:34.120 --> 02:56:35.309 align:start position:0%
my question yeah I know the speaker is
not

02:56:35.309 --> 02:56:35.319 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:56:38.870 --> 02:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
ideal um you you were you mentioning in
 
02:56:40.469 --> 02:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
the audit um and I know there's been
 
02:56:42.030 --> 02:56:42.040 align:start position:0%
some controversy around what has
 
02:56:43.790 --> 02:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
occurred and I'll admit that I'm not as
 
02:56:45.309 --> 02:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
up to date as I want to be I have a bit
 
02:56:46.550 --> 02:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
more to learn about what has occurred
 
02:56:48.910 --> 02:56:48.920 align:start position:0%
around that um but but is it is it
 
02:56:51.429 --> 02:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
accurate that some of the controversy
 
02:56:53.830 --> 02:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
was surrounding certain requests for
 
02:56:55.550 --> 02:56:55.560 align:start position:0%
information that were made that included
 
02:56:57.630 --> 02:56:57.640 align:start position:0%
personally identifiable information for
 
02:56:59.229 --> 02:56:59.239 align:start position:0%
either students or their families in the
 
02:56:59.239 --> 02:57:00.990 align:start position:0%
either students or their families in the
EFA

02:57:00.990 --> 02:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
EFA
 
02:57:04.309 --> 02:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
program I really don't know I um I don't
 
02:57:05.630 --> 02:57:05.640 align:start position:0%
know because I don't I don't think they
 
02:57:07.910 --> 02:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
made public what the requests were I
 
02:57:09.910 --> 02:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
know that the commissioner mentioned it
 
02:57:11.710 --> 02:57:11.720 align:start position:0%
would make it wouldn't be right to go
 
02:57:15.269 --> 02:57:15.279 align:start position:0%
and ask tutor Inc to give us all their
 
02:57:16.990 --> 02:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
uh all the information about every
 
02:57:19.309 --> 02:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
student but I doubt that's what I doubt
 
02:57:20.389 --> 02:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
that that's what an auditor would be
 
02:57:21.950 --> 02:57:21.960 align:start position:0%
asking I would suspect that they would
 
02:57:23.710 --> 02:57:23.720 align:start position:0%
be asking for procedures that are in
 
02:57:25.590 --> 02:57:25.600 align:start position:0%
place to make sure that all the
 
02:57:27.750 --> 02:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
requirements in the law are being met
 
02:57:28.990 --> 02:57:29.000 align:start position:0%
and you wouldn't need to know the names
 
02:57:30.870 --> 02:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
and IDs of students to do that but I
 
02:57:32.550 --> 02:57:32.560 align:start position:0%
don't know I I don't know what they were
 
02:57:34.870 --> 02:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
asking for f questions from the
 
02:57:37.070 --> 02:57:37.080 align:start position:0%
committee not seeing thank you very much
 
02:57:39.550 --> 02:57:39.560 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and with that I have
 
02:57:40.990 --> 02:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
no further pin card so I'm going to
 
02:57:43.590 --> 02:57:43.600 align:start position:0%
close the hearing for
 
02:57:47.550 --> 02:57:47.560 align:start position:0%
442 and we're going to take a yes before
 
02:57:49.389 --> 02:57:49.399 align:start position:0%
before you break for L could you answer
 
02:57:52.070 --> 02:57:52.080 align:start position:0%
proceed your question for me
 
02:57:55.630 --> 02:57:55.640 align:start position:0%
please what's your question um I know
 
02:57:58.070 --> 02:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
we're receiving Senate bills and at
 
02:57:59.670 --> 02:57:59.680 align:start position:0%
least 10 of us on this table were very
 
02:58:01.990 --> 02:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about seeing Senate Bill 499
 
02:58:03.950 --> 02:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
come forward so I was checking the
 
02:58:05.510 --> 02:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
docket to see what was going to come
 
02:58:08.349 --> 02:58:08.359 align:start position:0%
forward um because it deals with
 
02:58:11.150 --> 02:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
meals uh and I found out that from the
 
02:58:13.790 --> 02:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
docket that you had waved it off um so
 
02:58:15.150 --> 02:58:15.160 align:start position:0%
we're not going to see that we'll be
 
02:58:16.710 --> 02:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
able to discuss that and I was just
 
02:58:18.950 --> 02:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
curious I understand stand it's in your
 
02:58:21.349 --> 02:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
prerogative to wave the bill right past
 
02:58:23.990 --> 02:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
us I was just curious why that
 
02:58:26.510 --> 02:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
occurred that was vacated to another
 
02:58:27.950 --> 02:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
committee where they're dealing with
 
02:58:30.550 --> 02:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
elderly Affairs in which we do not deal
 
02:58:32.349 --> 02:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
with elderly Affairs and some of the
 
02:58:34.670 --> 02:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
issues which are associated with HHS
 
02:58:37.630 --> 02:58:37.640 align:start position:0%
there was a small partion relative to
 
02:58:42.150 --> 02:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
education but when upon re reviewing it
 
02:58:44.790 --> 02:58:44.800 align:start position:0%
and approved by the speaker it has now
 
02:58:46.630 --> 02:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
gone to another committee it's more
 
02:58:49.070 --> 02:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate well but for
 
02:58:52.429 --> 02:58:52.439 align:start position:0%
yeah is did you wave it off to another
 
02:58:53.990 --> 02:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
Comm the speaker because the doctor says
 
02:58:57.710 --> 02:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
you did yes I asked that it be vacated
 
02:59:00.190 --> 02:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
okay so my only point for that reason
 
02:59:03.229 --> 02:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
the the first paragraph the first
 
02:59:07.389 --> 02:59:07.399 align:start position:0%
portion in that bill dealt with student
 
02:59:10.469 --> 02:59:10.479 align:start position:0%
breakfast meals I understand that I
 
02:59:11.469 --> 02:59:11.479 align:start position:0%
understand that and we never get to talk
 
02:59:14.389 --> 02:59:14.399 align:start position:0%
about it okay Woodcock I'm not going to
 
02:59:16.670 --> 02:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
discuss any further I just explained to
 
02:59:19.630 --> 02:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
you that it was vacated for a purpose
 
02:59:21.510 --> 02:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
that was other than what you're talking
 
02:59:24.030 --> 02:59:24.040 align:start position:0%
about there are issues in that which
 
02:59:27.389 --> 02:59:27.399 align:start position:0%
were belonged in another committee and
 
02:59:30.389 --> 02:59:30.399 align:start position:0%
upon reviewing that with the clerk it
 
02:59:32.630 --> 02:59:32.640 align:start position:0%
was seen that yes it should have gone to
 
02:59:34.710 --> 02:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
another committee we have that happened
 
02:59:37.429 --> 02:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
with bills periodically and we do vacant
 
02:59:39.630 --> 02:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
them to the proper committee you can
 
02:59:40.990 --> 02:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
testify and followed up with that
 
02:59:43.389 --> 02:59:43.399 align:start position:0%
committee no I I I believe you you're
 
02:59:46.030 --> 02:59:46.040 align:start position:0%
honest thank thank you very much and
 
02:59:47.190 --> 02:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do is we're going to
 
02:59:50.910 --> 02:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
take a caucus right now and both both
 
02:59:52.389 --> 02:59:52.399 align:start position:0%
caucuses are going to meet right now and
 
02:59:54.710 --> 02:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
then we're going to come back in about
 
03:00:03.229 --> 03:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:16.950 --> 03:00:16.960 align:start position:0%

03:13:17.389 --> 03:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
we have submitted a bill to to the
 
03:13:19.110 --> 03:13:19.120 align:start position:0%
Senate this time so I think there's no
 
03:13:23.910 --> 03:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:26.830 --> 03:13:26.840 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you
 
03:13:26.840 --> 03:13:28.349 align:start position:0%
discussion thank you
I

03:13:28.349 --> 03:13:28.359 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:13:32.309 --> 03:13:32.319 align:start position:0%
so so the motion the motion was made no
 
03:13:35.269 --> 03:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
I'm looking rep and
 
03:13:38.630 --> 03:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
dry I know I'm just I'm like I do I do I
 
03:13:41.190 --> 03:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
do have a concern I I do have a com yeah
 
03:13:43.990 --> 03:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
representative Miler I think my second
 
03:13:47.269 --> 03:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
is based upon the issue of not a need to
 
03:13:50.269 --> 03:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
expand the program to its current level
 
03:13:52.389 --> 03:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
uh as I mentioned in the testimony of
 
03:13:56.429 --> 03:13:56.439 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang I'm concerned about the
 
03:14:00.070 --> 03:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
um the overspending of it uh I'm
 
03:14:03.550 --> 03:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
concerned about the department not uh
 
03:14:05.269 --> 03:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
projecting appropriately for their
 
03:14:07.110 --> 03:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
budget so we have some sense of what the
 
03:14:09.870 --> 03:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
guideline is and it's for those reasons
 
03:14:13.150 --> 03:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
that I think uh moving it from 350 to
 
03:14:18.229 --> 03:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:19.910 --> 03:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
any other comments from the
 
03:14:22.790 --> 03:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
committee it's uh
 
03:14:24.870 --> 03:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
442 going to slow down a little bit
 
03:14:28.670 --> 03:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:35.990 --> 03:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:40.349 --> 03:14:40.359 align:start position:0%
can was motion be by lad and second by
