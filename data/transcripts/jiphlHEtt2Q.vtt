all um I would like to thank everyone
 
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:13.800 align:start position:0%
for being here I know the weather
 
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
was not
 
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 align:start position:0%
ideal but I don't know if we've had
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
ideal weather for the last few
 
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
weeks um but anyways uh director Buxton
 
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
who was originally supposed to be here
 
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
this morning uh has uh sent an email
 
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
uh around
 
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 align:start position:0%
215 yesterday afternoon saying that he
 
00:07:35.589 --> 00:07:35.599 align:start position:0%
had a schedule change and could not
 
00:07:36.869 --> 00:07:36.879 align:start position:0%
attend this
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
morning um we do have somebody coming in
 
00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
to talk to us uh but they've also got
 
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
delayed due to weather uh as well
 
00:07:51.869 --> 00:07:51.879 align:start position:0%
as uh some other
 
00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:56.159 align:start position:0%
detours um but I guess I would take this
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
time and ask the committee members if
 
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's anything specific
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
specific um that we would like to
 
00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
address to director
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
buckon uh and we could send him an email
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
so that when he does come in he has
 
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
information in front of us and I will
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:18.440 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
Belcher thank you madam chair I I think
 
00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:22.840 align:start position:0%
what we would like or what I'd like to
 
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
see done is to outline um perhaps in the
 
00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:28.039 align:start position:0%
same manner that we've previously
 
00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:30.280 align:start position:0%
proceeded in a sort of time timeline
 
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
sort of manner the uh specific actions
 
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
um taken uh by DHHS so actions taken um
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
especially significant actions taken the
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
guidance even even if it wasn't mandates
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
but guidance put out um as well as uh
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
significant actions receive or I suppose
 
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:56.560 align:start position:0%
you could say orders received from any
 
00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:58.680 align:start position:0%
any federal authorities or or anyone
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
else for that matter matter as well as
 
00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
guidance received from any federal
 
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:04.600 align:start position:0%
authorities or anyone else for that
 
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
matter um that would be my
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
recommendation and I think maybe we
 
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
narrow those down to what kind of things
 
00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:13.959 align:start position:0%
because we we could we could be swamped
 
00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:15.560 align:start position:0%
with data so what kind of things do we
 
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:17.800 align:start position:0%
consider significant that we would like
 
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
to see as a part of
 
00:09:25.430 --> 00:09:25.440 align:start position:0%
that anyone else repres
 
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
gr thank you madam chair so at the
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
beginning of this meeting the very very
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
the first um meetings of this commit
 
00:09:38.389 --> 00:09:38.399 align:start position:0%
commiss committee we specifically wanted
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
to see and hear from the director of
 
00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security based on
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
what we had heard so I think we should
 
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
go back to do we have minutes of that
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
meeting and go back because all that was
 
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
outlined we talked about that in I think
 
00:09:57.150 --> 00:09:57.160 align:start position:0%
it was the first or second meeting it
 
00:09:59.750 --> 00:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
was the meeting when when director uh
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
till Tilly came right in directed uh uh
 
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:07.570 align:start position:0%
Tilly uh she had given us
 
00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:08.990 align:start position:0%
Tilly uh she had given us
[Music]

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:10:12.430 --> 00:10:12.440 align:start position:0%
um the guidance and she had outlined
 
00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
given us an outline of the co response
 
00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.269 align:start position:0%
given us an outline of the co response
from

00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:20.670 align:start position:0%
from
DHHS

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
um D yes so we we do have that outline
 
00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:27.839 align:start position:0%
um and when I did correspond with
 
00:10:29.389 --> 00:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
director buckson I told him that that
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
we're also interested in if he
 
00:10:36.389 --> 00:10:36.399 align:start position:0%
could when he meets with us give us kind
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
of an idea of what their report is going
 
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:40.470 align:start position:0%
of an idea of what their report is going
to

00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:44.240 align:start position:0%
contain um because I think that is also
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
important um that we understand what
 
00:10:52.269 --> 00:10:52.279 align:start position:0%
their focus was um because as we even in
 
00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
our mission there is so many areas of
 
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:57.920 align:start position:0%
focus that we could go down
 
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480 align:start position:0%
that the hopes to have him in was
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
to not
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
um try and be
 
00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.910 align:start position:0%
um try and be
duplicative

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
duplicative
 
00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
um but we'll have to wait and see uh yes
 
00:11:15.190 --> 00:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative evil well unfortunately I
 
00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
don't have the uh list in front of me
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
but I it seems like we got something at
 
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
some point may I thought it was from
 
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
um uh director Tilly that said the
 
00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:29.600 align:start position:0%
different subjects that the home land
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
security report was going to cover
 
00:11:37.389 --> 00:11:37.399 align:start position:0%
and I guess uh my thought would be that
 
00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:39.760 align:start position:0%
we look at that list I remember uh
 
00:11:42.389 --> 00:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
Health was one of them but we could look
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
at the list and then maybe zero in on
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
those particular aspects of it when he
 
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
he comes in but I agree with you one of
 
00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:54.079 align:start position:0%
the big things I'd like to hear from him
 
00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
is just maybe an overarching um uh
 
00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
summary of what they're doing and what
 
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
their timeline is for uh producing their
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
report and then at some point level we
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
can kind of figure out what we're doing
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
that might be additive or duplicative to
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
their uh
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
work right and and I will forward
 
00:12:21.189 --> 00:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
another email and I will ask for it to
 
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
be printed out um but I also have here
 
00:12:28.509 --> 00:12:28.519 align:start position:0%
and I was hoping I with everything else
 
00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:31.560 align:start position:0%
going on I apologize for this but I'll
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
get this printed sent this off upstairs
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
but this is a covid-19 vaccine roll out
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
um and how that followed um and it talks
 
00:12:47.069 --> 00:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
about the the actual roll out um when uh
 
00:12:50.949 --> 00:12:50.959 align:start position:0%
on March 3rd in 2020 there was uh a
 
00:12:54.069 --> 00:12:54.079 align:start position:0%
declaration of Public Health incident
 
00:12:55.790 --> 00:12:55.800 align:start position:0%
March 13th the governor declared the
 
00:12:56.990 --> 00:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
state of
 
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:00.440 align:start position:0%
emergency um March 23rd the first covid
 
00:13:04.629 --> 00:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
death happened um and the 100th covid-19
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
case was reported in New Hampshire um I
 
00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:11.440 align:start position:0%
will send this off to H uh house
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
committee Services now and ask that they
 
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.560 align:start position:0%
uh see if they can print these out for
 
00:13:18.389 --> 00:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
us but it talk but this is all about the
 
00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:22.839 align:start position:0%
actual vaccine roll out um it up until
 
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:24.680 align:start position:0%
and it goes through even through to
 
00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.670 align:start position:0%
and it goes through even through to
October

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
October
 
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:28.600 align:start position:0%
2023 the FDA authorizes the emergency
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
use of the updated novavax covid-19
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
vaccine and amends the eua to include
 
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
individuals over the age of 12 um and
 
00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
when I read that and I listen to Dr korf
 
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:48.360 align:start position:0%
um I have some concerns based on some of
 
00:13:52.829 --> 00:13:52.839 align:start position:0%
the testimony that we've received um
 
00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
about the ages of the vaccines based on
 
00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
what he was given guidance
 
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
I don't know how anybody else on this
 
00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:05.160 align:start position:0%
committee feels about that or or what
 
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
their thoughts are
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
um so I'm hoping that at some point we
 
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
can find out the science behind the
 
00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.389 align:start position:0%
can find out the science behind the
vaccines

00:14:19.389 --> 00:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160 align:start position:0%
and I'll just leave it at that does
 
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:25.720 align:start position:0%
anybody else have anything else uh that
 
00:14:29.269 --> 00:14:29.279 align:start position:0%
they would like to talk discuss
 
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
um so I was gonna so who prepared that U
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
your P nope um um Patricia Tilly yes
 
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
okay um yeah I mean because she DHHS or
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
Ben Chan we who we've talked about
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
having come in here um seems like they
 
00:14:49.949 --> 00:14:49.959 align:start position:0%
would be the uh appropriate people to
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
have that kind of a
 
00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:55.759 align:start position:0%
conversation um I mean as I look at our
 
00:15:00.629 --> 00:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
mission I think the particular focus is
 
00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:03.920 align:start position:0%
Health but the other thing is the money
 
00:15:06.749 --> 00:15:06.759 align:start position:0%
flows and for that reason that's why I
 
00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:09.399 align:start position:0%
think it would be really useful to have
 
00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:12.279 align:start position:0%
Taylor Caswell come in or whoever he
 
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
might like to designate to just talk
 
00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
about the federal funds I think that's
 
00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
something really really worthwhile
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
investigating because it's something
 
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
largely the legislature wasn't a
 
00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079 align:start position:0%
participant in um so that that's uh one
 
00:15:32.189 --> 00:15:32.199 align:start position:0%
thing and I I don't know how much of
 
00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
that aspect the homeland security
 
00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519 align:start position:0%
director is focusing
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
on and represent evil I 100% agree with
 
00:15:46.949 --> 00:15:46.959 align:start position:0%
you and I I uh like I said it would be I
 
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:51.160 align:start position:0%
think we would gain a lot of insight um
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
from uh director Caswell or commissioner
 
00:15:58.189 --> 00:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
Caswell um coming in here and
 
00:15:58.199 --> 00:15:59.990 align:start position:0%
Caswell um coming in here and
understanding

00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
um how all the money's flowed
 
00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
um not only you
 
00:16:12.749 --> 00:16:12.759 align:start position:0%
know how it was handled at the um the
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
agencies but how it the agencies
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
actually divested some of that uh those
 
00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
dollars and do they still have those
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
dollars and are they still utilizing
 
00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:24.440 align:start position:0%
them and if they do what are they using
 
00:16:28.189 --> 00:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
them for and is it is it in the best
 
00:16:28.199 --> 00:16:30.030 align:start position:0%
them for and is it is it in the best
interest

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
um of the public uh the way that they're
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
using them I mean I was concerned to
 
00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:45.069 --> 00:16:45.079 align:start position:0%
opting to fix things versus air
 
00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
filtration I mean because to me a good
 
00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:52.120 align:start position:0%
air filtration in a school Not only
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
would benefit you know during the co
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
time but during any time where we have
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
increases like with the flu and
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
everything everything else would help
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
mitigate and keep students healthy um so
 
00:17:06.669 --> 00:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
that I think is is a huge area of
 
00:17:09.350 --> 00:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
concern of mine so so I'm just thinking
 
00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of questions I don't know who
 
00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
to ask the question of but the but the
 
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh Federal funding roll out a timeline
 
00:17:21.789 --> 00:17:21.799 align:start position:0%
would be really interesting I mean we've
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
got the covid roll out and the different
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
you know orders that were issued but be
 
00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:29.590 align:start position:0%
you know orders that were issued but be
interested

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
interested
 
00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:31.880 align:start position:0%
to get a timeline of the federal fund
 
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
distribution and maybe overlay that with
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
the with the health roll out and uh we
 
00:17:39.950 --> 00:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
could ask the homeland
 
00:17:42.909 --> 00:17:42.919 align:start position:0%
security uh director I forget his name
 
00:17:46.029 --> 00:17:46.039 align:start position:0%
but maybe Taylor could help us with that
 
00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
too I mean I think that's a worthwhile
 
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:52.200 align:start position:0%
thing to look at uh because I'm not sure
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
who has honestly I I I don't know right
 
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
us and along those lines what money came
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
in for the
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
schools specifically for covid response
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
and what did they do with it what did it
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
actually get spent on and how much is
 
00:18:17.830 --> 00:18:17.840 align:start position:0%
still hanging around represent Belcher
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so just listening
 
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
to what we've been talking about I I
 
00:18:23.149 --> 00:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
wholly agree with that and all of that
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
um all those lines of questioning I also
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
want to uh look at um well for instance
 
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
when it comes to uh treatments such as a
 
00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:33.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine I think those are questions we
 
00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
want to put to DHS and if they had no
 
00:18:39.789 --> 00:18:39.799 align:start position:0%
hand in it that's not their purview that
 
00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
would be excellent information to have
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
because that means we no longer have to
 
00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
pursue that line of questioning with
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
them we can directed elsewhere I also
 
00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:48.200 align:start position:0%
would like to look at lines of
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
questioning around things like um what
 
00:18:52.029 --> 00:18:52.039 align:start position:0%
is variously described as either
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
shutdowns or stay-at-home orders um
 
00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:56.760 align:start position:0%
essential Personnel decisions business
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
and house of worship closers guidance
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
the science behind it the legal
 
00:19:02.950 --> 00:19:02.960 align:start position:0%
Authority behind it what analysis legal
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
analysis was done and who was that legal
 
00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:07.120 align:start position:0%
analysis done by was the guidance coming
 
00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:09.799 align:start position:0%
from the federal level uh supernational
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
level was it coming from the state level
 
00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
who in particular was it coming from
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
that might give us guidance for who we
 
00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:20.039 align:start position:0%
might ask to come in or present further
 
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
questions uh to on these specific topics
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
Federal funding um obviously uh tracing
 
00:19:29.549 --> 00:19:29.559 align:start position:0%
that money the timeline
 
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
whether there were and what uh any
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
requirements attached to that funding
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
and what they were for instance uh did
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
any of these federal funds require the
 
00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
state to have certain uh to make
 
00:19:44.909 --> 00:19:44.919 align:start position:0%
vaccines or monocon antibodies available
 
00:19:47.669 --> 00:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
and how did were there any requirements
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
on that uh for specific rollouts uh or
 
00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
or lockdowns or closures or anything
 
00:19:56.470 --> 00:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
else required coming with that Federal
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
funding so these are all questions that
 
00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
I think we can we can reasonably put
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
together and put forward and again if
 
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
the if the answer from DHS is that's not
 
00:20:06.070 --> 00:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
our purview we didn't have a hand in it
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
awesome now we can move on and and and
 
00:20:11.789 --> 00:20:11.799 align:start position:0%
direct them elsewhere represent
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
leas yes I was looking back at my notes
 
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
and um one of the things
 
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
I interested in is where and how they
 
00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:24.400 align:start position:0%
got their data to make the decisions
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
they made because we kept getting
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
information um and we kept you walk into
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
any place with the TV on and there'd be
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
scroll you know waiting for the doctor's
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
office whatever scrolling announcements
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering where they got the
 
00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
data and how they made the decisions as
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
to what to put out um I have a quote
 
00:20:47.549 --> 00:20:47.559 align:start position:0%
from them we knew our data was bad but
 
00:20:50.549 --> 00:20:50.559 align:start position:0%
they kept putting out
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
information even though they knew the
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
data was bad so the question is where
 
00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
were they getting their data and how
 
00:20:58.870 --> 00:20:58.880 align:start position:0%
were they making those decisions to put
 
00:21:00.789 --> 00:21:00.799 align:start position:0%
those announcements out when they knew
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.400 align:start position:0%
bad represent
 
00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
POF thank you Madame chair
 
00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
um um I don't have a specific question
 
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
but uh I wonder like um in regular times
 
00:21:21.789 --> 00:21:21.799 align:start position:0%
our medicine is run by medical
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
professionals with some input from
 
00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:28.799 align:start position:0%
scientists and some input with local
 
00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:29.789 align:start position:0%
scientists and some input with local
policy

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:29.799 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:21:32.830 --> 00:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
makers and then we switch to times when
 
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
a lot of it is run by military and
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
agencies like Homeland Security so I
 
00:21:40.669 --> 00:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
wonder what kind of lessons we learned
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
from that is a is military and Homeland
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
Security the best equipped to run
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
our medicine or part of it and uh is
 
00:21:58.149 --> 00:21:58.159 align:start position:0%
there any better interaction between
 
00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
science scientists for example and those
 
00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
implementing uh in agencies those
 
00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:08.240 align:start position:0%
medical decisions could be made in
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
future in case if we need to involve
 
00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
them again and in my
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
view uh we we all often hear about uh
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
science has changed so our knowledge
 
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.470 align:start position:0%
science has changed so our knowledge
evolves

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
evolves
 
00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:27.000 align:start position:0%
and in order to implement the best
 
00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
decision we need discussion we need some
 
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:33.360 align:start position:0%
uh some variety of opinions but when we
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
have some kind of militarized response
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
with a simple task to be achieved the
 
00:22:42.549 --> 00:22:42.559 align:start position:0%
tendency is to do the opposite is to
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
shut down all the discussions and just
 
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
to follow the goal that was initially
 
00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
set and that might be one of the line of
 
00:22:56.549 --> 00:22:56.559 align:start position:0%
questioning we want to ask how we should
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
uh and I I I like your where you're
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
going there but I think we have to have
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh director of Homeland Security in here
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
to really understand some part of that
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you represent evil I mean
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
I think part of the challenge here is
 
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
that Homeland Security is actually
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
assessing everything that we're talking
 
00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
about and their report isn't going to be
 
00:23:25.430 --> 00:23:25.440 align:start position:0%
done until the end of June so we'll just
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know who knows what they'll be able
 
00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
to say when they're here
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
I just would uh encourage us that when
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
we're putting together questions that we
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
keep it to a very limited number
 
00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:40.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise it becomes I think really
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
overwhelming for the agency I mean we
 
00:23:45.669 --> 00:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
can't send and I'm not saying anybody
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
was suggesting that we are but we can't
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
send them pages and pages and pages of
 
00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:53.240 align:start position:0%
questions because at that rate we're
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
going to get less I think you know less
 
00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400 align:start position:0%
is Le it so we need to be careful of of
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
the magnitude of what we're asking and
 
00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
and and be pretty
 
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
focused okay um I believe we have
 
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
someone from the public here uh that
 
00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:16.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:20.669 --> 00:24:20.679 align:start position:0%
uh are you you yeah uh please have a
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
seat uh introduce yourself
 
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:27.350 align:start position:0%
seat uh introduce yourself
and

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%

absolutely

00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
please introduce yourself uh where
 
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
you're from and what you like to discuss

00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
all right that's a New Hampshire
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
thing sorry just
 
00:26:06.269 --> 00:26:06.279 align:start position:0%
kidding all right my name is John Bodwin
 
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
I live in Massachusetts I grew up in
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
Connecticut and I plan to move to New
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I started a company in New
 
00:26:12.679 --> 00:26:13.830 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I started a company in New
Hampshire

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:26:16.389 --> 00:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
recently uh these were printed in LEL
 
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts but they're distributed by
 
00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
pathway book service in New Hampshire uh
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
it's one of one of your companies a very
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
good company I would highly recommend
 
00:26:29.029 --> 00:26:29.039 align:start position:0%
them um
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
I'm one of very few people in the world
 
00:26:34.909 --> 00:26:34.919 align:start position:0%
that has uh more than a million
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
non-reacted um death
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
records that have been analyzed I've
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
been looking at them for almost two
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
years now actually over two years it's
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
uh it's April so over two years and from
 
00:26:48.830 --> 00:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
that I was able to glean certain things
 
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:52.360 align:start position:0%
that no one really can from the CDC data
 
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
which isn't really the cdc's data it's a
 
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:56.200 align:start position:0%
compilation of all states that send
 
00:26:58.990 --> 00:26:59.000 align:start position:0%
their data to the CDC
 
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
in fact the only way to track uh causes
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
of death well before I get into it I'm
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
an engineer I have an MBA I um
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
electrical engineering my career was in
 
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
sales of large contracts so to get an
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
idea about what I did in my career I
 
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
would meet with um well it started out
 
00:27:20.789 --> 00:27:20.799 align:start position:0%
Engineers when I was young and by the
 
00:27:23.149 --> 00:27:23.159 align:start position:0%
time I I don't want to say retired but I
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
I was done with that uh career I was
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
meeting with CEOs CFOs CT
 
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
of multi-billion dollar
 
00:27:33.269 --> 00:27:33.279 align:start position:0%
corporations um I'll just go to the one
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
of the big deals I put together which
 
00:27:37.230 --> 00:27:37.240 align:start position:0%
was the guidance control system for the
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
Trident nuclear missile MK6 Le which is
 
00:27:41.509 --> 00:27:41.519 align:start position:0%
the Polaris nuclear missile that pops
 
00:27:42.269 --> 00:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
out of
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
submarines uh the guidance control
 
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
system looks like a basketball it sits
 
00:27:49.350 --> 00:27:49.360 align:start position:0%
in a nose cone and um the companies
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
let's see Ron northrip no northr wasn't
 
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:54.559 align:start position:0%
in that one the prime contractor was
 
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
Draper with whom I negotiated the
 
00:27:59.549 --> 00:27:59.559 align:start position:0%
contract and uh put all pieces together
 
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
but they talked to Ron in elsag gundo
 
00:28:05.389 --> 00:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
California not locally also General
 
00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:08.120 align:start position:0%
Dynamics in Pittsfield crane naval base
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
in Indiana Honeywell in Florida and in I
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
think their Fab was in the it was in the
 
00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:16.720 align:start position:0%
midwest maybe Minnesota so in in putting
 
00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:18.519 align:start position:0%
all these deals together for multiple
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
sites multiple Engineers um Executives
 
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
and very big corporations I'll cut to
 
00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
the Chase and say that's that's netted
 
00:28:27.669 --> 00:28:27.679 align:start position:0%
over a billion dollars in revenue for
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
the company I represented I was told not
 
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
to work on it but I did it anyway and I
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
think they're pretty happy about that so
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
um in putting all these deals together
 
00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:40.360 align:start position:0%
they put $40,000 of training into me
 
00:28:42.830 --> 00:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
which is kind of like an MBA over over
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
years and it's it's how to speak to
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
people do public speaking as well as how
 
00:28:48.509 --> 00:28:48.519 align:start position:0%
to negotiate but also how
 
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
to I don't want to say manipulate but um
 
00:28:54.909 --> 00:28:54.919 align:start position:0%
how to get people to uh understand what
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
you're trying to sell and it's nothing
 
00:28:58.110 --> 00:28:58.120 align:start position:0%
to do with what I'm trying to sell and
 
00:28:59.710 --> 00:28:59.720 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to say it's really what you
 
00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
want to hear and what's important to you
 
00:29:04.630 --> 00:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
and so it's to bring the value of the
 
00:29:05.909 --> 00:29:05.919 align:start position:0%
information to the person who's
 
00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:08.200 align:start position:0%
listening which is what I'm here to do
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
today uh so that was my career and
 
00:29:14.909 --> 00:29:14.919 align:start position:0%
because of that I speak well I interface
 
00:29:17.909 --> 00:29:17.919 align:start position:0%
with people well and um I can also
 
00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
investigate I also have my engineering
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
skills I understand the physical world
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
um I understand well
 
00:29:26.669 --> 00:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
science that people don't understand
 
00:29:30.029 --> 00:29:30.039 align:start position:0%
what science is it's very long process
 
00:29:32.669 --> 00:29:32.679 align:start position:0%
uh engineering is is not you work on a
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
schedule the product has to work it has
 
00:29:37.230 --> 00:29:37.240 align:start position:0%
to be safe and it has to make money if
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make money you don't get a
 
00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
job as an engineer right the company
 
00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:44.360 align:start position:0%
goes out of business science they get
 
00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:46.799 align:start position:0%
grants they have to beg the government
 
00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:49.720 align:start position:0%
for Grants um they hope that their baby
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
their thesis their hypothesis um has
 
00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
enough evidence behind it after maybe 10
 
00:29:58.110 --> 00:29:58.120 align:start position:0%
20 years um and they they don't really
 
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
really uh they should not be relied upon
 
00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:02.640 align:start position:0%
is what I'm saying so I have a lot to
 
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
say and I'm going to get into the data
 
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:08.440 align:start position:0%
uh call it data but these are really
 
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
people every data point is a person
 
00:30:13.230 --> 00:30:13.240 align:start position:0%
every pixel and every graph are people
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
who died and these are excess people who
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
died that should not have died and they
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
did not die from covid they died from
 
00:30:20.399 --> 00:30:21.509 align:start position:0%
did not die from covid they died from
government

00:30:21.509 --> 00:30:21.519 align:start position:0%
government
 
00:30:25.070 --> 00:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
interventions so I'll say right now I'm
 
00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
here as a journalist um I write under
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
the name kand which means or Ina kand um
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
little different accent up there it
 
00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:38.679 align:start position:0%
means um bad dog I like Elgato Malo from
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
uh Twitter and that's Spanish for the
 
00:30:43.789 --> 00:30:43.799 align:start position:0%
bad cat so I'm French and I'm the bad
 
00:30:46.269 --> 00:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
dog and as a
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
journalist um there are certain
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
whistleblowers who have come to me with
 
00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
government data I'm going to re review
 
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
that first before I get into the data I
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
have officially and publicly
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
so the following information regarding
 
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:04.600 align:start position:0%
the deaths of New Hampshire citizens um
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
should not have been hidden from the
 
00:31:07.629 --> 00:31:07.639 align:start position:0%
people the people need to know in order
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
to make an informed decision whether or
 
00:31:12.909 --> 00:31:12.919 align:start position:0%
not they should take a countermeasure as
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
they call it or they've renamed it a
 
00:31:17.789 --> 00:31:17.799 align:start position:0%
vaccine which isn't really what it was
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
but they changed the definition of
 
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine I'm sure you guys know that in
 
00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:24.200 align:start position:0%
order to call this a
 
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
vaccine uh the data belongs to the
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
people not the government identif
 
00:31:29.430 --> 00:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
ification need not be known for the
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
people to know the results what that
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
means is
 
00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.629 align:start position:0%
means is
um

00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
you your HHS Department should be
 
00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:40.600 align:start position:0%
providing this information it doesn't
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
have to be identities they always hide
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
behind the oh uh we can't identify them
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
because of Privacy Law well the privacy
 
00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:49.440 align:start position:0%
laws are different in Death than they
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
are in life and hipa does not apply but
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh there's no reason why they can't give
 
00:31:56.669 --> 00:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
you the data as to how many people died
 
00:31:59.789 --> 00:31:59.799 align:start position:0%
the day of the day after two days after
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
vaccination so at least 87 people died
 
00:32:05.269 --> 00:32:05.279 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire within 3 days of covid
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
immunization at least 50 died within two
 
00:32:09.629 --> 00:32:09.639 align:start position:0%
days of covid immunization in New
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at least 24 died the day of or
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
the day after the following 11 people
 
00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
and I'll only use their first names out
 
00:32:18.669 --> 00:32:18.679 align:start position:0%
of respect because I did testify at
 
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
another hearing and I was told um not to
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
use the last name so I'll honor that so
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
the following 11 people died on the same
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
day of covid immunization Rodney was 62
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
years old died March 29 2022 Barbara 68
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
years old died January 5 2021 Amy
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
72 October 28
 
00:32:43.389 --> 00:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
2021 Daniel
 
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
76 May 28 2021 that that's four in
 
00:32:51.389 --> 00:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
2021 we should have known then that was
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
four years ago excuse me three years ago
 
00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
three years ago there was enough data to
 
00:32:58.149 --> 00:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
shut this down V's vaccine aders event
 
00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:00.600 align:start position:0%
Reporting System I looked at that in
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
February of
 
00:33:04.029 --> 00:33:04.039 align:start position:0%
2021 there was enough information in
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
four weeks of January to shut the
 
00:33:08.669 --> 00:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
vaccine down but it was all hidden and
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
suppressed um an was 77 May 18 2022
 
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
Louise Fontaine 81 June 22 2021
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
margarite was 83 years old died January
 
00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:28.039 align:start position:0%
29 2021 Roger died May 30 2021 Katherine
 
00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
84 years old died January 9 2021 Sheila
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
died January 31 2021 Edward January 18
 
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
2021 he was 93 these 11 died on the same
 
00:33:42.909 --> 00:33:42.919 align:start position:0%
day of covid immunization in New
 
00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
people since this is a a broad-based
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
covid uh response efficacy hearing I I
 
00:33:57.789 --> 00:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
want to go back to the mask mandate and
 
00:33:59.590 --> 00:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
alert you to certain facts you probably
 
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
don't know very few people know unless
 
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:05.080 align:start position:0%
you read um my
 
00:34:07.269 --> 00:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
articles I'm going to submit this I
 
00:34:08.750 --> 00:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
don't have multiple copies I'm just
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
going to read a little bit from it I
 
00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:11.839 align:start position:0%
won't spend too much time on masks
 
00:34:13.950 --> 00:34:13.960 align:start position:0%
people don't want to hear about it but
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
it's going to happen again if you don't
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
understand what really happened
 
00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
so um I sued Governor Charlie Baker and
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
the public health commissioner in
 
00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in the US District Court
 
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
District of Massachusetts um case 1 20-
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:38.669 --> 00:34:38.679 align:start position:0%
dnmg that was over order 31 in
 
00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:46.109 --> 00:34:46.119 align:start position:0%
orders I sued on the basis of I'm deaf
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
in one ear and he violated my
 
00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights because I could
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
not receive free speech from others
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
because I could not hear them without
 
00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
seeing their lips move so by ordering
 
00:34:58.750 --> 00:34:58.760 align:start position:0%
other people to cover their mouths he
 
00:35:01.349 --> 00:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
deprived me of receiving free speech
 
00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
that was the legal Theory I
 
00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:06.640 align:start position:0%
used they rescinded the governor
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
rescinded order 31 and issued order 55
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
and in order 55 in paragraph 2B there is
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
an exception the exception is people
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
hearing impaired and people speaking to
 
00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
anybody hearing impaired don't have to
 
00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
wear a mask and by doing so he took my
 
00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
standing I'll get into standing later
 
00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:27.160 align:start position:0%
it's probably something the the house
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
members should consider in changing the
 
00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:30.760 align:start position:0%
rules of civil procedure of New
 
00:35:32.589 --> 00:35:32.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so that cases don't get kicked
 
00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
out of court and people's uh most
 
00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
foundational uh rights are not violated
 
00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:39.040 align:start position:0%
that is to the right to petition the
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
government for redress grievances but
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
sticking to the mask issue for a moment
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
and how it relates to New
 
00:35:49.309 --> 00:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire let me let me go on on that
 
00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
um so the case was dismissed because I
 
00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
didn't have standing but my public
 
00:35:56.309 --> 00:35:56.319 align:start position:0%
records request came in the day the case
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
was dismissed and I got 1,200 pages and
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
if you remember the news in 2020 how
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts oh what a major coup they
 
00:36:07.349 --> 00:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
got um 1.4 or 1.7 million masks from
 
00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:08.720 align:start position:0%
China flown in on the New England
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
Patriots jet everybody remember
 
00:36:14.430 --> 00:36:14.440 align:start position:0%
that okay well they they contracted with
 
00:36:16.589 --> 00:36:16.599 align:start position:0%
Professor Gregory rled at MIT to test
 
00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:19.000 align:start position:0%
those masks I have the internal emails
 
00:36:20.349 --> 00:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
from the Massachusetts Department of
 
00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:23.160 align:start position:0%
Public Health he tested the masks and on
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
April 20th 2020 he reported back to the
 
00:36:27.069 --> 00:36:27.079 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Department of Public
 
00:36:28.470 --> 00:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
Health they don't
 
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:31.200 align:start position:0%
work they knew then they don't
 
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
work it's supposed to be 95%
 
00:36:38.309 --> 00:36:38.319 align:start position:0%
efficacy they were at 38 42 they got up
 
00:36:40.309 --> 00:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
to 80 in one batch but most of them were
 
00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
around 50% which makes them basically
 
00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
useless and that's across a test fixture
 
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
not a person's mouth with zero
 
00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
leaks if you have a perfect fit there
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
are also instructions in this article
 
00:36:53.790 --> 00:36:53.800 align:start position:0%
this is all internal emails from the
 
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Health he knew on
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
April 20th 2020 before he issued the
 
00:36:59.790 --> 00:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
mask mandate like every governor in
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
every state issued some mask Mandate of
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
some type except I believe South
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
Dakota um and I think FL it depends on
 
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
the state some states go by County they
 
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
have County rules um but you had a broad
 
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
sweeping everybody doing masks and
 
00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
fouchy saying you heard him say ah they
 
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:18.880 align:start position:0%
don't really do anything until somebody
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
got to him and said no no no we need to
 
00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:23.400 align:start position:0%
coers people into getting the vaccine so
 
00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:25.880 align:start position:0%
make them more masks until they get the
 
00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine so
 
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
a an attorney in in New Hampshire who
 
00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
took on the governor of New Hampshire
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
for parents who didn't want their kids
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
masked in
 
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.589 align:start position:0%
masked in
schools

00:37:42.589 --> 00:37:42.599 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
well the the bar of New Hampshire went
 
00:37:47.750 --> 00:37:47.760 align:start position:0%
back in his past found something and uh
 
00:37:49.750 --> 00:37:49.760 align:start position:0%
basically attacked him and they
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
suspended his license to practice for
 
00:37:53.829 --> 00:37:53.839 align:start position:0%
two years on the way out of the meeting
 
00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
I said hey what did they say to you now
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
of course this is here say but this
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
isn't the court well they just asked me
 
00:38:01.589 --> 00:38:01.599 align:start position:0%
how the case was going against the
 
00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:04.520 align:start position:0%
governor like yeah you were sent a
 
00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
message if you go against the government
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
for anything like a mask on a child
 
00:38:13.069 --> 00:38:13.079 align:start position:0%
where they're fidgeting with it it does
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
nothing in fact it does the opposite
 
00:38:17.510 --> 00:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
because Cassidy baraca was seven years
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
old and she died with fungal and
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
bacterial puracy she didn't die from
 
00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
that she died from the vaccine she
 
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:25.960 align:start position:0%
reacted in five minutes threw up for8 to
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
10 hours and they gave her another one a
 
00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
couple weeks
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
later and she died terrible stomach pain
 
00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:38.400 align:start position:0%
agonizing she was dead in five days but
 
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
she died with fungal and bacterial
 
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.230 align:start position:0%
she died with fungal and bacterial
puracy

00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
puracy
 
00:38:44.710 --> 00:38:44.720 align:start position:0%
why if if you understand material
 
00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:46.480 align:start position:0%
properties and you understand fluid
 
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
dynamics then breathing into something
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
on your face is like wearing a petri
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
dish for six to eight hours all day it
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
makes no sense at all it's a warm moist
 
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
environment now viruses can't replicate
 
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
without a host but bacteria and fungi do
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
and they did you you not only breathe
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
them in you replicate them multiply them
 
00:39:10.109 --> 00:39:10.119 align:start position:0%
in the mask and then when you breathe in
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
they go deeper into your lungs because
 
00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:13.839 align:start position:0%
they're smaller particles and they
 
00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
deposit deeper so with regard to um
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
covid measures you should look into why
 
00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
the mask mandate
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
occurred and why did education
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
departments then require students to
 
00:39:30.270 --> 00:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
wear masks and in the same uh what they
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
call an order which isn't in order
 
00:39:33.390 --> 00:39:33.400 align:start position:0%
because they generally don't have the
 
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
authority to do
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
that give you an example in
 
00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:40.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um they said if the class
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
gets if the school gets to 80%
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate then you don't have to
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
wear a
 
00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:49.480 align:start position:0%
mask what does that have to do with the
 
00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
trying to protect people it's clearly a
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
carrot and stick these rules that came
 
00:39:56.550 --> 00:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
out and and check the rules in New
 
00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:57.950 align:start position:0%
out and and check the rules in New
Hampshire

00:39:57.950 --> 00:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:00.400 align:start position:0%
I I I'm friends with one of the uh
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
litigants one of the plaintiffs in the
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
case um and she she lived in Brook the
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
Brookline um Hollis school
 
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
district and as since left the state
 
00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:11.720 align:start position:0%
like many people because they don't want
 
00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:14.440 align:start position:0%
their kids being abused by mandates that
 
00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
do nothing except coers people to get a
 
00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
dangerous there was other coercion
 
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:24.440 align:start position:0%
coercion of doctors you need to look
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
into excuse me the American Board of
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
internal medicine American Board of
 
00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
Family Medicine American Board of
 
00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:32.839 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics put out a joint statement to
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
all doctors in the
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
country and this was based on the
 
00:40:39.349 --> 00:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
Federation of State Medical
 
00:40:42.309 --> 00:40:42.319 align:start position:0%
boards now that that sounds like an
 
00:40:44.430 --> 00:40:44.440 align:start position:0%
official organization right the
 
00:40:47.309 --> 00:40:47.319 align:start position:0%
Federation of State Medical boards it's
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
a nonprofit non-governmental
 
00:40:51.390 --> 00:40:51.400 align:start position:0%
organization with a ton of power they
 
00:40:53.670 --> 00:40:53.680 align:start position:0%
think they regulate everything licensing
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
and everything
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
else go look at who their executives are
 
00:41:00.309 --> 00:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
it's on the um it's on the web look at
 
00:41:02.589 --> 00:41:02.599 align:start position:0%
the board of directors they're more
 
00:41:04.230 --> 00:41:04.240 align:start position:0%
concerned about Dei than they are
 
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about making sure doctors are
 
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
qualified to practice medicine and when
 
00:41:10.309 --> 00:41:10.319 align:start position:0%
you have a centralization of authority
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
like that they re tyranny down on the
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
people and what you have as lwes at the
 
00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
margins I I I'll try not to talk too
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
economic focused um and people I'm told
 
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
I speak above U certain people when I do
 
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
that but so the Federation of State
 
00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:29.119 align:start position:0%
Medical boards
 
00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
Well here here's the uh I'll I'll submit
 
00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:34.760 align:start position:0%
this as well this was September 9 2021
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
the Federation of State Medical boards
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
which supports its member states member
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
State Medical licensing boards has
 
00:41:43.109 --> 00:41:43.119 align:start position:0%
recently issued a statement it sounds
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
like they're in charge of supporting
 
00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
your medical licensing board but they
 
00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be they're just another
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
organization they're a RICO
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
organization so saying that providing
 
00:41:58.990 --> 00:41:59.000 align:start position:0%
misinformation about the covid-19
 
00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine contradicts Physicians ethical
 
00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
and professional
 
00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities they're telling
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
Physicians they they can't say anything
 
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:11.710 --> 00:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
misinformation and therefore may be
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
subject to physician disciplinary
 
00:42:16.550 --> 00:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
actions including suspension or rication
 
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:18.760 align:start position:0%
of their medical license they're
 
00:42:21.430 --> 00:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
threatening publicly still on the web
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
today every single doctor in this
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
country that if they don't comply if
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
they don't shut up and they don't give
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
them the guidelines as to what's
 
00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
information misinformation or
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:35.480 align:start position:0%
disinformation they're now in charge of
 
00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
your State Licensing Board if I were a
 
00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
resident in New Hampshire I'd be pretty
 
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
upset some group down in Texas that's
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
getting a ton of money from various
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
organizations is telling your medical
 
00:42:48.549 --> 00:42:48.559 align:start position:0%
board what to
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
do uh we are the American Board of
 
00:42:52.549 --> 00:42:52.559 align:start position:0%
Family Medicine American Board of
 
00:42:55.309 --> 00:42:55.319 align:start position:0%
internal medicine American Board of
 
00:42:58.030 --> 00:42:58.040 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics and we support the fsmb's
 
00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
position so this this joint statement is
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
from the CEOs of those three medical
 
00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
boards now if you don't know the
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
difference so State Licensing boards are
 
00:43:09.990 --> 00:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
for licensing your doctors but the board
 
00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
certifications those are kind of NGO
 
00:43:15.309 --> 00:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
organizations that certify doctors so
 
00:43:18.270 --> 00:43:18.280 align:start position:0%
that they can say operate in a hospital
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
because a hospital for insurance reasons
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
won't let um a
 
00:43:25.390 --> 00:43:25.400 align:start position:0%
doctor they'll take away privileges to
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
use the hospital which they need to use
 
00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
right so board certification is very
 
00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:32.079 align:start position:0%
important to doctors in order to be able
 
00:43:34.109 --> 00:43:34.119 align:start position:0%
to function in their in their
 
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
purview um and they go on we also want
 
00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:38.559 align:start position:0%
Physicians certified by our boards to
 
00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:39.920 align:start position:0%
know that such unethical or
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
unprofessional conduct may prompt their
 
00:43:41.599 --> 00:43:42.950 align:start position:0%
unprofessional conduct may prompt their
respective

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
respective
 
00:43:47.349 --> 00:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
board to be take to take action that
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
could put their certification at risk
 
00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.870 align:start position:0%
could put their certification at risk
another

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
threat this is the society we live in
 
00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:55.400 align:start position:0%
where the doctors you go to are
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
threatened by their boards and are
 
00:43:58.430 --> 00:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
making making decisions for their own
 
00:44:00.150 --> 00:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
best interest and not
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
yours I'll submit that as well the
 
00:44:08.430 --> 00:44:08.440 align:start position:0%
FSNB uh spreading covid vaccine
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
information so this is directly from the
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
S FSNB that's referred to by the CEOs of
 
00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.950 align:start position:0%
S FSNB that's referred to by the CEOs of
those

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
boards um I'm not sure if you're
 
00:44:24.510 --> 00:44:24.520 align:start position:0%
familiar with Rico crime uh the elements
 
00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:26.200 align:start position:0%
of a RICO crime it has to be an
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
Enterprise that's two or more entities
 
00:44:30.230 --> 00:44:30.240 align:start position:0%
in most jurisdictions sometimes it's
 
00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:31.400 align:start position:0%
three or more depends on the
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that you're in this being
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
Federal uh two or more entities I just
 
00:44:38.549 --> 00:44:38.559 align:start position:0%
read you3 and four if you include the
 
00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:42.400 align:start position:0%
FSNB um it has to be a pattern now
 
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
pattern means again different things in
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
different jurisdictions but in most
 
00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
cases it's at least two times so they
 
00:44:50.950 --> 00:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
have to have committed that illegal
 
00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:53.880 align:start position:0%
activity at least twice of racketeering
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
activity and the racketeering activity
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
are it's a list of predicate crimes
 
00:44:59.710 --> 00:44:59.720 align:start position:0%
crimes of which fraud murder and such
 
00:45:02.950 --> 00:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
can be uh part of it and I will get into
 
00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
that so the these organizations relating
 
00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:07.760 align:start position:0%
to each other and communicating with
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
each other especially with um exhibit H
 
00:45:13.829 --> 00:45:13.839 align:start position:0%
in the CDC memorandum that I handed to
 
00:45:15.870 --> 00:45:15.880 align:start position:0%
you you don't have to look now but um if
 
00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:17.880 align:start position:0%
you look at that you'll see America
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
First legal Steven Miller is associated
 
00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:22.680 align:start position:0%
with that organization they did a state
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
they did a Foya a federal um Foya not a
 
00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
state one for hhs.gov and received
 
00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:34.240 align:start position:0%
information and in that information you
 
00:45:37.589 --> 00:45:37.599 align:start position:0%
will see that hhs.gov
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
CDC and others uh from the US government
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
conspired with people from Facebook and
 
00:45:46.109 --> 00:45:46.119 align:start position:0%
Twitter they have an open portal they
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
communicate as to what information they
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
want taken
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
down so whatever citizens post the
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
government our government and the the
 
00:45:59.470 --> 00:45:59.480 align:start position:0%
centralized government in Washington DC
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
is telling you what you can or cannot
 
00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:03.680 align:start position:0%
say what they deem misinformation even
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
if it's not misinformation if they don't
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
like it they want it down they have
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
people suspended they have people they
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
had people embedded in Twitter you know
 
00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:14.319 align:start position:0%
that you know that that you know if they
 
00:46:15.549 --> 00:46:15.559 align:start position:0%
weren't getting their check directly
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
from FBI they were still taking orders
 
00:46:19.069 --> 00:46:19.079 align:start position:0%
and their check was coming from Twitter
 
00:46:19.079 --> 00:46:19.990 align:start position:0%
and their check was coming from Twitter
or

00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:46:23.109 --> 00:46:23.119 align:start position:0%
Facebook so the fsmb uh like I said
 
00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
they're basically impersonating a
 
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
federal agency as a it's a nonprofit
 
00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
Federation not a federal entity State
 
00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:31.760 align:start position:0%
Licensing boards bow down to a woke
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
entity out of Houston Texas run by
 
00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:36.200 align:start position:0%
oligarchs every board and every group is
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
captured and they Co they use coercion
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
solicitation to get doctors and Hospital
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
administrators to to do their bidding if
 
00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
youve if you interview certain doctors
 
00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
you'll learn what I learned directly and
 
00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:53.720 align:start position:0%
why they left Massachusetts or another
 
00:46:57.470 --> 00:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
state that pushes the uh the drugs
 
00:47:00.670 --> 00:47:00.680 align:start position:0%
um one was a
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
40-year-old came in with 95%
 
00:47:07.710 --> 00:47:07.720 align:start position:0%
oxygen he was told he had to by the
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
hospital Administration staff he had to
 
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
put them on a
 
00:47:13.790 --> 00:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
ventilator why well the doctors were
 
00:47:15.829 --> 00:47:15.839 align:start position:0%
told that if you don't put somebody on a
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
ventilator and you only put them on a
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
CPAP you don't contain the aerosols to
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
the patient a CPAP will allow the
 
00:47:23.309 --> 00:47:23.319 align:start position:0%
aerosols to go into the
 
00:47:26.030 --> 00:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
room and the staff is going to die the
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
nurses the doctor
 
00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:28.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to
 
00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:30.470 align:start position:0%
they're going to
die

00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
die
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
so that's what they did they took people
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
with no problem with oxygen and they put
 
00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:37.480 align:start position:0%
them on
 
00:47:39.190 --> 00:47:39.200 align:start position:0%
ventilators now why did the
 
00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:42.200 align:start position:0%
administrators of hospitals tell the
 
00:47:44.670 --> 00:47:44.680 align:start position:0%
doctors to do this was it because they
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
really believed about the aerosol
 
00:47:49.309 --> 00:47:49.319 align:start position:0%
problem or was it because the car act
 
00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
and other legislation at DC level in and
 
00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:54.440 align:start position:0%
I heard you talking earlier about the
 
00:47:57.030 --> 00:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
money it incentivizes people put putting
 
00:47:58.950 --> 00:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
on being put on
 
00:48:00.829 --> 00:48:00.839 align:start position:0%
ventilators there are a few things that
 
00:48:03.549 --> 00:48:03.559 align:start position:0%
are incentivized one is putting covid
 
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
diagnosis on a death record or um a
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
patient record they get money for
 
00:48:13.109 --> 00:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
that using ventilators they get money
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
Desir if you don't mind me asking um do
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
you have documentation that shows that
 
00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
they're being incentivized
 
00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:31.240 align:start position:0%
just out of curiosity if if I might I I
 
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
don't mean to interrupt but if I might I
 
00:48:34.309 --> 00:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
that was actually in the documentation I
 
00:48:36.150 --> 00:48:36.160 align:start position:0%
read into the record of the last
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
representative there we go um direct
 
00:48:45.790 --> 00:48:45.800 align:start position:0%
accounting files no that's like the Holy
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
Grail of evidence nobody has but I I can
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
go on the web and I can look at cms.gov
 
00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
okay you go to cms.gov and look for
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
nctap that's a covid payout plan and
 
00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
you'll find that aluman uh which is
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
baricitinib or vlar which is remes has a
 
00:49:06.190 --> 00:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
20% Adder to the entire hospital bill if
 
00:49:09.309 --> 00:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
if if somebody goes in with a I'll get
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
to examples in a little bit you're going
 
00:49:13.069 --> 00:49:13.079 align:start position:0%
to see when I get to the real evidence
 
00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
um you'll see what I mean it's it's it's
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
bad they they murdered a lot of
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
people so the car's act I went through
 
00:49:29.470 --> 00:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
um is basically a solicitation of fraud
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
um Walter E Williams said it but
 
00:49:34.990 --> 00:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
probably also said by Thomas soul Milton
 
00:49:36.430 --> 00:49:36.440 align:start position:0%
Friedman if you subsidize something
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
you'll get more of it and since they
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
subsidized Co being put on a death
 
00:49:42.990 --> 00:49:43.000 align:start position:0%
certificate thinking somehow or
 
00:49:44.870 --> 00:49:44.880 align:start position:0%
convincing the people that that's going
 
00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
to save
 
00:49:47.950 --> 00:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
people how is that going to save
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
somebody but that's what they did uh
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
people being put on ventilators that's
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
an 86% kill
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
rate 86% of people
 
00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
get put on
 
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
ventilators and they did it to people
 
00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:03.760 align:start position:0%
who whose vital signs were
 
00:50:05.950 --> 00:50:05.960 align:start position:0%
normal and they
 
00:50:11.150 --> 00:50:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
Danielle so 18 USC 1035 is false
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
statements on Healthcare matters 1040 is
 
00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
fraud and disaster relief 1343 is fraud
 
00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
by wire 241 is conspiracy against rights
 
00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:25.799 align:start position:0%
242 is deprivation of rights under color
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
of law those are just five there's a lot
 
00:50:32.109 --> 00:50:32.119 align:start position:0%
more and they carry five to 20 years
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes more and they add up because
 
00:50:37.069 --> 00:50:37.079 align:start position:0%
they did all these things plus murder um
 
00:50:38.549 --> 00:50:38.559 align:start position:0%
they're doing this as a matter of custom
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
and practice in almost every um medical
 
00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:44.520 align:start position:0%
examiner office and I say that by
 
00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
extrapolating the data that I have
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
across other states I know that they've
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
been writing things on death
 
00:50:51.910 --> 00:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
certificates that are not true I also
 
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
know that the CDC has been deleting
 
00:50:56.710 --> 00:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
vaccine as a cause of death which I will
 
00:50:58.710 --> 00:50:58.720 align:start position:0%
show you evidence of that's in the CDC
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:08.319 align:start position:0%
51 so New Hampshire deaths in
 
00:51:09.789 --> 00:51:09.799 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Connecticut if you
 
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
open the books there are some loose um
 
00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:17.190 --> 00:51:17.200 align:start position:0%
front I'll try to go through these
 
00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.270 align:start position:0%
front I'll try to go through these
quickly

00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:51:22.270 --> 00:51:22.280 align:start position:0%
um this is public these are obituaries
 
00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
online so uh Rick Rick Morris he died of
 
00:51:27.630 --> 00:51:27.640 align:start position:0%
a heart attack in his
 
00:51:31.870 --> 00:51:31.880 align:start position:0%
sleep March 5th 2024 at age
 
00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:36.119 align:start position:0%
64 I know that he was vaccinated because
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
the it correlated to the only record
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
available in in vs for that person um
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
with all those details of death and so
 
00:51:48.950 --> 00:51:48.960 align:start position:0%
he was vaccinated on January 25th that's
 
00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.190 align:start position:0%
he was vaccinated on January 25th that's
40

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:50.200 align:start position:0%
40
 
00:51:53.549 --> 00:51:53.559 align:start position:0%
days um it should be
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
investigated if if this be's ID really
 
00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
is him then he died in 40 days after
 
00:52:00.069 --> 00:52:00.079 align:start position:0%
Gene drug
 
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
injection on March 5th
 
00:52:06.150 --> 00:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
2024 people are still getting the
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
vaccine excuse me on January 25th
 
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
2024 people are still taking these shots
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
because the government and state
 
00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:16.280 align:start position:0%
governments are telling them to and
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
they're still
 
00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
dying so the lack of information is
 
00:52:23.069 --> 00:52:23.079 align:start position:0%
actually if you're a knowing person and
 
00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
many of the people in these Health
 
00:52:26.510 --> 00:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
departments in states are knowing
 
00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
knowing people if they know and they're
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
not stepping forward then it's
 
00:52:33.230 --> 00:52:33.240 align:start position:0%
murder uh if you turn the page over Gary
 
00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
Dayton um died April 30 2022 he was 82
 
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
years old this requires
 
00:52:41.829 --> 00:52:41.839 align:start position:0%
investigation he actually died in
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
Connecticut that's why it says
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
Connecticut on a death certificate but
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
he was a resident of Hanover New
 
00:52:51.349 --> 00:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and a cerebrovascular accident
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
stroke New Hampshire resident Robert
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
immunization he had a heart transplant
 
00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:07.430 align:start position:0%
immunization he had a heart transplant
in

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:07.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:53:09.910 --> 00:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
2017 I knew that these drugs were
 
00:53:12.670 --> 00:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
prothrombotic in February of
 
00:53:15.230 --> 00:53:15.240 align:start position:0%
2021 by reading the Bears dat it was
 
00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:17.920 align:start position:0%
obvious and and my analyses even there's
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
a video of me in APR from April of
 
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
20121 and in that video I have listed
 
00:53:27.109 --> 00:53:27.119 align:start position:0%
many of the deaths from pulmonary UL
 
00:53:29.349 --> 00:53:29.359 align:start position:0%
ISM and
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
other excuse me and other prothrombotic
 
00:53:38.109 --> 00:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
old oh and then Anna Tucker was
 
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
26 she was immunized one day before she
 
00:53:53.589 --> 00:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
died on January 8th she was immunized on
 
00:53:55.910 --> 00:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
January 7th passed away peacefully in
 
00:53:57.150 --> 00:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
her sleep
 
00:53:57.160 --> 00:53:58.589 align:start position:0%
her sleep
stou

00:53:58.589 --> 00:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
stou
 
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:03.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
22nd he was vaccinated earlier than the
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.309 --> 00:54:17.319 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly and if we look at the
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
graphs these are I don't have access to
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire data which is which is
 
00:54:25.349 --> 00:54:25.359 align:start position:0%
a problem because nobody in New
 
00:54:27.950 --> 00:54:27.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has access to it either that's
 
00:54:30.829 --> 00:54:30.839 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to do with hb1 1661
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
was get the people of New Hampshire to
 
00:54:35.829 --> 00:54:35.839 align:start position:0%
get the data and that doesn't mean
 
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:37.960 align:start position:0%
divulging people's names this means
 
00:54:39.470 --> 00:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
knowing what's happening in New
 
00:54:42.589 --> 00:54:42.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what are people dying from so
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
these um if you understand the term
 
00:54:47.309 --> 00:54:47.319 align:start position:0%
ketris paribus it means all other things
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
being equal or in
 
00:54:48.839 --> 00:54:50.470 align:start position:0%
being equal or in
parity

00:54:50.470 --> 00:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
parity
 
00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
and Through the Years people you from
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire utilize Massachusetts
 
00:54:57.510 --> 00:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
hospitals and they travel to
 
00:55:00.390 --> 00:55:00.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and so forth and so all
 
00:55:02.030 --> 00:55:02.040 align:start position:0%
the other things being equal say the
 
00:55:03.789 --> 00:55:03.799 align:start position:0%
number of people use the hospitals and
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
so forth um let's look at that in look
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
at these graphs in that light and you'll
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
notice in the top left are the
 
00:55:16.829 --> 00:55:16.839 align:start position:0%
D68 codes these These are icd10 codes
 
00:55:19.430 --> 00:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
these are the codes used internationally
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
put out by the wh a subset of which is
 
00:55:23.029 --> 00:55:23.039 align:start position:0%
adopted by the
 
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
CDC and so New Hampshire what you will
 
00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
do is is you will create a death record
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
with part one and part two part one is
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
the causes of death and it'll be ABC D
 
00:55:38.029 --> 00:55:38.039 align:start position:0%
in backward time order the way it should
 
00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
be but the doctors don't know how to do
 
00:55:42.789 --> 00:55:42.799 align:start position:0%
it right so they get it backwards a lot
 
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
of times and part two is contributing
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
conditions usually like you know asthma
 
00:55:51.950 --> 00:55:51.960 align:start position:0%
smoking alcoholic um conditions that may
 
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:55.000 align:start position:0%
have contributed to the cause of
 
00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%
death so all other things being equal in
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
these clot deaths you'll notice that in
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
2015 it was four and then 2016 it was
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
four and then three and then two then
 
00:56:08.789 --> 00:56:08.799 align:start position:0%
five and then six and then in 2021 when
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
the shots came out it was
 
00:56:13.950 --> 00:56:13.960 align:start position:0%
12 it's more than double the average
 
00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:15.240 align:start position:0%
more than double the
 
00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
trend no matter how you look at it it's
 
00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
more than double in a single year and if
 
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
you look at anemas so there's there's
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
thomy toena and then there's just
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
regular anemia um
 
00:56:32.470 --> 00:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
neutropenia there a lot of a lot of
 
00:56:35.109 --> 00:56:35.119 align:start position:0%
anemas I I call it anemas that means
 
00:56:37.589 --> 00:56:37.599 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're lacking some type
 
00:56:37.599 --> 00:56:39.390 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're lacking some type
of

00:56:39.390 --> 00:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh of of blood cell of which you think
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
of three types the thrombocytes are your
 
00:56:46.390 --> 00:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
platelets right so they're for clotting
 
00:56:49.150 --> 00:56:49.160 align:start position:0%
and stuff and then your white cells for
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
killing off bad stuff in your body and
 
00:56:53.549 --> 00:56:53.559 align:start position:0%
red cells for basically carrying oxygen
 
00:56:56.750 --> 00:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
mostly um
 
00:56:59.069 --> 00:56:59.079 align:start position:0%
take a look at the graph you know it's
 
00:57:00.990 --> 00:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
it's pretty substantial and Stark when
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
you look at
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
21 what is happening to New Hampshire
 
00:57:04.559 --> 00:57:05.470 align:start position:0%
21 what is happening to New Hampshire
people

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:57:08.109 --> 00:57:08.119 align:start position:0%
dying a lot more in
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
21 from a cause that wasn't really high
 
00:57:15.069 --> 00:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
in 20120 2020 was the year of covid huge
 
00:57:16.390 --> 00:57:16.400 align:start position:0%
first wave in
 
00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I think the only reason
 
00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:20.359 align:start position:0%
that huge first wave didn't happen in
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is because you don't have
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
the financial incentive that we have in
 
00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:26.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the world should know
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
about Massachusetts I I'll I'll I'm
 
00:57:29.510 --> 00:57:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to take a break and tell you about
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts here for a second 600
 
00:57:34.430 --> 00:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
Pharma ecosystem companies in
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts alone $47 billion in
 
00:57:39.549 --> 00:57:39.559 align:start position:0%
Venture Capital financing there are 50
 
00:57:41.510 --> 00:57:41.520 align:start position:0%
companies over $100 million a year in
 
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
Pharma and revenue in Massachusetts 10
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
companies over a billion dollars mad's
 
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:47.720 align:start position:0%

00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
fizer's divisional headquarters for the
 
00:57:52.549 --> 00:57:52.559 align:start position:0%
MRNA vaccine is in Massachusetts relle
 
00:57:54.309 --> 00:57:54.319 align:start position:0%
walinsky is from Massachusetts my
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
congressman is Jake oen Claus's as Huen
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
class worked for fouchy for 20 years as
 
00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:00.119 align:start position:0%
his number
 
00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:02.440 align:start position:0%
two that's all
 
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and if you look at on J
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
July 27 2020 of all sovereigns in the
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
world with three million people or
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
more the top three purported covid
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
deaths per population were New York New
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
Jersey and Massachusetts with Belgium a
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
distant fourth so far distant that
 
00:58:27.150 --> 00:58:27.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts was 50% more than Belgium
 
00:58:28.990 --> 00:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
and I'll offend Belgium here by saying
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
they're probably one of the most corrupt
 
00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:33.400 align:start position:0%
countries over there in
 
00:58:36.750 --> 00:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
Europe so if if they're that way what is
 
00:58:38.230 --> 00:58:38.240 align:start position:0%
ma what are Massachusetts New York and
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
New Jersey and why why New York and New
 
00:58:42.750 --> 00:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
Jersey well you've got Wall Street New
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
Jersey's based Northern New Jersey is
 
00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:47.680 align:start position:0%
just a suburb of Wall Street Lower
 
00:58:50.349 --> 00:58:50.359 align:start position:0%
Manhattan so all the executives live out
 
00:58:54.069 --> 00:58:54.079 align:start position:0%
in the BBS in uh in New
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
Jersey they padded the numbers quite a
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
bit how do you prove it good luck I can
 
00:59:01.589 --> 00:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
prove it in Massachusetts because I have
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
the records but New York Won't Give Up
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
the ghost they won't give up the records
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
so when I talk about Massachusetts it's
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
not just that I live there it's not just
 
00:59:11.630 --> 00:59:11.640 align:start position:0%
that I have the data there because I'm
 
00:59:14.430 --> 00:59:14.440 align:start position:0%
also going to review some Minnesota data
 
00:59:16.109 --> 00:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
it's that Massachusetts New York and New
 
00:59:18.549 --> 00:59:18.559 align:start position:0%
Jersey fooled the world and I'll show
 
00:59:20.990 --> 00:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
you the fraud that they committed acute
 
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
fenal intoxication they tested dead
 
00:59:25.589 --> 00:59:25.599 align:start position:0%
bodies oh positive covid test it's a
 
00:59:27.549 --> 00:59:27.559 align:start position:0%
covid death blunt force trauma to the
 
00:59:30.390 --> 00:59:30.400 align:start position:0%
Head blunt force trauma to the Torso old
 
00:59:31.990 --> 00:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
ladies fallen down the stairs in the
 
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
Care Homes because nobody was there to
 
00:59:36.710 --> 00:59:36.720 align:start position:0%
care for them because oh
 
00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:39.280 align:start position:0%
co they called these deaths covid deaths
 
00:59:40.589 --> 00:59:40.599 align:start position:0%
they padded numbers if they're willing
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
to go so far and commit such fraud for
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
accidental deaths what do you think they
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
did for heart attacks for 95 year
 
00:59:50.630 --> 00:59:50.640 align:start position:0%
olds in the CDC memorandum I'll save
 
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:52.920 align:start position:0%
myself some time flipping to the page I
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
also have Vermont
 
00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:57.640 align:start position:0%
records a 98-year-old old she died from
 
00:59:59.950 --> 00:59:59.960 align:start position:0%
a heart attack who's going to say
 
01:00:02.190 --> 01:00:02.200 align:start position:0%
anything about
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
that but I matched her up with A's
 
01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
record of the only 98-year-old who died
 
01:00:08.710 --> 01:00:08.720 align:start position:0%
on the same
 
01:00:11.470 --> 01:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
day and she was injected two days before
 
01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
and what happened her heart rate went to
 
01:00:17.430 --> 01:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
145 beats per minute at 98 years old she
 
01:00:19.789 --> 01:00:19.799 align:start position:0%
was dead in two days it wasn't mentioned
 
01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
on her on her death record but I found
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
the data they killed her with the jab
 
01:00:26.510 --> 01:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
and then they hit it and refused to
 
01:00:29.829 --> 01:00:29.839 align:start position:0%
mention it this absolute evidence that
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
the vaccine killed this woman woman now
 
01:00:35.190 --> 01:00:35.200 align:start position:0%
yeah who's going to mourn oh 98 years
 
01:00:38.950 --> 01:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
old that's sad right she was a person
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
she didn't deserve to go by having her
 
01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:43.400 align:start position:0%
heart race for two days from and we know
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
that Tac cardia and disautonomia and
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
I'll show you some graphs about
 
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:49.960 align:start position:0%
disautonomia has occurred from these
 
01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
Jabs so clots in the
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
brain I mean the graph says it all you
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
27 again it doubles you twice the number
 
01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:07.599 align:start position:0%
of deaths and if you Jeffrey was from
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
Hudson New Hampshire he had a stroke in
 
01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:10.950 align:start position:0%
Hudson New Hampshire he had a stroke in
days

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:10.960 align:start position:0%
days
 
01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
claing oh cerebral beus sinus thrombosis
 
01:01:21.549 --> 01:01:21.559 align:start position:0%
cvst interventricular Hemorrhage he was
 
01:01:24.589 --> 01:01:24.599 align:start position:0%
hemorrhaging all over his
 
01:01:27.670 --> 01:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
body in
 
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
days uh Elaine was 61 she died she was
 
01:01:33.549 --> 01:01:33.559 align:start position:0%
from Rochester New Hampshire 61 years
 
01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
old died January 5th 2022 cerebral
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
herniation in hours multifocal cerebral
 
01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:41.720 align:start position:0%
infarcts aortic dissection in days
 
01:01:45.349 --> 01:01:45.359 align:start position:0%
aortic dissection and a cerebral
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
herniation the heart is not that close
 
01:01:50.829 --> 01:01:50.839 align:start position:0%
to the brain why is she having a hole
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
eaten through her the endothelial lining
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
of her aorta at the same time having a
 
01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:56.710 align:start position:0%
of her aorta at the same time having a
massive

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:56.720 align:start position:0%
massive
 
01:02:00.269 --> 01:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
stroke have one or two which you know it
 
01:02:02.190 --> 01:02:02.200 align:start position:0%
needs to be investigated because as I
 
01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
sit here I think about my mom my mom had
 
01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:07.960 align:start position:0%
a stroke uh and had had an abdominal
 
01:02:11.309 --> 01:02:11.319 align:start position:0%
aortic aneurysm but that was a year
 
01:02:11.319 --> 01:02:12.870 align:start position:0%
aortic aneurysm but that was a year
apart

01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
apart
 
01:02:15.829 --> 01:02:15.839 align:start position:0%
um this woman who died having multiple
 
01:02:18.390 --> 01:02:18.400 align:start position:0%
things going on needs to be investigated
 
01:02:22.109 --> 01:02:22.119 align:start position:0%
clots in lungs so these are pulmonary
 
01:02:25.150 --> 01:02:25.160 align:start position:0%
embolism it's very difficult to find in
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
the data
 
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
the uh neurological stroke and and other
 
01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:33.640 align:start position:0%
issues for intracranial intraspinal
 
01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
issues because the codes by the CDC the
 
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
G Codes are scattered across about 50
 
01:02:42.910 --> 01:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
codes but PR pulmonary embolism deaths
 
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
there's only two as big as your lungs
 
01:02:47.910 --> 01:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
are there's only two as big as your
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
brain is there 50 to give you an idea of
 
01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:54.760 align:start position:0%
how to trace data in in this regard um
 
01:02:56.589 --> 01:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
so the clots in the lungs right so
 
01:02:58.150 --> 01:02:58.160 align:start position:0%
that's ponary
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
rism take a look at
 
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
27 Lindsay was 27 years old from Newton
 
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire died August 4th
 
01:03:17.150 --> 01:03:17.160 align:start position:0%
2021 pulmonary thrombo
 
01:03:20.910 --> 01:03:20.920 align:start position:0%
emo and a DBT deep Bain
 
01:03:22.950 --> 01:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
thrombos they probably go together
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
because you get a clot in your leg and
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
your calf right and they call it
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
throwing a CL
 
01:03:29.029 --> 01:03:29.039 align:start position:0%
goes up to your lung and then you could
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
have ventricular failure and die Jeffrey
 
01:03:35.309 --> 01:03:35.319 align:start position:0%
was 30 I just listen to these
 
01:03:38.390 --> 01:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
ages 30 years
 
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
old died November 7 2021 in eping New
 
01:03:43.230 --> 01:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or he's from eping New
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cardiogenic shock massive
 
01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:48.069 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cardiogenic shock massive
pulmonary

01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:52.029 --> 01:03:52.039 align:start position:0%
embolism and I I told you about
 
01:03:55.349 --> 01:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
um a million people have been killed by
 
01:03:58.269 --> 01:03:58.279 align:start position:0%
uh drug and Hospital protocols so it's
 
01:03:59.670 --> 01:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
not just about the
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
vaccine I'll be speaking in Houston
 
01:04:04.589 --> 01:04:04.599 align:start position:0%
Texas at halt Hospital homicides too
 
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
it's the second one they're going to
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
1st it if you could just sit on some of
 
01:04:14.359 --> 01:04:15.630 align:start position:0%
1st it if you could just sit on some of
these

01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:04:17.829 --> 01:04:17.839 align:start position:0%
calls with people who've lost their
 
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
husbands their wives their
 
01:04:22.269 --> 01:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
children and to hear what the hospitals
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
did to these people all around the
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
country and I imagine imine that New
 
01:04:28.269 --> 01:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is probably no different red
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
state blue State this is not politics at
 
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
all this is centralization of
 
01:04:37.430 --> 01:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
authority that creates marginal losses
 
01:04:39.789 --> 01:04:39.799 align:start position:0%
as they push out you know you have a
 
01:04:41.789 --> 01:04:41.799 align:start position:0%
central point of failure when they push
 
01:04:43.589 --> 01:04:43.599 align:start position:0%
out what they want you to take the
 
01:04:45.789 --> 01:04:45.799 align:start position:0%
doctors just do it they don't want to
 
01:04:47.069 --> 01:04:47.079 align:start position:0%
lose their
 
01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
license and and I've you've got the
 
01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:53.440 align:start position:0%
evidence on that so 150,000 excess
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
sudden kidney failure deaths alone this
 
01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.430 align:start position:0%
sudden kidney failure deaths alone this
is

01:04:56.430 --> 01:04:56.440 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
excess so this is more than normal and
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
when you flip this over so I'll say
 
01:05:03.349 --> 01:05:03.359 align:start position:0%
there a million Americans have been
 
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:04.960 align:start position:0%
killed by both the vaccines and the
 
01:05:06.670 --> 01:05:06.680 align:start position:0%
hospital protocols I don't know which
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
one is more I I tend to think the
 
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
hospital protocols killed more
 
01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:15.559 align:start position:0%
people so let's look at New
 
01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um
 
01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
oops there it is all right let's take a
 
01:05:22.829 --> 01:05:22.839 align:start position:0%
look at New Hampshire residents who died
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts top left where it says
 
01:05:27.870 --> 01:05:27.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:30.829 --> 01:05:30.839 align:start position:0%
failure do you see a problem
 
01:05:36.190 --> 01:05:36.200 align:start position:0%
here 2021 2022 2023 is not here imagine
 
01:05:40.029 --> 01:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
where that is maybe it drops you know I
 
01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:42.240 align:start position:0%
don't know Joseph died he was uh 30
 
01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:45.079 align:start position:0%
years old from Franklin New
 
01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire died on December 28 2022
 
01:05:50.190 --> 01:05:50.200 align:start position:0%
multi-stem organ
 
01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
failure pneumonia flu stapac cacus orius
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
sudden kidney failure
 
01:05:59.950 --> 01:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
it it's not that you know everybody says
 
01:06:02.789 --> 01:06:02.799 align:start position:0%
remes takes out your kidneys it's remes
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
it's remes I don't know I'm not a doctor
 
01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
I'm not a
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
biologist I have six medical files of
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
deant that families have given me one is
 
01:06:14.349 --> 01:06:14.359 align:start position:0%
12,000 Pages the other's 6,000 one's
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
4,000 the hospitals are so nice that
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
when they give these to the families
 
01:06:21.549 --> 01:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
they're not searchable they give them
 
01:06:23.789 --> 01:06:23.799 align:start position:0%
images so I had to run it through a
 
01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:25.960 align:start position:0%
software program and Optical character
 
01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:30.160 align:start position:0%
recognition to build the words from the
 
01:06:33.190 --> 01:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
images and when that took an hour to run
 
01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
then I could search for REM Desir
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
baricitinib and vamy so I I don't know
 
01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
some people say it's barit nib some
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
people say it's from dvir I personally
 
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
think it's vamy in combination with one
 
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
of the other two I believe van vom is a
 
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
very very strong um antibiotic but
 
01:06:55.789 --> 01:06:55.799 align:start position:0%
here's the protocol it's given and the
 
01:06:59.230 --> 01:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
evidence in the CDC memorandum with
 
01:07:01.589 --> 01:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
individual cases I I'll read probably
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
one of them so we won't take too much
 
01:07:07.910 --> 01:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
time and you'll see and here here's the
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
protocol or a there are variations of
 
01:07:14.069 --> 01:07:14.079 align:start position:0%
it I'll just talk about Danielle now
 
01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
I'll do it from memory but it it's in
 
01:07:17.910 --> 01:07:17.920 align:start position:0%
the CDC
 
01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:21.240 align:start position:0%
memorandum 28-year old
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
woman her mother got nervous that she
 
01:07:26.349 --> 01:07:26.359 align:start position:0%
tested positive for Co at home home and
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
she had a neighbor uh used the little
 
01:07:31.109 --> 01:07:31.119 align:start position:0%
finger pulseox and the neighbor said oh
 
01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's only 87 you should bring her
 
01:07:35.029 --> 01:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
in right away so she brought her in she
 
01:07:39.269 --> 01:07:39.279 align:start position:0%
was 95% oxygen when she got there 95%
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
not a problem
 
01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
right because she had a positive covid
 
01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:45.160 align:start position:0%
test they started her on remes and
 
01:07:46.349 --> 01:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
started running that stuff through her
 
01:07:48.309 --> 01:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
veins immediately 200 milligrams first
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
day then you go 100 100 100 100 it's a
 
01:07:53.269 --> 01:07:53.279 align:start position:0%
5day course so you go 200 and then 100
 
01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:56.279 align:start position:0%
for four days
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
that wasn't enough money though to get a
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
CO diagnosis and R doe they had to get
 
01:08:01.950 --> 01:08:01.960 align:start position:0%
get around the
 
01:08:05.109 --> 01:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
ventilator so I I looked at the time uh
 
01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
and again you know I'm telling you these
 
01:08:09.630 --> 01:08:09.640 align:start position:0%
are thousands of pages and as I go
 
01:08:12.870 --> 01:08:12.880 align:start position:0%
through time there were hourly um vital
 
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
signs that were taken on her and then
 
01:08:16.630 --> 01:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
there was probably I don't know if it
 
01:08:19.709 --> 01:08:19.719 align:start position:0%
was daily blood check um but there were
 
01:08:22.030 --> 01:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
it was often they were checking her
 
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:24.920 align:start position:0%
blood so her liver enzymes were actually
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
fine um even through the rim does appear
 
01:08:29.149 --> 01:08:29.159 align:start position:0%
but her Vital
 
01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
Signs it was in the area of um 60 beats
 
01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
per minute heart rate um her breathing
 
01:08:38.269 --> 01:08:38.279 align:start position:0%
was about 15 breaths per minute this
 
01:08:40.669 --> 01:08:40.679 align:start position:0%
this is all normal right
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
97.8 or nine uh was her temperature did
 
01:08:46.709 --> 01:08:46.719 align:start position:0%
not have a temperature she didn't have a
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
breathing problem she didn't have a
 
01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
pulseox problem she didn't have a
 
01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
temperature problem she didn't have a
 
01:08:52.829 --> 01:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
heart rate
 
01:08:54.590 --> 01:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
problem when they put her on a
 
01:08:56.910 --> 01:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
ventilator at 95 5%
 
01:08:59.870 --> 01:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
oxygen and they killed her she didn't
 
01:09:02.749 --> 01:09:02.759 align:start position:0%
need it but they got their extra money
 
01:09:04.269 --> 01:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
because if you incentivize something
 
01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:06.199 align:start position:0%
you'll get more of it and they got this
 
01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:08.239 align:start position:0%
28-year-old why she was learning
 
01:09:10.829 --> 01:09:10.839 align:start position:0%
disabled she couldn't she couldn't
 
01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
defend herself and her mother was not
 
01:09:13.950 --> 01:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to see her at that
 
01:09:16.430 --> 01:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
point and so she developed the lung
 
01:09:18.550 --> 01:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
infection which happens when you get put
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
on um May I just interject to ask a
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
question absolutely representative thank
 
01:09:25.510 --> 01:09:25.520 align:start position:0%
you very much uh and thank you for for
 
01:09:27.870 --> 01:09:27.880 align:start position:0%
all of this um so when it comes to and
 
01:09:28.590 --> 01:09:28.600 align:start position:0%
I've heard you talk about the
 
01:09:30.749 --> 01:09:30.759 align:start position:0%
ventilators a few times now and I think
 
01:09:32.189 --> 01:09:32.199 align:start position:0%
that's a very important thing for us to
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
look at I've heard and I don't recall
 
01:09:37.709 --> 01:09:37.719 align:start position:0%
exactly where where I've heard it um so
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if you have any
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
information regarding this that the uh
 
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:44.440 align:start position:0%
protocols for early extremely aggressive
 
01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
ventilator use um may have originated
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
with the World Health Organization and
 
01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:50.239 align:start position:0%
been pushed down from there is that
 
01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:51.759 align:start position:0%
something that you've heard have any
 
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
awareness of or have any evidence for I
 
01:09:55.990 --> 01:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
I don't want to answer something I don't
 
01:09:57.709 --> 01:09:57.719 align:start position:0%
know fair enough but I know if you go to
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
the NIH and that's where I believe you
 
01:10:02.310 --> 01:10:02.320 align:start position:0%
should start your investigation uh not
 
01:10:05.350 --> 01:10:05.360 align:start position:0%
the CDC necessarily but the NIH and how
 
01:10:06.990 --> 01:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
to treat this I think that's where it
 
01:10:09.430 --> 01:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
originated if if not the
 
01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
who all right thank you um so yeah she
 
01:10:17.790 --> 01:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
uh she got put on um the ventilator
 
01:10:19.510 --> 01:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
developed the lung infection they
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't stop it she went septic they
 
01:10:24.189 --> 01:10:24.199 align:start position:0%
tried bomy of course and her kidneys
 
01:10:26.870 --> 01:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
failed and the gentleman from New
 
01:10:28.030 --> 01:10:28.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I just mentioned with the
 
01:10:30.110 --> 01:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
multi-organ failure I mean everything
 
01:10:32.310 --> 01:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
goes wrong in the body they're they're
 
01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
pumping them so full of the drugs and
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
here are the drugs they they kind of get
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
you ready for going on a ventilator mzm
 
01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
lorazapam fentanyl propal
 
01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
dexamine all of them I'm not saying one
 
01:10:46.189 --> 01:10:46.199 align:start position:0%
or the other they're hitting you with
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
the anti-anxiety they're hitting you
 
01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
with the uh the painkiller they're
 
01:10:50.590 --> 01:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
hitting you with
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
everything and they they
 
01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
basically kill people
 
01:10:59.110 --> 01:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
I don't mean to interrupt um and I know
 
01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:01.880 align:start position:0%
you're not a medical
 
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
doctor but I'm just trying to wrap my
 
01:11:07.709 --> 01:11:07.719 align:start position:0%
head around the
 
01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
fact that if when you're speaking
 
01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
about the one person where they come in
 
01:11:17.950 --> 01:11:17.960 align:start position:0%
and their oxygen rate really isn't that
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
low they don't have a fever they don't
 
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.270 align:start position:0%
low they don't have a fever they don't
have

01:11:20.270 --> 01:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
anything and then they put them you're
 
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:24.800 align:start position:0%
saying the protocol is to put them on
 
01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:27.400 align:start position:0%
like five or
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
more drugs for lack of a better
 
01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:35.400 align:start position:0%
word that that is the protocol for
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
basically anyone that they're prepping
 
01:11:39.669 --> 01:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
ventilator yeah and and yeah you can't
 
01:11:44.070 --> 01:11:44.080 align:start position:0%
put somebody on a ventilator unless you
 
01:11:47.950 --> 01:11:47.960 align:start position:0%
get them all calm and you know
 
01:11:50.110 --> 01:11:50.120 align:start position:0%
get you're gonna you're going to have to
 
01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
ask a doctor about this because the
 
01:11:54.709 --> 01:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
doctors have a lot to answer for they're
 
01:11:57.030 --> 01:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
doing what they're told but I did what I
 
01:11:59.310 --> 01:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
was told is not a defense for
 
01:12:01.390 --> 01:12:01.400 align:start position:0%
murder I appreciate that representative
 
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:03.040 align:start position:0%
Bel did you have something thank you yes
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to provide a little bit of
 
01:12:05.950 --> 01:12:05.960 align:start position:0%
information because I have a healthcare
 
01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
background I was a paramedic for quite
 
01:12:10.669 --> 01:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
some time um when it comes to
 
01:12:14.189 --> 01:12:14.199 align:start position:0%
historically ventilating patients um I
 
01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:17.440 align:start position:0%
will say it's not necessarily uncommon
 
01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
to ventilate before hypoxia sets in
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
because once hypoxia sets in uh through
 
01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:27.520 align:start position:0%
low blood oxygen um it can uh quickly go
 
01:12:29.189 --> 01:12:29.199 align:start position:0%
very quickly go south from there so
 
01:12:30.870 --> 01:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
typically what people look at or what
 
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
they historically would look at is uh
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
work of breathing indicators suggesting
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
muscle fatigue that suggests breathing
 
01:12:43.590 --> 01:12:43.600 align:start position:0%
is failing um in order to uh to
 
01:12:45.910 --> 01:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
ventilate um I think the big thing we
 
01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
want to look at here given some of this
 
01:12:49.590 --> 01:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
testimony we've heard is we want to
 
01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:53.679 align:start position:0%
verify whether there was a deviation
 
01:12:55.669 --> 01:12:55.679 align:start position:0%
from looking at these tradition
 
01:12:58.350 --> 01:12:58.360 align:start position:0%
metrics such as work of breathing in
 
01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
especially in order to do anything akin
 
01:13:06.510 --> 01:13:06.520 align:start position:0%
to um to control of the uh of the of the
 
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
spread of the pathogen because that
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
would be a very interesting finding if
 
01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
these people are truly overriding
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
traditional metrics for ventilation in
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:22.679 align:start position:0%
containment thank you for that please
 
01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
what he said I agree with everything it
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
needs to be investigated and that's the
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
point is not whether REM Desir vanam
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
Baris sanib and other Protocols are
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
killing people's kidneys the point is
 
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
the criminal omission of conduct to
 
01:13:44.350 --> 01:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
investigate by the CDC by the FDA by the
 
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
NIH all three directors of those
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
organizations and 13 of their Deputy
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
directors received a copy of this
 
01:13:54.229 --> 01:13:54.239 align:start position:0%
certified mail they were served not this
 
01:13:57.870 --> 01:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
bound one but a loose one with um this
 
01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:00.320 align:start position:0%
one has about five or six names changed
 
01:14:01.709 --> 01:14:01.719 align:start position:0%
in Minnesota because they didn't want
 
01:14:03.870 --> 01:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
their names in it so I said okay p and
 
01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:05.480 align:start position:0%
their names are not in but all the other
 
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
names in here are correct so they
 
01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
received this and once they've been
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
notified they can't unknow they have a
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
legal duty to act okay you you and I
 
01:14:16.070 --> 01:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
don't have that Duty well you sort of
 
01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
have that Duty you you're you're members
 
01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
of the general court you're officers of
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
the court of New Hampshire so you do
 
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
have the legal duty to investigate this
 
01:14:27.070 --> 01:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
is and that that is what you're doing
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
but at the CDC they refuse to
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
investigate what's killed 150,000 excess
 
01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
people by a single cause of death that's
 
01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:37.040 align:start position:0%
the worst thing since
 
01:14:39.110 --> 01:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
1918 and it doesn't matter what you
 
01:14:40.709 --> 01:14:40.719 align:start position:0%
believe about the Spanish Flu whether it
 
01:14:42.550 --> 01:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
was the virus or secondary bacterial
 
01:14:43.950 --> 01:14:43.960 align:start position:0%
infection that killed
 
01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
people you just got to know that there
 
01:14:48.390 --> 01:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
were a lot of extra people who died and
 
01:14:50.270 --> 01:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
it Bears investigating and we have the
 
01:14:52.510 --> 01:14:52.520 align:start position:0%
ability to investigate all the
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
information is in CDC and and state
 
01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
databases they refuse to investigate if
 
01:15:02.709 --> 01:15:02.719 align:start position:0%
I had access to the information within a
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
week I can tell you and I'm not even a
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
doctor because I'll just go through and
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
find the common thread of all the people
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
that died from acute Rena failure how
 
01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
many got remir how many got bankam how
 
01:15:19.229 --> 01:15:19.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
ciip so the omission of conduct of
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
Investigation is the
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
crime they're they're killing people and
 
01:15:29.669 --> 01:15:29.679 align:start position:0%
and they don't want to know in fact
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
they'll kill your kids and go out for
 
01:15:33.149 --> 01:15:33.159 align:start position:0%
sushi that day and laugh about it sorry
 
01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
I had to throw that
 
01:15:37.110 --> 01:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
in all right so you'll notice that the
 
01:15:38.430 --> 01:15:38.440 align:start position:0%
pattern of New Hampshire deaths from
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
Sudden kidney failure in the top left
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
which is a 100%
 
01:15:46.750 --> 01:15:46.760 align:start position:0%
increase and that's 2728 people in 2022
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
alone and that's just New Hampshire
 
01:15:50.550 --> 01:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
residents in Massachusetts hospitals or
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
in MA or in the state of
 
01:15:54.629 --> 01:15:54.639 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts imagine how many hundreds
 
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
in New
 
01:15:58.990 --> 01:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hundreds of excess acute renal
 
01:16:00.550 --> 01:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
failure deaths in New
 
01:16:03.669 --> 01:16:03.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're killing your citizens
 
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:10.709 --> 01:16:10.719 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts you'll see 2,000 excess
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
2,000 EXs people in Massachusetts alone
 
01:16:17.430 --> 01:16:17.440 align:start position:0%
in the top right in the bottom
 
01:16:20.830 --> 01:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
left 1600 excess
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
Minnesota 1,600 EXs Minnesota this does
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
not include 2023 if I include 2023 I'll
 
01:16:30.470 --> 01:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
say more than 3,000 excess renal failure
 
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
deaths in Massachusetts alone so when I
 
01:16:35.910 --> 01:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
say 150,000 across the United States I
 
01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:36.629 align:start position:0%
say 150,000 across the United States I
mean

01:16:36.629 --> 01:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:16:38.950 --> 01:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
it and in the bottom right I'm not at
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
Liberty to say yet but does the graph
 
01:16:43.830 --> 01:16:43.840 align:start position:0%
look familiar to you it's the same as
 
01:16:47.229 --> 01:16:47.239 align:start position:0%
all the others this is an insane amount
 
01:16:50.030 --> 01:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
of excess deaths by acute reenal failure
 
01:16:52.189 --> 01:16:52.199 align:start position:0%
these are not happening at home these
 
01:16:57.149 --> 01:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
there's work in progress that I can't
 
01:17:03.030 --> 01:17:03.040 align:start position:0%
really talk about and um within a couple
 
01:17:05.189 --> 01:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
months you guys keep doing your work to
 
01:17:06.870 --> 01:17:06.880 align:start position:0%
investigate and you'll have a lot more
 
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
information to rely upon in a couple
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
months from multiple entities
 
01:17:26.629 --> 01:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:30.870 --> 01:17:30.880 align:start position:0%
so I testified for Bill hb1
 
01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
1661 and after I testified for that bill
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
and I answered all questions um there
 
01:17:39.149 --> 01:17:39.159 align:start position:0%
there there was only one question that
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
kind of threw me it was the second time
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
that same person
 
01:17:47.229 --> 01:17:47.239 align:start position:0%
asked uh Bill H hb1 1661 real quickly it
 
01:17:50.830 --> 01:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
it's more than just trying to get the
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
vaccines put on death certificates for
 
01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
anybody who died within two years of a
 
01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine that's part one right there's
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
four sections the second section compels
 
01:18:01.350 --> 01:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
quarterly reports from the state of New
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to the people saying how many
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
people died within one day three days
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
one week three weeks 10 weeks 25 weeks
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
and one year of vaccin of of any type of
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
immunization but the the the third and
 
01:18:14.830 --> 01:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
fourth are the most important the third
 
01:18:17.550 --> 01:18:17.560 align:start position:0%
compels the state to do an investigation
 
01:18:19.950 --> 01:18:19.960 align:start position:0%
much like I've done and I'm one
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
man I'm just one guy with and and if
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
you've you've seen my work some of it
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
this only a piece of it then you'll know
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
that it's the most
 
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh Public Health
 
01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
analysis ever
 
01:18:37.149 --> 01:18:37.159 align:start position:0%
anywhere I can tell you every cause of
 
01:18:39.790 --> 01:18:39.800 align:start position:0%
death um I can't tell you definitively
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
what happened because many of the causes
 
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
of death rely upon the custom and
 
01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
practice of the local medical examiner's
 
01:18:49.070 --> 01:18:49.080 align:start position:0%
office so you'll find different patterns
 
01:18:50.990 --> 01:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
in Minnesota than you will in
 
01:18:53.070 --> 01:18:53.080 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because they were taught
 
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:54.440 align:start position:0%
how to fill out death certificats
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
differently write different words and
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
when those words go to the CDC they get
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
run through transacts and acne software
 
01:19:02.189 --> 01:19:02.199 align:start position:0%
and the words are that I I started to
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
tell you before part one and part two
 
01:19:05.510 --> 01:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
right so New Hampshire fills out the
 
01:19:08.629 --> 01:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
words they go to the CDC again a single
 
01:19:09.950 --> 01:19:09.960 align:start position:0%
point of failure they get run through
 
01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:10.830 align:start position:0%
point of failure they get run through
the

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
software and that applies codes and that
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
is the only way we as Citizens know
 
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
what's happening is to track the codes
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
because you can't read all the different
 
01:19:21.910 --> 01:19:21.920 align:start position:0%
words that all the crazy doctors write
 
01:19:23.870 --> 01:19:23.880 align:start position:0%
on death certificates the medical
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
examiners are pretty consistent because
 
01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
they do about 400 per year of uh death
 
01:19:31.990 --> 01:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
records um but a regular doctor you know
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
it depends if there's a doctor in a care
 
01:19:36.110 --> 01:19:36.120 align:start position:0%
home he might do you know 20 or 30 a
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
year um but a regular doctor a family
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
practitioner probably only does one or
 
01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
two every couple years right how many
 
01:19:45.390 --> 01:19:45.400 align:start position:0%
people die in the office of a of a
 
01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:48.400 align:start position:0%
doctor so when they do one they don't do
 
01:19:51.430 --> 01:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
a good job but um the software is
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
supposed to pick out the words and then
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
apply the codes
 
01:19:57.110 --> 01:19:57.120 align:start position:0%
if they're using different words and
 
01:19:59.270 --> 01:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'll give you an example in Minnesota
 
01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:01.199 align:start position:0%
then Massachusetts then New Hampshire
 
01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
right so here's Minnesota c41 bone and
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
articular cartilage cancer is way up in
 
01:20:09.350 --> 01:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts bone and bone marrow
 
01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
cancer is way up well that's c41 and
 
01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:12.830 align:start position:0%
cancer is way up well that's c41 and
that's

01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
c79 they're completely different but if
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
if they if it manifests the same in the
 
01:20:19.830 --> 01:20:19.840 align:start position:0%
human body and it's the same
 
01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:23.400 align:start position:0%
disease for bone maybe bone marrow but
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
they just write a different word saroma
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
or whatever it gets picked up
 
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
differently by the transacts and Acme
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
software and coded differently so now we
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
think we're getting good information so
 
01:20:37.189 --> 01:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
the Integrity of the data relies upon
 
01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
custom and practice of human behavior in
 
01:20:40.870 --> 01:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
every office and therefore you should
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
not look at the entire United States you
 
01:20:44.189 --> 01:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
should look regionally to see what has
 
01:20:46.870 --> 01:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
happened uh because of like I explained
 
01:20:48.550 --> 01:20:48.560 align:start position:0%
earlier ketris
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
parabo all
 
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
right I I want to read the uh response I
 
01:20:58.430 --> 01:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
sent to the house members after my
 
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
testimony and after the um HHS DHHS
 
01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.350 align:start position:0%
testimony and after the um HHS DHHS
people

01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:21:05.510 --> 01:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
testified um please stop and ask
 
01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:06.629 align:start position:0%
testified um please stop and ask
questions

01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
anytime um all right I'll try to go
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
quickly so after testif testifying I
 
01:21:19.110 --> 01:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
fielded questions from house members um
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
I I didn't know somebody told me the
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
parties were on different sides I I
 
01:21:24.189 --> 01:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
don't know how you guys sit I didn't
 
01:21:25.709 --> 01:21:25.719 align:start position:0%
know who I was talking to but I can say
 
01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
that it seemed very fair there were
 
01:21:31.149 --> 01:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
questions from both sides and um I found
 
01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
out later that you know I I had
 
01:21:35.790 --> 01:21:35.800 align:start position:0%
challenging questions from from both
 
01:21:38.189 --> 01:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
sides you know and I answered all of
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
them um but I I found it to be a good
 
01:21:45.390 --> 01:21:45.400 align:start position:0%
experience for hb1 1661 not the prior
 
01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
testimony at the Senate hearing that was
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
not a good experience where people just
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even pay attention to 11 and
 
01:21:54.110 --> 01:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
seven and and 12 year olds dying from
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
the VAC seen and they just typing away
 
01:21:59.189 --> 01:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
and talking to each other but let me
 
01:22:01.870 --> 01:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
um so again it seems to have gone well
 
01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
let me uh read some of the letter that I
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
had sent um email I should say that I
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
had sent to some of the house members
 
01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
after so thank you for hosting me for a
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
short description of hb1 1661 with great
 
01:22:16.270 --> 01:22:16.280 align:start position:0%
regret I'm compelled to provide you
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
information regarding the DHHS Bureau
 
01:22:20.709 --> 01:22:20.719 align:start position:0%
Chief's testimony that followed mine I
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
will wait a few days before I publish
 
01:22:25.229 --> 01:22:25.239 align:start position:0%
this commentary know
 
01:22:27.149 --> 01:22:27.159 align:start position:0%
my hearing is not good and I couldn't
 
01:22:29.390 --> 01:22:29.400 align:start position:0%
hear the names of the bureau Chiefs one
 
01:22:31.629 --> 01:22:31.639 align:start position:0%
was a man one was a woman I'll have to
 
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
go with these as identifiers here and a
 
01:22:36.189 --> 01:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
House member asked the Bureau of chiefs
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
if DH now this this is all in video so
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
you could say oh it's hearsay but you
 
01:22:45.470 --> 01:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
can go listen to the video it's there a
 
01:22:48.990 --> 01:22:49.000 align:start position:0%
House member asked uh the bureau Chiefs
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
if DHHS is alarmed about sudden deaths
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the gentleman bureau
 
01:22:54.239 --> 01:22:54.950 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire the gentleman bureau
chief

01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:54.960 align:start position:0%
chief
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
answer was mere and only included
 
01:23:00.270 --> 01:23:00.280 align:start position:0%
looking at death records database the
 
01:23:01.629 --> 01:23:01.639 align:start position:0%
gentleman also mentioned that if there
 
01:23:03.510 --> 01:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
was a covid vaccine caused injury it
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
would be reported through the US hhs's
 
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine adverse event reporting
 
01:23:11.229 --> 01:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
system that answer should frighten all
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
of you if somebody dies go go talk to
 
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
Bears you know we're not going to
 
01:23:18.629 --> 01:23:18.639 align:start position:0%
investigate in New Hampshire that's
 
01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:19.800 align:start position:0%
that's not what the public health in New
 
01:23:23.070 --> 01:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does really that that's pretty
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
frightening so when asked further by a
 
01:23:28.189 --> 01:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
House member if DHHS was alarmed at the
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
amount and ages of sudden deaths
 
01:23:32.790 --> 01:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
including a 27-year-old and teenagers
 
01:23:35.030 --> 01:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
and if DHHS was doing anything like
 
01:23:36.669 --> 01:23:36.679 align:start position:0%
forming a committee to look at what is
 
01:23:38.990 --> 01:23:39.000 align:start position:0%
happening the woman bureau chief
 
01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
answered she stated that her office
 
01:23:43.110 --> 01:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
focuses on certain indicators and that
 
01:23:45.110 --> 01:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
she had her staff look into the most
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
current death record data to see if
 
01:23:50.310 --> 01:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
there are any vaccine caused adverse
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
effects listing icd10 code u129
 
01:23:57.149 --> 01:23:57.159 align:start position:0%
and I explained icd10 codes before right
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
so what is uh e129 I'll tell you in a
 
01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:00.430 align:start position:0%
so what is uh e129 I'll tell you in a
minute

01:24:00.430 --> 01:24:00.440 align:start position:0%
minute
 
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
but the codes are managed by the
 
01:24:07.270 --> 01:24:07.280 align:start position:0%
wh a subset of them is used by the CDC
 
01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:11.350 align:start position:0%
wh a subset of them is used by the CDC
remember

01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
that so not not all icd10 codes are
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
adopted by the CDC it seems that the
 
01:24:18.110 --> 01:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
individual US states only apply codes
 
01:24:20.910 --> 01:24:20.920 align:start position:0%
approved for use by the CDC in fact most
 
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
if not all states send death records to
 
01:24:25.709 --> 01:24:25.719 align:start position:0%
the CDC without the cd10 codes the CDC
 
01:24:28.510 --> 01:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
then runs the pros the words of the
 
01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:29.669 align:start position:0%
then runs the pros the words of the
death

01:24:29.669 --> 01:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
death
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
certificates Parts one and two through
 
01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
the transaction AC me software these
 
01:24:36.590 --> 01:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
software programs apply the codes the
 
01:24:38.470 --> 01:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
death records are then returned with
 
01:24:40.790 --> 01:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
codes to the respective
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
States if all that the wom bureau chief
 
01:24:46.550 --> 01:24:46.560 align:start position:0%
has ever done to monitor potential
 
01:24:48.550 --> 01:24:48.560 align:start position:0%
vaccine death is to look for
 
01:24:52.109 --> 01:24:52.119 align:start position:0%
u129 then she will not find any and in
 
01:24:53.870 --> 01:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
the hearing she stated that she did not
 
01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
find any
 
01:24:58.830 --> 01:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
neither is u129 F9 found in nearly 1
 
01:25:01.990 --> 01:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
million and I can now say 1.4 million
 
01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
death records that I have from Minnesota
 
01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and another
 
01:25:08.790 --> 01:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
state why the CDC seems not to have
 
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
adopted this code from The Who a search
 
01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
of cdc's website shows no mention of
 
01:25:16.550 --> 01:25:16.560 align:start position:0%
u129 however a full web search shows
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
that Germany and the United Kingdom have
 
01:25:20.550 --> 01:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
adopted it in the context which follows
 
01:25:23.149 --> 01:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
there's a stunning notation on the who's
 
01:25:24.669 --> 01:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
document which has no official markings
 
01:25:28.109 --> 01:25:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:31.270 --> 01:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
website the notation for u12 prefix is
 
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
as follows
 
01:25:35.629 --> 01:25:35.639 align:start position:0%
u129 now here's what it means covid-19
 
01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
vaccines causing adverse effects and
 
01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
therapeutic use unspecified note this
 
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
code is to be used as an external cause
 
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
code it s as a subcategory under
 
01:25:51.470 --> 01:25:51.480 align:start position:0%
y59 remember that it's to be used under
 
01:25:54.270 --> 01:25:54.280 align:start position:0%
y59 other and unspecified vaccines by
 
01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.149 align:start position:0%
y59 other and unspecified vaccines by
iCal

01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
iCal
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
substances in addition to this a code
 
01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
from another chapter of the
 
01:26:01.990 --> 01:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
classification could be used indicating
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
the nature of the adverse effect correct
 
01:26:05.790 --> 01:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
administration of covid-19 vaccine and
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
prophylactic therapeutic use as the
 
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
cause of any adverse effect okay on the
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
website of the office of national
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
statistics of the United Kingdom is a
 
01:26:17.550 --> 01:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
very similar notation I won't read it to
 
01:26:20.910 --> 01:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
you it's it's the same wording as who
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
they're saying that yeah there's u129
 
01:26:26.910 --> 01:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
but it's a subcategory of y59 and we're
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
not really using one 12.9 and now you
 
01:26:31.030 --> 01:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
know that the CDC has no record of even
 
01:26:33.950 --> 01:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
using it and you're DHHS the one who's
 
01:26:36.070 --> 01:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
head of all the data that's the only
 
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
thing she looked for and it's not even
 
01:26:41.750 --> 01:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
in use in the United States and then
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
they're not looking at vaccine deaths in
 
01:26:45.270 --> 01:26:45.280 align:start position:0%
any other
 
01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:48.639 align:start position:0%
way that is Extreme call it dereliction
 
01:26:50.189 --> 01:26:50.199 align:start position:0%
of Duty but it's omission of conduct
 
01:26:51.750 --> 01:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
where they have a legal duty to act and
 
01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.149 --> 01:26:59.159 align:start position:0%
now comes the difficult part to tell you
 
01:27:00.910 --> 01:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
it's to be used as a subcategory under
 
01:27:03.149 --> 01:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
y59 not not only is there no mention of
 
01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
u129 on the CDC website and no use of it
 
01:27:09.109 --> 01:27:09.119 align:start position:0%
on nearly well I'll say 1.4 million
 
01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
death certificates but even the UK and
 
01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
who state that it's a subcategory
 
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
y59 y59 was used on both Massachusetts
 
01:27:21.550 --> 01:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
and Minnesota and now I can tell you the
 
01:27:23.430 --> 01:27:23.440 align:start position:0%
third state I've found it in there in
 
01:27:25.470 --> 01:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
the database
 
01:27:29.109 --> 01:27:29.119 align:start position:0%
y59 is used in three other states two of
 
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
them very local to
 
01:27:37.629 --> 01:27:37.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:39.629 --> 01:27:39.639 align:start position:0%
vaccines it appears the New Hampshire
 
01:27:42.990 --> 01:27:43.000 align:start position:0%
Bureau Chiefs health and statistics and
 
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
informatics bureau chief for health
 
01:27:47.550 --> 01:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
statistics and informatics has not
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
looked for the right information in the
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
death record database this is basic
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
information I've known for years now she
 
01:27:55.950 --> 01:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
should have searched for Wi-Fi
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
but that's not the only one there are
 
01:27:59.790 --> 01:27:59.800 align:start position:0%
plenty of other codes that transacts and
 
01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
acne software may put out for vaccine
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
cause death
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
t881 also used in Massachusetts and
 
01:28:08.870 --> 01:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
Minnesota death records means other
 
01:28:10.590 --> 01:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
complications following immunization not
 
01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:11.629 align:start position:0%
complications following immunization not
elsewhere

01:28:11.629 --> 01:28:11.639 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
01:28:14.229 --> 01:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
classified in Minnesota was also found a
 
01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
t509 which means other and unspecified
 
01:28:19.590 --> 01:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
drugs medicaments and biological
 
01:28:21.550 --> 01:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
substances so depending on how it's
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
written vaccine or vaccination on the
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
death certificate
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
you'll find that it gets coded
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
differently can I just check time how
 
01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
much I'm good okay the house members
 
01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
should also know that specific and
 
01:28:37.750 --> 01:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
credible evidence shows that the CDC
 
01:28:39.550 --> 01:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
committed several acts of felony fraud
 
01:28:41.229 --> 01:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
against the People by hiding vaccine
 
01:28:41.239 --> 01:28:46.750 align:start position:0%
against the People by hiding vaccine
caused

01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
deaths I'm going to
 
01:28:52.109 --> 01:28:52.119 align:start position:0%
uh I'm just going to skip right to the
 
01:28:55.990 --> 01:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
the memorandum now so just open it up
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
and there are paragraph numbers
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:12.480 --> 01:29:14.229 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um on page
 
01:29:21.070 --> 01:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
58 before paragraph 49 CDC response to
 
01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.590 align:start position:0%

all right I shouldn't have said that out
 
01:29:31.709 --> 01:29:31.719 align:start position:0%
public everybody knows my birthday now
 
01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:35.080 align:start position:0%

everything's published herzberg's thesis
 
01:29:55.470 --> 01:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
in the article is an accusation by

Herzberg of fraud committed by the CDC
 
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:00.760 align:start position:0%
in the omission of icd10 codes Y 59.0
 
01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:03.320 align:start position:0%

basically cdc's public

covid vaccine death icd10 codes withheld
 
01:30:54.510 --> 01:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
question mark the body of the email
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
States hello this is Greg Piper at just
 
01:30:58.830 --> 01:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
the news in DC I wanted to get the
 
01:31:01.470 --> 01:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
agency's response to this reported
 
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
discovery about your categorization of

Kristen nordland of CDC public affairs
 
01:31:14.590 --> 01:31:14.600 align:start position:0%
replied to Greg Piper of just the
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
news the response email from nordland is
 
01:31:19.390 --> 01:31:19.400 align:start position:0%
an unintelligible word salad seemingly
 
01:31:21.830 --> 01:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
debating the difference between the word
 
01:31:23.669 --> 01:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
vaccine and the word vaccination the
 
01:31:25.229 --> 01:31:25.239 align:start position:0%
email appears to be an attempt to
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
misinform disinform and outright
 
01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:29.560 align:start position:0%
prevaricate expressing that there is no
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
unusual pattern of illness or death
 
01:31:33.350 --> 01:31:33.360 align:start position:0%
resulting from Co
 
01:31:35.310 --> 01:31:35.320 align:start position:0%
immunizations here is the email from
 
01:31:38.470 --> 01:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
Kristen nordland to Greg Piper hi Greg
 
01:31:40.830 --> 01:31:40.840 align:start position:0%
thanks for reaching out to CDC the claim
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
in the post is incorrect the icd10 codes
 
01:31:45.550 --> 01:31:45.560 align:start position:0%
in question pertain to adverse effects
 
01:31:48.510 --> 01:31:48.520 align:start position:0%
of vaccines not vaccination vaccination
 
01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
is not a disease or cause of death so
 
01:31:52.390 --> 01:31:52.400 align:start position:0%
simple mention of the vaccine or
 
01:31:54.109 --> 01:31:54.119 align:start position:0%
vaccination without mention of ad
 
01:31:56.590 --> 01:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
effects will not get coded does that
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
make sense to anybody
 
01:32:01.430 --> 01:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
here does it when when I said it's an
 
01:32:03.390 --> 01:32:03.400 align:start position:0%
unintelligible word salad was I
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
exaggerating I mean that's rhetorical
 
01:32:08.350 --> 01:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
you don't have to answer um the examples
 
01:32:10.550 --> 01:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
in this now here I go on this is what
 
01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:12.520 align:start position:0%
she wrote the examples in this article
 
01:32:14.350 --> 01:32:14.360 align:start position:0%
for which adverse effects codes are
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
included are those that mention adverse
 
01:32:19.790 --> 01:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
or side effects of vaccine the examples
 
01:32:22.350 --> 01:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
for which the codes are not included do
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
not contain such language
 
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines are undergoing the
 
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
most intense safety monitoring in US
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
history so intense that they don't look

at death certificates that actually say
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine as a cause of death to date CDC
 
01:32:40.830 --> 01:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
has not detected any unusual or
 
01:32:42.790 --> 01:32:42.800 align:start position:0%
unexpected patterns for deaths following
 
01:32:44.510 --> 01:32:44.520 align:start position:0%

01:32:45.830 --> 01:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
covid vaccines are causing or

familiar with the term limited
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
hangout you should probably look that up
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
there's a very quick definition of it
 
01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
very easy where they admit to a small
 
01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
piece so people will go away and not
 
01:33:08.350 --> 01:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
investigate further for the whole
 
01:33:10.990 --> 01:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
truth and she goes on when an adverse
 
01:33:13.109 --> 01:33:13.119 align:start position:0%

is done by certifying by the certifying

official who completes the death

01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
the autopsy thanks Kristen
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
if you go to paragraph
 
01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:03.149 --> 01:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
page you could probably find it faster
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
than me let's
 
01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:13.709 --> 01:34:13.719 align:start position:0%
22 I will skim through this so we're
 
01:34:18.030 --> 01:34:18.040 align:start position:0%
gonna have to go faster um on January 16
 
01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
2021 Solomon kizo died he was 60 years
 
01:34:23.709 --> 01:34:23.719 align:start position:0%

vaccination vaccination not vaccine it
 
01:34:33.390 --> 01:34:33.400 align:start position:0%
does not say side effect of it does not
 
01:34:36.390 --> 01:34:36.400 align:start position:0%
say adverse effect of if you look at the
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
codes the CDC assigned transacts acne
 
01:34:44.350 --> 01:34:44.360 align:start position:0%
code to be Y 59.0 which means viral
 
01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:47.600 align:start position:0%
vaccines in other words and this is
 
01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Kristen nordin's excuse to
 
01:34:54.030 --> 01:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
Greg Piper was tailored to the three
 
01:34:56.669 --> 01:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
Minnesota death certificates that have y
 
01:34:59.310 --> 01:34:59.320 align:start position:0%
59.0 one says side effect of the other
 
01:35:01.750 --> 01:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
says adverse effect of and they do not
 
01:35:03.750 --> 01:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
say vaccination they say
 
01:35:06.709 --> 01:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
vaccine by tailoring her excuse to the
 
01:35:06.719 --> 01:35:07.870 align:start position:0%
vaccine by tailoring her excuse to the
three

01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
records that have it written and the
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
other records that say vaccine
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
vaccination weren't coded so in in
 
01:35:16.950 --> 01:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
Minnesota three were coded and the other
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
six that followed were not in
 
01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Solomon kizo right here
 
01:35:25.629 --> 01:35:25.639 align:start position:0%
this official government record proves
 
01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:27.440 align:start position:0%
that she lied to Greg Piper and
 
01:35:30.270 --> 01:35:30.280 align:start position:0%
committed further felony fraud in
 
01:35:32.910 --> 01:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
writing expressly written in her
 
01:35:36.189 --> 01:35:36.199 align:start position:0%
email it also shows that the CDC is not
 
01:35:38.109 --> 01:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
going to change their ways and is not
 
01:35:40.149 --> 01:35:40.159 align:start position:0%
going to protect the public nor are they
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
going to investigate the further eight
 
01:35:46.030 --> 01:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
other Massachusetts records that say
 
01:35:47.910 --> 01:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine and vaccination all documented
 
01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
in the CDC memorandum right here Solomon
 
01:35:55.910 --> 01:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
kizo after January 16 the WiFi 9
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
disappears it's not used again in
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and after the three in
 
01:36:03.910 --> 01:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
Minnesota for the next six it is not
 
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
used this is an automatic software
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
program that applies codes yes they do
 
01:36:12.070 --> 01:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
manual intervention sometimes but the if
 
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
they manually intervene to add y59 why
 
01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:16.480 align:start position:0%
didn't they do it for the others why did
 
01:36:18.470 --> 01:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
they stop doing it to hide vaccine
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
caused deaths from the American
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
people and I can tell you that in the
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
third state I found the same thing y59
 
01:36:25.639 --> 01:36:26.669 align:start position:0%
third state I found the same thing y59
is

01:36:26.669 --> 01:36:26.679 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:36:30.189 --> 01:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
coded the next three or not one was
 
01:36:32.950 --> 01:36:32.960 align:start position:0%
coded the next three or not they did the
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
same thing logic will tell you that
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
either they're deleting y59 after
 
01:36:41.310 --> 01:36:41.320 align:start position:0%
transacts and act me codes for it or
 
01:36:43.270 --> 01:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
they're Manu they manually stopped
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:50.750 --> 01:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
intentional action against the people to
 
01:36:52.629 --> 01:36:52.639 align:start position:0%
hide vaccine cause deaths from the
 
01:36:54.590 --> 01:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
people even the medical examiners and
 
01:36:57.149 --> 01:36:57.159 align:start position:0%
doctors wrote vaccine and vaccination on
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
the death certificate they wanted us to
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
know and I can go to let let's take a
 
01:37:05.950 --> 01:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
look at who happened first Brianna um we
 
01:37:07.709 --> 01:37:07.719 align:start position:0%
can go to
 
01:37:12.109 --> 01:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.119 --> 01:37:14.709 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:17.990 --> 01:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
page well let me let me do Diane's
 
01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:22.360 align:start position:0%
first page 25 paragraph 5 on March 18
 
01:37:26.590 --> 01:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
2021 Diane V died she was 62 years
 
01:37:28.669 --> 01:37:28.679 align:start position:0%
old here's part one of her dust
 
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:30.360 align:start position:0%
certificate acute intracranial
 
01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:31.480 align:start position:0%

01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
with covid-19 vaccination 11 days prior
 
01:37:35.639 --> 01:37:36.750 align:start position:0%
with covid-19 vaccination 11 days prior
to

01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:39.390 --> 01:37:39.400 align:start position:0%
presentation it's on her death
 
01:37:41.550 --> 01:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
certificate this the the person who
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
wrote this death certificate wants you
 
01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
to know she died from the vaccine there
 
01:37:51.149 --> 01:37:51.159 align:start position:0%
are no codes here y 590 and t881 are
 
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
absent this is an omission of material
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
fact and therefore a false writing on
 
01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
official documents as a matter of custom
 
01:37:57.679 --> 01:37:58.830 align:start position:0%
official documents as a matter of custom
and

01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%

and
practice

01:38:00.470 --> 01:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:38:04.950 --> 01:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
both the uh the CDC is guilty they have
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
been notified they've been given this
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
document they've been given other
 
01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
documents they were contacted by Greg
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
Piper and they are looking at you and
 
01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
saying we don't care about New Hampshire
 
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
doing page um
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
26 paragraph
 
01:38:31.709 --> 01:38:31.719 align:start position:0%
7 this is on the uh New Hampshire border
 
01:38:31.719 --> 01:38:32.510 align:start position:0%
7 this is on the uh New Hampshire border
very

01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:38:36.390 --> 01:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
close um close to Salem so Bri Brianna
 
01:38:38.189 --> 01:38:38.199 align:start position:0%
lived in hail but she grew up in methu
 
01:38:40.550 --> 01:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
she was a high school teacher she died
 
01:38:44.189 --> 01:38:44.199 align:start position:0%
on March 30 excuse me on March 30th
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
2021 she was injected with a single dose
 
01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:49.310 align:start position:0%
2021 she was injected with a single dose
of

01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.950 --> 01:38:52.960 align:start position:0%
madna the v's report was entered by a
 
01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:55.550 align:start position:0%
madna the v's report was entered by a
practicing

01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:58.109 --> 01:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
nurse uh a severe headache appears to
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
have been appears to have begun only
 
01:39:02.830 --> 01:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
hours following immunization ensued for
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
days until Brianna was admitted to
 
01:39:07.950 --> 01:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
hospital then degraded into a seizure
 
01:39:10.870 --> 01:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
brain lesions paralysis and brain
 
01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:12.189 align:start position:0%

01:39:12.189 --> 01:39:12.199 align:start position:0%
activity
 
01:39:14.910 --> 01:39:14.920 align:start position:0%
stopped so she reacted in hours to the
 
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
vaccine she was removed from life
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
support about two and a half weeks later
 
01:39:22.990 --> 01:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
Brianna died officially on April 15 2021
 
01:39:26.310 --> 01:39:26.320 align:start position:0%
at years old her death record
 
01:39:29.109 --> 01:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
States non-traumatic cerebral
 
01:39:31.229 --> 01:39:31.239 align:start position:0%
herniation in other words she wasn't hit
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:39:39.910 --> 01:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
head and um no
 
01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
mention no no y59 on her death record
 
01:39:50.270 --> 01:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
it's not there now did they really know
 
01:39:55.070 --> 01:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:57.229 --> 01:39:57.239 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to do this from memory
 
01:39:59.070 --> 01:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
because it's easier and I I've presented
 
01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
this a million times so there were six
 
01:40:02.510 --> 01:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
doctors from Harvard Medical College
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
Beth Israel deaconness Hospital where
 
01:40:06.350 --> 01:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
she died and they wrote a brief report
 
01:40:09.350 --> 01:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
in the neurohospitalist journal and and
 
01:40:11.550 --> 01:40:11.560 align:start position:0%
the report is titled fatal postco mRNA
 
01:40:13.390 --> 01:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine Associated cerebral esia and
 
01:40:14.870 --> 01:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
that means the vaccine killed her by
 
01:40:17.629 --> 01:40:17.639 align:start position:0%
stroke they wrote a report about it in
 
01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
every paragraph of that report it says
 
01:40:21.149 --> 01:40:21.159 align:start position:0%
the vaccine killed her by
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
frequent remember Diane Dua two weeks
 
01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
before Brianna got injected she died if
 
01:40:33.709 --> 01:40:33.719 align:start position:0%
they had investigated her death and they
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
knew they wrote it on the death
 
01:40:38.189 --> 01:40:38.199 align:start position:0%
certificate what killed her but they
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
covered it up and because they covered
 
01:40:47.990 --> 01:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:49.750 align:start position:0%
 
dead

01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
dead
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
so you you have a society where we sit
 
01:40:56.350 --> 01:40:56.360 align:start position:0%
here and wonder how can this happen it
 
01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
can't be it can't be all lies this many
 
01:41:00.750 --> 01:41:00.760 align:start position:0%
people can't be
 
01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
involved but the facts stay
 
01:41:06.510 --> 01:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
otherwise they wrote the report they
 
01:41:08.430 --> 01:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
said where thrombocytopenia Is frequent
 
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
they also said where cvst is they have a
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
number of reports on C cvst is cerebral
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
Venus sinus thrombosis it's a kind of
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
hemorrhagic stroke I said but Briana
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
didn't have that but they're common
 
01:41:26.189 --> 01:41:26.199 align:start position:0%
where hypen Is frequent they also say
 
01:41:28.950 --> 01:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
they have a number of reports of Strokes
 
01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
from Co vaccinations plural in other
 
01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:34.239 align:start position:0%
words not just the Mna not just the
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
Jansen not just the
 
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.070 --> 01:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
them and I'm gonna I'm going to skip I
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
mean you see how extensive all these
 
01:41:48.149 --> 01:41:48.159 align:start position:0%
facts are these are facts can't get away
 
01:41:48.159 --> 01:41:49.030 align:start position:0%
facts are these are facts can't get away
from

01:41:49.030 --> 01:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:57.950 --> 01:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:01.229 --> 01:42:01.239 align:start position:0%
11 on May 23rd 2021 the Commonwealth of
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts a 17-year-old girl was
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:13.390 --> 01:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
um well I I I'm going to read just part
 
01:42:24.350 --> 01:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
of it
 
01:42:27.510 --> 01:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
so she got her shot and then she had a
 
01:42:29.070 --> 01:42:29.080 align:start position:0%
headache so bad she went to her primary
 
01:42:31.550 --> 01:42:31.560 align:start position:0%
care physician twice and when her
 
01:42:34.790 --> 01:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
headache resolved in a week or two she
 
01:42:36.149 --> 01:42:36.159 align:start position:0%
got her second
 
01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
shot and the quote is it then resolved
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
and she got her second
 
01:42:43.589 --> 01:42:43.599 align:start position:0%
vaccine massive acute int cranial
 
01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
Hemorrhage large interventricular
 
01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:47.639 align:start position:0%
Hemorrhage massive brain swelling in
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
infarctions on her death certificate she
 
01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:50.870 align:start position:0%
infarctions on her death certificate she
died

01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
died
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
from complications of cerebral Venus
 
01:42:57.990 --> 01:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
sinus thrombosis this was 5 weeks after
 
01:43:01.709 --> 01:43:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:10.109 --> 01:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
stroke and so the only thing coded was a
 
01:43:12.790 --> 01:43:12.800 align:start position:0%
g08 which means intracranial intraspinal
 
01:43:14.709 --> 01:43:14.719 align:start position:0%
fitis and Throop
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
fitis so I just told you about three
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
Strokes in three women in three months
 
01:43:19.950 --> 01:43:19.960 align:start position:0%
in early
 
01:43:22.430 --> 01:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
2021 all attributed to the vaccine
 
01:43:24.750 --> 01:43:24.760 align:start position:0%
without a
 
01:43:27.629 --> 01:43:27.639 align:start position:0%
doubt and yet they hid them they covered
 
01:43:30.430 --> 01:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
them up they didn't tell the public
 
01:43:33.790 --> 01:43:33.800 align:start position:0%
about them and Amaya was 12 years old I
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
I'll just I'll I'll speak from memory
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
it's in
 
01:43:41.310 --> 01:43:41.320 align:start position:0%
here 12 years old they gave her four
 
01:43:44.870 --> 01:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
shots they gave her HPV minin cockle
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
Tdap and they gave her her third Co shot
 
01:43:50.030 --> 01:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
on August 3rd
 
01:43:52.750 --> 01:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
2022 I don't know how long the hospital
 
01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:53.629 align:start position:0%
2022 I don't know how long the hospital
stayed

01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
stayed
 
01:43:55.950 --> 01:43:55.960 align:start position:0%
were I'm sure she had the headaches
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
pretty soon after but she was officially
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
dead on August 29th same
 
01:44:04.990 --> 01:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
month now you could say well Eden and
 
01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
Amaya had um congenital defects in the
 
01:44:11.550 --> 01:44:11.560 align:start position:0%
vasculature of their brains okay did
 
01:44:13.229 --> 01:44:13.239 align:start position:0%
they deserve to be taken out 10 years
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
earlier than they otherwise would have
 
01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
by this shot because we know the shots
 
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
are killing people by stroke we know
 
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:25.070 --> 01:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
and then the reason I got all this
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
information is on page
 
01:44:29.189 --> 01:44:29.199 align:start position:0%
31 paragraph
 
01:44:31.430 --> 01:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
15 I heard on the radio that a
 
01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:33.320 align:start position:0%
seven-year-old girl died from covid and
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
I knew that was that was a lie so I
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
looked into it and I got all these death
 
01:44:42.910 --> 01:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
certificates and um so I'll just I'll
 
01:44:44.229 --> 01:44:44.239 align:start position:0%
just read the paragraph and then I can
 
01:44:47.589 --> 01:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
move on to some graphs on on January 13
 
01:44:49.390 --> 01:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
2022 in the Commonwealth of
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts a 7-year-old girl was
 
01:44:52.310 --> 01:44:52.320 align:start position:0%
injected with covid immunization
 
01:44:56.430 --> 01:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
according to bears ID 20 38120 entered
 
01:44:59.470 --> 01:44:59.480 align:start position:0%
into vs on January 15 that's important
 
01:45:02.790 --> 01:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:05.830 --> 01:45:05.840 align:start position:0%
15th and she was injected on the 13th
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
now this is a a V's record so there's no
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
name and the vs record States severe
 
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
nausea and vomiting from 5 minutes post
 
01:45:17.390 --> 01:45:17.400 align:start position:0%
vaccination and for the next 8 to 10
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
hours and then the next field States
 
01:45:23.790 --> 01:45:23.800 align:start position:0%
spiked a 103 degree fever severe stomach
 
01:45:27.310 --> 01:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination that that other one was for
 
01:45:31.470 --> 01:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
the first vaccination prior
 
01:45:33.910 --> 01:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
back so here's here's the one about this
 
01:45:36.870 --> 01:45:36.880 align:start position:0%
vaccination spiked a 103 degree fever
 
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
severe stomach ache had not had a bowel
 
01:45:39.910 --> 01:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
movement since the day before
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination which makes today three days
 
01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:43.189 align:start position:0%
vaccination which makes today three days
without

01:45:43.189 --> 01:45:43.199 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:45:46.350 --> 01:45:46.360 align:start position:0%
one her bowel is shut
 
01:45:49.390 --> 01:45:49.400 align:start position:0%
down I I assume there's no blood supply
 
01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
there bow lemia there's also been many
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
hemorrhages if you read through here and
 
01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
and I could show you many death
 
01:45:58.229 --> 01:45:58.239 align:start position:0%
certificates where people just started
 
01:46:00.030 --> 01:46:00.040 align:start position:0%
hemorrhaging from their
 
01:46:02.990 --> 01:46:03.000 align:start position:0%
bowels or they had esia they their Bowes
 
01:46:04.629 --> 01:46:04.639 align:start position:0%
shut down because they you can't get a
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
blood supply to it how can the muscles
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
contract to push food
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
along first vaccine caused severe Nom I
 
01:46:14.470 --> 01:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
don't know have to read that again
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
um so I go on to list the number of uh
 
01:46:22.229 --> 01:46:22.239 align:start position:0%
V's reports and death certificates they
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
in proxim
 
01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
of um this girl Cassidy Baraka it's only
 
01:46:32.990 --> 01:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
fits if you don't mind me asking I'm
 
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
just curious uh to find out how you got
 
01:46:42.669 --> 01:46:42.679 align:start position:0%
involved in obtaining the data and why
 
01:46:45.229 --> 01:46:45.239 align:start position:0%
you chose to dig
 
01:46:47.390 --> 01:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
in yeah
 
01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:50.239 align:start position:0%
so I I raised three boys pretty much on
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
my own for a while and then I lost my
 
01:46:56.510 --> 01:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:58.830 --> 01:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
accident so I was just sitting there on
 
01:47:00.669 --> 01:47:00.679 align:start position:0%
a couch doing nothing for a couple of
 
01:47:04.950 --> 01:47:04.960 align:start position:0%
years and um Co hit and it's basically
 
01:47:06.990 --> 01:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
destroying my other two sons with all
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
the the rules and everything like that's
 
01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:10.719 align:start position:0%
all Bs because as an engineer I know the
 
01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
masks aren't going to work why are you
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
asking doctors the doctor can read the
 
01:47:17.629 --> 01:47:17.639 align:start position:0%
Box they don't understand material
 
01:47:20.070 --> 01:47:20.080 align:start position:0%
properties Material Science they've
 
01:47:22.430 --> 01:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
never studied that they don't understand
 
01:47:24.310 --> 01:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
fluid Dynamics unless maybe they're a
 
01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
vascular surgeon and they might have had
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
to take a course in it and even then I
 
01:47:29.229 --> 01:47:29.239 align:start position:0%
would challenge them to understand
 
01:47:31.470 --> 01:47:31.480 align:start position:0%
branolia equations especially with
 
01:47:33.470 --> 01:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
regard to the aortic Arch and stuff so
 
01:47:36.189 --> 01:47:36.199 align:start position:0%
why did I get into it because I found
 
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
that people that specialize in in
 
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
purviews they they the solution is right
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
here but but they're like this and they
 
01:47:49.750 --> 01:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
can't see it and just step back and
 
01:47:51.669 --> 01:47:51.679 align:start position:0%
learn a little bit about something else
 
01:47:51.679 --> 01:47:53.709 align:start position:0%
learn a little bit about something else
like

01:47:53.709 --> 01:47:53.719 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:47:54.950 --> 01:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
how many people are looking at all the
 
01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
fiser trial data I don't care about it
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
do you think the criminal is going to
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
give you the evidence to hang them they
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're leaking out that as slowly as
 
01:48:05.750 --> 01:48:05.760 align:start position:0%
they can that as slowly as the judge
 
01:48:07.149 --> 01:48:07.159 align:start position:0%
allows and what are they leaking out
 
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
you're not going to find anything in
 
01:48:09.990 --> 01:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
there there's a couple of things that
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
are like oh look what we found but they
 
01:48:14.189 --> 01:48:14.199 align:start position:0%
have thousands and thousands of people
 
01:48:15.870 --> 01:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the fizer
 
01:48:19.470 --> 01:48:19.480 align:start position:0%
data why we have billions of people
 
01:48:22.350 --> 01:48:22.360 align:start position:0%
who've been injected we have I mean I
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
have one 1.4 million death certificates
 
01:48:27.629 --> 01:48:27.639 align:start position:0%
that are worth far more than any fiser
 
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
data that every state has access to the
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
immunization information system of the
 
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
state and all they have to do is
 
01:48:38.070 --> 01:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
correlate the names from the IIs to
 
01:48:40.030 --> 01:48:40.040 align:start position:0%
either the death records or the Medicaid
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
and Medicare because they also have
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
that and when I said I had whistleblower
 
01:48:48.030 --> 01:48:48.040 align:start position:0%
data you can imagine what databases get
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
leaked out here and there but if anybody
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
finds out where it came from they'll
 
01:48:54.070 --> 01:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
throw the person in
 
01:48:57.229 --> 01:48:57.239 align:start position:0%
jail the data exists we could solve this
 
01:48:59.310 --> 01:48:59.320 align:start position:0%
in one week in any
 
01:49:02.550 --> 01:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
state that just does does a thorough
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
investigation oh excuse me a cursory
 
01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
investigation in a week could put all
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
these vaccines to rest it is the Holy
 
01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
Grail of information they will not let
 
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
out so why did I get into it because I
 
01:49:16.510 --> 01:49:16.520 align:start position:0%
care about all the kids being killed
 
01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
because their parents I don't want to
 
01:49:19.950 --> 01:49:19.960 align:start position:0%
say so ignorant people think of as a bad
 
01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:21.080 align:start position:0%
word it just means you don't know
 
01:49:22.149 --> 01:49:22.159 align:start position:0%
something there's nothing wrong with the
 
01:49:23.589 --> 01:49:23.599 align:start position:0%
word ignorant
 
01:49:25.910 --> 01:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
the parents are ignorant because the
 
01:49:28.109 --> 01:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
government has been lying to them and
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
hiding it and if you understand behavior
 
01:49:33.070 --> 01:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
in systems and and I heard somebody
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
mention earlier um one one of you two
 
01:49:40.910 --> 01:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
guys uh you know hhs.gov is is not
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
running this whole thing it's a joint
 
01:49:45.669 --> 01:49:45.679 align:start position:0%
operation warp speed is a joint Mission
 
01:49:45.679 --> 01:49:46.589 align:start position:0%
operation warp speed is a joint Mission
with

01:49:46.589 --> 01:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:49:49.270 --> 01:49:49.280 align:start position:0%
DOD whose DOD going to assign to do it
 
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
oh that's just for distribution they
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
don't have they don't have Army cargo
 
01:49:55.550 --> 01:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
trucks driving around the country
 
01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
delivering vaccines that's not their
 
01:50:00.189 --> 01:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
mission their mission is a vaccine in
 
01:50:01.709 --> 01:50:01.719 align:start position:0%
every arm that's what they were told
 
01:50:03.149 --> 01:50:03.159 align:start position:0%
that's what they're going to do and when
 
01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
the Smith month act part of it was
 
01:50:07.910 --> 01:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
repealed under Obama that allowed them
 
01:50:11.390 --> 01:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
to propagandize Americans so who got the
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
tap on the shoulder what division of
 
01:50:16.669 --> 01:50:16.679 align:start position:0%
military military intelligence and what
 
01:50:19.390 --> 01:50:19.400 align:start position:0%
did they do they infiltrated social
 
01:50:21.550 --> 01:50:21.560 align:start position:0%
media that people like me have been
 
01:50:23.310 --> 01:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
suppressed Terri
 
01:50:24.990 --> 01:50:25.000 align:start position:0%
they attack people who've been back
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
injured people with transverse myus who
 
01:50:29.950 --> 01:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
paralyzed from the waist down people who
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:47.550 --> 01:50:47.560 align:start position:0%
kids cute kid helping out just walked in
 
01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:49.069 align:start position:0%
kids cute kid helping out just walked in
the

01:50:49.069 --> 01:50:49.079 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
room it's pretty funny should I wait or
 
01:50:55.709 --> 01:50:55.719 align:start position:0%
continue continue
 
01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
okay so you know I I don't
 
01:51:01.990 --> 01:51:02.000 align:start position:0%
just understand like what I read but
 
01:51:04.189 --> 01:51:04.199 align:start position:0%
also how people interact that was my job
 
01:51:07.310 --> 01:51:07.320 align:start position:0%
for 30 years is to understand both the
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
formal and informal and these are all
 
01:51:11.910 --> 01:51:11.920 align:start position:0%
things I've been taught the formal and
 
01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:14.320 align:start position:0%
informal structure of an organization
 
01:51:15.709 --> 01:51:15.719 align:start position:0%
because they're very
 
01:51:18.510 --> 01:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
different but formerly what mission were
 
01:51:20.470 --> 01:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
they given a needle in every arm what
 
01:51:22.390 --> 01:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
tools do they know what tactics do they
 
01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:24.069 align:start position:0%
tools do they know what tactics do they
take

01:51:24.069 --> 01:51:24.079 align:start position:0%
take
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
they went out and they they violated the
 
01:51:28.189 --> 01:51:28.199 align:start position:0%
Free Speech rights of all Americans not
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
all but the ones of us who were telling
 
01:51:32.430 --> 01:51:32.440 align:start position:0%
the truth they called us
 
01:51:34.669 --> 01:51:34.679 align:start position:0%
misinformation this is a fact we know
 
01:51:37.069 --> 01:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
this if you look at so Aaron kot's got a
 
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
case um American First America First
 
01:51:42.390 --> 01:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
legal has the foyer releases that is in
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
exhibit h of this they worked with
 
01:51:47.589 --> 01:51:47.599 align:start position:0%
social media to suppress any voice that
 
01:51:49.830 --> 01:51:49.840 align:start position:0%
was called
 
01:51:51.910 --> 01:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
antivaccine how about we just wanted to
 
01:51:54.149 --> 01:51:54.159 align:start position:0%
save people's lives from a gene drug
 
01:51:56.189 --> 01:51:56.199 align:start position:0%
therapy never before deployed in humans
 
01:51:56.199 --> 01:51:57.229 align:start position:0%
therapy never before deployed in humans
on

01:51:57.229 --> 01:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:51:59.790 --> 01:51:59.800 align:start position:0%
mass and it will never work because
 
01:52:02.109 --> 01:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
those lipid nanoparticle uh delivery
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
mechanism that they use is it I I don't
 
01:52:06.830 --> 01:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
want to get into all the specifics and
 
01:52:08.750 --> 01:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
yes I can have a conversation with a
 
01:52:10.950 --> 01:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
doctor and I probably know more than any
 
01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
given doctor about the specifics of
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
these but I will never say I'm an
 
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
expert here here's an example before I
 
01:52:21.229 --> 01:52:21.239 align:start position:0%
move on I was in a
 
01:52:23.350 --> 01:52:23.360 align:start position:0%
group I've been I'm in a number of
 
01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:26.760 align:start position:0%
groups but so a lot of phds a lot of
 
01:52:30.109 --> 01:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
phds one guy was being attacked by his
 
01:52:32.189 --> 01:52:32.199 align:start position:0%
university and they wanted to get rid of
 
01:52:33.510 --> 01:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
him and all the other professors were
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
angry at him so the history professors
 
01:52:37.550 --> 01:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
the philosophy professors the law
 
01:52:39.750 --> 01:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
professors they are you get the vaccine
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
get the vaccine the three professors
 
01:52:45.069 --> 01:52:45.079 align:start position:0%
that were being attacked the three
 
01:52:47.629 --> 01:52:47.639 align:start position:0%
professors at this large University that
 
01:52:49.149 --> 01:52:49.159 align:start position:0%
were being attacked were the three
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
Immunology professors they would not get
 
01:52:53.669 --> 01:52:53.679 align:start position:0%
the vaccine they were being yelled at by
 
01:52:55.589 --> 01:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
the history professors and the
 
01:52:57.950 --> 01:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
philosophy and political science profess
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
does that make any sense to anybody so
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
did I hear you correctly it was the
 
01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
immunologist professors that did not
 
01:53:09.350 --> 01:53:09.360 align:start position:0%
want the vaccine they didn't get it they
 
01:53:11.629 --> 01:53:11.639 align:start position:0%
weren't allowed on campus there's a
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
lawsuit I can't really I I I'm afraid to
 
01:53:16.750 --> 01:53:16.760 align:start position:0%
use his name um it's public it's Byron
 
01:53:19.430 --> 01:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
Bridal out of Canada University of GF in
 
01:53:21.470 --> 01:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
Toronto I just wanted to make sure I
 
01:53:23.870 --> 01:53:23.880 align:start position:0%
understood correctly that it was the
 
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:26.520 align:start position:0%
other professors ganging up on the
 
01:53:28.990 --> 01:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
immunologist professors and they're the
 
01:53:31.069 --> 01:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
ones that were refusing the vacine
 
01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
yep so the the people should know that
 
01:53:41.550 --> 01:53:41.560 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's evil and then
 
01:53:44.069 --> 01:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
there's just I'm doing my job right and
 
01:53:45.629 --> 01:53:45.639 align:start position:0%
some of these people from military
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
intelligence are just doing their job so
 
01:53:49.510 --> 01:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
I personally I know I've been suppressed
 
01:53:51.870 --> 01:53:51.880 align:start position:0%
on social media I mostly am on Twitter
 
01:53:53.430 --> 01:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
now called
 
01:53:55.470 --> 01:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
um I won't get into follower accounts
 
01:53:56.870 --> 01:53:56.880 align:start position:0%
and what I saw the needle going
 
01:54:00.430 --> 01:54:00.440 align:start position:0%
backwards you know um and and especially
 
01:54:02.270 --> 01:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
when Robert F Kennedy Jr tweeted about
 
01:54:05.709 --> 01:54:05.719 align:start position:0%
me and got 18,000 likes in six hours and
 
01:54:08.310 --> 01:54:08.320 align:start position:0%
I got zero followers and I and I went
 
01:54:10.109 --> 01:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
and I looked at it for half an hour and
 
01:54:12.270 --> 01:54:12.280 align:start position:0%
it it was like
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
2997 3002 and then within a second 29.97
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
35 2997 310 29.97 anytime they were
 
01:54:22.669 --> 01:54:22.679 align:start position:0%
added they were subtracted immediately
 
01:54:25.149 --> 01:54:25.159 align:start position:0%
by what appears to be an algorithm can't
 
01:54:27.750 --> 01:54:27.760 align:start position:0%
prove anything but I know that's what I
 
01:54:31.390 --> 01:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
did I watched my phone um and you know I
 
01:54:33.310 --> 01:54:33.320 align:start position:0%
have 30,000 now which is pretty modest
 
01:54:34.790 --> 01:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
most people have hundreds of thousands
 
01:54:39.030 --> 01:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
and for doing what I do um but I I I
 
01:54:42.149 --> 01:54:42.159 align:start position:0%
believe that the CDC memorandum the the
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
prototypes for this were the ver Vermont
 
01:54:46.550 --> 01:54:46.560 align:start position:0%
memorandum the Minnesota memorandum
 
01:54:48.910 --> 01:54:48.920 align:start position:0%
served to the governors Public Health
 
01:54:50.790 --> 01:54:50.800 align:start position:0%
Commissioners chief medical examiners
 
01:54:52.830 --> 01:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
and and other people within the
 
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:55.320 align:start position:0%
States um I told you about the Vermont
 
01:54:57.229 --> 01:54:57.239 align:start position:0%
woman there's another woman in here from
 
01:55:00.350 --> 01:55:00.360 align:start position:0%
Vermont uh who died just just just a
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
horribly tragic mother uh she had lost
 
01:55:07.310 --> 01:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
her mother and so she leaves the child
 
01:55:10.470 --> 01:55:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh without anybody and um pulmonary
 
01:55:12.550 --> 01:55:12.560 align:start position:0%
embolism and you know if you read these
 
01:55:14.830 --> 01:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
things it says oh she was feeling
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
lethargic for a few days it's like yeah
 
01:55:19.830 --> 01:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
she had a pulmonary embolism it doesn't
 
01:55:21.950 --> 01:55:21.960 align:start position:0%
just kill you in a second sometimes you
 
01:55:24.750 --> 01:55:24.760 align:start position:0%
know it it takes a while to form grow
 
01:55:28.669 --> 01:55:28.679 align:start position:0%
and shut down the ventricle so
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah I all right let let me let me
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:39.390 --> 01:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
here if there's anything really
 
01:55:45.510 --> 01:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.229 --> 01:56:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:06.390 --> 01:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
act um yeah I'm I'm gonna I'll tell you
 
01:56:16.709 --> 01:56:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:20.470 --> 01:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
it and and while you're looking I just
 
01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh as a side note just so you understand
 
01:56:28.030 --> 01:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
um we had a uh industrial hygienist in
 
01:56:32.550 --> 01:56:32.560 align:start position:0%
here a few weeks back to discuss masks
 
01:56:37.470 --> 01:56:37.480 align:start position:0%
and um how they work and uh who should
 
01:56:39.470 --> 01:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
be giving guidance on them so it was
 
01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:41.189 align:start position:0%
be giving guidance on them so it was
very

01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
informative there there's a reason why
 
01:56:46.030 --> 01:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
you did not hear from OSHA or NEOS those
 
01:56:48.750 --> 01:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
the two organizations under hhs.gov
 
01:56:50.990 --> 01:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
because if they had come
 
01:56:54.149 --> 01:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
out they would have had to lied so you
 
01:56:55.950 --> 01:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
have to find somebody who's going to lie
 
01:56:58.669 --> 01:56:58.679 align:start position:0%
overtly Based on data and they couldn't
 
01:57:00.189 --> 01:57:00.199 align:start position:0%
find anybody so they had people like
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
fouchi and people who know nothing about
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
medical devices how they're manufactured
 
01:57:07.830 --> 01:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
material properties of them and the the
 
01:57:10.830 --> 01:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
effectiveness and um yeah an industrial
 
01:57:13.149 --> 01:57:13.159 align:start position:0%
hygienist knows that you have to be
 
01:57:15.069 --> 01:57:15.079 align:start position:0%
trained you have to be fit tested every
 
01:57:17.870 --> 01:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
single time uh they're they're all just
 
01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
meant as a behavior control mechanism to
 
01:57:24.589 --> 01:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
get people to vaccinate all right right
 
01:57:24.599 --> 01:57:26.550 align:start position:0%
get people to vaccinate all right right
so

01:57:26.550 --> 01:57:26.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:29.109 --> 01:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
I'm oh I should just go to the beginning
 
01:57:31.470 --> 01:57:31.480 align:start position:0%
and look at the page
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
contents okay
 
01:57:52.350 --> 01:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.189 --> 01:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
if you go to the covid humanity material
 
01:57:58.149 --> 01:57:58.159 align:start position:0%
memory Project chbm online you will see
 
01:57:59.830 --> 01:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people who tell their
 
01:58:01.870 --> 01:58:01.880 align:start position:0%
stories true stories of being murdered
 
01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:03.629 align:start position:0%
stories true stories of being murdered
in

01:58:03.629 --> 01:58:03.639 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:58:06.669 --> 01:58:06.679 align:start position:0%
hospitals um they're they're horrific
 
01:58:09.030 --> 01:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
stories I've been on several calls with
 
01:58:11.589 --> 01:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
these people crying into the
 
01:58:11.599 --> 01:58:14.430 align:start position:0%
these people crying into the
phone

01:58:14.430 --> 01:58:14.440 align:start position:0%
phone
 
01:58:17.669 --> 01:58:17.679 align:start position:0%
um people being handcuff the beds not
 
01:58:19.910 --> 01:58:19.920 align:start position:0%
being able to see them being put on
 
01:58:21.910 --> 01:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
drugs they said they do not want to be
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
on on expressly they get put on him
 
01:58:26.910 --> 01:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
anyway so the hospital gets the money
 
01:58:28.390 --> 01:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
because that drug has to be given for
 
01:58:30.430 --> 01:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
the hospital to get the money REM do
 
01:58:33.350 --> 01:58:33.360 align:start position:0%
here all right so at the bottom of page
 
01:58:37.149 --> 01:58:37.159 align:start position:0%
97 Danielle in October 2023 um her mom
 
01:58:40.069 --> 01:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:40.079 --> 01:58:41.669 align:start position:0%
 
Records

01:58:41.669 --> 01:58:41.679 align:start position:0%
Records
 
01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:44.960 align:start position:0%
um Danielle Kathleen Alvarez was
 
01:58:48.109 --> 01:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
admitted on August 27
 
01:58:52.589 --> 01:58:52.599 align:start position:0%
2021 I have the names of uh the doctors
 
01:58:55.790 --> 01:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh so Heather Melman jincy Jacob was a
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
nurse they started her on um so she was
 
01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
a they entered the
 
01:59:05.990 --> 01:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
order at um 3:04 p.m. to give her remes
 
01:59:07.830 --> 01:59:07.840 align:start position:0%
of here so as soon as they get a
 
01:59:09.430 --> 01:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
positive covid test bam they hit her
 
01:59:14.189 --> 01:59:14.199 align:start position:0%
with that R Dee so her Vital Signs 97.9
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
temperature 82 beat per minute heart
 
01:59:20.430 --> 01:59:20.440 align:start position:0%
rate 119 over 87 blood pressure 15
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
breasts per minute
 
01:59:25.229 --> 01:59:25.239 align:start position:0%
sound like she was struggling she wasn't
 
01:59:28.109 --> 01:59:28.119 align:start position:0%
struggling there's no
 
01:59:28.119 --> 01:59:31.149 align:start position:0%
struggling there's no
struggle

01:59:31.149 --> 01:59:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:33.390 --> 01:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
um all right then they started hitting
 
01:59:35.510 --> 01:59:35.520 align:start position:0%
her with the courses of R doir I have a
 
01:59:36.950 --> 01:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
lot of details in here I'm just going to
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
kind of skip but I mean 97.3 81 beats
 
01:59:42.510 --> 01:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
per minute she's nervous she's learning
 
01:59:44.550 --> 01:59:44.560 align:start position:0%
disabled she's alone her mom isn't
 
01:59:47.270 --> 01:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
allowed to be with her pulse sock was
 
01:59:49.229 --> 01:59:49.239 align:start position:0%
down to
 
01:59:54.030 --> 01:59:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
um just more more data I'm giving you
 
02:00:00.669 --> 02:00:00.679 align:start position:0%
leading up to the uh
 
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
ventilation I guess at this point I just
 
02:00:05.470 --> 02:00:05.480 align:start position:0%
this is a a lot of pages I'll just say
 
02:00:07.510 --> 02:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
the facts are
 
02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:09.679 align:start position:0%
here and and these can be used to
 
02:00:11.069 --> 02:00:11.079 align:start position:0%
convict these people and murder they
 
02:00:12.270 --> 02:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
murdered this
 
02:00:15.589 --> 02:00:15.599 align:start position:0%
girl um now I guess I'll finish up with
 
02:00:18.069 --> 02:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
some graphs if you go to look what I
 
02:00:21.189 --> 02:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
just I I just want to make sure um you
 
02:00:24.430 --> 02:00:24.440 align:start position:0%
know we keep men the r Desir yeah but
 
02:00:26.550 --> 02:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
you mentioned early that you don't know
 
02:00:30.149 --> 02:00:30.159 align:start position:0%
if it was R Desir you're not saying it's
 
02:00:32.550 --> 02:00:32.560 align:start position:0%
Desir is that correct that is correct
 
02:00:33.790 --> 02:00:33.800 align:start position:0%
thank you and there a lot of people are
 
02:00:35.229 --> 02:00:35.239 align:start position:0%
going to be very mad at me for not
 
02:00:36.589 --> 02:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
saying it's R
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
Desir I'm not a cheerleader for anything
 
02:00:42.510 --> 02:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
I go by facts and and data and evidence
 
02:00:44.149 --> 02:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
and so I don't have the evidence that
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's from Desir what I have the evidence
 
02:00:47.950 --> 02:00:47.960 align:start position:0%
of is that the government is not
 
02:00:51.350 --> 02:00:51.360 align:start position:0%
investigating one of the largest mass
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
casualties in the history of the United
 
02:00:58.109 --> 02:00:58.119 align:start position:0%
States they just don't care acute renal
 
02:01:00.990 --> 02:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
failure they just don't care I told you
 
02:01:03.310 --> 02:01:03.320 align:start position:0%
150,000 so well a million were killed by
 
02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
Co no they weren't that's a
 
02:01:09.149 --> 02:01:09.159 align:start position:0%
lie I also have in here I told you all
 
02:01:11.189 --> 02:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
the fraud that occurred Massachusetts
 
02:01:13.030 --> 02:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
New York New Jersey drove the fear of
 
02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:13.790 align:start position:0%
New York New Jersey drove the fear of
this

02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:01:16.189 --> 02:01:16.199 align:start position:0%
pandemic because they had the most to
 
02:01:18.750 --> 02:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
gain it was all a game it was all gamed
 
02:01:20.069 --> 02:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
out from the very beginning the cares
 
02:01:22.790 --> 02:01:22.800 align:start position:0%
Act was written in 2018
 
02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
couple variables were tweaked in
 
02:01:27.669 --> 02:01:27.679 align:start position:0%
2020 and they passed it they just pass
 
02:01:29.950 --> 02:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
it whatever the lobbyist hands them here
 
02:01:32.109 --> 02:01:32.119 align:start position:0%
pass this it's behavior modification to
 
02:01:33.950 --> 02:01:33.960 align:start position:0%
get the doctors to do what they
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:44.030 --> 02:01:44.040 align:start position:0%
please I'm not I'm not going to do too
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
many because there there are 400 graphs
 
02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:48.390 align:start position:0%
many because there there are 400 graphs
in

02:01:48.390 --> 02:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:01:50.950 --> 02:01:50.960 align:start position:0%
this by the way you you can buy this on
 
02:01:52.830 --> 02:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
my website
 
02:01:56.069 --> 02:01:56.079 align:start position:0%
you can buy it at Amazon too um that's
 
02:01:58.069 --> 02:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
the the change names version the other
 
02:02:00.709 --> 02:02:00.719 align:start position:0%
version that went to the CDC FDA and IH
 
02:02:03.430 --> 02:02:03.440 align:start position:0%
had real real names and that's only uh
 
02:02:05.229 --> 02:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
about like I said about four or five
 
02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:14.109 --> 02:02:14.119 align:start position:0%
258 if you've heard of Turbo cancer this
 
02:02:14.119 --> 02:02:15.550 align:start position:0%
258 if you've heard of Turbo cancer this
is

02:02:15.550 --> 02:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:02:19.390 --> 02:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
it now the difference in 2020 on the top
 
02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
left graph and 2020 is up
 
02:02:25.350 --> 02:02:25.360 align:start position:0%
well you had 8,800 excess deaths in a
 
02:02:27.430 --> 02:02:27.440 align:start position:0%
matter of nine weeks in 2020 from
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
mid-march to Mid June that's a lot of
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
old people the average death uh the
 
02:02:36.069 --> 02:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
average age of of uh covid and the
 
02:02:39.030 --> 02:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
average age of excess death was 81 in
 
02:02:40.669 --> 02:02:40.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and that that all happened
 
02:02:42.189 --> 02:02:42.199 align:start position:0%
in nine weeks so you have a lot of
 
02:02:43.629 --> 02:02:43.639 align:start position:0%
people that had lymph node cancer and
 
02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
they were kind of cleared out by
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
whatever there was done to them mostly
 
02:02:50.069 --> 02:02:50.079 align:start position:0%
neglect you know doctors will say you
 
02:02:53.149 --> 02:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
died of covid but I I interviewed a a
 
02:02:54.629 --> 02:02:54.639 align:start position:0%
medical examiner for three and a half
 
02:02:56.030 --> 02:02:56.040 align:start position:0%
hours and reviewed hundreds of death
 
02:02:57.750 --> 02:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
certificates with
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
him and he told
 
02:03:03.310 --> 02:03:03.320 align:start position:0%
me we didn't do blood Labs we didn't do
 
02:03:05.510 --> 02:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
imaging we didn't do tissue samples we
 
02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
called up the old folks home said what
 
02:03:08.550 --> 02:03:08.560 align:start position:0%
happened and they said well she was 95
 
02:03:10.430 --> 02:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
was coughing and died it's like okay co
 
02:03:13.069 --> 02:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
co co co co everything was Co they
 
02:03:14.229 --> 02:03:14.239 align:start position:0%
didn't do their jobs because they were
 
02:03:16.950 --> 02:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
afraid of the dead bodies but a doctor
 
02:03:19.470 --> 02:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
would know dead bodies don't breathe
 
02:03:23.030 --> 02:03:23.040 align:start position:0%
just use gloves which they use anyway
 
02:03:24.470 --> 02:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
they weren't going to die from the dead
 
02:03:27.870 --> 02:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
bodies but they were afraid anyway they
 
02:03:31.030 --> 02:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
bought into the fear so when you look at
 
02:03:33.390 --> 02:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
this and you see that 2020 has
 
02:03:36.109 --> 02:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
risen it should actually go down after
 
02:03:38.350 --> 02:03:38.360 align:start position:0%
2020 there should be a deficit because
 
02:03:40.109 --> 02:03:40.119 align:start position:0%
you've you pulled people forward they
 
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
call it a pull forward effect I hate
 
02:03:44.510 --> 02:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
that term but I I I say you've cleared
 
02:03:48.069 --> 02:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
out the dry Tinder right people had
 
02:03:49.270 --> 02:03:49.280 align:start position:0%
something and they were going to die
 
02:03:52.950 --> 02:03:52.960 align:start position:0%
anyway over the next six 12 maybe 24
 
02:03:55.069 --> 02:03:55.079 align:start position:0%
months or they were pulled into that
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
window of time of 9 weeks when they kind
 
02:03:59.350 --> 02:03:59.360 align:start position:0%
of weren't cared for the staff didn't
 
02:04:01.589 --> 02:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
show up at a lot of the old folks ones
 
02:04:03.390 --> 02:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
if you don't walk a 95 year-old down the
 
02:04:05.149 --> 02:04:05.159 align:start position:0%
hallway twice a day they can't it
 
02:04:07.149 --> 02:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't contract their
 
02:04:09.830 --> 02:04:09.840 align:start position:0%
calves and and that and push the blood
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
back up right so if you just say here
 
02:04:14.750 --> 02:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
wear a mask and lie in bed for two weeks
 
02:04:16.149 --> 02:04:16.159 align:start position:0%
until we get the staff to walk you
 
02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
around again they're dead from either
 
02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:20.040 align:start position:0%
pneumonia or a DBT throwing a clot to a
 
02:04:22.350 --> 02:04:22.360 align:start position:0%
PE within two weeks
 
02:04:24.549 --> 02:04:24.559 align:start position:0%
so most of the people that died from
 
02:04:26.589 --> 02:04:26.599 align:start position:0%
covid it was
 
02:04:28.709 --> 02:04:28.719 align:start position:0%
neglect and and once all these old
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
people died then in
 
02:04:33.470 --> 02:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
21 you have people dying and I'm not
 
02:04:35.870 --> 02:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
going to say cancer lymph node cancer
 
02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
specifically but what you have is a
 
02:04:40.669 --> 02:04:40.679 align:start position:0%
shift of 16 years in the excess deaths
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
so the excess
 
02:04:47.109 --> 02:04:47.119 align:start position:0%
deaths were were 81 in 20120 in
 
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the middle of the
 
02:04:51.149 --> 02:04:51.159 align:start position:0%
range of excess deaths was 16 years
 
02:04:51.159 --> 02:04:52.990 align:start position:0%
range of excess deaths was 16 years
lower

02:04:52.990 --> 02:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
lower
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
in 2021 figure that one out and and the
 
02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
average age of covid death was not in
 
02:04:58.239 --> 02:04:59.030 align:start position:0%
average age of covid death was not in
that

02:04:59.030 --> 02:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
range the average age of covid death in
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:10.069 --> 02:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
75.8 but it was 65 on average of the
 
02:05:12.669 --> 02:05:12.679 align:start position:0%
excess deaths so people were dying of
 
02:05:15.229 --> 02:05:15.239 align:start position:0%
not covid something
 
02:05:19.549 --> 02:05:19.559 align:start position:0%
else 10 years younger and that's a 10x
 
02:05:21.270 --> 02:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
so you say oh people died from a million
 
02:05:22.709 --> 02:05:22.719 align:start position:0%
people died from covid well first of all
 
02:05:25.109 --> 02:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
no they didn't it's about 90 maybe 80 to
 
02:05:25.119 --> 02:05:27.030 align:start position:0%
no they didn't it's about 90 maybe 80 to
90%

02:05:27.030 --> 02:05:27.040 align:start position:0%
90%
 
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
fraud and if you actually believe those
 
02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
numbers and the and the age was
 
02:05:35.549 --> 02:05:35.559 align:start position:0%
81 and the real age of the excess that
 
02:05:38.629 --> 02:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
is occurring from not covid let's say a
 
02:05:40.470 --> 02:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
100,000 of them died let's say only
 
02:05:42.350 --> 02:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
let's be conservative I'll say a million
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
but 100,000 of
 
02:05:46.910 --> 02:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
them but but they died an average of 10
 
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
years younger that's 10 times the life
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
years lost that's a million life years
 
02:05:56.189 --> 02:05:56.199 align:start position:0%
lost and the people that it
 
02:05:58.510 --> 02:05:58.520 align:start position:0%
affects when it when I'm sorry but when
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
an 85-year-old dies you know and I most
 
02:06:06.189 --> 02:06:06.199 align:start position:0%
of my family is is gone the the the Next
 
02:06:08.990 --> 02:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
Generation my father was born in 1918 he
 
02:06:11.709 --> 02:06:11.719 align:start position:0%
cut down trees in the CCC camps in the
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
Great Depression in New Hampshire
 
02:06:17.350 --> 02:06:17.360 align:start position:0%
swinging an axe because the saw was too
 
02:06:22.709 --> 02:06:22.719 align:start position:0%
fast so it's sad when somebody 85 died
 
02:06:26.549 --> 02:06:26.559 align:start position:0%
but how about a 45y old with three
 
02:06:29.350 --> 02:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
kids and what pathologies then manifest
 
02:06:31.750 --> 02:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
in those three children as they grow up
 
02:06:33.910 --> 02:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
depression drug addiction all kinds of
 
02:06:36.109 --> 02:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
stuff uh getting back to this I'm trying
 
02:06:38.149 --> 02:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
to tell you that the 21 and 22 numbers
 
02:06:39.669 --> 02:06:39.679 align:start position:0%
that you see here that are skyrocketing
 
02:06:41.910 --> 02:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
and 23 is also very
 
02:06:44.830 --> 02:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
high it's not on
 
02:06:49.069 --> 02:06:49.079 align:start position:0%
here the these are these multiply out to
 
02:06:52.189 --> 02:06:52.199 align:start position:0%
life years's loss that are 10 15 and 20
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
times that of anything from
 
02:06:59.390 --> 02:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
Co and I guess I just want to hit one
 
02:07:02.189 --> 02:07:02.199 align:start position:0%
thing before I finish up um you want me
 
02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
to finish up right yeah
 
02:07:08.510 --> 02:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay um so before I finish up Kevin
 
02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
mccaran is um there a lot of graphs
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
check check them out you guys have this
 
02:07:16.189 --> 02:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
now keep it
 
02:07:20.069 --> 02:07:20.079 align:start position:0%
free Kevin mccaran uh managed the Human
 
02:07:22.229 --> 02:07:22.239 align:start position:0%
Genome Project at MIT for a number of
 
02:07:24.030 --> 02:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
years he now is the chief science
 
02:07:26.709 --> 02:07:26.719 align:start position:0%
officer at medicinal genomics in
 
02:07:31.189 --> 02:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um he's a world leading
 
02:07:31.199 --> 02:07:32.669 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um he's a world leading
genetics

02:07:32.669 --> 02:07:32.679 align:start position:0%
genetics
 
02:07:36.549 --> 02:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
expert he uh did a DNA sequence of the
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
vaccines and accidentally found
 
02:07:42.790 --> 02:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
contamination um in the area of
 
02:07:46.109 --> 02:07:46.119 align:start position:0%
sequences that cause both oncogenesis so
 
02:07:46.119 --> 02:07:47.189 align:start position:0%
sequences that cause both oncogenesis so
cancer

02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
cancer
 
02:07:51.549 --> 02:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
promotion and uh tumor suppression
 
02:07:54.229 --> 02:07:54.239 align:start position:0%
so if you have a way to make cancers
 
02:07:56.510 --> 02:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
grow faster you got it and if you have a
 
02:07:58.830 --> 02:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
way to suppress your
 
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:01.880 align:start position:0%
ability for those tumors to grow you got
 
02:08:05.390 --> 02:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
that too um I I don't know that stuff
 
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
very well I try to shy away from it but
 
02:08:11.229 --> 02:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
what you need to know is it's there we
 
02:08:13.870 --> 02:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
know it's there now not to any degree of
 
02:08:16.870 --> 02:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
a small amount so your body is if you
 
02:08:19.350 --> 02:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
get the injections your B the MRNA
 
02:08:20.990 --> 02:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
injections your body is producing
 
02:08:23.950 --> 02:08:23.960 align:start position:0%
protein that we don't know what they are
 
02:08:26.910 --> 02:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
supposed to be the spike protein which
 
02:08:30.629 --> 02:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
is a glycoprotein right and it resembles
 
02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
stapo cacus and or toxin B which is a
 
02:08:34.790 --> 02:08:34.800 align:start position:0%
toxin it also then you hear oh it's
 
02:08:38.310 --> 02:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
snake venom okay it's not snake venom
 
02:08:41.870 --> 02:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
but it resembles the protein that is the
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
toxin that is in snake venom and box
 
02:08:45.910 --> 02:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
jellyfish and Portuguese manow waren
 
02:08:48.990 --> 02:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
scorpions and hopa um if you were to
 
02:08:52.510 --> 02:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
mandate hopter things oh hopter bees
 
02:08:55.510 --> 02:08:55.520 align:start position:0%
Hornets wasps and red fire ants or hopa
 
02:08:57.910 --> 02:08:57.920 align:start position:0%
okay let's just say Beast thingss about
 
02:08:59.750 --> 02:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
20 to 40 people die each year in the
 
02:09:01.270 --> 02:09:01.280 align:start position:0%
united in the United States from Beast
 
02:09:03.629 --> 02:09:03.639 align:start position:0%
stings if you were to mandate Beast
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
stings for everybody 20,000 people would
 
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
die in the United States from Beast
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
thingss so what you have is a death
 
02:09:13.709 --> 02:09:13.719 align:start position:0%
Lottery that you've mandated upon the
 
02:09:16.229 --> 02:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
people and so people say well I got it
 
02:09:19.510 --> 02:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
it didn't hurt me hey good luck to you
 
02:09:21.069 --> 02:09:21.079 align:start position:0%
you know put another put another chamber
 
02:09:24.350 --> 02:09:24.360 align:start position:0%
in the revolver put another uh bullet in
 
02:09:26.470 --> 02:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
the chamber in your revolver spin it now
 
02:09:29.069 --> 02:09:29.079 align:start position:0%
you get two in there oh three four five
 
02:09:30.750 --> 02:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
so if your chances are one in a thousand
 
02:09:32.109 --> 02:09:32.119 align:start position:0%
by the time you take your fifth one it's
 
02:09:34.750 --> 02:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
five in a thousand I'm not taking that
 
02:09:37.470 --> 02:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
chance it's a death Lottery that's
 
02:09:39.069 --> 02:09:39.079 align:start position:0%
another article I wrote moral calculus
 
02:09:40.390 --> 02:09:40.400 align:start position:0%
of a death Lottery if you want to see
 
02:09:42.589 --> 02:09:42.599 align:start position:0%
the deductive syllogism of of all that
 
02:09:45.790 --> 02:09:45.800 align:start position:0%
now so Kevin found the DNA it's in there
 
02:09:48.390 --> 02:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
and lastly I will say I I I talked about
 
02:09:53.589 --> 02:09:53.599 align:start position:0%
duties before um so don't take this the
 
02:09:55.950 --> 02:09:55.960 align:start position:0%
wrong way I mean I sat down with the
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney General John promela for 45
 
02:10:01.709 --> 02:10:01.719 align:start position:0%
minutes with um Representatives um urri
 
02:10:03.229 --> 02:10:03.239 align:start position:0%
paulov and Jason
 
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
Gard that was over a year ago and I
 
02:10:09.629 --> 02:10:09.639 align:start position:0%
reviewed even more uh New Hampshire
 
02:10:11.589 --> 02:10:11.599 align:start position:0%
people who died in Massachusetts
 
02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals that I had the records of they
 
02:10:15.669 --> 02:10:15.679 align:start position:0%
were they were they were surprised and
 
02:10:17.069 --> 02:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
uh when I say they I can't remember the
 
02:10:18.430 --> 02:10:18.440 align:start position:0%
gentleman's name but the criminal
 
02:10:19.549 --> 02:10:19.559 align:start position:0%
justice bureau
 
02:10:21.470 --> 02:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
chief uh they they were kind of of
 
02:10:22.870 --> 02:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
surprised at what I had where did you
 
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
get that I said I have them legally from
 
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I know it's a felony if I
 
02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
have them from direct directly from New
 
02:10:31.390 --> 02:10:31.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they were kind of almost
 
02:10:33.629 --> 02:10:33.639 align:start position:0%
disappointed I think but we had a we had
 
02:10:36.510 --> 02:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
a a good discussion um I got them to
 
02:10:38.149 --> 02:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
crack a smile a couple times and in the
 
02:10:41.390 --> 02:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
end uh um I said I even I even got this
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
guy to laugh and and they
 
02:10:47.149 --> 02:10:47.159 align:start position:0%
laughed and then I said and you've been
 
02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
given notice and you have a legal duty
 
02:10:50.669 --> 02:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
to act on information and belief that
 
02:10:52.950 --> 02:10:52.960 align:start position:0%
people are d in New Hampshire from from
 
02:10:54.589 --> 02:10:54.599 align:start position:0%
this you have a legal duty to
 
02:10:56.549 --> 02:10:56.559 align:start position:0%
investigate it I don't know what
 
02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
happened after that so I'm I'm going to
 
02:11:00.430 --> 02:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
and they walked me out and the smiles
 
02:11:04.790 --> 02:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
were gone by the way but um so you guys
 
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:07.360 align:start position:0%
have a duty to uh make a criminal
 
02:11:09.189 --> 02:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
referral once you digest this
 
02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
information I've told you about felonies
 
02:11:13.149 --> 02:11:13.159 align:start position:0%
that are occurring to New Hampshire
 
02:11:15.629 --> 02:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
citizens by the
 
02:11:19.709 --> 02:11:19.719 align:start position:0%
CDC that the HHS Homeland Security is
 
02:11:21.510 --> 02:11:21.520 align:start position:0%
not going to investigate they don't
 
02:11:23.830 --> 02:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
investigate their own do not rely on
 
02:11:26.189 --> 02:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
them you have a duty to the citizens of
 
02:11:28.109 --> 02:11:28.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire whom you
 
02:11:30.709 --> 02:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
represent so I I would I would say make
 
02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
a ask the uh attorney general to
 
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
petition district judge to immediately
 
02:11:38.430 --> 02:11:38.440 align:start position:0%
impanel a special grand jury with a
 
02:11:40.549 --> 02:11:40.559 align:start position:0%
special prosecutor special prosecutor
 
02:11:42.870 --> 02:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
you use your special prosecutor law if
 
02:11:44.589 --> 02:11:44.599 align:start position:0%
you want I will I will go through the
 
02:11:46.109 --> 02:11:46.119 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law to try to find that
 
02:11:48.950 --> 02:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
legal path for you to do so um I don't
 
02:11:50.669 --> 02:11:50.679 align:start position:0%
believe that you can wait to do your
 
02:11:52.390 --> 02:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
full invest investigation you now know
 
02:11:56.470 --> 02:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
of Crimes by the CDC and and the
 
02:11:58.870 --> 02:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
um uh us attorneys are not going to
 
02:12:00.870 --> 02:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
pursue this the doj is not going to
 
02:12:03.069 --> 02:12:03.079 align:start position:0%
pursue this they do not investigate
 
02:12:06.430 --> 02:12:06.440 align:start position:0%
their own and so we we cannot get to a
 
02:12:08.990 --> 02:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
Federal grand jury but states have their
 
02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
own grand
 
02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
juries and you know new New Hampshire n
 
02:12:15.470 --> 02:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
the grand jury law you have is is not
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
that great um the the Northwest and
 
02:12:20.189 --> 02:12:20.199 align:start position:0%
western states have better laws based on
 
02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
the way they were kind of set up and
 
02:12:24.189 --> 02:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
founded you know we have really old laws
 
02:12:27.189 --> 02:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
here that predate our constitution out
 
02:12:28.910 --> 02:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
west the district judges would come
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
around like once a year and so they have
 
02:12:34.390 --> 02:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
the ability to deputize people and they
 
02:12:35.750 --> 02:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
have Board of County Commissioners that
 
02:12:37.390 --> 02:12:37.400 align:start position:0%
have certain powers that we don't have
 
02:12:42.189 --> 02:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
here um but again so have them in
 
02:12:43.589 --> 02:12:43.599 align:start position:0%
investigate criminal matters that cause
 
02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
the deaths of thousands of New Hampshire
 
02:12:46.629 --> 02:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
residents and several hundred thousand
 
02:12:48.390 --> 02:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
Americans if not more than a million
 
02:12:51.189 --> 02:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
already so I I I'm Ending by saying
 
02:12:53.990 --> 02:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
please uh you have that
 
02:12:57.189 --> 02:12:57.199 align:start position:0%
Duty I hope you'll at least look into it
 
02:13:00.350 --> 02:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
um attorney generals and again I look at
 
02:13:02.750 --> 02:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
overall systems Behavior Uh informal
 
02:13:05.669 --> 02:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
informal political structures within
 
02:13:07.950 --> 02:13:07.960 align:start position:0%
organizations anyone who is an attorney
 
02:13:10.950 --> 02:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
general has accepted that position as a
 
02:13:14.109 --> 02:13:14.119 align:start position:0%
as a politician and that is their uh
 
02:13:14.119 --> 02:13:15.750 align:start position:0%
as a politician and that is their uh
career

02:13:15.750 --> 02:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
career
 
02:13:18.470 --> 02:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
choice any attorney general that even
 
02:13:20.549 --> 02:13:20.559 align:start position:0%
attempts to put together an
 
02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
investigation of Pharma is going to have
 
02:13:25.589 --> 02:13:25.599 align:start position:0%
the wrath of trillions of dollars
 
02:13:28.629 --> 02:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
against them and they will never work in
 
02:13:28.639 --> 02:13:29.669 align:start position:0%
against them and they will never work in
politics

02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
politics
 
02:13:32.950 --> 02:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
again and this goes for any Red State as
 
02:13:36.109 --> 02:13:36.119 align:start position:0%
red as you can get they they're they're
 
02:13:37.589 --> 02:13:37.599 align:start position:0%
afraid their entire career will be
 
02:13:42.229 --> 02:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
ruined so it takes um you need to box
 
02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
them in a corner and force them to
 
02:13:46.109 --> 02:13:46.119 align:start position:0%
impanel a grand jury petition the
 
02:13:48.030 --> 02:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
district judge make sure it's happened
 
02:13:49.549 --> 02:13:49.559 align:start position:0%
and you can't use a state attorney
 
02:13:51.109 --> 02:13:51.119 align:start position:0%
because State Attorneys are also on that
 
02:13:53.589 --> 02:13:53.599 align:start position:0%
career path that's why a special
 
02:13:55.950 --> 02:13:55.960 align:start position:0%
prosecutor is so important you bring in
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
somebody who's retired who cares about
 
02:14:00.189 --> 02:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire not his own
 
02:14:01.950 --> 02:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
job and I'm not saying anything bad
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
about all the New Hampshire State
 
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
Attorneys I'm just saying it's a fact
 
02:14:08.270 --> 02:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
that when when you're in that world you
 
02:14:10.589 --> 02:14:10.599 align:start position:0%
you you see things through a lens that
 
02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
is not necessarily for the people but
 
02:14:15.510 --> 02:14:15.520 align:start position:0%
for your career path and what's good for
 
02:14:19.069 --> 02:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
you and your family so um please attempt
 
02:14:21.750 --> 02:14:21.760 align:start position:0%
to do that and you know this a long time
 
02:14:22.910 --> 02:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
that you've heard me and I really
 
02:14:25.589 --> 02:14:25.599 align:start position:0%
appreciate it I think
 
02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
um it was it was tough I've got so much
 
02:14:30.430 --> 02:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
in my head and I speak for two sometimes
 
02:14:32.109 --> 02:14:32.119 align:start position:0%
four hours straight from memory I don't
 
02:14:34.750 --> 02:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
even need all the the the written words
 
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
um this is real and it has to be done at
 
02:14:40.549 --> 02:14:40.559 align:start position:0%
the state and County
 
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
levels and the federal government is
 
02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
killing your
 
02:14:47.750 --> 02:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
people and it's not an accident thank
 
02:14:50.669 --> 02:14:50.679 align:start position:0%
you very much for your time does anyone
 
02:14:53.030 --> 02:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
represent pres
 
02:14:56.189 --> 02:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
02:14:57.709 --> 02:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
very much for all your testimony this
 
02:14:59.870 --> 02:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
has been very uh
 
02:15:01.990 --> 02:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive um certainly can't make
 
02:15:03.310 --> 02:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
any promises as to what we're going to
 
02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
do or what our report will contain but
 
02:15:07.470 --> 02:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
we will certainly look at all of these
 
02:15:11.310 --> 02:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
things and consider them all um I would
 
02:15:12.750 --> 02:15:12.760 align:start position:0%
like to take a moment if if it's
 
02:15:15.310 --> 02:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
allowable to speak to uh the committee
 
02:15:18.390 --> 02:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
and to the public at large um because
 
02:15:19.950 --> 02:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
we've just heard a lot of things and I
 
02:15:22.270 --> 02:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
think from my personal perspective I
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
think some things are are fairly likely
 
02:15:25.950 --> 02:15:25.960 align:start position:0%
I think other ones may be a little less
 
02:15:27.910 --> 02:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
likely I'd like to look at them all a
 
02:15:29.950 --> 02:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
little bit more myself but I do want to
 
02:15:32.950 --> 02:15:32.960 align:start position:0%
just because I'm sure people heard both
 
02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
here and at home things today that are
 
02:15:36.069 --> 02:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
going to challenge them a little bit
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
maybe they've heard it for the first
 
02:15:40.390 --> 02:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
time maybe these things even sound a
 
02:15:44.350 --> 02:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
little bit outlandish to them um so I'd
 
02:15:46.790 --> 02:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
like to tell you just for a moment about
 
02:15:51.270 --> 02:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
about a personal experience of mine um
 
02:15:52.830 --> 02:15:52.840 align:start position:0%
and I can't speak to everything that
 
02:15:53.790 --> 02:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
we've just
 
02:15:56.870 --> 02:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
heard uh but I I did receive a single
 
02:15:59.430 --> 02:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
dose of an mRNA
 
02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:01.750 align:start position:0%
dose of an mRNA
vaccine

02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
02:16:04.790 --> 02:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
um I was a little skeptical at the time
 
02:16:06.629 --> 02:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
so I went to the process of being tested
 
02:16:08.350 --> 02:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
for antibodies to make sure that I
 
02:16:10.069 --> 02:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
hadn't actually had covid before I
 
02:16:11.709 --> 02:16:11.719 align:start position:0%
received it I didn't so I went forward I
 
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
received the single
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
dose um within 12 hours I was extremely
 
02:16:20.030 --> 02:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
sick within 24 to 48 hours I had severe
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
hypertension roughly 180 over
 
02:16:26.189 --> 02:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
110 increased heart rate I developed
 
02:16:28.990 --> 02:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
neurological problems a severe headache
 
02:16:31.390 --> 02:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
I was hospitalized for the better part
 
02:16:34.070 --> 02:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
of a week where I nearly died I was
 
02:16:37.870 --> 02:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
treated with Hein because I was
 
02:16:40.589 --> 02:16:40.599 align:start position:0%
clotting I developed autoimmune issues I
 
02:16:42.990 --> 02:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
developed disautonomia I developed heart
 
02:16:45.469 --> 02:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
problems migraines and seizures among
 
02:16:47.709 --> 02:16:47.719 align:start position:0%
other things that's not merely my
 
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
opinion that is the opinion of the
 
02:16:50.950 --> 02:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
Physicians who have been treating me
 
02:16:50.960 --> 02:16:52.750 align:start position:0%
Physicians who have been treating me
since

02:16:52.750 --> 02:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
since
 
02:16:56.709 --> 02:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
2021 now uh this is not as positive for
 
02:16:58.669 --> 02:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
the rates of these sort of things
 
02:17:00.150 --> 02:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
happening but I just want people to
 
02:17:01.389 --> 02:17:01.399 align:start position:0%
understand that some of the things we've
 
02:17:04.110 --> 02:17:04.120 align:start position:0%
heard today I can verify they're real
 
02:17:08.589 --> 02:17:08.599 align:start position:0%
and they have happened to some people at
 
02:17:10.790 --> 02:17:10.800 align:start position:0%
least I can say that when I was
 
02:17:13.709 --> 02:17:13.719 align:start position:0%
diagnosed originally um there was an odd
 
02:17:15.509 --> 02:17:15.519 align:start position:0%
thing that happened my neurologist went
 
02:17:17.389 --> 02:17:17.399 align:start position:0%
to enter the diagnostic code and
 
02:17:19.790 --> 02:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
discovered that despite for many
 
02:17:21.230 --> 02:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
vaccines they're being specific
 
02:17:24.309 --> 02:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
diagnostic codes for a vaccine related
 
02:17:26.389 --> 02:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
injury or illness for covid vaccine
 
02:17:27.509 --> 02:17:27.519 align:start position:0%
there was no
 
02:17:30.549 --> 02:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
code it had to be a generic entry for a
 
02:17:33.190 --> 02:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
generic vaccine injury or
 
02:17:35.509 --> 02:17:35.519 align:start position:0%
illness so that's going to provide a
 
02:17:37.070 --> 02:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
complication I think for us moving
 
02:17:38.589 --> 02:17:38.599 align:start position:0%
forward in our investigation to try to
 
02:17:41.429 --> 02:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
determine the frequency of some of these
 
02:17:41.439 --> 02:17:43.110 align:start position:0%
determine the frequency of some of these
things

02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
um and the other thing I would say is
 
02:17:47.589 --> 02:17:47.599 align:start position:0%
we've already read into the record in
 
02:17:49.230 --> 02:17:49.240 align:start position:0%
this committee and they are our record
 
02:17:52.270 --> 02:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
people can access that uh some issues
 
02:17:54.709 --> 02:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
that have been well documented via major
 
02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
studies in prominent journals that
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
include uh the Journal of nature mRNA
 
02:18:01.990 --> 02:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
frame shifting producing random proteins
 
02:18:04.629 --> 02:18:04.639 align:start position:0%
in a large percentage of cases DNA
 
02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
contamination particle contamination
 
02:18:09.429 --> 02:18:09.439 align:start position:0%
issues with the libid nanop particles
 
02:18:13.110 --> 02:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
mRNA uh located systemically in the body
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
not merely
 
02:18:17.509 --> 02:18:17.519 align:start position:0%
locally uh reverse transcription of mRNA
 
02:18:20.309 --> 02:18:20.319 align:start position:0%
in liver cells Health signals for heart
 
02:18:22.150 --> 02:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
problems neurological problems as well
 
02:18:25.549 --> 02:18:25.559 align:start position:0%
as igg4 production uh uh leading to
 
02:18:28.990 --> 02:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
immune deficiency in some people um so
 
02:18:31.110 --> 02:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
again I can't this is not just positive
 
02:18:33.309 --> 02:18:33.319 align:start position:0%
for frequency I just want the people at
 
02:18:34.910 --> 02:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
home and and elsewhere to understand
 
02:18:36.750 --> 02:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
that though we've heard some things that
 
02:18:38.629 --> 02:18:38.639 align:start position:0%
might uh challenge you today I can
 
02:18:41.830 --> 02:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
verify that at least some of this has
 
02:18:45.629 --> 02:18:45.639 align:start position:0%
happened in some frequency so I'd like I
 
02:18:46.910 --> 02:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
I hope we will continue to look into
 
02:18:49.030 --> 02:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
that and thank
 
02:18:52.950 --> 02:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:55.549 --> 02:18:55.559 align:start position:0%
I just I have a question about one of
 
02:18:58.110 --> 02:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
your graphs I'm
 
02:19:00.389 --> 02:19:00.399 align:start position:0%
just in the
 
02:19:03.870 --> 02:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
um first page of graphs that you gave us
 
02:19:07.270 --> 02:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
of the individual sheets and you were
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
pointing out the great increases in
 
02:19:13.349 --> 02:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
2021 but I noticed that for clots and
 
02:19:15.830 --> 02:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
brains the increases in
 
02:19:19.030 --> 02:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
2022 and I'm just wondering if you had
 
02:19:23.309 --> 02:19:23.319 align:start position:0%
any information as to why that might
 
02:19:26.790 --> 02:19:26.800 align:start position:0%
be you know a lot of these are just my
 
02:19:28.669 --> 02:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
guesses and I don't like to do that in
 
02:19:31.509 --> 02:19:31.519 align:start position:0%
testimony you know is it the third shot
 
02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
is it the you
 
02:19:35.790 --> 02:19:35.800 align:start position:0%
know I I I put
 
02:19:38.429 --> 02:19:38.439 align:start position:0%
forth theories I've been told I Was
 
02:19:40.309 --> 02:19:40.319 align:start position:0%
Wrong by doctors and six months later
 
02:19:41.910 --> 02:19:41.920 align:start position:0%
they come later they come back and say
 
02:19:43.469 --> 02:19:43.479 align:start position:0%
oh you were right like I said there's a
 
02:19:45.910 --> 02:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
pH imbalance in the blood John there
 
02:19:47.389 --> 02:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
there's there's nothing wrong with it
 
02:19:48.750 --> 02:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
that that's not happening six months
 
02:19:50.990 --> 02:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
later a paper comes out this pH
 
02:19:52.710 --> 02:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
imbalance in the blood and why did I say
 
02:19:54.670 --> 02:19:54.680 align:start position:0%
that because I had the death
 
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
certificates in which there were a lot
 
02:19:58.230 --> 02:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
of blood and blood forming everything
 
02:20:01.349 --> 02:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
changed now in my presentation I say so
 
02:20:03.190 --> 02:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
respiratory excess deaths occurred in
 
02:20:05.790 --> 02:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
2020 this is Massachusetts okay it's
 
02:20:07.270 --> 02:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
different for different places New
 
02:20:08.309 --> 02:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is very different from
 
02:20:10.110 --> 02:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I believe that your people
 
02:20:12.510 --> 02:20:12.520 align:start position:0%
were more honest in filling out death
 
02:20:15.790 --> 02:20:15.800 align:start position:0%
certificates I really believe that
 
02:20:18.910 --> 02:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
um so respiratory in 2020 it shifted to
 
02:20:22.230 --> 02:20:22.240 align:start position:0%
circulatory and blood in 2021 and then
 
02:20:25.030 --> 02:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
you have acute problems like you know
 
02:20:27.830 --> 02:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
endothelial scoring uh through apoptosis
 
02:20:30.190 --> 02:20:30.200 align:start position:0%
by transection and then you have t- cell
 
02:20:32.950 --> 02:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
attack of parts of your endothelium so
 
02:20:34.790 --> 02:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
if you take a direct vein injection like
 
02:20:37.550 --> 02:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
Mark jiro's ballis Theory
 
02:20:41.070 --> 02:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
um it there's a chance maybe 150 maybe
 
02:20:42.990 --> 02:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
200 we don't know but it's it's in that
 
02:20:44.790 --> 02:20:44.800 align:start position:0%
range uh if the tip of the needle is
 
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
near a vein you're going to take a a
 
02:20:48.070 --> 02:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
vein hit where the blood is returning
 
02:20:49.870 --> 02:20:49.880 align:start position:0%
right so it's returning but you take a
 
02:20:51.469 --> 02:20:51.479 align:start position:0%
whole bunch all at once and it goes to
 
02:20:54.190 --> 02:20:54.200 align:start position:0%
like one place and through fluid
 
02:20:57.510 --> 02:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
dynamics I think that they tend to
 
02:20:59.710 --> 02:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
aggregate where um when when you get to
 
02:21:01.590 --> 02:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
the edge of something where fluid flows
 
02:21:04.389 --> 02:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
through it slows down so that the
 
02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
theoretically the air at your windshield
 
02:21:09.349 --> 02:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
is not moving but it gets compressed but
 
02:21:10.710 --> 02:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
there's certain molecules that are just
 
02:21:13.270 --> 02:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
sitting there right um and if it all
 
02:21:16.150 --> 02:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
gets all all that mRNA goes to one
 
02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
place that's where I believe the aortic
 
02:21:21.070 --> 02:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
dissections are occurring and um you get
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
a whole balloon threeyear aorta why I
 
02:21:27.270 --> 02:21:27.280 align:start position:0%
mean is that normal no no people
 
02:21:30.469 --> 02:21:30.479 align:start position:0%
have problems excuse me people have
 
02:21:32.750 --> 02:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
problems for a long time that then
 
02:21:34.830 --> 02:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
manifest in an aortic dissection they
 
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
don't just get a shot and then you know
 
02:21:40.150 --> 02:21:40.160 align:start position:0%
a week later they're dead like um like
 
02:21:42.750 --> 02:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
Victor s you know he's from New York
 
02:21:44.910 --> 02:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
moved to Washington he's in here you
 
02:21:46.950 --> 02:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
read his about the aortic aortic
 
02:21:49.110 --> 02:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
dissection and you look in the Minnesota
 
02:21:51.389 --> 02:21:51.399 align:start position:0%
data aortic dissection
 
02:21:52.750 --> 02:21:52.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm sorry I'm not answering your
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
question I I just don't don't know how
 
02:21:58.070 --> 02:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
to answer it but that's fine thank
 
02:21:58.080 --> 02:21:59.950 align:start position:0%
to answer it but that's fine thank
youle

02:21:59.950 --> 02:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
youle
 
02:22:03.150 --> 02:22:03.160 align:start position:0%
off thank you Madame chair and thank you
 
02:22:05.469 --> 02:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
for presenting it and taking my question
 
02:22:10.349 --> 02:22:10.359 align:start position:0%
so you talk about different uh risk
 
02:22:14.550 --> 02:22:14.560 align:start position:0%
factors that uh looks like they contri
 
02:22:17.230 --> 02:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
contributed to that excessive death that
 
02:22:19.790 --> 02:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
we are seen you talked about lack of
 
02:22:22.429 --> 02:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
care you talked about ventilators you
 
02:22:25.630 --> 02:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
talked about covid vaccines and you
 
02:22:29.550 --> 02:22:29.560 align:start position:0%
talked about vular REM and we already
 
02:22:33.790 --> 02:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
heard about most of it but you also
 
02:22:36.670 --> 02:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned when commits in so I just
 
02:22:39.110 --> 02:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
wonder if you can follow up and later
 
02:22:41.670 --> 02:22:41.680 align:start position:0%
send us send the committee some
 
02:22:46.469 --> 02:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
documents about when Comm and uh if the
 
02:22:49.469 --> 02:22:49.479 align:start position:0%
what are concerns about the drug what
 
02:22:53.429 --> 02:22:53.439 align:start position:0%
are side effects uh from Van possible
 
02:22:57.750 --> 02:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
yeah it's uh representative paulov vany
 
02:23:02.070 --> 02:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
is is pretty commonly used um and and
 
02:23:04.910 --> 02:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
it's known that in overdose situations
 
02:23:06.510 --> 02:23:06.520 align:start position:0%
it causes kidney failure there's plenty
 
02:23:08.230 --> 02:23:08.240 align:start position:0%
of papers on it I I can't provide you
 
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
any more than you could do by just
 
02:23:11.630 --> 02:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
typing it in Duck
 
02:23:13.790 --> 02:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
ducko rather than that other search
 
02:23:16.790 --> 02:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
company that is against the
 
02:23:19.309 --> 02:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
people so and you you'd probably know
 
02:23:23.349 --> 02:23:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
would represent beler and then represent
 
02:23:28.070 --> 02:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
leus thank you madam chair and I was
 
02:23:29.190 --> 02:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
going to wait a little later on this but
 
02:23:32.110 --> 02:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
I'd like to just quickly read one item
 
02:23:34.269 --> 02:23:34.279 align:start position:0%
into the record which I will provide a
 
02:23:38.309 --> 02:23:38.319 align:start position:0%
bit later um study available from the uh
 
02:23:42.790 --> 02:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
NIH website from December 2022 titled to
 
02:23:44.710 --> 02:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
aspirate or to not aspirate
 
02:23:46.750 --> 02:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
considerations for covid-19 vaccines in
 
02:23:49.150 --> 02:23:49.160 align:start position:0%
which the abstract goes on to explain
 
02:23:51.910 --> 02:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
that despite it being um common practice
 
02:23:54.309 --> 02:23:54.319 align:start position:0%
for a very long time it was not
 
02:23:56.910 --> 02:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
recommended that aspiration occur with
 
02:24:00.349 --> 02:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccination for some reason and
 
02:24:02.309 --> 02:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
to describe what that is uh when you
 
02:24:04.870 --> 02:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
when you do an intramuscular injection
 
02:24:06.910 --> 02:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
they you're trying well you're trying to
 
02:24:09.150 --> 02:24:09.160 align:start position:0%
put it the drug into the musculature
 
02:24:11.070 --> 02:24:11.080 align:start position:0%
which is where it's then supposed to
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
remain for the most part but obviously
 
02:24:15.269 --> 02:24:15.279 align:start position:0%
within your body there's not just muscle
 
02:24:17.110 --> 02:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
even within the muscular there are veins
 
02:24:18.269 --> 02:24:18.279 align:start position:0%
and there are arteries there's actually
 
02:24:20.070 --> 02:24:20.080 align:start position:0%
a loop that goes around the the tip of
 
02:24:20.990 --> 02:24:21.000 align:start position:0%
the hum
 
02:24:23.790 --> 02:24:23.800 align:start position:0%
that's an artery that can be hit um so
 
02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
typically when you're trained to
 
02:24:27.230 --> 02:24:27.240 align:start position:0%
administer an intramuscular vaccine you
 
02:24:30.070 --> 02:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
insert the needle and then you pull back
 
02:24:32.070 --> 02:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
on the plunger which is aspiration to
 
02:24:34.150 --> 02:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
see if you get blood which would
 
02:24:35.790 --> 02:24:35.800 align:start position:0%
indicate you're in a blood vessel rather
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
than a muscle uh again the study goes on
 
02:24:41.349 --> 02:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
to explain that this was not recommended
 
02:24:43.429 --> 02:24:43.439 align:start position:0%
for the covid-19 vaccine so that's
 
02:24:44.950 --> 02:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
another angle that we'll probably want
 
02:24:47.389 --> 02:24:47.399 align:start position:0%
to take a look at thank
 
02:24:51.590 --> 02:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
you may I comment on that sure okay so
 
02:24:53.710 --> 02:24:53.720 align:start position:0%
the CDC puts out the pink
 
02:24:56.750 --> 02:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
book it's about what he just said and it
 
02:24:58.790 --> 02:24:58.800 align:start position:0%
was put out uh by two
 
02:25:01.269 --> 02:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
nurses and in the pink book they say Do
 
02:25:04.309 --> 02:25:04.319 align:start position:0%
not aspirate because needle wiggle may
 
02:25:04.319 --> 02:25:06.110 align:start position:0%
not aspirate because needle wiggle may
cause

02:25:06.110 --> 02:25:06.120 align:start position:0%
cause
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
discomfort they further say in the
 
02:25:10.110 --> 02:25:10.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph that they have no scientific
 
02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
basis for this they just feel that the
 
02:25:15.190 --> 02:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
patient would be more comfortable if
 
02:25:17.190 --> 02:25:17.200 align:start position:0%
you inject
 
02:25:19.870 --> 02:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
quickly not not not just not aspirate
 
02:25:22.510 --> 02:25:22.520 align:start position:0%
but also inject quickly which another
 
02:25:25.710 --> 02:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
thing like Mark jirau says inject very
 
02:25:27.550 --> 02:25:27.560 align:start position:0%
slowly and you'll have a lot less lot
 
02:25:30.750 --> 02:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
fewer people dying so where did that
 
02:25:33.190 --> 02:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
come from it came look look up the pink
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
book if you buy my book you just look at
 
02:25:38.790 --> 02:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
the references and it's in there um and
 
02:25:40.630 --> 02:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
that's online under the CDC that's where
 
02:25:43.590 --> 02:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
that came from and there's no scientific
 
02:25:46.389 --> 02:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
basis for not doing what was custom and
 
02:25:48.750 --> 02:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
practice prior to co so they're killing
 
02:25:51.429 --> 02:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of people simply by ball injection
 
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't even mean matter if it's
 
02:25:55.269 --> 02:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
the covid vaccine that if you do that
 
02:25:56.710 --> 02:25:56.720 align:start position:0%
with the flu vaccine or any others
 
02:25:58.950 --> 02:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see deaths rise you'll see
 
02:26:01.309 --> 02:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
anything that transfects cells anything
 
02:26:03.630 --> 02:26:03.640 align:start position:0%
that's going to be you know you're
 
02:26:05.630 --> 02:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
bypassing your mucosal defenses how do
 
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
things get in your body you put them in
 
02:26:08.469 --> 02:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
your body or you're taking it in through
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
the air your lungs have very strong
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
mucosal defenses you're bypassing that
 
02:26:14.790 --> 02:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
by going directly into your body with an
 
02:26:16.830 --> 02:26:16.840 align:start position:0%
injection of stuff you don't even know
 
02:26:18.830 --> 02:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
what it is with the manufacturing
 
02:26:21.230 --> 02:26:21.240 align:start position:0%
controls that are so terrible as there
 
02:26:23.190 --> 02:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
contamination but one one other thing I
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention um with some of the
 
02:26:27.790 --> 02:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
smaller ones when you do aspirate you
 
02:26:29.230 --> 02:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
have immediate
 
02:26:32.710 --> 02:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
Collapse by through the the D the
 
02:26:34.790 --> 02:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
physics of it and because you collapse
 
02:26:36.190 --> 02:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
it it pulls it through the other side
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
now you're out you're not in the vein
 
02:26:41.230 --> 02:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
anymore either so aspiration alone uh
 
02:26:43.110 --> 02:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
isn't foolproof but it's it's another
 
02:26:45.110 --> 02:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
measure that helps so yeah I'm really
 
02:26:48.670 --> 02:26:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:51.070 --> 02:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
thanks yes
 
02:26:52.550 --> 02:26:52.560 align:start position:0%
going back
 
02:26:54.389 --> 02:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
um to
 
02:26:56.670 --> 02:26:56.680 align:start position:0%
earlier and you had commented that there
 
02:26:58.790 --> 02:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
was enough information within months to
 
02:27:01.910 --> 02:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
shut down shut down the whole process
 
02:27:05.429 --> 02:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
from the um deaths that
 
02:27:08.150 --> 02:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
happened same day you know 11 deaths you
 
02:27:10.510 --> 02:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
said happen the same day so I'm
 
02:27:13.190 --> 02:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
wondering what is
 
02:27:18.230 --> 02:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:23.670 --> 02:27:23.680 align:start position:0%
comparison J okay so um that comment was
 
02:27:25.510 --> 02:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
in the context of looking at vs the
 
02:27:27.110 --> 02:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine adverse event reporting system
 
02:27:29.950 --> 02:27:29.960 align:start position:0%
which was put in place for it it was to
 
02:27:33.349 --> 02:27:33.359 align:start position:0%
appease the antix crowd years
 
02:27:35.710 --> 02:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
ago I think it's a terrible system but
 
02:27:38.870 --> 02:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's what we have and as bad as it is
 
02:27:41.389 --> 02:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
the signal and I say the signal right so
 
02:27:45.030 --> 02:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
what is normal um the problem with
 
02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
saying oh all these things are now in in
 
02:27:49.870 --> 02:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
bears that are so much more than before
 
02:27:49.880 --> 02:27:50.670 align:start position:0%
bears that are so much more than before
the

02:27:50.670 --> 02:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:27:52.830 --> 02:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
my easy counterargument was yeah people
 
02:27:54.790 --> 02:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
are a lot more aware aware of this
 
02:27:56.990 --> 02:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
vaccine and so they're going crazy
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
making Bears reports where they didn't
 
02:28:00.910 --> 02:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
make reports before you you can always
 
02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
come up with an excuse one side versus
 
02:28:04.990 --> 02:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
the other but when you look at the
 
02:28:06.910 --> 02:28:06.920 align:start position:0%
number of deaths and and so what I did
 
02:28:09.070 --> 02:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
is I went in and I correlated the death
 
02:28:10.870 --> 02:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
certificates to the vers report so I
 
02:28:14.389 --> 02:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
know the person actually died it's not a
 
02:28:17.670 --> 02:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
BS Report these people really died and I
 
02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
got their injection dates and I know
 
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
what they died from they didn't die from
 
02:28:23.550 --> 02:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
pneumonia they didn't die from covid
 
02:28:25.190 --> 02:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
they died from a pulmonary embolism they
 
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
died from throm cytopenia post
 
02:28:30.389 --> 02:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
hemorrhagic anemia did you see the PO go
 
02:28:32.110 --> 02:28:32.120 align:start position:0%
when you're done just remember post
 
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
hemorrhagic anemia take a look at that
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
one now Cardiac
 
02:28:41.030 --> 02:28:41.040 align:start position:0%
Arrest writing the paper on it now um
 
02:28:43.870 --> 02:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
there's a major bug in the entire CDC
 
02:28:48.309 --> 02:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
excuse me wh system and the CDC of how
 
02:28:50.990 --> 02:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
to categorize cardiac arrest uh I I
 
02:28:53.070 --> 02:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
don't have time to explain it right now
 
02:28:56.710 --> 02:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
but the entire system is is messed up um
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
so you have scientific papers being
 
02:29:01.110 --> 02:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
written on data that's it's not
 
02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
fraudulent it's it's errant it lacks
 
02:29:06.190 --> 02:29:06.200 align:start position:0%
integrity and understanding of what a
 
02:29:08.269 --> 02:29:08.279 align:start position:0%
cardiac arrest is you know what Cardiac
 
02:29:11.710 --> 02:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
Arrest means think of the word the heart
 
02:29:14.510 --> 02:29:14.520 align:start position:0%
stopped okay the guy got covid then he
 
02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
got pneumonia then he died of
 
02:29:17.830 --> 02:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
cardiopulmonary arrest and it gets
 
02:29:21.230 --> 02:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
listed as heart disease it doesn't it
 
02:29:23.590 --> 02:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
and it's 16 to
 
02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
19% of all deaths in Massachusetts have
 
02:29:31.309 --> 02:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:34.830 --> 02:29:34.840 align:start position:0%

02:37:24.230 --> 02:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
um if I could get everyone to take their
 
02:37:29.950 --> 02:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
seat uh so we can uh break for lunch
 
02:37:36.309 --> 02:37:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:39.230 --> 02:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
beler uh representative H off you wanted
 
02:37:40.990 --> 02:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
to uh introduce something into the
 
02:37:44.030 --> 02:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
record yeah yeah yes there's a like uh F
 
02:37:46.950 --> 02:37:46.960 align:start position:0%
five uh five pages I want to introduce
 
02:37:50.750 --> 02:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
to record so um in previous session we
 
02:37:54.910 --> 02:37:54.920 align:start position:0%
heard a lot that um from specialist that
 
02:38:00.630 --> 02:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
kids are not uh the target vulnerable
 
02:38:02.950 --> 02:38:02.960 align:start position:0%
population for covid and those measures
 
02:38:05.830 --> 02:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
are misapplied when applied for kids but
 
02:38:09.030 --> 02:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
is there any data to back it up so I
 
02:38:12.550 --> 02:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
looked it up and that's what I found so
 
02:38:17.309 --> 02:38:17.319 align:start position:0%
if you go an hdhhs visit data on minor
 
02:38:23.469 --> 02:38:23.479 align:start position:0%
covid death uh 2020 2024 ages 0 to9 you
 
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
will find that for all this Co years
 
02:38:29.590 --> 02:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
there's only a single death for that
 
02:38:31.950 --> 02:38:31.960 align:start position:0%
population on the other side of that
 
02:38:36.230 --> 02:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
paper ages 10 to 19 uh how
 
02:38:39.870 --> 02:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
many uh New Hampshire uh residents in
 
02:38:45.910 --> 02:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
that age died from covid zero zero so in
 
02:38:49.910 --> 02:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
total under 19 years old uh only only
 
02:38:52.790 --> 02:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
only single Des
 
02:38:55.710 --> 02:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
documented uh and if you go to the next
 
02:38:59.710 --> 02:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
one uh name is CDC whiskers New
 
02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire caes of this
 
02:39:07.110 --> 02:39:07.120 align:start position:0%
data uh so uh it's a little bit small
 
02:39:10.030 --> 02:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
font so if you turn it around uh I
 
02:39:14.990 --> 02:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
multip uh there's a better view of Ages
 
02:39:19.790 --> 02:39:19.800 align:start position:0%
1 to 4 and you can see uh number four uh
 
02:39:24.269 --> 02:39:24.279 align:start position:0%
cause of death for that ages uh
 
02:39:30.030 --> 02:39:30.040 align:start position:0%
for uh uh is uh uh pretty long it's
 
02:39:34.110 --> 02:39:34.120 align:start position:0%
combination of covid-19 diabetes melus
 
02:39:36.870 --> 02:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
heart disease influenza pneumonia and
 
02:39:39.790 --> 02:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
septicemia and why this specific
 
02:39:43.070 --> 02:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
combination as as you saw in previous
 
02:39:45.710 --> 02:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
document it's because there was only one
 
02:39:48.750 --> 02:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
case and that one case uh was actually
 
02:39:50.750 --> 02:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
specific New Hampshire resident that was
 
02:39:52.670 --> 02:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
already dying from diabetes heart
 
02:39:56.830 --> 02:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
disease flu Etc but also was tested
 
02:40:01.630 --> 02:40:01.640 align:start position:0%
positive for Co So Co listed as a
 
02:40:05.910 --> 02:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
primary uh death and as that person died
 
02:40:09.910 --> 02:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
not in New Hampshire hospital but
 
02:40:13.710 --> 02:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
outside and you you heard from previous
 
02:40:16.870 --> 02:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
presenter that that might be the reason
 
02:40:21.110 --> 02:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
why Co and not for example diabetes was
 
02:40:25.790 --> 02:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
listed because those states are not as
 
02:40:25.800 --> 02:40:27.070 align:start position:0%
listed because those states are not as
uh

02:40:27.070 --> 02:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:40:30.830 --> 02:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
accurate and kind of overstated number
 
02:40:33.870 --> 02:40:33.880 align:start position:0%
of deaths but even with that like so for
 
02:40:37.269 --> 02:40:37.279 align:start position:0%
all this years there's only a single kid
 
02:40:41.469 --> 02:40:41.479 align:start position:0%
who died from covid official data from
 
02:40:43.230 --> 02:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
CDC and
 
02:40:47.590 --> 02:40:47.600 align:start position:0%
DHHS and uh and uh that that picture was
 
02:40:51.550 --> 02:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
combined not by some republ an it's bami
 
02:40:56.429 --> 02:40:56.439 align:start position:0%
uh pretty ultr left organization so it's
 
02:41:00.550 --> 02:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's a nonpartisan agreement that
 
02:41:04.750 --> 02:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
that's what happened and the last one is
 
02:41:09.630 --> 02:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
U uh query from uh virus the vaccine
 
02:41:13.150 --> 02:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
adverse event Reporting System results
 
02:41:18.349 --> 02:41:18.359 align:start position:0%
uh so I query several age ranges for New
 
02:41:19.790 --> 02:41:19.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident
 
02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:21.710 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident
under

02:41:21.710 --> 02:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:41:25.469 --> 02:41:25.479 align:start position:0%
17 uh up to 18 years
 
02:41:29.230 --> 02:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh and
 
02:41:33.070 --> 02:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
uh and uh those of them who died so you
 
02:41:36.590 --> 02:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
can see that there are uh four four New
 
02:41:40.790 --> 02:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents uh and uh multiple
 
02:41:45.070 --> 02:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
awful symptoms that went after they took
 
02:41:48.510 --> 02:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
covid-19 vaccines uh for those people
 
02:41:52.710 --> 02:41:52.720 align:start position:0%
and uh being on house Health uh Human
 
02:41:54.830 --> 02:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
Services and elderly Affairs committee
 
02:41:58.550 --> 02:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
everyone on our committee knows that
 
02:42:02.469 --> 02:42:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh the number of reports the reports to
 
02:42:04.910 --> 02:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
virus database are severely under
 
02:42:08.590 --> 02:42:08.600 align:start position:0%
reported many many injuries and deaths
 
02:42:11.710 --> 02:42:11.720 align:start position:0%
don't end up being here so but even with
 
02:42:14.389 --> 02:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
that we see
 
02:42:17.630 --> 02:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
that in New
 
02:42:20.190 --> 02:42:20.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire not the single otherwise
 
02:42:24.150 --> 02:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
healthy kid died from covid but a number
 
02:42:28.950 --> 02:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
of kid died uh after receiving covid-19
 
02:42:32.230 --> 02:42:32.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine and I think it's very concerning
 
02:42:35.830 --> 02:42:35.840 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you represent POA uh
 
02:42:38.670 --> 02:42:38.680 align:start position:0%
we'll get that into the record um uh to
 
02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
continue our discussion from earlier
 
02:42:43.910 --> 02:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
today discuss some uh questions that we
 
02:42:47.309 --> 02:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
have and
 
02:42:50.910 --> 02:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
uh what we want for this committee I'd
 
02:42:53.150 --> 02:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
like to continue that discussion does
 
02:42:56.590 --> 02:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
anyone have anything specific represent
 
02:42:59.670 --> 02:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
evil thank you madam chair I was sort of
 
02:43:02.469 --> 02:43:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh thinking about the federal funds
 
02:43:05.830 --> 02:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
issue in particular and I just made some
 
02:43:10.830 --> 02:43:10.840 align:start position:0%
notes um maybe we could get a timeline
 
02:43:13.630 --> 02:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
like we have for the covid vaccine roll
 
02:43:16.510 --> 02:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
out for the federal funds
 
02:43:19.469 --> 02:43:19.479 align:start position:0%
identify um where they were coming from
 
02:43:22.630 --> 02:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
and and how they started to be
 
02:43:25.550 --> 02:43:25.560 align:start position:0%
distributed maybe zero in on the amount
 
02:43:28.230 --> 02:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
of money the process of distrib
 
02:43:31.110 --> 02:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
distribution to whom it was distributed
 
02:43:34.510 --> 02:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
and and whether uh or how the use of the
 
02:43:38.510 --> 02:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
funds was was tracked and then maybe if
 
02:43:43.070 --> 02:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
there's some uh measures of success so I
 
02:43:45.790 --> 02:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
think that uh maybe Taylor Caswell can
 
02:43:49.349 --> 02:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
help us with that and then I know that
 
02:43:51.750 --> 02:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
there is on some State websites a
 
02:43:53.389 --> 02:43:53.399 align:start position:0%
listing of how the funds were
 
02:43:55.110 --> 02:43:55.120 align:start position:0%
distributed so I don't think that should
 
02:43:58.830 --> 02:43:58.840 align:start position:0%
take a lot of extra accounting from him
 
02:44:01.550 --> 02:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
and then we could sort of look at the
 
02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
federal funds that were used for health
 
02:44:07.510 --> 02:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
orientation kind of a thing and then I
 
02:44:10.790 --> 02:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
know many funds were used for for
 
02:44:13.510 --> 02:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so I don't know how other
 
02:44:16.630 --> 02:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
people feel about that but that seemed
 
02:44:19.349 --> 02:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
like if we were going to uh talk to
 
02:44:21.429 --> 02:44:21.439 align:start position:0%
Taylor Caswell that might be a way of
 
02:44:23.670 --> 02:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
focusing the discussion I I think that's
 
02:44:25.389 --> 02:44:25.399 align:start position:0%
a great idea and I like the idea of
 
02:44:28.750 --> 02:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
focusing on on the successes um I think
 
02:44:32.070 --> 02:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
it's important uh that not only we find
 
02:44:33.670 --> 02:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
what the issues are but we really need
 
02:44:35.590 --> 02:44:35.600 align:start position:0%
to find out what we did well in New
 
02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:38.190 align:start position:0%
to find out what we did well in New
Hampshire

02:44:38.190 --> 02:44:38.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
02:44:42.230 --> 02:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
um because I think like and even uh our
 
02:44:45.550 --> 02:44:45.560 align:start position:0%
former speaker said that New Hampshire
 
02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
got he thought we got some of the things
 
02:44:50.230 --> 02:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
right um
 
02:44:54.670 --> 02:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
and uh you know so I think that we need
 
02:44:57.070 --> 02:44:57.080 align:start position:0%
you know we didn't follow everything
 
02:44:59.590 --> 02:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
that every other state did and I think
 
02:45:03.070 --> 02:45:03.080 align:start position:0%
that's a plus for us and so I think also
 
02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
looking at our successes to see what we
 
02:45:07.150 --> 02:45:07.160 align:start position:0%
did right is also important to highlight
 
02:45:10.269 --> 02:45:10.279 align:start position:0%
in the in the report um so I don't know
 
02:45:12.349 --> 02:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
if anyone else has any other questions
 
02:45:16.630 --> 02:45:16.640 align:start position:0%
um I do know I have sent an email to uh
 
02:45:20.110 --> 02:45:20.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner Caswell um to see his
 
02:45:21.990 --> 02:45:22.000 align:start position:0%
availability I'm still waiting to hear
 
02:45:23.630 --> 02:45:23.640 align:start position:0%
back I'm hoping to hear back from
 
02:45:26.190 --> 02:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
director buckton also of their
 
02:45:30.469 --> 02:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
availability I mean you know I think
 
02:45:33.630 --> 02:45:33.640 align:start position:0%
where we're not meeting I mean Fridays
 
02:45:35.870 --> 02:45:35.880 align:start position:0%
does seem to be an okay day for most of
 
02:45:38.349 --> 02:45:38.359 align:start position:0%
us but if we have to change our day uh
 
02:45:40.469 --> 02:45:40.479 align:start position:0%
to accommodate these folks um I would
 
02:45:42.110 --> 02:45:42.120 align:start position:0%
definitely give the committee a heads up
 
02:45:44.830 --> 02:45:44.840 align:start position:0%
but I think um because we really want to
 
02:45:46.429 --> 02:45:46.439 align:start position:0%
hear from them and we also want to hear
 
02:45:49.349 --> 02:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
from Dr Chan that we need to maybe
 
02:45:52.469 --> 02:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
accommodate their schedules also um well
 
02:45:55.269 --> 02:45:55.279 align:start position:0%
and I I remember when we spoke to the
 
02:45:58.150 --> 02:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
speaker he said you know after crossover
 
02:46:00.389 --> 02:46:00.399 align:start position:0%
one of the limiting factors was all our
 
02:46:03.269 --> 02:46:03.279 align:start position:0%
work but the other thing was the um the
 
02:46:05.630 --> 02:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
availability of meeting rooms he said
 
02:46:08.990 --> 02:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
maybe after crossover there would we'd
 
02:46:12.269 --> 02:46:12.279 align:start position:0%
have a little bit more latitude um and I
 
02:46:14.230 --> 02:46:14.240 align:start position:0%
think he mentioned Wednesday or you and
 
02:46:16.230 --> 02:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
I uh talk I know you have a work
 
02:46:18.110 --> 02:46:18.120 align:start position:0%
schedule though everybody's got their
 
02:46:20.309 --> 02:46:20.319 align:start position:0%
schedules um if you want I was just
 
02:46:22.230 --> 02:46:22.240 align:start position:0%
going to offer I could just dash off a
 
02:46:24.750 --> 02:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
few of these things that I just said for
 
02:46:27.389 --> 02:46:27.399 align:start position:0%
you and then that way if you wanted to
 
02:46:29.910 --> 02:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
change it or whatever you could send it
 
02:46:32.830 --> 02:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
to commissioner C sure if you would like
 
02:46:35.349 --> 02:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
to and if anybody has any questions that
 
02:46:37.349 --> 02:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
we've discussed if you just want to
 
02:46:38.990 --> 02:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
email them to me then I will forward
 
02:46:41.309 --> 02:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
them on I think it you know that way uh
 
02:46:42.910 --> 02:46:42.920 align:start position:0%
it'll be in one central place and it
 
02:46:45.830 --> 02:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
will just make it easier um that way and
 
02:46:48.269 --> 02:46:48.279 align:start position:0%
we're not being duplicative of the
 
02:46:50.750 --> 02:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
questions we're asking
 
02:46:53.309 --> 02:46:53.319 align:start position:0%
um so does anyone else have anything
 
02:46:55.710 --> 02:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
else that we need to look at but I agree
 
02:46:57.590 --> 02:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
with uh you representative Eble I think
 
02:47:01.070 --> 02:47:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:03.389 --> 02:47:03.399 align:start position:0%
monies I actually have a so then the
 
02:47:05.750 --> 02:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
other person is the homeland security
 
02:47:08.590 --> 02:47:08.600 align:start position:0%
director so I mean obviously we should
 
02:47:10.670 --> 02:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
ask him about his the current
 
02:47:12.990 --> 02:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
preparation of the report what they're
 
02:47:16.429 --> 02:47:16.439 align:start position:0%
looking at what the status is and then
 
02:47:19.030 --> 02:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
um I mean
 
02:47:21.150 --> 02:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
hard to know exactly what to ask him I
 
02:47:22.950 --> 02:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
think well maybe we'll say we're our
 
02:47:26.269 --> 02:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
Focus from our mission is a special look
 
02:47:30.710 --> 02:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
at at health I don't know um um what I
 
02:47:33.190 --> 02:47:33.200 align:start position:0%
have done when I have emailed these uh
 
02:47:35.950 --> 02:47:35.960 align:start position:0%
these folks is I am actually giving them
 
02:47:37.510 --> 02:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
a copy what of what our mission
 
02:47:39.150 --> 02:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
statement is so they have an
 
02:47:41.389 --> 02:47:41.399 align:start position:0%
understanding of what this committee is
 
02:47:43.550 --> 02:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
um and I think it's important that they
 
02:47:47.389 --> 02:47:47.399 align:start position:0%
have that um uh so that is what I am
 
02:47:50.030 --> 02:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
doing just so there it's not a oh what
 
02:47:53.910 --> 02:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
is this committee so represent like us I
 
02:47:55.870 --> 02:47:55.880 align:start position:0%
didn't think we were just health I
 
02:47:59.309 --> 02:47:59.319 align:start position:0%
thought we were oh education yeah
 
02:48:01.309 --> 02:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
because that's that's a big that it had
 
02:48:03.429 --> 02:48:03.439 align:start position:0%
a huge effect on education trying to
 
02:48:05.630 --> 02:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
remember that I couldn't hear without
 
02:48:07.349 --> 02:48:07.359 align:start position:0%
microphone it's a little bit loud in
 
02:48:07.359 --> 02:48:10.230 align:start position:0%
microphone it's a little bit loud in
this

02:48:10.230 --> 02:48:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:12.750 --> 02:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
corner represent leus was saying we
 
02:48:13.990 --> 02:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to just focus on health we
 
02:48:16.790 --> 02:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
want to focus on the educational aspect
 
02:48:19.910 --> 02:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
um but but I do believe that the two go
 
02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
hand in hand because with the shutdown
 
02:48:25.950 --> 02:48:25.960 align:start position:0%
of schools it affected the you know we
 
02:48:27.710 --> 02:48:27.720 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with mental health issues
 
02:48:30.790 --> 02:48:30.800 align:start position:0%
and other health things which in turn
 
02:48:33.110 --> 02:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
and also you know looking at air
 
02:48:35.910 --> 02:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
filtration systems and even ongoing to
 
02:48:37.630 --> 02:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
make sure that our schools have the
 
02:48:40.070 --> 02:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
proper air air filtration systems in
 
02:48:43.830 --> 02:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
them uh for any
 
02:48:47.670 --> 02:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
upcoming pandemic or even the flu season
 
02:48:49.990 --> 02:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
um to help mitigate those I think is an
 
02:48:53.950 --> 02:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
important um thing to look at that that
 
02:48:58.190 --> 02:48:58.200 align:start position:0%
would be an advantage of this committee
 
02:49:01.750 --> 02:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
is that speak micophone that would be an
 
02:49:03.870 --> 02:49:03.880 align:start position:0%
advantage to this committee is that
 
02:49:06.590 --> 02:49:06.600 align:start position:0%
things that we find that are helpful
 
02:49:07.950 --> 02:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
that would have been helpful or that
 
02:49:09.429 --> 02:49:09.439 align:start position:0%
were helpful in
 
02:49:13.670 --> 02:49:13.680 align:start position:0%
covid-19 is they can be used for lots of
 
02:49:16.309 --> 02:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
other issues like the flu because that's
 
02:49:18.950 --> 02:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
that takes out huge numbers of kids and
 
02:49:23.630 --> 02:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
teachers every year flu season and so if
 
02:49:25.550 --> 02:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
they get the
 
02:49:28.190 --> 02:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
proper if they get a nice system that's
 
02:49:30.110 --> 02:49:30.120 align:start position:0%
going to would have worked or did work
 
02:49:30.120 --> 02:49:31.349 align:start position:0%
going to would have worked or did work
for

02:49:31.349 --> 02:49:31.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:49:34.070 --> 02:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
covid and they use the co monies for
 
02:49:37.990 --> 02:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
that yes that continues on and keeps
 
02:49:40.950 --> 02:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
that mayate the flu season right I'm not
 
02:49:42.510 --> 02:49:42.520 align:start position:0%
saying that it's going to eliminate it
 
02:49:44.830 --> 02:49:44.840 align:start position:0%
but it could possibly help and I'm you
 
02:49:46.389 --> 02:49:46.399 align:start position:0%
know but the flu could act completely
 
02:49:48.389 --> 02:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
different than Co and that's it's the
 
02:49:50.429 --> 02:49:50.439 align:start position:0%
other thing we just don't know
 
02:49:53.190 --> 02:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
everything represent Vil yeah I found
 
02:49:56.110 --> 02:49:56.120 align:start position:0%
the um email that we got from Trisha
 
02:49:59.070 --> 02:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
Tilly on what the homeland security
 
02:50:01.710 --> 02:50:01.720 align:start position:0%
report was going to cover so it was
 
02:50:04.349 --> 02:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
preparedness command communication
 
02:50:07.309 --> 02:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
decision making financial management so
 
02:50:10.990 --> 02:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
that is also federal funds right um and
 
02:50:13.710 --> 02:50:13.720 align:start position:0%
other and then health and medical
 
02:50:16.349 --> 02:50:16.359 align:start position:0%
Logistics private Public Partnerships
 
02:50:20.710 --> 02:50:20.720 align:start position:0%
and public information so so
 
02:50:23.469 --> 02:50:23.479 align:start position:0%
um I think financial management and
 
02:50:25.590 --> 02:50:25.600 align:start position:0%
health and medical I mean I do think the
 
02:50:28.110 --> 02:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
education piece sort of feeds into
 
02:50:31.110 --> 02:50:31.120 align:start position:0%
health because what they were doing was
 
02:50:35.590 --> 02:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
because of health reasons right ex so I
 
02:50:39.070 --> 02:50:39.080 align:start position:0%
mean anyway that's what he's uh that's
 
02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
what he's covering so I don't know if we
 
02:50:42.990 --> 02:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
want to select out some of those were
 
02:50:45.229 --> 02:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
particularly interested in or if you
 
02:50:50.590 --> 02:50:50.600 align:start position:0%
just want to have him come in and talk
 
02:50:54.190 --> 02:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
well I think um I mean private Public
 
02:50:56.910 --> 02:50:56.920 align:start position:0%
Partnerships not sure we'll dive deep in
 
02:50:59.349 --> 02:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
02:51:02.670 --> 02:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
leus yeah I have and I can make copies
 
02:51:05.870 --> 02:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
if people are interested but um the
 
02:51:09.830 --> 02:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
Indiana attorney general did a report
 
02:51:12.630 --> 02:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
that's sort of a subset maybe of what
 
02:51:15.349 --> 02:51:15.359 align:start position:0%
we're doing just to see what they did
 
02:51:17.110 --> 02:51:17.120 align:start position:0%
and what questions were asked and what
 
02:51:19.670 --> 02:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
information they got it's the analysis
 
02:51:22.469 --> 02:51:22.479 align:start position:0%
of covid-19 positivity rate data and
 
02:51:26.670 --> 02:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
death stati statistics and the soci
 
02:51:29.550 --> 02:51:29.560 align:start position:0%
economic impact of covid-19 mitigation
 
02:51:31.950 --> 02:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
policies and so I can make everybody a

belch thank you madam chair I just I

just wanted to make a a a quick um
 
02:52:04.349 --> 02:52:04.359 align:start position:0%
argument Point regarding the um the
 
02:52:07.550 --> 02:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
upcoming DHHS report that we are going
 
02:52:10.070 --> 02:52:10.080 align:start position:0%
to be receiving and looking at um just
 
02:52:12.150 --> 02:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
just for clarification it's Homeland
 
02:52:15.510 --> 02:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
Security oh yes my apologies yes so the
 
02:52:16.790 --> 02:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
report that we're going to be looking at
 
02:52:17.990 --> 02:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
and receiving is going to come from the
 
02:52:19.910 --> 02:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
executive Branch obviously with our form
 
02:52:22.550 --> 02:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
of government the three branches of
 
02:52:24.190 --> 02:52:24.200 align:start position:0%
government we have each other in check
 
02:52:28.389 --> 02:52:28.399 align:start position:0%
and we have a responsibility to um to
 
02:52:30.269 --> 02:52:30.279 align:start position:0%
keep each other in check in the various
 
02:52:32.190 --> 02:52:32.200 align:start position:0%
ways that were delegated To Us by the
 
02:52:35.349 --> 02:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
Constitution um as such I think it's
 
02:52:37.990 --> 02:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
very important that we look at this
 
02:52:42.590 --> 02:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
report as a very good thing that we can
 
02:52:47.950 --> 02:52:47.960 align:start position:0%
utilize in our efforts here um as a part
 
02:52:50.309 --> 02:52:50.319 align:start position:0%
of what we're doing but it's also at the
 
02:52:52.710 --> 02:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
same time very important to not look at
 
02:52:53.870 --> 02:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
it as
 
02:52:58.429 --> 02:52:58.439 align:start position:0%
dispositive and simply um file it away
 
02:53:00.830 --> 02:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
and say Yep this is this is what it is
 
02:53:02.790 --> 02:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
it's it's very important for us to
 
02:53:04.750 --> 02:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
anything that we find uh important in
 
02:53:07.469 --> 02:53:07.479 align:start position:0%
our in our goals here to verify the
 
02:53:09.469 --> 02:53:09.479 align:start position:0%
veracity of it uh which may mean
 
02:53:11.670 --> 02:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
duplicating efforts but that that is
 
02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
just part of our I think responsibility
 
02:53:16.229 --> 02:53:16.239 align:start position:0%
from the legislative side uh well I
 
02:53:17.830 --> 02:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
think that the timing of the report
 
02:53:19.670 --> 02:53:19.680 align:start position:0%
which will be out is supposed to be out
 
02:53:22.229 --> 02:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
according to
 
02:53:26.790 --> 02:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
um Miss Tilly uh is the end of June um
 
02:53:29.550 --> 02:53:29.560 align:start position:0%
we will not be meeting in July or August
 
02:53:33.150 --> 02:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
so that will give us a chance to uh
 
02:53:36.110 --> 02:53:36.120 align:start position:0%
preview the report and um when we come
 
02:53:39.070 --> 02:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
back in the fall maybe have uh if we
 
02:53:41.870 --> 02:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
have any questions we can uh address
 
02:53:44.190 --> 02:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
them then
 
02:53:47.150 --> 02:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
um that if you think that there's
 
02:53:48.950 --> 02:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
something that we've just discovered
 
02:53:52.389 --> 02:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
that report differs from or if the what
 
02:53:54.150 --> 02:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
the positives in the report are that we
 
02:53:56.950 --> 02:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
agree with I mean I think it's important
 
02:54:02.429 --> 02:54:02.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:06.630 --> 02:54:06.640 align:start position:0%
positives so um uh Trisha Tilly did
 
02:54:10.110 --> 02:54:10.120 align:start position:0%
write us a a email to see if we had more
 
02:54:12.510 --> 02:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
questions for her and I didn't know if
 
02:54:14.349 --> 02:54:14.359 align:start position:0%
there had been any response to that or
 
02:54:17.110 --> 02:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
if we have something more so I did send
 
02:54:19.550 --> 02:54:19.560 align:start position:0%
off a list of question questions to her
 
02:54:22.269 --> 02:54:22.279 align:start position:0%
I was LAX in getting those questions to
 
02:54:25.030 --> 02:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
her so I would give her some latitude in
 
02:54:27.830 --> 02:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
getting them back to her to us but I
 
02:54:29.710 --> 02:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
also believe that some of the questions
 
02:54:33.389 --> 02:54:33.399 align:start position:0%
May Beyond her purview um and I let her
 
02:54:35.510 --> 02:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
know as such that if she thought they
 
02:54:37.510 --> 02:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
were and maybe if she knew who they
 
02:54:40.590 --> 02:54:40.600 align:start position:0%
could be directed to to let let me know
 
02:54:43.190 --> 02:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
um did you share the question I can
 
02:54:45.309 --> 02:54:45.319 align:start position:0%
absolutely share the qu the email that I
 
02:54:47.830 --> 02:54:47.840 align:start position:0%

04:05:39.309 --> 04:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
for the prom and the heels were a big
 
04:05:43.110 --> 04:05:43.120 align:start position:0%
deal for her because she has had a
 
04:05:45.750 --> 04:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
chronic p pain condition that started
 
04:05:48.309 --> 04:05:48.319 align:start position:0%
when she was 12 years old but she
 
04:05:52.469 --> 04:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
overcame it and so for her that
 
04:05:54.429 --> 04:05:54.439 align:start position:0%
purchasing of a
 
04:05:57.950 --> 04:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
prom buying heels that she could go to
 
04:06:00.070 --> 04:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
her prom with was a big
 
04:06:05.830 --> 04:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
deal um so she'd overcame The Chronic
 
04:06:09.790 --> 04:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
pain disease her leg hurt but she could
 
04:06:12.269 --> 04:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
function nobody knew that she wasn't she
 
04:06:15.070 --> 04:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
was competing gymnastics at her High
 
04:06:17.630 --> 04:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
School uh she was also doing competitive
 
04:06:19.710 --> 04:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
gymnastics at one of the local Club
 
04:06:19.720 --> 04:06:20.910 align:start position:0%
gymnastics at one of the local Club
Gymnastics

04:06:20.910 --> 04:06:20.920 align:start position:0%
Gymnastics
 
04:06:23.590 --> 04:06:23.600 align:start position:0%
facilities uh she also competed
 
04:06:25.990 --> 04:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
nationally as a competitive jump roper
 
04:06:28.630 --> 04:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
doing events like speed and double dutch
 
04:06:30.550 --> 04:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
and whole variety of things so she was a
 
04:06:35.590 --> 04:06:35.600 align:start position:0%
really active active kid um she'd always
 
04:06:37.429 --> 04:06:37.439 align:start position:0%
been active you know her things to do
 
04:06:39.590 --> 04:06:39.600 align:start position:0%
were jump on the trampoline do flips
 
04:06:42.590 --> 04:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
yoga hang out with friends hiking all of
 
04:06:45.030 --> 04:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
that stuff um I don't know if you're
 
04:06:47.510 --> 04:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
interested but I for instance I have a
 
04:06:49.990 --> 04:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
picture of her summer of
 
04:06:53.990 --> 04:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
2020 hiking Mount Major um at the top of
 
04:06:57.670 --> 04:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
it just so excited to be standing at the
 
04:07:01.229 --> 04:07:01.239 align:start position:0%
top of the mountain um because she could
 
04:07:02.750 --> 04:07:02.760 align:start position:0%
um it was
 
04:07:05.550 --> 04:07:05.560 align:start position:0%
fantastic um when Co first hit the
 
04:07:08.229 --> 04:07:08.239 align:start position:0%
school things were tough and shut down
 
04:07:09.750 --> 04:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know at first we really understood
 
04:07:14.630 --> 04:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
it we you know two weeks it made sense
 
04:07:18.750 --> 04:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
let's do this was our in our mind but
 
04:07:20.990 --> 04:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
then as more and more data came
 
04:07:23.630 --> 04:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
out it wasn't making sense to keep these
 
04:07:28.870 --> 04:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
kids out of school um my oldest she was
 
04:07:31.269 --> 04:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
a freshman in college at the time she
 
04:07:33.950 --> 04:07:33.960 align:start position:0%
came home from college in March of 2020
 
04:07:36.830 --> 04:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
and did not go back that year um while
 
04:07:40.030 --> 04:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
she was home taking classes remotely for
 
04:07:41.790 --> 04:07:41.800 align:start position:0%
the remainder of ref freshman year and
 
04:07:44.149 --> 04:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
all of her sophomore year she was a
 
04:07:46.590 --> 04:07:46.600 align:start position:0%
Frontline worker at a
 
04:07:49.910 --> 04:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
supermarket um and at that
 
04:07:52.990 --> 04:07:53.000 align:start position:0%
point we were like why is it that she
 
04:07:56.710 --> 04:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
can go day in day out serve hundreds of
 
04:07:58.790 --> 04:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
customers people she doesn't know but
 
04:08:02.389 --> 04:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
she can't go sit in a classroom with her
 
04:08:05.469 --> 04:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
peers and and learn and get her
 
04:08:05.479 --> 04:08:06.990 align:start position:0%
peers and and learn and get her
education

04:08:06.990 --> 04:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:08:10.630 --> 04:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
um so again as more and more data came
 
04:08:14.510 --> 04:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
out it started to become clear that
 
04:08:17.750 --> 04:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
younger healthy people were at minimal
 
04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
risk of
 
04:08:23.070 --> 04:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
severe reaction severe cases of
 
04:08:26.550 --> 04:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
covid um we knew that it was individuals
 
04:08:29.109 --> 04:08:29.119 align:start position:0%
with comorbidities we knew that it was a
 
04:08:33.389 --> 04:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
lot of elderly um but our young were
 
04:08:33.399 --> 04:08:34.630 align:start position:0%
lot of elderly um but our young were
pretty

04:08:34.630 --> 04:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
04:08:37.590 --> 04:08:37.600 align:start position:0%
safe um in the summer
 
04:08:40.590 --> 04:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
2020 our local K through2 School
 
04:08:43.830 --> 04:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
District came out and sent a survey to
 
04:08:47.349 --> 04:08:47.359 align:start position:0%
All Families asking whether we wanted
 
04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
our children to go back to school in
 
04:08:52.309 --> 04:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
person for fall of
 
04:08:56.510 --> 04:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
2020 the results showed that 80% of the
 
04:08:59.510 --> 04:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
families in the school district wanted
 
04:09:03.710 --> 04:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:07.590 --> 04:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
person then we were told that wasn't
 
04:09:10.109 --> 04:09:10.119 align:start position:0%
happening it was too dangerous for these
 
04:09:11.870 --> 04:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
kids to be back in
 
04:09:14.910 --> 04:09:14.920 align:start position:0%
school we needed to protect them they
 
04:09:16.590 --> 04:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
were told they couldn't have all those
 
04:09:18.910 --> 04:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
kids in the middle and high school and
 
04:09:22.109 --> 04:09:22.119 align:start position:0%
still be able to keep the 6 foot social
 
04:09:22.119 --> 04:09:25.189 align:start position:0%
still be able to keep the 6 foot social
distancing

04:09:25.189 --> 04:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:28.429 --> 04:09:28.439 align:start position:0%
policy if you don't mind I'm I'm sorry
 
04:09:31.830 --> 04:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
to interrupt and I know this is is
 
04:09:34.750 --> 04:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
difficult so I have a couple questions
 
04:09:39.229 --> 04:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
of what you just said is one 80% of
 
04:09:41.389 --> 04:09:41.399 align:start position:0%
parents I want to make sure I understand
 
04:09:43.590 --> 04:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
this 80%
 
04:09:45.990 --> 04:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
so more than well more than half of the
 
04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
families wanted their kids back in
 
04:09:50.590 --> 04:09:50.600 align:start position:0%
school and they felt that it would be a
 
04:09:53.870 --> 04:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
safe environment is this correct correct
 
04:09:57.070 --> 04:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
my other question to you is you
 
04:09:59.469 --> 04:09:59.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned the social distancing the six
 
04:10:04.429 --> 04:10:04.439 align:start position:0%
foot did they ever talk about
 
04:10:06.870 --> 04:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
why they where they came up with that
 
04:10:09.429 --> 04:10:09.439 align:start position:0%
guidance or why they needed it to be 6
 
04:10:11.830 --> 04:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
feet I'm just curious my understanding
 
04:10:14.510 --> 04:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
is it came from fouchy
 
04:10:16.990 --> 04:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
um that was the number that he had and
 
04:10:21.030 --> 04:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
the NIH had stated was the appropriate
 
04:10:25.109 --> 04:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
number today there is information and
 
04:10:27.510 --> 04:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
that has come out that says that was a
 
04:10:31.309 --> 04:10:31.319 align:start position:0%
guess that was not fact based on any
 
04:10:34.349 --> 04:10:34.359 align:start position:0%
factual or scientific data however that
 
04:10:36.870 --> 04:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
was the number that was used in order
 
04:10:39.229 --> 04:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
for the kids to go back to school safely
 
04:10:40.790 --> 04:10:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm sorry to interrupt but I
 
04:10:43.349 --> 04:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify
 
04:10:46.750 --> 04:10:46.760 align:start position:0%
that's fine representative
 
04:10:49.030 --> 04:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
Penza So based upon just kind of
 
04:10:51.550 --> 04:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
following up on what um uh
 
04:10:56.109 --> 04:10:56.119 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa asked so when school
 
04:11:00.030 --> 04:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
guidance came out it was just like in a
 
04:11:02.149 --> 04:11:02.159 align:start position:0%
sense not giving any reasons it was kind
 
04:11:03.990 --> 04:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
of like we're doing what we're
 
04:11:07.149 --> 04:11:07.159 align:start position:0%
told like CDC guidance that kind of
 
04:11:09.870 --> 04:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
thing like if people questioned it was
 
04:11:11.670 --> 04:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
it did they get just a kind of a canned
 
04:11:13.510 --> 04:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
response for people that did question
 
04:11:16.189 --> 04:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
when we did question when questions were
 
04:11:19.990 --> 04:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
asked it went back to the CDC guidance
 
04:11:22.870 --> 04:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
was what they utilized to make their
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
decisions um there was at later times
 
04:11:32.429 --> 04:11:32.439 align:start position:0%
they looked at um rate Community rate
 
04:11:35.429 --> 04:11:35.439 align:start position:0%
hospitalization um then vaccination like
 
04:11:37.229 --> 04:11:37.239 align:start position:0%
when could teachers be
 
04:11:39.830 --> 04:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinated um all of that
 
04:11:42.469 --> 04:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
information um and I'll speak to it
 
04:11:46.750 --> 04:11:46.760 align:start position:0%
later but they the feeling from our
 
04:11:49.750 --> 04:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
perspective is that the bar kept moving
 
04:11:52.990 --> 04:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
and that created a an entire environment
 
04:11:53.000 --> 04:11:54.070 align:start position:0%
and that created a an entire environment
of

04:11:54.070 --> 04:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:11:58.309 --> 04:11:58.319 align:start position:0%
uncertainty and pressure on families but
 
04:12:00.429 --> 04:12:00.439 align:start position:0%
more importantly on the kids and the
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
students because they were told one
 
04:12:07.229 --> 04:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
thing when we met that it was
 
04:12:10.429 --> 04:12:10.439 align:start position:0%
changed um and the bar would be moved
 
04:12:13.630 --> 04:12:13.640 align:start position:0%
out further and so it became very
 
04:12:15.590 --> 04:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
difficult to have a good understanding
 
04:12:18.149 --> 04:12:18.159 align:start position:0%
of when they would be back in school and
 
04:12:21.469 --> 04:12:21.479 align:start position:0%
what that would look like quick followup
 
04:12:24.109 --> 04:12:24.119 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative
 
04:12:26.189 --> 04:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
so you know before I was a
 
04:12:28.670 --> 04:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
representative this was I was in this uh
 
04:12:30.870 --> 04:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
kind of uh space kind of fighting
 
04:12:34.309 --> 04:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
against all this uh stuff and um and I
 
04:12:36.389 --> 04:12:36.399 align:start position:0%
received the guidance um that came out
 
04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
and I was just wondering as a parent
 
04:12:40.790 --> 04:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
because my girls were not in a public
 
04:12:43.750 --> 04:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
school at the time and um
 
04:12:45.750 --> 04:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
but so for example I got I got the
 
04:12:48.229 --> 04:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
guidance from districts that were right
 
04:12:49.750 --> 04:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
next door to you big districts like a
 
04:12:52.469 --> 04:12:52.479 align:start position:0%
Portsmith and stuff that had you know it
 
04:12:54.070 --> 04:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
was kind of like think of it all like on
 
04:12:56.030 --> 04:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
an Excel spreadsheet but did you get
 
04:12:58.469 --> 04:12:58.479 align:start position:0%
that with the red and the green and okay
 
04:13:01.349 --> 04:13:01.359 align:start position:0%
so you had all they and but they kept
 
04:13:04.750 --> 04:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
you got that to at the beginning no oh
 
04:13:06.950 --> 04:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay that piece came out and again
 
04:13:09.309 --> 04:13:09.319 align:start position:0%
please forgive me in my recollection
 
04:13:14.750 --> 04:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
here but that came out later um in the
 
04:13:19.070 --> 04:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
spring when they started saying okay so
 
04:13:22.389 --> 04:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
the first part of it was we don't have
 
04:13:26.030 --> 04:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
enough room for all of the students to
 
04:13:28.229 --> 04:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
come back to the school based on the six
 
04:13:29.510 --> 04:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
foot social
 
04:13:31.990 --> 04:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
distancing so that was the first reason
 
04:13:36.710 --> 04:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
that they could not do it um again
 
04:13:40.550 --> 04:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
despite 80% of families saying this is
 
04:13:43.750 --> 04:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
what we wanted um there was one local
 
04:13:47.710 --> 04:13:47.720 align:start position:0%
elementary school um in Brentwood suy
 
04:13:50.469 --> 04:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
that did go back in person and they
 
04:13:54.189 --> 04:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
found a way to make it work where kids
 
04:13:57.269 --> 04:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
that wanted to stay home were able to do
 
04:13:59.510 --> 04:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
a remote with their teachers and the
 
04:14:01.189 --> 04:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
kids that wanted to be in person were
 
04:14:04.149 --> 04:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
able to be in person from day one um
 
04:14:06.149 --> 04:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
starting back in Fall of
 
04:14:10.229 --> 04:14:10.239 align:start position:0%
2020 that worked well I don't know how
 
04:14:12.109 --> 04:14:12.119 align:start position:0%
you know it would be great if someone
 
04:14:15.590 --> 04:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
could track the impact of the kids that
 
04:14:19.269 --> 04:14:19.279 align:start position:0%
were in person versus remote on that you
 
04:14:22.630 --> 04:14:22.640 align:start position:0%
your District was one I I believe my
 
04:14:25.149 --> 04:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
recollection was one of the ones that
 
04:14:28.269 --> 04:14:28.279 align:start position:0%
was at either at the last or was forced
 
04:14:30.189 --> 04:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
by the governor to open correct we were
 
04:14:33.269 --> 04:14:33.279 align:start position:0%
forced by the governor thank you
 
04:14:38.950 --> 04:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
yep and I will talk about that
 
04:14:42.149 --> 04:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
because that is one of the things that
 
04:14:44.830 --> 04:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
really impacted my daughter is this
 
04:14:48.070 --> 04:14:48.080 align:start position:0%
yo-yoing um you
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
know again these kids after they were
 
04:14:54.990 --> 04:14:55.000 align:start position:0%
told the middle in the high school
 
04:14:59.790 --> 04:14:59.800 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough room for six foot
 
04:15:03.469 --> 04:15:03.479 align:start position:0%
distancing I believe it was November the
 
04:15:05.870 --> 04:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
guidance changed and they dropped it to
 
04:15:05.880 --> 04:15:06.950 align:start position:0%
guidance changed and they dropped it to
3

04:15:06.950 --> 04:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
3
 
04:15:10.229 --> 04:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
feet at that point again people were
 
04:15:14.030 --> 04:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
excited thinking okay now perhaps we'll
 
04:15:15.149 --> 04:15:15.159 align:start position:0%
get back to
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
school again the high school and the
 
04:15:20.030 --> 04:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
middle school they said it was too
 
04:15:22.710 --> 04:15:22.720 align:start position:0%
complicated to get those kids back in
 
04:15:25.790 --> 04:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
school the middle of the year um may I
 
04:15:28.149 --> 04:15:28.159 align:start position:0%
ask who is making that decision was it
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
the school administration or the school
 
04:15:34.550 --> 04:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
board it was a combination I believe it
 
04:15:38.429 --> 04:15:38.439 align:start position:0%
was being presented to them by the
 
04:15:40.429 --> 04:15:40.439 align:start position:0%
administration but the school board
 
04:15:42.950 --> 04:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
seemed to go along with all of the rec
 
04:15:44.229 --> 04:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
recommendations that were coming down
 
04:15:47.550 --> 04:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
from the school administration thank you
 
04:15:47.560 --> 04:15:49.109 align:start position:0%
from the school administration thank you
yeah

04:15:49.109 --> 04:15:49.119 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:15:53.670 --> 04:15:53.680 align:start position:0%
um so pretty much after my kids had this
 
04:15:55.950 --> 04:15:55.960 align:start position:0%
summer where they were doing competitive
 
04:15:57.429 --> 04:15:57.439 align:start position:0%
Sports they were interacting they were
 
04:16:01.269 --> 04:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
living life they were then told you know
 
04:16:04.870 --> 04:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
you were going to be remote again um you
 
04:16:06.429 --> 04:16:06.439 align:start position:0%
know and at that
 
04:16:09.109 --> 04:16:09.119 align:start position:0%
point you know they they ended up going
 
04:16:10.429 --> 04:16:10.439 align:start position:0%
back to school
 
04:16:14.109 --> 04:16:14.119 align:start position:0%
online in their bedrooms by
 
04:16:17.910 --> 04:16:17.920 align:start position:0%
themselves it was my youngest her senior
 
04:16:22.229 --> 04:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
year and that's how it started um so
 
04:16:24.469 --> 04:16:24.479 align:start position:0%
then I mentioned in November there was I
 
04:16:26.189 --> 04:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
believe it was November the social
 
04:16:28.630 --> 04:16:28.640 align:start position:0%
distancing changed from six feet to 3
 
04:16:31.389 --> 04:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
feet but that still wasn't enough to get
 
04:16:35.429 --> 04:16:35.439 align:start position:0%
us back middle of the term too difficult
 
04:16:38.550 --> 04:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
um too hard to make that
 
04:16:42.510 --> 04:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
happen around that time what we did not
 
04:16:45.630 --> 04:16:45.640 align:start position:0%
know until after the fact is that the
 
04:16:45.640 --> 04:16:46.990 align:start position:0%
know until after the fact is that the
school

04:16:46.990 --> 04:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
04:16:50.229 --> 04:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
administration signed and and the school
 
04:16:52.469 --> 04:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
board signed
 
04:16:55.990 --> 04:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
anou with the teachers union that
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
prohibited the ability to do hybrid
 
04:17:00.479 --> 04:17:02.189 align:start position:0%
prohibited the ability to do hybrid
learning

04:17:02.189 --> 04:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
learning
 
04:17:05.469 --> 04:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
um just for my
 
04:17:07.950 --> 04:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
clarification could you please repeat
 
04:17:11.269 --> 04:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
did you just say that over the request
 
04:17:14.149 --> 04:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
of parents in for the benefit of the
 
04:17:16.630 --> 04:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
students the school administration and
 
04:17:19.870 --> 04:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
the school board went against 80% of the
 
04:17:22.590 --> 04:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
population and signed a memorandum of
 
04:17:25.189 --> 04:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
understanding with the teachers union
 
04:17:29.309 --> 04:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
that said that you could only go back if
 
04:17:32.469 --> 04:17:32.479 align:start position:0%
it was full-time and not a
 
04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
full-time um some full-time and some
 
04:17:38.830 --> 04:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
remote is that correct at the beg at the
 
04:17:42.030 --> 04:17:42.040 align:start position:0%
end of the summer there was a survey to
 
04:17:45.070 --> 04:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
parents and 80% of the parents surveyed
 
04:17:48.830 --> 04:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
wanted their children back in school in
 
04:17:52.469 --> 04:17:52.479 align:start position:0%
person come November December and I
 
04:17:54.030 --> 04:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
would have to go back and look at the
 
04:17:56.189 --> 04:17:56.199 align:start position:0%
specific dates and the emails because I
 
04:18:00.790 --> 04:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
have them um they
 
04:18:03.429 --> 04:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
changed and started saying we could not
 
04:18:06.469 --> 04:18:06.479 align:start position:0%
go back in the middle of a
 
04:18:09.870 --> 04:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
term they also started talking about the
 
04:18:15.269 --> 04:18:15.279 align:start position:0%
rate of covid having increased again so
 
04:18:17.910 --> 04:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
that perhaps the surveys that were done
 
04:18:21.229 --> 04:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
in the summer were no longer relevant
 
04:18:23.109 --> 04:18:23.119 align:start position:0%
because now there was a higher rate of
 
04:18:25.070 --> 04:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
covid than there was at the beginning of
 
04:18:26.229 --> 04:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
the school
 
04:18:31.590 --> 04:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
year they also at that time signed anou
 
04:18:33.870 --> 04:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
with the teachers
 
04:18:36.149 --> 04:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
union that
 
04:18:39.830 --> 04:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
stated that there would not be hybrid
 
04:18:41.750 --> 04:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
they would not be required to teach a
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
hybrid class
 
04:18:47.550 --> 04:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
which meant all classes had to be either
 
04:18:53.349 --> 04:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
100% in person or 100%
 
04:18:55.870 --> 04:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
remote this becomes
 
04:18:55.880 --> 04:18:57.389 align:start position:0%
remote this becomes
important

04:18:57.389 --> 04:18:57.399 align:start position:0%
important
 
04:19:02.429 --> 04:19:02.439 align:start position:0%
when January comes along and we are told
 
04:19:05.790 --> 04:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
that our kids could go back to school in
 
04:19:08.109 --> 04:19:08.119 align:start position:0%
person if they would
 
04:19:12.349 --> 04:19:12.359 align:start position:0%
like so my daughter a senior wants to go
 
04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
back to to school in
 
04:19:18.070 --> 04:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
person I then find
 
04:19:20.990 --> 04:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
out that
 
04:19:23.990 --> 04:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately and a lot of the seniors
 
04:19:27.429 --> 04:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
if you are taking AP classes if you are
 
04:19:31.429 --> 04:19:31.439 align:start position:0%
taking honors classes if you
 
04:19:31.439 --> 04:19:33.149 align:start position:0%
taking honors classes if you
are

04:19:33.149 --> 04:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:19:36.670 --> 04:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
um if you are taking a highlevel
 
04:19:40.189 --> 04:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
language class high level math class
 
04:19:42.950 --> 04:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
anyone where there might not be multiple
 
04:19:44.950 --> 04:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
sessions of that
 
04:19:48.070 --> 04:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
classes you would still be
 
04:19:52.269 --> 04:19:52.279 align:start position:0%
remote you could go into the school and
 
04:19:54.950 --> 04:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
you could zoom from the band room the
 
04:19:57.870 --> 04:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
cafeteria the gymnasium wherever you
 
04:19:57.880 --> 04:19:59.030 align:start position:0%
cafeteria the gymnasium wherever you
were

04:19:59.030 --> 04:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:20:01.910 --> 04:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
assigned but you were sitting in there
 
04:20:04.590 --> 04:20:04.600 align:start position:0%
with a number of other students that
 
04:20:07.510 --> 04:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
were all taking different classes and
 
04:20:09.710 --> 04:20:09.720 align:start position:0%
you would zoom into your classroom while
 
04:20:12.990 --> 04:20:13.000 align:start position:0%
the teacher was in the classroom and you
 
04:20:16.670 --> 04:20:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:20.309 --> 04:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
not I just need to kind of wrap my head
 
04:20:23.229 --> 04:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
around this a little bit um because it
 
04:20:27.710 --> 04:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
sounds very convoluted to me however so
 
04:20:30.590 --> 04:20:30.600 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is anybody in a high
 
04:20:30.600 --> 04:20:32.630 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is anybody in a high
level

04:20:32.630 --> 04:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:20:37.349 --> 04:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
class who would have to go to the
 
04:20:40.309 --> 04:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
school and sit in an empty classroom
 
04:20:42.790 --> 04:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
with other kids in that school and the
 
04:20:46.830 --> 04:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
teacher would be remote no not quite if
 
04:20:50.870 --> 04:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
you were in a high level class class and
 
04:20:53.189 --> 04:20:53.199 align:start position:0%
there might only be one session of that
 
04:20:55.950 --> 04:20:55.960 align:start position:0%
class offered and there were students
 
04:20:57.870 --> 04:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
who opted for
 
04:21:00.990 --> 04:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
remote and there were students who opted
 
04:21:02.309 --> 04:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
for in
 
04:21:05.870 --> 04:21:05.880 align:start position:0%
person because of theou that was
 
04:21:09.590 --> 04:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
signed they could not offer hybrid so
 
04:21:11.550 --> 04:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
that the student that wanted to be
 
04:21:14.389 --> 04:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
remote could Di into the classroom and
 
04:21:16.269 --> 04:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
the rest of the students could be in the
 
04:21:19.429 --> 04:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
room with the classroom with the teacher
 
04:21:22.550 --> 04:21:22.560 align:start position:0%
because of that the school solution to
 
04:21:27.149 --> 04:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
that was to assign the kids that were
 
04:21:27.159 --> 04:21:28.670 align:start position:0%
that was to assign the kids that were
inperson

04:21:28.670 --> 04:21:28.680 align:start position:0%
inperson
 
04:21:31.510 --> 04:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
remote to a location within the school
 
04:21:34.510 --> 04:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
building for instance the band
 
04:21:38.070 --> 04:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
room it might be the cafeteria so they
 
04:21:40.550 --> 04:21:40.560 align:start position:0%
would be assigned to a location within
 
04:21:43.070 --> 04:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
the school building while the teacher
 
04:21:47.229 --> 04:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
would be sitting in the classroom by
 
04:21:49.750 --> 04:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
themselves and the students would dial
 
04:21:52.830 --> 04:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
in through Zoom from whatever room they
 
04:21:56.750 --> 04:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
were in in the school while the teachers
 
04:22:00.990 --> 04:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
taught fully remotely so let me just
 
04:22:04.349 --> 04:22:04.359 align:start position:0%
rephrase what you just said and see if I
 
04:22:07.030 --> 04:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
understand this the teacher was actually
 
04:22:09.710 --> 04:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
in the building but because of a
 
04:22:12.269 --> 04:22:12.279 align:start position:0%
memorandum of understanding with the
 
04:22:14.030 --> 04:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
teach teachers
 
04:22:17.229 --> 04:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
union e that those students could not be
 
04:22:19.710 --> 04:22:19.720 align:start position:0%
in the same classroom as the teacher
 
04:22:21.149 --> 04:22:21.159 align:start position:0%
because there were some students that
 
04:22:23.910 --> 04:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
were remote is that correct correct and
 
04:22:26.349 --> 04:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
again I'm the teacher I guess since they
 
04:22:27.950 --> 04:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
were remote for that class they could be
 
04:22:30.469 --> 04:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
teaching it from anywhere I use that
 
04:22:32.550 --> 04:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
they might have been in the classroom
 
04:22:34.229 --> 04:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
because they so they could have been at
 
04:22:35.590 --> 04:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
the beach for all you
 
04:22:39.149 --> 04:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
know I'm just being fous yes but from
 
04:22:41.429 --> 04:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
anywhere okay thank you representative
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair I just want
 
04:22:44.670 --> 04:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
to drill a little bit of that too
 
04:22:46.830 --> 04:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
because I want to I think I
 
04:22:49.550 --> 04:22:49.560 align:start position:0%
understand the issue and I want to draw
 
04:22:51.790 --> 04:22:51.800 align:start position:0%
a good distinction just to make
 
04:22:51.800 --> 04:22:54.070 align:start position:0%
a good distinction just to make
sure

04:22:54.070 --> 04:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:22:57.109 --> 04:22:57.119 align:start position:0%
um because I I can I can just playing
 
04:22:59.510 --> 04:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
Devil's Advocate I can imagine a
 
04:23:03.149 --> 04:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
scenario where because remote is a
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
different thing than in person maybe a
 
04:23:08.510 --> 04:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
teacher gets assigned to a room the size
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
of a broom closet to be
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
remote and there's no room for students
 
04:23:16.030 --> 04:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
but I want to be clear that's that's not
 
04:23:17.910 --> 04:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
what was happening if they were in there
 
04:23:19.309 --> 04:23:19.319 align:start position:0%
they were actually in a classroom where
 
04:23:20.670 --> 04:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
there were seats and they just didn't
 
04:23:23.469 --> 04:23:23.479 align:start position:0%
occupy them I have to tell you that I
 
04:23:25.389 --> 04:23:25.399 align:start position:0%
can't tell you where the teachers were
 
04:23:27.429 --> 04:23:27.439 align:start position:0%
physically I can tell you where the
 
04:23:27.439 --> 04:23:28.510 align:start position:0%
physically I can tell you where the
students

04:23:28.510 --> 04:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:23:31.750 --> 04:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
were um that the students were remote
 
04:23:32.990 --> 04:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
well I guess I guess there's another way
 
04:23:36.710 --> 04:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
I could ask this which is the the the
 
04:23:40.670 --> 04:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
rational for doing this had nothing to
 
04:23:42.389 --> 04:23:42.399 align:start position:0%
do with whether or not the student
 
04:23:44.269 --> 04:23:44.279 align:start position:0%
students could be accommodated in a
 
04:23:47.109 --> 04:23:47.119 align:start position:0%
classroom that was equipped for Zoom but
 
04:23:49.309 --> 04:23:49.319 align:start position:0%
rather solely because of a memorandum of
 
04:23:51.389 --> 04:23:51.399 align:start position:0%
understanding that is my understanding
 
04:23:51.399 --> 04:23:52.710 align:start position:0%
understanding that is my understanding
thank

04:23:52.710 --> 04:23:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:23:52.720 --> 04:23:57.030 align:start position:0%
thank
you

04:23:57.030 --> 04:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:00.269 --> 04:24:00.279 align:start position:0%
yeah any okay
 
04:24:00.279 --> 04:24:02.030 align:start position:0%
yeah any okay
um

04:24:02.030 --> 04:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:05.349 --> 04:24:05.359 align:start position:0%
so again forgive me I'm trying to make
 
04:24:06.590 --> 04:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
sure I'm
 
04:24:10.870 --> 04:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
staying okay um so as I said the we felt
 
04:24:13.309 --> 04:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
like the bar kept moving January she put
 
04:24:15.790 --> 04:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
down that she wanted to go in person and
 
04:24:17.750 --> 04:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
then we found out her classes would be
 
04:24:20.630 --> 04:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
remote there were kids doing classes
 
04:24:23.469 --> 04:24:23.479 align:start position:0%
from their cars there were kids doing
 
04:24:26.070 --> 04:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
classes from coffee shops there were
 
04:24:28.149 --> 04:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
kids doing classes from home there were
 
04:24:30.429 --> 04:24:30.439 align:start position:0%
kids driving between home and school
 
04:24:32.670 --> 04:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
because they had one remote and one in
 
04:24:36.149 --> 04:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
person it it was there was a lot that
 
04:24:41.670 --> 04:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
went on at that time um so for after the
 
04:24:43.630 --> 04:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
excitement of potentially going back to
 
04:24:47.149 --> 04:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
school it was a let down for my senior
 
04:24:50.189 --> 04:24:50.199 align:start position:0%
to find out that it wasn't going to be
 
04:24:52.950 --> 04:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
that way for her so she decided to
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
remain remote because she could not
 
04:24:57.630 --> 04:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
study in she couldn't zoom in and listen
 
04:25:00.389 --> 04:25:00.399 align:start position:0%
from a band room while there were other
 
04:25:03.269 --> 04:25:03.279 align:start position:0%
kids taking different classes around her
 
04:25:05.590 --> 04:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
um so she ended up remaining remote at
 
04:25:07.590 --> 04:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
the high school until the governor told
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
the schools they had to go back in
 
04:25:10.870 --> 04:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
person in
 
04:25:13.109 --> 04:25:13.119 align:start position:0%
April represent
 
04:25:15.590 --> 04:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
Penza um just a quick question about
 
04:25:15.600 --> 04:25:17.590 align:start position:0%
Penza um just a quick question about
that

04:25:17.590 --> 04:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:25:21.750 --> 04:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
so in trying to understand so they
 
04:25:24.109 --> 04:25:24.119 align:start position:0%
opened up the school which even though
 
04:25:25.990 --> 04:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
it was fully remote like you said and
 
04:25:27.429 --> 04:25:27.439 align:start position:0%
she decided that she wasn't going to do
 
04:25:29.590 --> 04:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
that because it wasn't really going back
 
04:25:32.269 --> 04:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
and um so did they do all of the
 
04:25:34.550 --> 04:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
protocols like so for I know it was Bare
 
04:25:35.830 --> 04:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
Bones in a lot of these schools when
 
04:25:37.750 --> 04:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
they did open up because I know a couple
 
04:25:39.510 --> 04:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
did this same thing that you're talking
 
04:25:41.990 --> 04:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
about so was it barebone staff there
 
04:25:45.349 --> 04:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
pretty much um and then PE kids were
 
04:25:47.030 --> 04:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
assigned to certain rooms you might not
 
04:25:48.990 --> 04:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
know this so I was going to say I can't
 
04:25:50.910 --> 04:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
answer that what I can say though is
 
04:25:53.189 --> 04:25:53.199 align:start position:0%
there were classes that did take place
 
04:25:56.550 --> 04:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
in person so it wasn't 100% remote when
 
04:25:59.189 --> 04:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
the school opened up okay it was only
 
04:26:02.790 --> 04:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
those classes that they had students
 
04:26:06.469 --> 04:26:06.479 align:start position:0%
that wanted to be both remote and they
 
04:26:08.710 --> 04:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
had students that wanted to be in person
 
04:26:10.510 --> 04:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
and that they could not move them to
 
04:26:11.790 --> 04:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
another section of the class they
 
04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't do both
 
04:26:16.109 --> 04:26:16.119 align:start position:0%
they because they like so if you and let
 
04:26:17.630 --> 04:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
me give you an example if you were
 
04:26:21.149 --> 04:26:21.159 align:start position:0%
taking freshman English there might be
 
04:26:24.870 --> 04:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
20 or more freshman English classes so
 
04:26:27.070 --> 04:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
if you have 80% that want to be in
 
04:26:30.550 --> 04:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
person and 20% that don't they can find
 
04:26:33.309 --> 04:26:33.319 align:start position:0%
a way to move students around so that
 
04:26:35.630 --> 04:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
the 80% could be in person for that
 
04:26:38.469 --> 04:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
freshman English class and the 20% could
 
04:26:40.149 --> 04:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
be in a different class
 
04:26:43.630 --> 04:26:43.640 align:start position:0%
remote however when you talk about about
 
04:26:46.990 --> 04:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
you know honors physics can't do that
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
you don't have that flexibility and that
 
04:26:50.950 --> 04:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
option to do that and so that's why it
 
04:26:53.710 --> 04:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
tended to impact the upper classman I
 
04:26:57.550 --> 04:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
believe more than the the lower grade
 
04:27:00.109 --> 04:27:00.119 align:start position:0%
were you familiar like when when you're
 
04:27:01.990 --> 04:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
um when you expressed that you wanted to
 
04:27:04.710 --> 04:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
go back and she was excited in January
 
04:27:07.550 --> 04:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
if those were underneath all of the you
 
04:27:09.510 --> 04:27:09.520 align:start position:0%
know we're still going to operate under
 
04:27:11.790 --> 04:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
3 feet um you're going to be required to
 
04:27:14.070 --> 04:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
Mar mask all that all those protocols
 
04:27:16.349 --> 04:27:16.359 align:start position:0%
were still hardcore in place right yes
 
04:27:19.149 --> 04:27:19.159 align:start position:0%
and they had the hallways directional
 
04:27:22.630 --> 04:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
yes um so yeah I've been to I I was
 
04:27:24.590 --> 04:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
there in the High School uh multiple
 
04:27:26.990 --> 04:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
times during that and so yeah that the
 
04:27:28.670 --> 04:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
signs were everywhere they were on the
 
04:27:31.910 --> 04:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
floors walls all of that exactly okay
 
04:27:31.920 --> 04:27:33.189 align:start position:0%
floors walls all of that exactly okay
thank

04:27:33.189 --> 04:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:27:38.189 --> 04:27:38.199 align:start position:0%
you can you likeus thank you can you
 
04:27:41.309 --> 04:27:41.319 align:start position:0%
tell me how they did an honors physics
 
04:27:44.790 --> 04:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:47.109 --> 04:27:47.119 align:start position:0%
so great
 
04:27:47.119 --> 04:27:50.030 align:start position:0%
so great
question

04:27:50.030 --> 04:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:27:51.830 --> 04:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
um my
 
04:27:51.840 --> 04:27:53.429 align:start position:0%
um my
daughter

04:27:53.429 --> 04:27:53.439 align:start position:0%
daughter
 
04:27:57.309 --> 04:27:57.319 align:start position:0%
was having by this point she was
 
04:27:58.750 --> 04:27:58.760 align:start position:0%
starting to
 
04:28:03.109 --> 04:28:03.119 align:start position:0%
struggle in class um one of the things
 
04:28:06.149 --> 04:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
that I had done when I heard that the
 
04:28:09.309 --> 04:28:09.319 align:start position:0%
school was not going to be open in the
 
04:28:13.510 --> 04:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
fall I looked online and then said if
 
04:28:16.670 --> 04:28:16.680 align:start position:0%
she needs to take classes why not have
 
04:28:19.510 --> 04:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
her take classes where she gets college
 
04:28:22.349 --> 04:28:22.359 align:start position:0%
credit so she took two classes from
 
04:28:25.950 --> 04:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
Great Bay Community College she took
 
04:28:28.870 --> 04:28:28.880 align:start position:0%
classes at the SEO School of Technology
 
04:28:30.550 --> 04:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
where she earned her
 
04:28:34.550 --> 04:28:34.560 align:start position:0%
LNA and she took two classes at exor
 
04:28:34.560 --> 04:28:35.590 align:start position:0%
LNA and she took two classes at exor
high

04:28:35.590 --> 04:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
high
 
04:28:38.070 --> 04:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
school those two classes that she took
 
04:28:39.910 --> 04:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
at the exor high
 
04:28:43.550 --> 04:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
school were
 
04:28:46.149 --> 04:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
the stress that those were the ones
 
04:28:47.950 --> 04:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
there was no understanding of what was
 
04:28:51.349 --> 04:28:51.359 align:start position:0%
going on there was confusion there was
 
04:28:53.710 --> 04:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
it was challenging it was
 
04:28:55.510 --> 04:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
frustrating it
 
04:28:58.269 --> 04:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
was there were no set
 
04:29:02.189 --> 04:29:02.199 align:start position:0%
expectations it it was those caused
 
04:29:05.750 --> 04:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
her anxiety and
 
04:29:10.710 --> 04:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
stress and at one point I reached out to
 
04:29:12.950 --> 04:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
the school and I said she will no longer
 
04:29:16.269 --> 04:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
be attending the classes because this is
 
04:29:18.670 --> 04:29:18.680 align:start position:0%
not um and she took a break from
 
04:29:20.309 --> 04:29:20.319 align:start position:0%
attending the online classes and we
 
04:29:22.030 --> 04:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
figured out how for how she could get
 
04:29:24.870 --> 04:29:24.880 align:start position:0%
the information and learn on her own
 
04:29:28.149 --> 04:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
thank you it so no you couldn't learn
 
04:29:31.870 --> 04:29:31.880 align:start position:0%
honors physics online
 
04:29:36.870 --> 04:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah um all right so um she went to
 
04:29:38.550 --> 04:29:38.560 align:start position:0%
those online classes she obtained her
 
04:29:41.790 --> 04:29:41.800 align:start position:0%
LNA as I mentioned her senior year which
 
04:29:45.790 --> 04:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
that was challenging because um it was
 
04:29:47.309 --> 04:29:47.319 align:start position:0%
really hard to get
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
clinicals and but they managed to do it
 
04:29:52.710 --> 04:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
at the very end of her senior year and
 
04:29:54.229 --> 04:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
she was actually able to pass the
 
04:29:58.309 --> 04:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
licensing exam in the spring of 21 right
 
04:29:58.319 --> 04:29:59.510 align:start position:0%
licensing exam in the spring of 21 right
before

04:29:59.510 --> 04:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:29:59.520 --> 04:30:01.189 align:start position:0%
before
graduation

04:30:01.189 --> 04:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
graduation
 
04:30:04.149 --> 04:30:04.159 align:start position:0%
um she as I said my daughter was a
 
04:30:06.990 --> 04:30:07.000 align:start position:0%
gymnast um she had to wear a mask for
 
04:30:09.710 --> 04:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
high school gymnastics yet she could go
 
04:30:13.670 --> 04:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
to Club Gymnastics and and that was no
 
04:30:18.070 --> 04:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
mask um imagine being a gymnast on the
 
04:30:21.950 --> 04:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
beam or on the bars and your mask
 
04:30:25.229 --> 04:30:25.239 align:start position:0%
slips um you know it was it was
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
interesting they started then getting to
 
04:30:29.109 --> 04:30:29.119 align:start position:0%
the point where you could hang your mask
 
04:30:32.309 --> 04:30:32.319 align:start position:0%
on the apparatus or hand it to your
 
04:30:36.790 --> 04:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
coach before you got on to did your aent
 
04:30:38.109 --> 04:30:38.119 align:start position:0%
and then your coach would hand it back
 
04:30:40.070 --> 04:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
to you which was very
 
04:30:43.429 --> 04:30:43.439 align:start position:0%
sanitary um and made made a lot
 
04:30:46.149 --> 04:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
of so so those were the things that she
 
04:30:50.950 --> 04:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
was dealing with um it
 
04:30:53.429 --> 04:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
was you know we had friends that played
 
04:30:56.469 --> 04:30:56.479 align:start position:0%
tennis they had to play tennis with
 
04:30:58.910 --> 04:30:58.920 align:start position:0%
masks on while their opponent was across
 
04:31:03.630 --> 04:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
the net um so there just seemed to be
 
04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
this trying to understand trying to help
 
04:31:09.790 --> 04:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
us make it make sense and feeling like
 
04:31:13.030 --> 04:31:13.040 align:start position:0%
we weren't getting
 
04:31:15.790 --> 04:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
we weren't looking out for our kids the
 
04:31:17.950 --> 04:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
decisions that were being made were not
 
04:31:20.790 --> 04:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the kids in my
 
04:31:25.309 --> 04:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
opinion um we felt like covid kept being
 
04:31:28.790 --> 04:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
held over their head and that the bar
 
04:31:30.670 --> 04:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
for when life could become normal for
 
04:31:32.030 --> 04:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
them kept
 
04:31:32.040 --> 04:31:34.510 align:start position:0%
them kept
moving

04:31:34.510 --> 04:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
moving
 
04:31:38.670 --> 04:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
um then they were told after the January
 
04:31:41.429 --> 04:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
attempt to go back to school in person
 
04:31:44.469 --> 04:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
for my daughter some were able to um
 
04:31:46.109 --> 04:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
they were then told that school could go
 
04:31:47.189 --> 04:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
back to
 
04:31:49.309 --> 04:31:49.319 align:start position:0%
normal when teachers had had the
 
04:31:51.750 --> 04:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get
 
04:31:55.109 --> 04:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and that once the teachers
 
04:31:57.830 --> 04:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
all the teacher categories were
 
04:32:00.590 --> 04:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinated one month after that because
 
04:32:02.510 --> 04:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
that would allow them to get their two
 
04:32:05.070 --> 04:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
shots and or whatever the time frame was
 
04:32:08.189 --> 04:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
I can't remember then we could go back
 
04:32:11.950 --> 04:32:11.960 align:start position:0%
to school that was the next thing
 
04:32:14.349 --> 04:32:14.359 align:start position:0%
then it became the handout with the
 
04:32:16.790 --> 04:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that talked about
 
04:32:21.189 --> 04:32:21.199 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations and Community rates of
 
04:32:25.229 --> 04:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
covid and based on those charts then we
 
04:32:29.510 --> 04:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
could or couldn't go back to school um
 
04:32:32.590 --> 04:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
we went through all of that so then
 
04:32:33.950 --> 04:32:33.960 align:start position:0%
after we were told about the
 
04:32:36.389 --> 04:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and that the
 
04:32:39.349 --> 04:32:39.359 align:start position:0%
teachers you know as they got to be
 
04:32:42.429 --> 04:32:42.439 align:start position:0%
vaccinated the conversation at school
 
04:32:44.309 --> 04:32:44.319 align:start position:0%
became are you
 
04:32:47.389 --> 04:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
vaccinated teachers were asking students
 
04:32:50.670 --> 04:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
were asking it became a common question
 
04:32:53.109 --> 04:32:53.119 align:start position:0%
for everybody are you vaccinated are you
 
04:32:55.429 --> 04:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
getting vaccinated when are you getting
 
04:32:58.710 --> 04:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
vaccinated to the point where the school
 
04:33:01.750 --> 04:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
had to send a notice out stating that
 
04:33:04.390 --> 04:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
that was not an appropriate topic or
 
04:33:07.310 --> 04:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
question to be asked of
 
04:33:09.629 --> 04:33:09.639 align:start position:0%
students so again my daughter's feeling
 
04:33:13.349 --> 04:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of pressure about
 
04:33:14.590 --> 04:33:14.600 align:start position:0%
I need to get
 
04:33:17.029 --> 04:33:17.039 align:start position:0%
vaccinated so then they went from there
 
04:33:18.349 --> 04:33:18.359 align:start position:0%
and they told them that they could have
 
04:33:19.629 --> 04:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
their senior
 
04:33:22.949 --> 04:33:22.959 align:start position:0%
prom and that was big news that was
 
04:33:25.590 --> 04:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
exciting happy it was going to be held
 
04:33:27.390 --> 04:33:27.400 align:start position:0%
in the parking lot
 
04:33:27.400 --> 04:33:29.230 align:start position:0%
in the parking lot
outside

04:33:29.230 --> 04:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
outside
 
04:33:33.189 --> 04:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
um and they would have to wear
 
04:33:37.070 --> 04:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:40.390 --> 04:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated along with a list of other
 
04:33:44.510 --> 04:33:44.520 align:start position:0%
requirements there would be social whole
 
04:33:48.349 --> 04:33:48.359 align:start position:0%
variety whole list of things uh first um
 
04:33:51.390 --> 04:33:51.400 align:start position:0%
just a quick question for you I thought
 
04:33:53.789 --> 04:33:53.799 align:start position:0%
you just said that something came down
 
04:33:56.310 --> 04:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
from the administration that asking
 
04:33:58.551 --> 04:33:58.561 align:start position:0%
students or anyone if they were
 
04:34:01.150 --> 04:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
vaccinated was inappropriate is that
 
04:34:04.750 --> 04:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
correct yes so how could they
 
04:34:07.830 --> 04:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
ask students that weren't vaccinated to
 
04:34:10.070 --> 04:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
wear mask and how would they know who
 
04:34:12.109 --> 04:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
wasn't vaccinated
 
04:34:14.789 --> 04:34:14.799 align:start position:0%
um if asking that question was
 
04:34:17.949 --> 04:34:17.959 align:start position:0%
inappropriate that just seems to me
 
04:34:21.029 --> 04:34:21.039 align:start position:0%
duplicitous that was a great question
 
04:34:24.629 --> 04:34:24.639 align:start position:0%
and um the students were asked to
 
04:34:26.990 --> 04:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
provide their vaccination
 
04:34:32.551 --> 04:34:32.561 align:start position:0%
card when they checked in for prom that
 
04:34:36.310 --> 04:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
evening I just need to clarify something
 
04:34:39.830 --> 04:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
again and I'm I'm sorry if I'm being
 
04:34:42.390 --> 04:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
repetitive the administ
 
04:34:45.910 --> 04:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
ation sent out a memo to school
 
04:34:49.990 --> 04:34:50.000 align:start position:0%
officials s saying that asking if a
 
04:34:52.629 --> 04:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
student is vaccinated was inappropriate
 
04:34:54.750 --> 04:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
is that correct in the school
 
04:34:56.990 --> 04:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
environment correct in the school
 
04:34:59.830 --> 04:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
environment was not the prom considered
 
04:35:03.150 --> 04:35:03.160 align:start position:0%
being in the school environment the prom
 
04:35:07.470 --> 04:35:07.480 align:start position:0%
was not a right it was an
 
04:35:11.109 --> 04:35:11.119 align:start position:0%
activity it's but but it is still
 
04:35:13.551 --> 04:35:13.561 align:start position:0%
associated with the school is it
 
04:35:17.310 --> 04:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
not in my mind yes however I was not the
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
one making the decisions thank you and
 
04:35:22.670 --> 04:35:22.680 align:start position:0%
who may I ask who made that decision was
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
it the school administration or the
 
04:35:27.189 --> 04:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
school board so I have an article that I
 
04:35:31.990 --> 04:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
brought with me on oops that's not it um
 
04:35:33.709 --> 04:35:33.719 align:start position:0%
I have an article that I brought with me
 
04:35:37.349 --> 04:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
from the SE coast online that says EHS
 
04:35:40.310 --> 04:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
Administration aware of plan to Mark oh
 
04:35:42.070 --> 04:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
I haven't spoken about the market of the
 
04:35:45.510 --> 04:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
vaccinated students yet but I will um
 
04:35:48.470 --> 04:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
EHS Administration aware of plan to Mark
 
04:35:52.390 --> 04:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
students at the prom sau6 superintendent
 
04:35:56.830 --> 04:35:56.840 align:start position:0%
says this was on July 28th
 
04:36:01.670 --> 04:36:01.680 align:start position:0%
2021 okay so just following up on this
 
04:36:04.990 --> 04:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
so the administration was aware of
 
04:36:07.830 --> 04:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
it but the and the superintendent was
 
04:36:10.150 --> 04:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
also aware of it but it doesn't say
 
04:36:12.070 --> 04:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
who's taking responsibility
 
04:36:15.551 --> 04:36:15.561 align:start position:0%
there so I'm just so let me let me back
 
04:36:20.029 --> 04:36:20.039 align:start position:0%
up one minute yeah um because to fully
 
04:36:22.750 --> 04:36:22.760 align:start position:0%
understand what occurred and why I don't
 
04:36:23.830 --> 04:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
have those
 
04:36:27.551 --> 04:36:27.561 align:start position:0%
answers um so my daughter showed up to
 
04:36:27.561 --> 04:36:28.429 align:start position:0%
answers um so my daughter showed up to
the

04:36:28.429 --> 04:36:28.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:36:31.709 --> 04:36:31.719 align:start position:0%
prom we did she BR did not have a
 
04:36:34.709 --> 04:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
vaccination card because she was not
 
04:36:38.830 --> 04:36:38.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinated um when she showed up to the
 
04:36:43.590 --> 04:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
prom they had decided they would Mark
 
04:36:47.709 --> 04:36:47.719 align:start position:0%
and number the hands of the students who
 
04:36:50.510 --> 04:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
were not vaccinated and they tracked
 
04:36:52.189 --> 04:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
that on a
 
04:36:55.070 --> 04:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
document that the parent volunteers I
 
04:36:58.390 --> 04:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
believe were responsible
 
04:37:00.230 --> 04:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
for they
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
then went into the prom and there were
 
04:37:07.750 --> 04:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
underclassmen who were recording after
 
04:37:10.310 --> 04:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
every three songs the students would
 
04:37:12.109 --> 04:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
raise their hand up
 
04:37:14.150 --> 04:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
and they would record the numbers of the
 
04:37:16.750 --> 04:37:16.760 align:start position:0%
students with markings on their hand so
 
04:37:20.470 --> 04:37:20.480 align:start position:0%
that they could M keep track of where
 
04:37:25.310 --> 04:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:25.320 --> 04:37:28.949 align:start position:0%
 
with

04:37:28.949 --> 04:37:28.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:31.310 --> 04:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
04:37:33.830 --> 04:37:33.840 align:start position:0%
Penza okay so I want to go back real
 
04:37:36.310 --> 04:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
quick to the guidance okay because I I
 
04:37:38.189 --> 04:37:38.199 align:start position:0%
do know this pretty well and I'd like
 
04:37:41.551 --> 04:37:41.561 align:start position:0%
you just to confirm so
 
04:37:43.429 --> 04:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
so most of the guidance that was coming
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
out I know of in another district and I
 
04:37:49.230 --> 04:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
believe it was in your District as well
 
04:37:51.470 --> 04:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
guidance was given out directly to the
 
04:37:53.670 --> 04:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
students through their email addresses
 
04:37:55.990 --> 04:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes even bypassing the parents in
 
04:37:58.189 --> 04:37:58.199 align:start position:0%
regards with these protocols right
 
04:38:01.109 --> 04:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
pushing with vaccines and Clinics and
 
04:38:02.590 --> 04:38:02.600 align:start position:0%
all of these types of things that were
 
04:38:06.189 --> 04:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
happening and then um through them kind
 
04:38:09.109 --> 04:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
of in a sense getting slapped is when
 
04:38:10.629 --> 04:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
then the administration sent out a
 
04:38:13.230 --> 04:38:13.240 align:start position:0%
blanket message to say you know oh sorry
 
04:38:15.910 --> 04:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
we screwed up correct that's how my
 
04:38:17.910 --> 04:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
understanding okay and I know where that
 
04:38:19.310 --> 04:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
guidance came from and I'm going to
 
04:38:20.830 --> 04:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
provide that to the committee I have all
 
04:38:22.990 --> 04:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
of that information but if you have all
 
04:38:26.150 --> 04:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
of those emails that would be extremely
 
04:38:29.510 --> 04:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
helpful um I have a bunch of emails from
 
04:38:31.629 --> 04:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
another district and I think it would be
 
04:38:33.510 --> 04:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
very good because of similar but still
 
04:38:37.670 --> 04:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
different yeah um you know and then the
 
04:38:42.109 --> 04:38:42.119 align:start position:0%
other piece is um in
 
04:38:44.750 --> 04:38:44.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of this came from peers feeling
 
04:38:47.070 --> 04:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
this stuff and and of course possibly
 
04:38:49.510 --> 04:38:49.520 align:start position:0%
even teachers or administrators saying
 
04:38:51.789 --> 04:38:51.799 align:start position:0%
these things like off the cuff up which
 
04:38:55.750 --> 04:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
they never should but in in no time
 
04:38:58.789 --> 04:38:58.799 align:start position:0%
anybody ever talked about um medical
 
04:39:01.390 --> 04:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
privacy or any of these types of things
 
04:39:03.150 --> 04:39:03.160 align:start position:0%
none of this stuff ever came up right
 
04:39:04.750 --> 04:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
everybody was wanting to know their
 
04:39:08.230 --> 04:39:08.240 align:start position:0%
status correct and
 
04:39:12.750 --> 04:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
um yeah correct you know and that was
 
04:39:16.269 --> 04:39:16.279 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I you know wanted
 
04:39:21.230 --> 04:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
to specify here was that when she went
 
04:39:23.510 --> 04:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
to the
 
04:39:27.629 --> 04:39:27.639 align:start position:0%
prom she was excited to go she was
 
04:39:30.629 --> 04:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated and the guidance had been
 
04:39:33.551 --> 04:39:33.561 align:start position:0%
that she would have to wear a mask so
 
04:39:35.390 --> 04:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
she had actually had her
 
04:39:38.030 --> 04:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
grandmother who trimmed her who hemmed
 
04:39:41.628 --> 04:39:41.638 align:start position:0%
her dress making matching mask out of
 
04:39:43.750 --> 04:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
the bottom of her prom dress because
 
04:39:45.990 --> 04:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's that's healthy I mean
 
04:39:49.030 --> 04:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
that's um so she had a matching mask
 
04:39:52.190 --> 04:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
created from the bottom of her dress
 
04:39:54.788 --> 04:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
that she could wear since she was
 
04:39:58.190 --> 04:39:58.200 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated um what had happened though
 
04:40:01.590 --> 04:40:01.600 align:start position:0%
is right before the prom The Mask
 
04:40:03.390 --> 04:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
mandate was
 
04:40:07.230 --> 04:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
dropped which is why they made this
 
04:40:11.430 --> 04:40:11.440 align:start position:0%
decision to Mark to number them
 
04:40:14.628 --> 04:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
and that decision I never received any
 
04:40:17.350 --> 04:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
notification that that was happening we
 
04:40:21.110 --> 04:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
went to the um like the prominade where
 
04:40:23.310 --> 04:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
the students all walk by all the parents
 
04:40:25.430 --> 04:40:25.440 align:start position:0%
and we cheer for them and everything and
 
04:40:28.910 --> 04:40:28.920 align:start position:0%
I noticed that there was um this black
 
04:40:30.910 --> 04:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
staining on my daughter and I said
 
04:40:32.868 --> 04:40:32.878 align:start position:0%
what's that from and she goes oh wait
 
04:40:36.550 --> 04:40:36.560 align:start position:0%
till you hear and she told that was how
 
04:40:38.230 --> 04:40:38.240 align:start position:0%
I found out that they were planning on
 
04:40:42.788 --> 04:40:42.798 align:start position:0%
doing this so
 
04:40:45.350 --> 04:40:45.360 align:start position:0%
that was just one more kind of blow to
 
04:40:45.360 --> 04:40:47.628 align:start position:0%
that was just one more kind of blow to
her

04:40:47.628 --> 04:40:47.638 align:start position:0%
her
 
04:40:51.150 --> 04:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
of you know she was being marked based
 
04:40:52.470 --> 04:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
on her medical
 
04:40:54.708 --> 04:40:54.718 align:start position:0%
decisions represent
 
04:40:57.708 --> 04:40:57.718 align:start position:0%
Penza okay so when that it's very
 
04:40:59.708 --> 04:40:59.718 align:start position:0%
interesting because it I remember the
 
04:41:03.190 --> 04:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
timing and dates wise so at the same
 
04:41:05.270 --> 04:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
time that guidance came out which
 
04:41:07.708 --> 04:41:07.718 align:start position:0%
slapped all of the schools about this
 
04:41:09.990 --> 04:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
specifically you know creating two
 
04:41:12.310 --> 04:41:12.320 align:start position:0%
classes of students and all of that kind
 
04:41:14.590 --> 04:41:14.600 align:start position:0%
of stuff the most important thing that
 
04:41:16.350 --> 04:41:16.360 align:start position:0%
was sent to every single
 
04:41:19.070 --> 04:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
superintendent um every single
 
04:41:20.910 --> 04:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent every single School Board
 
04:41:23.390 --> 04:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
in the entire State and all of that
 
04:41:25.590 --> 04:41:25.600 align:start position:0%
information should have came down like
 
04:41:26.990 --> 04:41:27.000 align:start position:0%
where you heard the guidance this is
 
04:41:29.230 --> 04:41:29.240 align:start position:0%
from from the Department of Education
 
04:41:31.390 --> 04:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
which you know came specifically from
 
04:41:31.400 --> 04:41:32.270 align:start position:0%
which you know came specifically from
their

04:41:32.270 --> 04:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:41:35.550 --> 04:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
lawyer um so you didn't get that
 
04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
directly you only got a secondhand oh we
 
04:41:41.708 --> 04:41:41.718 align:start position:0%
can't do that anymore correct yes
 
04:41:44.030 --> 04:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
the the other thing that had
 
04:41:47.590 --> 04:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
happened was because there was such a
 
04:41:50.550 --> 04:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
thing made about vaccinated versus
 
04:41:52.948 --> 04:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated it almost became as you
 
04:41:56.230 --> 04:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
said that second class
 
04:42:00.030 --> 04:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
um you couldn't get invited to things if
 
04:42:02.590 --> 04:42:02.600 align:start position:0%
you weren't vaccinated some parents
 
04:42:05.550 --> 04:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
wanted proof of vaccination to go to
 
04:42:05.560 --> 04:42:06.550 align:start position:0%
wanted proof of vaccination to go to
prom

04:42:06.550 --> 04:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
prom
 
04:42:10.830 --> 04:42:10.840 align:start position:0%
parties um so it just it kind of rolled
 
04:42:14.270 --> 04:42:14.280 align:start position:0%
and it became bigger and bigger once the
 
04:42:16.110 --> 04:42:16.120 align:start position:0%
students start feeling like oh well
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
everyone's telling us you should get
 
04:42:21.470 --> 04:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
vaccinated you're not that's not safe I
 
04:42:23.990 --> 04:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
don't know if you can come so it almost
 
04:42:26.430 --> 04:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
sounds like a form of
 
04:42:29.150 --> 04:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
discrimination would you say that uh
 
04:42:32.510 --> 04:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
based on what you're telling me um that
 
04:42:34.350 --> 04:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
people are actually discriminating
 
04:42:36.470 --> 04:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
against people that were not vaccinated
 
04:42:38.030 --> 04:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
is that correct against students that
 
04:42:40.510 --> 04:42:40.520 align:start position:0%
aren't vaccinated I felt that my
 
04:42:42.550 --> 04:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
daughter was treated
 
04:42:46.708 --> 04:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
differently um I felt that it's a form
 
04:42:51.270 --> 04:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
of pressure bullying har you know that's
 
04:42:55.910 --> 04:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
what I felt was happening there was this
 
04:42:58.470 --> 04:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
pressure that you need to do this you
 
04:43:01.948 --> 04:43:01.958 align:start position:0%
need to do this um and it was pretty
 
04:43:04.510 --> 04:43:04.520 align:start position:0%
clear what the message was get
 
04:43:08.550 --> 04:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:10.990 --> 04:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
behind and and did you and do you feel
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
that that that message was um more from
 
04:43:17.750 --> 04:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
her peers or from just the public in
 
04:43:21.350 --> 04:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
general I think that message was from
 
04:43:24.070 --> 04:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
everywhere even even
 
04:43:26.550 --> 04:43:26.560 align:start position:0%
today you
 
04:43:29.030 --> 04:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
know two days ago I walked into
 
04:43:31.030 --> 04:43:31.040 align:start position:0%
Walgreens and I took a whole bunch of
 
04:43:33.788 --> 04:43:33.798 align:start position:0%
photos because everywhere you
 
04:43:36.270 --> 04:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
look get your vaccination free
 
04:43:37.948 --> 04:43:37.958 align:start position:0%
vaccination have a
 
04:43:40.270 --> 04:43:40.280 align:start position:0%
vaccination all of this information
 
04:43:43.590 --> 04:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
about every vaccine under the and not
 
04:43:46.190 --> 04:43:46.200 align:start position:0%
one place does it
 
04:43:50.030 --> 04:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
specify what the potential risks are
 
04:43:52.670 --> 04:43:52.680 align:start position:0%
it's beautiful marketing it's beautiful
 
04:43:54.708 --> 04:43:54.718 align:start position:0%
information for people to get it hey
 
04:43:56.990 --> 04:43:57.000 align:start position:0%
it's free a lot of you can get it for
 
04:44:01.708 --> 04:44:01.718 align:start position:0%
free um but there's nothing on those
 
04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
marketing materials that tell
 
04:44:06.788 --> 04:44:06.798 align:start position:0%
you here's the potential side effects
 
04:44:08.070 --> 04:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
here's the things you might want to
 
04:44:12.550 --> 04:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
think about before you get this
 
04:44:12.560 --> 04:44:13.990 align:start position:0%
think about before you get this
represented

04:44:13.990 --> 04:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
represented
 
04:44:16.670 --> 04:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
Penza do you recall and you might still
 
04:44:20.910 --> 04:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
have emails of how many clinics they had
 
04:44:24.910 --> 04:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
I don't okay second question do you feel
 
04:44:28.110 --> 04:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
as if
 
04:44:30.030 --> 04:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
the I'm just going to have to use the
 
04:44:32.670 --> 04:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
word Insanity because it is um that was
 
04:44:36.230 --> 04:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
created by all of this is is has got to
 
04:44:39.110 --> 04:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
be a top down all of these teens they're
 
04:44:41.190 --> 04:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
impressionable all of this type of stuff
 
04:44:43.150 --> 04:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
this it just can't come out of nowhere
 
04:44:45.270 --> 04:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
right so you know pounding and pounding
 
04:44:46.670 --> 04:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
and pounding and losing school and
 
04:44:49.868 --> 04:44:49.878 align:start position:0%
losing friends and losing this right so
 
04:44:52.070 --> 04:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
I mean it has to come from there like
 
04:44:54.430 --> 04:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
you know it has it did become every
 
04:44:57.190 --> 04:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
everyone but didn't it start it had to
 
04:44:59.150 --> 04:44:59.160 align:start position:0%
start from the top absolutely the
 
04:45:01.670 --> 04:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
message was clear and
 
04:45:05.788 --> 04:45:05.798 align:start position:0%
consistent that the world could open up
 
04:45:07.470 --> 04:45:07.480 align:start position:0%
when everybody got
 
04:45:10.350 --> 04:45:10.360 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and if it didn't open up
 
04:45:12.590 --> 04:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
blame them ones that refused to get the
 
04:45:17.070 --> 04:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
vaccine and that message was loud and
 
04:45:17.080 --> 04:45:19.110 align:start position:0%
vaccine and that message was loud and
clear

04:45:19.110 --> 04:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
clear
 
04:45:19.120 --> 04:45:20.628 align:start position:0%
clear
um

04:45:20.628 --> 04:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:20.638 --> 04:45:23.470 align:start position:0%
um
yeah

04:45:23.470 --> 04:45:23.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:45:25.948 --> 04:45:25.958 align:start position:0%
uh any
 
04:45:30.390 --> 04:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
other so all of that I mean
 
04:45:34.110 --> 04:45:34.120 align:start position:0%
that kind of builds up
 
04:45:37.110 --> 04:45:37.120 align:start position:0%
to the pressure that she was feeling the
 
04:45:39.270 --> 04:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
stress she was feeling I didn't even
 
04:45:42.230 --> 04:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
talk or mention just the whole process
 
04:45:45.270 --> 04:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
to apply for colleges visiting colleges
 
04:45:48.670 --> 04:45:48.680 align:start position:0%
that was a whole other experience that
 
04:45:51.510 --> 04:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
we could spend a lot of time on but the
 
04:45:55.190 --> 04:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
real blow for her came when she found
 
04:45:56.750 --> 04:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
out that in order to go to the College
 
04:45:58.030 --> 04:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
of her
 
04:46:01.470 --> 04:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
choice that she needed to be
 
04:46:03.590 --> 04:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
vaccinated may I ask what state that
 
04:46:05.948 --> 04:46:05.958 align:start position:0%
college was in it so she looked at a
 
04:46:07.628 --> 04:46:07.638 align:start position:0%
variety of colleges the one that she
 
04:46:09.150 --> 04:46:09.160 align:start position:0%
chose was in
 
04:46:11.430 --> 04:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
Maine um thank you
 
04:46:14.190 --> 04:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
and so some of the colleges
 
04:46:17.948 --> 04:46:17.958 align:start position:0%
had programs where they would um tag
 
04:46:20.990 --> 04:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
your college ID and so that wherever you
 
04:46:23.270 --> 04:46:23.280 align:start position:0%
swiped it whatever door whatever whether
 
04:46:24.430 --> 04:46:24.440 align:start position:0%
you went to the
 
04:46:27.230 --> 04:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
cafeteria it was clear and you were
 
04:46:29.430 --> 04:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
supposed to be masked while unvaccinated
 
04:46:31.390 --> 04:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
could not so they had different
 
04:46:33.110 --> 04:46:33.120 align:start position:0%
different universities had different
 
04:46:34.670 --> 04:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
approaches that they took and that was
 
04:46:37.948 --> 04:46:37.958 align:start position:0%
all over the country um that wasn't just
 
04:46:42.750 --> 04:46:42.760 align:start position:0%
here um she chose Maine because it was a
 
04:46:46.548 --> 04:46:46.558 align:start position:0%
very strong Health Care College small it
 
04:46:48.510 --> 04:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
fit what she wanted it wasn't that far
 
04:46:48.520 --> 04:46:49.390 align:start position:0%
fit what she wanted it wasn't that far
from

04:46:49.390 --> 04:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:46:55.750 --> 04:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
home um so we kept thinking that if
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
she if we waited and kept waiting people
 
04:47:02.350 --> 04:47:02.360 align:start position:0%
would realize the data wasn't supporting
 
04:47:04.030 --> 04:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
this you know there were breakthrough
 
04:47:06.990 --> 04:47:07.000 align:start position:0%
cases happening everywhere so we kept
 
04:47:09.788 --> 04:47:09.798 align:start position:0%
being very optimistic that eventually
 
04:47:12.830 --> 04:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
they would say yeah it's okay okay um
 
04:47:17.270 --> 04:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
which was very naive on my part um the
 
04:47:19.590 --> 04:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
end of July my daughter went to a
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
freshman Camp up at the school and they
 
04:47:25.230 --> 04:47:25.240 align:start position:0%
didn't require the vaccine for her to go
 
04:47:27.470 --> 04:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
to that freshman Camp she lived in the
 
04:47:30.350 --> 04:47:30.360 align:start position:0%
dorm she had a great time stayed up late
 
04:47:32.948 --> 04:47:32.958 align:start position:0%
hanging made friends did all sorts of
 
04:47:36.830 --> 04:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
things loved it um but they still were
 
04:47:39.030 --> 04:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
requiring the mandate to actually go to
 
04:47:42.430 --> 04:47:42.440 align:start position:0%
school in the fall
 
04:47:46.270 --> 04:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
um I tried to get medical exemption but
 
04:47:49.390 --> 04:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
at that time those were extremely hard
 
04:47:51.030 --> 04:47:51.040 align:start position:0%
to come
 
04:47:56.030 --> 04:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
by and we kept asking if we could get
 
04:47:58.628 --> 04:47:58.638 align:start position:0%
one and none of her doctors nobody felt
 
04:48:02.830 --> 04:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
that she had any reason not to get it if
 
04:48:05.430 --> 04:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
anything they felt because of her
 
04:48:08.628 --> 04:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
chronic pain condition that she should
 
04:48:13.430 --> 04:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:16.708 --> 04:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
Penza so I my family experienced that
 
04:48:21.510 --> 04:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
too with a daughter of mine so um do you
 
04:48:22.708 --> 04:48:22.718 align:start position:0%
feel as
 
04:48:26.708 --> 04:48:26.718 align:start position:0%
if kind of everything that we
 
04:48:30.230 --> 04:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
knew previous history all of these types
 
04:48:33.310 --> 04:48:33.320 align:start position:0%
of things you know um went out the
 
04:48:36.910 --> 04:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
window um even even of course kids that
 
04:48:39.310 --> 04:48:39.320 align:start position:0%
had you know disabilities and stuff that
 
04:48:41.350 --> 04:48:41.360 align:start position:0%
that went out the window and
 
04:48:43.110 --> 04:48:43.120 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't find any doctor
 
04:48:43.120 --> 04:48:45.350 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't find any doctor
anywhere

04:48:45.350 --> 04:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
anywhere
 
04:48:49.628 --> 04:48:49.638 align:start position:0%
absolutely and you to even bring it up
 
04:48:49.638 --> 04:48:50.590 align:start position:0%
absolutely and you to even bring it up
you

04:48:50.590 --> 04:48:50.600 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:48:54.030 --> 04:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
were um I felt like you were treated
 
04:48:57.548 --> 04:48:57.558 align:start position:0%
differently if you even brought it up um
 
04:48:57.558 --> 04:48:59.548 align:start position:0%
differently if you even brought it up um
they

04:48:59.548 --> 04:48:59.558 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:49:02.150 --> 04:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
so so she ended up getting it we
 
04:49:06.270 --> 04:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't get the medical exemption um my
 
04:49:08.230 --> 04:49:08.240 align:start position:0%
gut kept telling me not to let her get
 
04:49:10.350 --> 04:49:10.360 align:start position:0%
it um I didn't think there was enough
 
04:49:11.990 --> 04:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
resour SE Arch I didn't think there was
 
04:49:16.670 --> 04:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
Data there wasn't um I was just afraid
 
04:49:19.070 --> 04:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
of how she would react to
 
04:49:22.390 --> 04:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
it um so we waited until the last
 
04:49:25.708 --> 04:49:25.718 align:start position:0%
possible day August 4th
 
04:49:29.750 --> 04:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
2021 two weeks before she had to go to
 
04:49:32.590 --> 04:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
school we went up we got the vaccine
 
04:49:34.750 --> 04:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
that morning
 
04:49:38.948 --> 04:49:38.958 align:start position:0%
and stopped picked up lunch and went to
 
04:49:42.110 --> 04:49:42.120 align:start position:0%
the beach to eat and she said she was
 
04:49:43.910 --> 04:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
tired she wasn't feeling great she was
 
04:49:47.350 --> 04:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
tired and could we just go home so we
 
04:49:50.030 --> 04:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
did um we went home and she went
 
04:49:52.910 --> 04:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
upstairs to lay down and about 30
 
04:49:55.868 --> 04:49:55.878 align:start position:0%
minutes later she came back downstairs
 
04:49:58.350 --> 04:49:58.360 align:start position:0%
and told me she wasn't feeling well she
 
04:50:02.310 --> 04:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
said something's not right um she felt
 
04:50:05.390 --> 04:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
like her heart was racing she was sweaty
 
04:50:08.230 --> 04:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
and hot and we checked her heart rate
 
04:50:10.948 --> 04:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
and it was over 180
 
04:50:12.430 --> 04:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
um she was an
 
04:50:16.110 --> 04:50:16.120 align:start position:0%
athlete um so I called the doctor's
 
04:50:18.430 --> 04:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
office and I was told to take her
 
04:50:19.910 --> 04:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
directly to the
 
04:50:25.750 --> 04:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
ER um there the waiting room was full um
 
04:50:29.190 --> 04:50:29.200 align:start position:0%
it was um there were people who had been
 
04:50:32.868 --> 04:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
waiting for hours um but they took my
 
04:50:35.628 --> 04:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
daughter straight back um they did an
 
04:50:39.150 --> 04:50:39.160 align:start position:0%
EKG the EKG came back
 
04:50:41.430 --> 04:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
abnormal um
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
and she started feeling really sick like
 
04:50:46.190 --> 04:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
she was going to throw up she was very
 
04:50:49.830 --> 04:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
nauseous um so they gave her medication
 
04:50:53.190 --> 04:50:53.200 align:start position:0%
to try to slow her heart rate and after
 
04:50:55.190 --> 04:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
they would give her the medication her
 
04:50:58.150 --> 04:50:58.160 align:start position:0%
heart rate would drop for a few seconds
 
04:51:00.990 --> 04:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
and then it would Elevate right back up
 
04:51:03.628 --> 04:51:03.638 align:start position:0%
so they kept trying to figure out what
 
04:51:07.590 --> 04:51:07.600 align:start position:0%
was happening and eventually they told
 
04:51:10.150 --> 04:51:10.160 align:start position:0%
us that she was going to be admitted to
 
04:51:11.190 --> 04:51:11.200 align:start position:0%
the I
 
04:51:11.200 --> 04:51:13.230 align:start position:0%
the I
you

04:51:13.230 --> 04:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:51:18.030 --> 04:51:18.040 align:start position:0%
um she didn't feel good you know
 
04:51:20.430 --> 04:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
as I don't mean to interrupt you and I
 
04:51:23.590 --> 04:51:23.600 align:start position:0%
am so sorry that as a
 
04:51:29.310 --> 04:51:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:32.670 --> 04:51:32.680 align:start position:0%
issue two questions are
 
04:51:37.030 --> 04:51:37.040 align:start position:0%
one um where was she vaccinated at what
 
04:51:40.030 --> 04:51:40.040 align:start position:0%
vaccination did she get and I guess I do
 
04:51:41.230 --> 04:51:41.240 align:start position:0%
have a third
 
04:51:43.948 --> 04:51:43.958 align:start position:0%
question when you went to the ER did the
 
04:51:45.788 --> 04:51:45.798 align:start position:0%
doctors there ask you if she was
 
04:51:48.430 --> 04:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
vaccinated and when she received
 
04:51:51.150 --> 04:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
it so your first
 
04:51:54.628 --> 04:51:54.638 align:start position:0%
question because I was concerned we
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
actually made an appointment um at
 
04:52:00.830 --> 04:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
Hutchins Memorial Hospital in wolfboro
 
04:52:04.270 --> 04:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
because I wanted her not to be in a mall
 
04:52:04.280 --> 04:52:05.310 align:start position:0%
because I wanted her not to be in a mall
or

04:52:05.310 --> 04:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:52:07.150 --> 04:52:07.160 align:start position:0%
Anna you
 
04:52:11.270 --> 04:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
know yeah so that was where where I
 
04:52:13.788 --> 04:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
wanted her in a hospital setting because
 
04:52:16.110 --> 04:52:16.120 align:start position:0%
I was I was
 
04:52:18.948 --> 04:52:18.958 align:start position:0%
concerned um the second thing she got
 
04:52:21.670 --> 04:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
the Johnson and Johnson because we felt
 
04:52:25.868 --> 04:52:25.878 align:start position:0%
it was one and done you know get it she
 
04:52:28.350 --> 04:52:28.360 align:start position:0%
was done go to
 
04:52:30.670 --> 04:52:30.680 align:start position:0%
school third
 
04:52:33.670 --> 04:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
question forgive me what was your when
 
04:52:36.430 --> 04:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
she was admitted to the ER did they ask
 
04:52:38.190 --> 04:52:38.200 align:start position:0%
if she was vaccinated and then the
 
04:52:40.750 --> 04:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
second part of that was is did they
 
04:52:43.628 --> 04:52:43.638 align:start position:0%
asked when she was vaccinated
 
04:52:46.788 --> 04:52:46.798 align:start position:0%
so we told them I don't think I gave
 
04:52:48.470 --> 04:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
them the opportunity to ask that
 
04:52:51.070 --> 04:52:51.080 align:start position:0%
question I told them as soon as we got
 
04:52:53.350 --> 04:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
there that this was a vac that she had
 
04:52:55.830 --> 04:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
just gotten the vaccine and that this
 
04:52:59.910 --> 04:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
was happening with the vaccine um two
 
04:53:03.750 --> 04:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
things is they kept testing her for
 
04:53:06.548 --> 04:53:06.558 align:start position:0%
covid over and over for her entire
 
04:53:09.270 --> 04:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
Hospital stay and it kept coming back
 
04:53:12.310 --> 04:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
negative um um but
 
04:53:15.628 --> 04:53:15.638 align:start position:0%
they that was one thing that was very
 
04:53:19.110 --> 04:53:19.120 align:start position:0%
interesting um they ran a lot of blood
 
04:53:21.390 --> 04:53:21.400 align:start position:0%
work and they ran a lot of different
 
04:53:24.230 --> 04:53:24.240 align:start position:0%
tests and the diagnosis the immediate
 
04:53:26.150 --> 04:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
diagnosis was severe
 
04:53:30.110 --> 04:53:30.120 align:start position:0%
tachicardia um from induced from the
 
04:53:35.030 --> 04:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
vaccine um my daughter she turned to me
 
04:53:38.190 --> 04:53:38.200 align:start position:0%
and she just said Mommy I wish I didn't
 
04:53:39.270 --> 04:53:39.280 align:start position:0%
get the
 
04:53:43.510 --> 04:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:43.520 --> 04:53:45.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:53:45.390 --> 04:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:53:48.868 --> 04:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
and I just kept telling her yes it's
 
04:53:53.310 --> 04:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
going to be okay you know
 
04:53:56.628 --> 04:53:56.638 align:start position:0%
so after they told me she was going to
 
04:53:56.638 --> 04:53:57.590 align:start position:0%
so after they told me she was going to
the

04:53:57.590 --> 04:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:54:01.310 --> 04:54:01.320 align:start position:0%
ICU they told me because she had just
 
04:54:04.868 --> 04:54:04.878 align:start position:0%
turned 18 I couldn't go up with
 
04:54:04.878 --> 04:54:06.548 align:start position:0%
turned 18 I couldn't go up with
her

04:54:06.548 --> 04:54:06.558 align:start position:0%
her
 
04:54:10.510 --> 04:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
and so I ended up finally convincing
 
04:54:13.750 --> 04:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
them to allow me to go up and make sure
 
04:54:15.110 --> 04:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
she was settled and this is the middle
 
04:54:17.750 --> 04:54:17.760 align:start position:0%
of the night now so I convinced them to
 
04:54:20.670 --> 04:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
let me go up and set get her settled in
 
04:54:22.510 --> 04:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
and I did and the plan was for her to
 
04:54:25.470 --> 04:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
have a CT scan in the morning um they
 
04:54:28.990 --> 04:54:29.000 align:start position:0%
felt like she was comfortable and you
 
04:54:32.670 --> 04:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
know that she would be fine we got up to
 
04:54:34.150 --> 04:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
her room in the
 
04:54:38.190 --> 04:54:38.200 align:start position:0%
ICU um and we weren't even in the door
 
04:54:40.708 --> 04:54:40.718 align:start position:0%
of her room and the phone was ringing
 
04:54:42.548 --> 04:54:42.558 align:start position:0%
and it was the ER doctor saying they'd
 
04:54:44.830 --> 04:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
gotten test results back and that she
 
04:54:48.190 --> 04:54:48.200 align:start position:0%
needed to go immediately to CT for a
 
04:54:52.390 --> 04:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
scan at that right then um so that they
 
04:54:54.548 --> 04:54:54.558 align:start position:0%
could do a chest scan and see what was
 
04:54:57.070 --> 04:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
going on they felt something was wrong
 
04:54:58.750 --> 04:54:58.760 align:start position:0%
based on the blood work that they had
 
04:54:58.760 --> 04:54:59.910 align:start position:0%
based on the blood work that they had
gotten

04:54:59.910 --> 04:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
gotten
 
04:54:59.920 --> 04:55:01.910 align:start position:0%
gotten
back

04:55:01.910 --> 04:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
back
 
04:55:04.910 --> 04:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
um they told me I couldn't be
 
04:55:07.390 --> 04:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
there my daughter asked me if I would
 
04:55:10.548 --> 04:55:10.558 align:start position:0%
stay at the hotel next to the hospital
 
04:55:12.830 --> 04:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:55:16.910 --> 04:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
I so at that point I left um when they
 
04:55:18.390 --> 04:55:18.400 align:start position:0%
brought her down to the CT and I went in
 
04:55:20.150 --> 04:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
the parking lot and I sat in my car and
 
04:55:20.160 --> 04:55:21.270 align:start position:0%
the parking lot and I sat in my car and
I

04:55:21.270 --> 04:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:55:21.280 --> 04:55:22.788 align:start position:0%
I
cried

04:55:22.788 --> 04:55:22.798 align:start position:0%
cried
 
04:55:26.470 --> 04:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
um that was I was trying so hard the
 
04:55:29.510 --> 04:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
whole time we were there just to be mom
 
04:55:32.830 --> 04:55:32.840 align:start position:0%
and strong and so got out to the car and
 
04:55:37.390 --> 04:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
I cried and I'll tell you you know it's
 
04:55:39.548 --> 04:55:39.558 align:start position:0%
been really hard to forgive myself for
 
04:55:41.590 --> 04:55:41.600 align:start position:0%
letting her get that
 
04:55:45.270 --> 04:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine um that I didn't fight hard
 
04:55:47.948 --> 04:55:47.958 align:start position:0%
enough and listen to my gut to prevent
 
04:55:52.070 --> 04:55:52.080 align:start position:0%
her from H feeling that she had no other
 
04:55:57.548 --> 04:55:57.558 align:start position:0%
choice but the more I look back at
 
04:55:57.558 --> 04:55:59.750 align:start position:0%
choice but the more I look back at
this

04:55:59.750 --> 04:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:56:03.990 --> 04:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
um the more that I look back at this I'm
 
04:56:06.150 --> 04:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
upset with the
 
04:56:09.750 --> 04:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
system that brought this on that gave
 
04:56:11.190 --> 04:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
her no
 
04:56:15.990 --> 04:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
Choice um she spent 3 days in ICU and
 
04:56:17.628 --> 04:56:17.638 align:start position:0%
then she spent one more in just a
 
04:56:19.788 --> 04:56:19.798 align:start position:0%
regular bed and her heart rate would
 
04:56:22.670 --> 04:56:22.680 align:start position:0%
spike every time she moved so her
 
04:56:25.628 --> 04:56:25.638 align:start position:0%
resting heart rate over the next few
 
04:56:29.590 --> 04:56:29.600 align:start position:0%
days slowly went down to 140
 
04:56:32.830 --> 04:56:32.840 align:start position:0%
130 um I think they wanted it at 120 as
 
04:56:34.390 --> 04:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
a resting heart rate before they would
 
04:56:35.510 --> 04:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
let her go
 
04:56:39.070 --> 04:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
home um she had one of her friends came
 
04:56:40.868 --> 04:56:40.878 align:start position:0%
to visit and the mom called me
 
04:56:43.708 --> 04:56:43.718 align:start position:0%
afterwards and said Tara she cuz she's
 
04:56:45.750 --> 04:56:45.760 align:start position:0%
hooked up to all the monitors and
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
everything and she
 
04:56:52.510 --> 04:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
said my daughter said anytime Abby moved
 
04:56:55.910 --> 04:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
all her like just adjusting in bed her
 
04:56:57.948 --> 04:56:57.958 align:start position:0%
heart rate would spike just a simple
 
04:56:59.990 --> 04:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
thing sit up in your chair heart rate
 
04:57:03.350 --> 04:57:03.360 align:start position:0%
would spike machines go off and so it
 
04:57:07.150 --> 04:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
took you know that was what she was
 
04:57:11.070 --> 04:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with um so when we brought her
 
04:57:14.670 --> 04:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
home she was dizzy exhausted nauseous
 
04:57:17.430 --> 04:57:17.440 align:start position:0%
and she kept saying her heart hurt she
 
04:57:20.030 --> 04:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
kept saying her chest her heart it hurt
 
04:57:23.430 --> 04:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
but there was nothing wrong no answers
 
04:57:26.310 --> 04:57:26.320 align:start position:0%
Tac cardia um at one point I believe we
 
04:57:27.628 --> 04:57:27.638 align:start position:0%
were told
 
04:57:31.030 --> 04:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
that it was like she'd run a marathon
 
04:57:31.040 --> 04:57:32.510 align:start position:0%
that it was like she'd run a marathon
for

04:57:32.510 --> 04:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:57:35.350 --> 04:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
days and that she was healthy and fit
 
04:57:36.868 --> 04:57:36.878 align:start position:0%
which is what allowed her to run that
 
04:57:38.310 --> 04:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
Marathon for
 
04:57:42.548 --> 04:57:42.558 align:start position:0%
days um and so that might be why it
 
04:57:49.510 --> 04:57:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:53.110 --> 04:57:53.120 align:start position:0%
so we got home and my
 
04:57:55.948 --> 04:57:55.958 align:start position:0%
husband um let me back up for a minute
 
04:58:00.270 --> 04:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
here and catch my thoughts um I think I
 
04:58:01.948 --> 04:58:01.958 align:start position:0%
mentioned that I'm a little bit upset
 
04:58:03.910 --> 04:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
with the system that created this
 
04:58:06.230 --> 04:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
environment uh one thing I wanted to say
 
04:58:08.430 --> 04:58:08.440 align:start position:0%
is I felt they harassed her and they
 
04:58:12.110 --> 04:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
bullied her um um in so many different
 
04:58:15.150 --> 04:58:15.160 align:start position:0%
ways into getting an experimental
 
04:58:15.160 --> 04:58:16.670 align:start position:0%
ways into getting an experimental
unproven

04:58:16.670 --> 04:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
unproven
 
04:58:19.628 --> 04:58:19.638 align:start position:0%
vaccine in order to be able to live her
 
04:58:22.830 --> 04:58:22.840 align:start position:0%
life for 18 months covid was held over
 
04:58:25.470 --> 04:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
her head as to why she couldn't do
 
04:58:28.110 --> 04:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
anything then the covid vaccine was held
 
04:58:30.430 --> 04:58:30.440 align:start position:0%
over her head if she wanted to have the
 
04:58:33.430 --> 04:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
future that she wanted went from covid
 
04:58:35.590 --> 04:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
being held can't do anything because of
 
04:58:37.990 --> 04:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
Co to now you can't do anything because
 
04:58:41.190 --> 04:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
you're not vaccinated
 
04:58:45.310 --> 04:58:45.320 align:start position:0%
um at this point we had the knowledge
 
04:58:48.430 --> 04:58:48.440 align:start position:0%
the data that covid wasn't impacting our
 
04:58:48.440 --> 04:58:50.150 align:start position:0%
the data that covid wasn't impacting our
youth

04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
youth
 
04:58:53.670 --> 04:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
severely um we had the information we
 
04:58:57.430 --> 04:58:57.440 align:start position:0%
knew many many vaccinated in individuals
 
04:59:00.910 --> 04:59:00.920 align:start position:0%
who were getting covid with breakthrough
 
04:59:00.920 --> 04:59:02.548 align:start position:0%
who were getting covid with breakthrough
infections

04:59:02.548 --> 04:59:02.558 align:start position:0%
infections
 
04:59:05.510 --> 04:59:05.520 align:start position:0%
um when we came home from the
 
04:59:07.750 --> 04:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
hospital my husband would carry her up
 
04:59:10.590 --> 04:59:10.600 align:start position:0%
and down the stairs
 
04:59:10.600 --> 04:59:12.070 align:start position:0%
and down the stairs
um

04:59:12.070 --> 04:59:12.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:14.628 --> 04:59:14.638 align:start position:0%
so every night we'd carry her up every
 
04:59:16.190 --> 04:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
morning we'd bring her
 
04:59:16.200 --> 04:59:18.070 align:start position:0%
morning we'd bring her
down

04:59:18.070 --> 04:59:18.080 align:start position:0%
down
 
04:59:20.750 --> 04:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
um we got a stool for the shower so that
 
04:59:24.910 --> 04:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
she could take showers um so we did
 
04:59:27.150 --> 04:59:27.160 align:start position:0%
everything we could to make her
 
04:59:29.708 --> 04:59:29.718 align:start position:0%
comfortable and let her lead her
 
04:59:32.788 --> 04:59:32.798 align:start position:0%
life um she lost 20
 
04:59:37.948 --> 04:59:37.958 align:start position:0%
lbs um she's 5'2 and she weighed 110 PBS
 
04:59:40.548 --> 04:59:40.558 align:start position:0%
uh so she dropped down to 90 lbs she
 
04:59:44.030 --> 04:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
couldn't eat she felt horrible and
 
04:59:46.590 --> 04:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
despite all of that she somehow managed
 
04:59:48.750 --> 04:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
to go to school that first
 
04:59:51.548 --> 04:59:51.558 align:start position:0%
semester um we didn't want to take that
 
04:59:53.868 --> 04:59:53.878 align:start position:0%
away from her my husband and I went
 
04:59:55.628 --> 04:59:55.638 align:start position:0%
round and round on whether or not we let
 
04:59:59.030 --> 04:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
her go to school we talked to the school
 
05:00:00.070 --> 05:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
we got
 
05:00:03.788 --> 05:00:03.798 align:start position:0%
accommodations um she would get hot
 
05:00:06.190 --> 05:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
flashes and so they let us put an air
 
05:00:07.430 --> 05:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
conditioner in her
 
05:00:10.948 --> 05:00:10.958 align:start position:0%
room um we simplified her schedule so it
 
05:00:12.868 --> 05:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
was the bare
 
05:00:15.948 --> 05:00:15.958 align:start position:0%
basic um bare minimum so that she could
 
05:00:18.110 --> 05:00:18.120 align:start position:0%
try to have that college
 
05:00:20.190 --> 05:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
experience um they ended up moving her
 
05:00:22.910 --> 05:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
to a single room uh just because she
 
05:00:24.670 --> 05:00:24.680 align:start position:0%
needed to rest so
 
05:00:28.270 --> 05:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
often um and it was just she's 18 and
 
05:00:30.510 --> 05:00:30.520 align:start position:0%
this is how her college experience
 
05:00:32.948 --> 05:00:32.958 align:start position:0%
started um that first semester was
 
05:00:35.110 --> 05:00:35.120 align:start position:0%
filled with doctor's appointments we
 
05:00:37.150 --> 05:00:37.160 align:start position:0%
would drive back and forth my husband
 
05:00:39.070 --> 05:00:39.080 align:start position:0%
and I to pick her up and bring her down
 
05:00:42.190 --> 05:00:42.200 align:start position:0%
and then bring her back back um just do
 
05:00:45.948 --> 05:00:45.958 align:start position:0%
whatever we could so that she could be
 
05:00:51.190 --> 05:00:51.200 align:start position:0%
at College have that but still get the
 
05:00:54.788 --> 05:00:54.798 align:start position:0%
treatment that she needed and she she
 
05:00:58.390 --> 05:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
wanted the social she wanted to be there
 
05:01:01.190 --> 05:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
um she tells me now that she doesn't
 
05:01:03.230 --> 05:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
remember very much about her freshman
 
05:01:06.868 --> 05:01:06.878 align:start position:0%
semester which doesn't surprise me at
 
05:01:10.150 --> 05:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
all um I will never forget one call that
 
05:01:14.350 --> 05:01:14.360 align:start position:0%
I got from her and a friend of hers uh
 
05:01:18.590 --> 05:01:18.600 align:start position:0%
her heart hurt really bad and her friend
 
05:01:21.670 --> 05:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
said she looks green she doesn't look
 
05:01:25.868 --> 05:01:25.878 align:start position:0%
good something's not right um she was
 
05:01:27.548 --> 05:01:27.558 align:start position:0%
dizzy nauseous and they didn't know what
 
05:01:27.558 --> 05:01:28.510 align:start position:0%
dizzy nauseous and they didn't know what
to

05:01:28.510 --> 05:01:28.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:01:31.390 --> 05:01:31.400 align:start position:0%
do and she told me she thought she was
 
05:01:32.788 --> 05:01:32.798 align:start position:0%
having a heart
 
05:01:37.548 --> 05:01:37.558 align:start position:0%
attack so we went to the ER um they did
 
05:01:39.548 --> 05:01:39.558 align:start position:0%
an EKG said everything looked normal and
 
05:01:39.558 --> 05:01:41.110 align:start position:0%
an EKG said everything looked normal and
S

05:01:41.110 --> 05:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
S
 
05:01:41.120 --> 05:01:42.628 align:start position:0%
S
home

05:01:42.628 --> 05:01:42.638 align:start position:0%
home
 
05:01:47.350 --> 05:01:47.360 align:start position:0%
um really nobody knew what was
 
05:01:50.510 --> 05:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
happening and my perception and my
 
05:01:52.190 --> 05:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
feeling was that when they heard this
 
05:01:54.310 --> 05:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
was a vaccine
 
05:01:57.190 --> 05:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
injury I felt like people didn't want to
 
05:01:59.350 --> 05:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
be involved with
 
05:02:05.190 --> 05:02:05.200 align:start position:0%
it um so we had no answers we had no it
 
05:02:08.548 --> 05:02:08.558 align:start position:0%
was this is she'll get better or we
 
05:02:10.190 --> 05:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
don't know we don't have have any
 
05:02:14.150 --> 05:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
answers for you um so that was her
 
05:02:18.948 --> 05:02:18.958 align:start position:0%
freshman year um we she decided and we
 
05:02:21.230 --> 05:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
decided she would not go back to school
 
05:02:22.030 --> 05:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:02:25.590 --> 05:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
spring um she kept we kept her home to
 
05:02:28.190 --> 05:02:28.200 align:start position:0%
try and heal and we did get some
 
05:02:31.868 --> 05:02:31.878 align:start position:0%
answers um in addition to tac cardia she
 
05:02:31.878 --> 05:02:32.670 align:start position:0%
answers um in addition to tac cardia she
has

05:02:32.670 --> 05:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
has
 
05:02:36.948 --> 05:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
pots um and
 
05:02:40.628 --> 05:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
gastroparesis so her pots uh which is
 
05:02:43.030 --> 05:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
postoral orthostatic tacac cardia
 
05:02:45.070 --> 05:02:45.080 align:start position:0%
syndrome that's being treated by a
 
05:02:47.030 --> 05:02:47.040 align:start position:0%
neurologist with a medication that she
 
05:02:50.230 --> 05:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
takes three times a day um and that has
 
05:02:52.510 --> 05:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
helped her with some of the dizziness
 
05:02:55.548 --> 05:02:55.558 align:start position:0%
and some of those symptoms and her heart
 
05:02:55.558 --> 05:02:56.830 align:start position:0%
and some of those symptoms and her heart
rate

05:02:56.830 --> 05:02:56.840 align:start position:0%
rate
 
05:02:59.110 --> 05:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
fluctuation uh her gastroparesis is
 
05:03:01.990 --> 05:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
being treated by a gastron neurologist
 
05:03:04.070 --> 05:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
with medication that she takes
 
05:03:07.750 --> 05:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
daily that medication cost 600 plus a
 
05:03:11.110 --> 05:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
month um and a few weeks ago her
 
05:03:15.030 --> 05:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
insurance declined it um after two years
 
05:03:18.110 --> 05:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
of being on it it was
 
05:03:21.670 --> 05:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
declined and so we went back and forth
 
05:03:24.830 --> 05:03:24.840 align:start position:0%
we finally got to the point where
 
05:03:28.390 --> 05:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
she said I was getting texts from her
 
05:03:31.030 --> 05:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
and calls from her and she find she's
 
05:03:33.310 --> 05:03:33.320 align:start position:0%
like Mom I'm nauseous my stomach hurts I
 
05:03:35.390 --> 05:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
can't eat I've lost weight
 
05:03:38.750 --> 05:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
again so I said I'm going to pick the
 
05:03:40.350 --> 05:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
medication up right now now it doesn't
 
05:03:43.230 --> 05:03:43.240 align:start position:0%
matter what it costs you need
 
05:03:43.240 --> 05:03:45.430 align:start position:0%
matter what it costs you need
it

05:03:45.430 --> 05:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:03:47.590 --> 05:03:47.600 align:start position:0%
thankfully the insurance approved it
 
05:03:47.600 --> 05:03:48.708 align:start position:0%
thankfully the insurance approved it
that

05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:03:53.270 --> 05:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
day um so that was two days ago and so
 
05:03:55.788 --> 05:03:55.798 align:start position:0%
she is starting to feel a little bit
 
05:03:58.110 --> 05:03:58.120 align:start position:0%
better now
 
05:04:02.750 --> 05:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
fortunately um so
 
05:04:05.548 --> 05:04:05.558 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it showed us that she's
 
05:04:07.190 --> 05:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
still dealing with these health issues
 
05:04:08.510 --> 05:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
they haven't gone
 
05:04:10.350 --> 05:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
away um
 
05:04:12.030 --> 05:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
does she need to be on these medications
 
05:04:16.350 --> 05:04:16.360 align:start position:0%
the rest of her life I don't know um I
 
05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
hope not I hope we can find a way to get
 
05:04:21.868 --> 05:04:21.878 align:start position:0%
her off from them I hope we can find a
 
05:04:24.430 --> 05:04:24.440 align:start position:0%
way to help figure out what's causing
 
05:04:28.150 --> 05:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
the pain in her chest um she'll still
 
05:04:30.590 --> 05:04:30.600 align:start position:0%
have that and nobody knows what causes
 
05:04:34.830 --> 05:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
that um we've just been to so many
 
05:04:37.390 --> 05:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
doctors appointments therapy we've gone
 
05:04:42.030 --> 05:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
a uh different types of doctors as well
 
05:04:44.070 --> 05:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
um because a lot of the treatments
 
05:04:46.470 --> 05:04:46.480 align:start position:0%
aren't covered by insurance if you want
 
05:04:50.590 --> 05:04:50.600 align:start position:0%
to have um acupuncture or if you want to
 
05:04:50.600 --> 05:04:52.150 align:start position:0%
to have um acupuncture or if you want to
have

05:04:52.150 --> 05:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:04:56.910 --> 05:04:56.920 align:start position:0%
IVs um to try to help rebalance the body
 
05:04:59.990 --> 05:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
um getting some of the blood work done
 
05:05:02.150 --> 05:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
is not something that most doctors will
 
05:05:05.470 --> 05:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
order so we've gone to different um
 
05:05:08.470 --> 05:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
individuals to try to get additional
 
05:05:11.190 --> 05:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
answers um that we haven't been able to
 
05:05:13.750 --> 05:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
get through traditional doctors and that
 
05:05:18.310 --> 05:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
we all we pay for out of pocket um she
 
05:05:21.190 --> 05:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
has been through so much and yet
 
05:05:23.910 --> 05:05:23.920 align:start position:0%
she continues to always have a smile and
 
05:05:25.310 --> 05:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
a positive
 
05:05:28.310 --> 05:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
attitude um currently she's in the
 
05:05:29.990 --> 05:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
process finishing up her junior year in
 
05:05:32.430 --> 05:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
college and looking at graduate programs
 
05:05:36.070 --> 05:05:36.080 align:start position:0%
to continue on to the medical field um
 
05:05:37.910 --> 05:05:37.920 align:start position:0%
she still wants to go to the medical
 
05:05:40.590 --> 05:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
field and help people
 
05:05:43.350 --> 05:05:43.360 align:start position:0%
um she has a medical exemption for all
 
05:05:46.670 --> 05:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines going forward and she also has
 
05:05:50.990 --> 05:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
a permanent handicap placard um as
 
05:05:53.110 --> 05:05:53.120 align:start position:0%
well we were
 
05:05:56.628 --> 05:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
told that not having a vaccine may
 
05:05:58.948 --> 05:05:58.958 align:start position:0%
impact her ability to get clinicals and
 
05:06:03.910 --> 05:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:08.230 --> 05:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
school interesting thing right now
 
05:06:11.948 --> 05:06:11.958 align:start position:0%
unfortunately even even though medical
 
05:06:14.548 --> 05:06:14.558 align:start position:0%
professionals no longer are required to
 
05:06:18.868 --> 05:06:18.878 align:start position:0%
get the vaccine covid vaccine and even
 
05:06:21.708 --> 05:06:21.718 align:start position:0%
though schools many colleges no longer
 
05:06:25.270 --> 05:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
mandate the covid
 
05:06:30.628 --> 05:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
vaccine there is a group of people that
 
05:06:32.948 --> 05:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
are still being
 
05:06:37.230 --> 05:06:37.240 align:start position:0%
pressured and required to get that and
 
05:06:39.910 --> 05:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
that is our college students who want to
 
05:06:41.750 --> 05:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
go into the medical
 
05:06:43.830 --> 05:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
professional and what they hold over
 
05:06:47.628 --> 05:06:47.638 align:start position:0%
their head is the inability to get
 
05:06:49.430 --> 05:06:49.440 align:start position:0%
clinicals or
 
05:06:51.750 --> 05:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
rotations and you need to provide your
 
05:06:54.470 --> 05:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
vaccination status in
 
05:07:01.470 --> 05:07:01.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:05.350 --> 05:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
clinicals so forgive me for my ignorance
 
05:07:08.910 --> 05:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
here um but if she's already been
 
05:07:11.830 --> 05:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
vaccinated with with the J&amp;J which was a
 
05:07:14.670 --> 05:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
oneandone why would she be denied
 
05:07:17.350 --> 05:07:17.360 align:start position:0%
clinicals because she is vaccinated so
 
05:07:20.788 --> 05:07:20.798 align:start position:0%
the j&amp; J she is vaccinated on what she
 
05:07:23.350 --> 05:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
is not now because she has a medical
 
05:07:27.230 --> 05:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
waiver for all she is not vaccinated for
 
05:07:31.230 --> 05:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
the flu um she is
 
05:07:34.628 --> 05:07:34.638 align:start position:0%
also had to do a tighter test for
 
05:07:36.750 --> 05:07:36.760 align:start position:0%
hepatitis B I believe it
 
05:07:39.990 --> 05:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
was and even though she had when she was
 
05:07:40.000 --> 05:07:40.910 align:start position:0%
was and even though she had when she was
very

05:07:40.910 --> 05:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
very
 
05:07:44.230 --> 05:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
young three I believe it was three doses
 
05:07:48.788 --> 05:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
of the Hep B I believe it's Hep B um
 
05:07:51.788 --> 05:07:51.798 align:start position:0%
vaccine her tighter test came back that
 
05:07:53.750 --> 05:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
she had
 
05:07:53.760 --> 05:07:55.350 align:start position:0%
she had
zero

05:07:55.350 --> 05:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
zero
 
05:07:57.910 --> 05:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
particles of That vaccine so she is
 
05:07:57.920 --> 05:07:58.868 align:start position:0%
particles of That vaccine so she is
completely

05:07:58.868 --> 05:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
completely
 
05:08:01.310 --> 05:08:01.320 align:start position:0%
unprotected and therefore she also needs
 
05:08:03.948 --> 05:08:03.958 align:start position:0%
to get the he B
 
05:08:03.958 --> 05:08:05.548 align:start position:0%
to get the he B
vaccine

05:08:05.548 --> 05:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
05:08:09.910 --> 05:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
so yes she is considered vaccinated for
 
05:08:13.868 --> 05:08:13.878 align:start position:0%
covid now there are other medical
 
05:08:15.310 --> 05:08:15.320 align:start position:0%
students who are
 
05:08:18.390 --> 05:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
not um I had an opportunity to meet a
 
05:08:20.670 --> 05:08:20.680 align:start position:0%
couple of wonderful gentlemen who are in
 
05:08:22.110 --> 05:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
a nursing
 
05:08:25.110 --> 05:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
program and they went
 
05:08:27.230 --> 05:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
down I can't I think they went to
 
05:08:27.240 --> 05:08:28.310 align:start position:0%
down I can't I think they went to
Liberty

05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
Liberty
 
05:08:30.708 --> 05:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
College because it was the only place
 
05:08:32.548 --> 05:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
that they knew they could get
 
05:08:35.788 --> 05:08:35.798 align:start position:0%
clinicals so even
 
05:08:38.190 --> 05:08:38.200 align:start position:0%
today this is still
 
05:08:41.628 --> 05:08:41.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:44.350 --> 05:08:44.360 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how to phrase this but
 
05:08:44.360 --> 05:08:45.350 align:start position:0%
um I don't know how to phrase this but
it's

05:08:45.350 --> 05:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's
 
05:08:45.360 --> 05:08:47.310 align:start position:0%
it's
still

05:08:47.310 --> 05:08:47.320 align:start position:0%
still
 
05:08:50.350 --> 05:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
impacting students who want to go into
 
05:08:53.390 --> 05:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
the medical Fields because they have to
 
05:08:55.868 --> 05:08:55.878 align:start position:0%
provide their vaccination
 
05:08:58.788 --> 05:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
statuses and it may not allow them to
 
05:09:00.788 --> 05:09:00.798 align:start position:0%
get the clinicals and the rotations that
 
05:09:00.798 --> 05:09:03.030 align:start position:0%
get the clinicals and the rotations that
they

05:09:03.030 --> 05:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:08.190 --> 05:09:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:11.270 --> 05:09:11.280 align:start position:0%
Penza go going back to when she first
 
05:09:13.990 --> 05:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
was in the hospital can you do you mind
 
05:09:18.590 --> 05:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
saying where she first was with her um
 
05:09:20.310 --> 05:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
like where she like where she went when
 
05:09:22.990 --> 05:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
she stayed when she was in ICU where
 
05:09:25.910 --> 05:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
those were she was in exitor hos
 
05:09:28.510 --> 05:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
hospital did she ever go any other place
 
05:09:30.990 --> 05:09:31.000 align:start position:0%
outside of exitor not not for that
 
05:09:35.510 --> 05:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
hospital stay no okay um for
 
05:09:41.548 --> 05:09:41.558 align:start position:0%
subsequent um any other she has gone to
 
05:09:46.948 --> 05:09:46.958 align:start position:0%
the ER in Portsmith she has gone to
 
05:09:49.510 --> 05:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
Boston children that's what I she has
 
05:09:52.708 --> 05:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
gone to Mass General okay she has gone
 
05:09:56.350 --> 05:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
to she had a team of four neurologist
 
05:10:02.470 --> 05:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
one was a um the autonomic dysfunction
 
05:10:06.708 --> 05:10:06.718 align:start position:0%
neurologist one was the gastro
 
05:10:09.868 --> 05:10:09.878 align:start position:0%
neurologist one was
 
05:10:12.548 --> 05:10:12.558 align:start position:0%
a movement specialist
 
05:10:15.628 --> 05:10:15.638 align:start position:0%
because her chronic pain has gone into
 
05:10:18.788 --> 05:10:18.798 align:start position:0%
severe pain a severe Flare from all of
 
05:10:21.830 --> 05:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
this um she's not been able to
 
05:10:21.840 --> 05:10:24.310 align:start position:0%
this um she's not been able to
walk

05:10:24.310 --> 05:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
walk
 
05:10:27.110 --> 05:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
um so she sees a movement disorder
 
05:10:28.830 --> 05:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
specialist and she sees a pain
 
05:10:31.628 --> 05:10:31.638 align:start position:0%
management specialist as well are those
 
05:10:35.830 --> 05:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
all out out of Massachusetts no she goes
 
05:10:38.270 --> 05:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
to Dover which is affiliated with Mass
 
05:10:41.190 --> 05:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
General yeah Mass so it's a bit of a mix
 
05:10:43.990 --> 05:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's a bit of a mix of where she goes
 
05:10:48.990 --> 05:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:49.000 --> 05:10:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
y

05:10:51.910 --> 05:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
y
 
05:10:55.990 --> 05:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:00.670 --> 05:11:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:04.548 --> 05:11:04.558 align:start position:0%
back is there anything that you feel
 
05:11:07.590 --> 05:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
that the state should have done
 
05:11:10.310 --> 05:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
differently anything going forward that
 
05:11:12.190 --> 05:11:12.200 align:start position:0%
we should be looking
 
05:11:16.070 --> 05:11:16.080 align:start position:0%
at um and any suggestions for anything
 
05:11:18.030 --> 05:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
in the future that may come down the
 
05:11:22.030 --> 05:11:22.040 align:start position:0%
pike um just want to see what your ideas
 
05:11:24.990 --> 05:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
are or your opinions um if you don't
 
05:11:27.788 --> 05:11:27.798 align:start position:0%
mind no that's
 
05:11:31.948 --> 05:11:31.958 align:start position:0%
um yeah um I mean in terms of what the
 
05:11:35.628 --> 05:11:35.638 align:start position:0%
state could have been done
 
05:11:39.830 --> 05:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
differently at the beginning there was
 
05:11:44.990 --> 05:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
this fear of the death rate was
 
05:11:48.830 --> 05:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
supposedly so high on this um on covid
 
05:11:51.470 --> 05:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
when it first came out and that that
 
05:11:51.480 --> 05:11:52.470 align:start position:0%
when it first came out and that that
scared

05:11:52.470 --> 05:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
scared
 
05:11:56.070 --> 05:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
everybody but I think once that
 
05:12:00.548 --> 05:12:00.558 align:start position:0%
information and the data started coming
 
05:12:03.390 --> 05:12:03.400 align:start position:0%
out and it was
 
05:12:07.750 --> 05:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
available I think there was a concerted
 
05:12:10.270 --> 05:12:10.280 align:start position:0%
lack of effort
 
05:12:14.150 --> 05:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
to share that um one thing I'd like to
 
05:12:17.868 --> 05:12:17.878 align:start position:0%
say also is and I I haven't even talked
 
05:12:22.510 --> 05:12:22.520 align:start position:0%
about the censoring that went on um I
 
05:12:24.510 --> 05:12:24.520 align:start position:0%
brought a
 
05:12:26.830 --> 05:12:26.840 align:start position:0%
post that my daughter
 
05:12:26.840 --> 05:12:28.548 align:start position:0%
post that my daughter
made

05:12:28.548 --> 05:12:28.558 align:start position:0%
made
 
05:12:32.150 --> 05:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
because two months after she
 
05:12:35.030 --> 05:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
was after her vaccine
 
05:12:39.788 --> 05:12:39.798 align:start position:0%
injury she wanted to share because
 
05:12:41.670 --> 05:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
nobody understood why she was so
 
05:12:44.030 --> 05:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
physically depleted up there and she
 
05:12:45.990 --> 05:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
wanted them to know this isn't me you
 
05:12:48.390 --> 05:12:48.400 align:start position:0%
know this and all she kept hearing was
 
05:12:50.190 --> 05:12:50.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine vaccine vaccine that was still
 
05:12:53.830 --> 05:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
being pushed everywhere so she made a
 
05:12:56.510 --> 05:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
post and I'm going to read exactly what
 
05:13:00.350 --> 05:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
she wrote um this is not a post I would
 
05:13:02.470 --> 05:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
typically make but I feel compelled to
 
05:13:06.390 --> 05:13:06.400 align:start position:0%
share my story I am not antivaccine but
 
05:13:08.670 --> 05:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
I do believe in medical Freedom as
 
05:13:11.990 --> 05:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
people know their body best I got the
 
05:13:14.990 --> 05:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
covid vaccine in early August and that
 
05:13:18.110 --> 05:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
night I was admitted to the ICU two
 
05:13:20.708 --> 05:13:20.718 align:start position:0%
months later I'm still dealing with side
 
05:13:24.350 --> 05:13:24.360 align:start position:0%
effects everyone including medical
 
05:13:27.670 --> 05:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
professionals disregarded my concerns
 
05:13:29.708 --> 05:13:29.718 align:start position:0%
due to my underlying
 
05:13:32.670 --> 05:13:32.680 align:start position:0%
conditions which was that pain condition
 
05:13:35.070 --> 05:13:35.080 align:start position:0%
that she had they all told me to get the
 
05:13:37.670 --> 05:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
shot and they wouldn't give me a medical
 
05:13:41.230 --> 05:13:41.240 align:start position:0%
waiver after my reaction everyone says I
 
05:13:43.190 --> 05:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
should have gotten a medical waiver but
 
05:13:46.590 --> 05:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
by then it was too late it makes me sad
 
05:13:50.670 --> 05:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
to see the level of anger and pressure
 
05:13:53.350 --> 05:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
towards people who are remaining
 
05:13:56.110 --> 05:13:56.120 align:start position:0%
unvaccinated when no one except them
 
05:13:57.868 --> 05:13:57.878 align:start position:0%
knows their particular
 
05:14:01.150 --> 05:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
situation please have compassion and
 
05:14:02.910 --> 05:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
understanding that people are doing the
 
05:14:05.230 --> 05:14:05.240 align:start position:0%
best they can with the information that
 
05:14:07.948 --> 05:14:07.958 align:start position:0%
is out there she made this post on
 
05:14:10.788 --> 05:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
October 21st of
 
05:14:13.948 --> 05:14:13.958 align:start position:0%
2021 and I she included a picture of
 
05:14:15.868 --> 05:14:15.878 align:start position:0%
herself in the hospital
 
05:14:19.110 --> 05:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
bed what you might probably can't see
 
05:14:21.310 --> 05:14:21.320 align:start position:0%
from where you're sitting is that post
 
05:14:23.628 --> 05:14:23.638 align:start position:0%
was tagged by

removed comments
 
05:14:57.110 --> 05:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
tagged there was a degree of information
 
05:15:00.628 --> 05:15:00.638 align:start position:0%
that we were not even allowed to share
 
05:15:03.350 --> 05:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
what happened to her with
 
05:15:06.868 --> 05:15:06.878 align:start position:0%
anybody and I the interesting thing is I
 
05:15:10.590 --> 05:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
went back last night
 
05:15:13.590 --> 05:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:16.190 --> 05:15:16.200 align:start position:0%
removed so it's no longer important for
 
05:15:18.830 --> 05:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
them to share that information now but
 
05:15:21.670 --> 05:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
it was when my daughter posted about
 
05:15:24.948 --> 05:15:24.958 align:start position:0%
that vaccine and the reason I share that
 
05:15:28.510 --> 05:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
is because I think in my heart I feel
 
05:15:34.430 --> 05:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:36.750 --> 05:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
understand what she was going through it
 
05:15:39.948 --> 05:15:39.958 align:start position:0%
represents just a small piece of what
 
05:15:42.390 --> 05:15:42.400 align:start position:0%
she had to deal with when she spoke to
 
05:15:44.270 --> 05:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
people about her vaccine
 
05:15:49.548 --> 05:15:49.558 align:start position:0%
injury and I'll tell you I
 
05:15:54.150 --> 05:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
had I had a close friend of ours so
 
05:15:56.510 --> 05:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
immediately after it we focused on our
 
05:16:00.470 --> 05:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
health but then it didn't take us long
 
05:16:02.548 --> 05:16:02.558 align:start position:0%
to realize that people really didn't
 
05:16:06.070 --> 05:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
want to hear about her vaccine injury
 
05:16:09.628 --> 05:16:09.638 align:start position:0%
because that was the that made people
 
05:16:11.590 --> 05:16:11.600 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable because everything they
 
05:16:14.070 --> 05:16:14.080 align:start position:0%
heard up to that point safe and
 
05:16:16.910 --> 05:16:16.920 align:start position:0%
effective it's all safe and effective so
 
05:16:19.430 --> 05:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
one close friend of ours actually
 
05:16:20.990 --> 05:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
suggested to
 
05:16:23.590 --> 05:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
me couple of days after Abby got home
 
05:16:26.110 --> 05:16:26.120 align:start position:0%
from the hospital that I should feel
 
05:16:27.948 --> 05:16:27.958 align:start position:0%
better now that she was vaccinated and
 
05:16:29.670 --> 05:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
could prevent PE other people from
 
05:16:29.680 --> 05:16:31.628 align:start position:0%
could prevent PE other people from
getting

05:16:31.628 --> 05:16:31.638 align:start position:0%
getting
 
05:16:35.070 --> 05:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
covid I had another woman tell me
 
05:16:37.230 --> 05:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
vaccine injuries are rare and that a
 
05:16:39.110 --> 05:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
certain rate of severe injuries was was
 
05:16:42.750 --> 05:16:42.760 align:start position:0%
okay in her mind for the better of the
 
05:16:46.030 --> 05:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:46.040 --> 05:16:48.150 align:start position:0%
 
population

05:16:48.150 --> 05:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
population
 
05:16:50.868 --> 05:16:50.878 align:start position:0%
so this is what we would we were going
 
05:16:54.230 --> 05:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
through on top of trying to heal I also
 
05:16:57.030 --> 05:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
wrote letters
 
05:17:00.548 --> 05:17:00.558 align:start position:0%
to um I
 
05:17:02.868 --> 05:17:02.878 align:start position:0%
wrote I've got two more topics that I
 
05:17:04.708 --> 05:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
really want to talk about one is the
 
05:17:09.230 --> 05:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
letters that I wrote to our Senators and
 
05:17:13.830 --> 05:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
the other one is about our V's
 
05:17:18.190 --> 05:17:18.200 align:start position:0%
experience um so I wrote letters because
 
05:17:21.350 --> 05:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
I felt like we weren't hearing anything
 
05:17:25.430 --> 05:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
so I sent those emails and a staffer
 
05:17:27.070 --> 05:17:27.080 align:start position:0%
from either Maggie Hassen or jeene
 
05:17:28.948 --> 05:17:28.958 align:start position:0%
Shaheen's office I cannot remember which
 
05:17:31.670 --> 05:17:31.680 align:start position:0%
office it was called me quite some time
 
05:17:33.830 --> 05:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
after I'd sent the letter to
 
05:17:36.310 --> 05:17:36.320 align:start position:0%
them and they called
 
05:17:39.830 --> 05:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
me because they wanted to ensure me that
 
05:17:42.590 --> 05:17:42.600 align:start position:0%
the senator was working diligently to
 
05:17:44.910 --> 05:17:44.920 align:start position:0%
ensure everyone was vaccinated in a
 
05:17:44.920 --> 05:17:48.070 align:start position:0%
ensure everyone was vaccinated in a
timely

05:17:48.070 --> 05:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:50.830 --> 05:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
manner they had a canned speech prepared
 
05:17:52.990 --> 05:17:53.000 align:start position:0%
for me that had nothing to do with my
 
05:17:55.830 --> 05:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
email or what happened to my
 
05:17:58.548 --> 05:17:58.558 align:start position:0%
daughter the only commonality was that
 
05:18:00.270 --> 05:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
it was vaccine
 
05:18:03.350 --> 05:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
related so I explained my purpose for
 
05:18:05.628 --> 05:18:05.638 align:start position:0%
reaching out to them and they said they
 
05:18:08.110 --> 05:18:08.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't answer my questions and offer
 
05:18:10.670 --> 05:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
to have someone else call me I then got
 
05:18:13.628 --> 05:18:13.638 align:start position:0%
a senior staffer who reached out who
 
05:18:15.510 --> 05:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
then explained to me how rare these
 
05:18:17.430 --> 05:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
injuries were they were sorry for my
 
05:18:22.030 --> 05:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
daughter um and that unfortunately my
 
05:18:25.190 --> 05:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
daughter was just a casualty for the
 
05:18:28.510 --> 05:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
greater good of the
 
05:18:33.070 --> 05:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
population I then asked if these vaccine
 
05:18:36.510 --> 05:18:36.520 align:start position:0%
reactions were so rare why had no one
 
05:18:39.708 --> 05:18:39.718 align:start position:0%
reached out to us from the CDC from
 
05:18:42.590 --> 05:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
Johnson and Johnson from the government
 
05:18:42.600 --> 05:18:43.510 align:start position:0%
Johnson and Johnson from the government
from

05:18:43.510 --> 05:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:18:47.030 --> 05:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
anybody why had no one wanted to learn
 
05:18:49.030 --> 05:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
what might have triggered this reaction
 
05:18:51.990 --> 05:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
in my daughter that was so
 
05:18:55.788 --> 05:18:55.798 align:start position:0%
rare Why did no one want to learn that
 
05:18:57.788 --> 05:18:57.798 align:start position:0%
the other thing
 
05:19:02.708 --> 05:19:02.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:07.430 --> 05:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:10.670 --> 05:19:10.680 align:start position:0%
Penza um
 
05:19:13.788 --> 05:19:13.798 align:start position:0%
first question is in in regards with um
 
05:19:14.948 --> 05:19:14.958 align:start position:0%
I know what you're talking about with
 
05:19:17.788 --> 05:19:17.798 align:start position:0%
the form letter multiple times I can't
 
05:19:19.150 --> 05:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
tell you how many people tell us the
 
05:19:20.590 --> 05:19:20.600 align:start position:0%
same thing it's like it's not even read
 
05:19:22.948 --> 05:19:22.958 align:start position:0%
and it's just an instant response which
 
05:19:25.548 --> 05:19:25.558 align:start position:0%
is it's like adding gasoline to a fire I
 
05:19:27.830 --> 05:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
get it um
 
05:19:31.510 --> 05:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
locally um I've heard from many
 
05:19:34.708 --> 05:19:34.718 align:start position:0%
constituents um that there was never a
 
05:19:39.430 --> 05:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
response from our governor that that was
 
05:19:41.510 --> 05:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
on every so you didn't hear back from
 
05:19:45.230 --> 05:19:45.240 align:start position:0%
that office at all no correct okay no I
 
05:19:46.788 --> 05:19:46.798 align:start position:0%
guess the question is as you reached out
 
05:19:49.510 --> 05:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
to the US senators but no one in the
 
05:19:53.270 --> 05:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
state government I I did I I blanketed a
 
05:19:56.868 --> 05:19:56.878 align:start position:0%
lot of emails um but the only person I
 
05:19:59.110 --> 05:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
heard back from was that one Senator's
 
05:20:02.070 --> 05:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
office okay thank you yeah
 
05:20:02.080 --> 05:20:03.750 align:start position:0%
office okay thank you yeah
representative

05:20:03.750 --> 05:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:20:06.350 --> 05:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
beler thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:20:07.830 --> 05:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
you for being here I'm sure this has not
 
05:20:09.628 --> 05:20:09.638 align:start position:0%
been easy
 
05:20:13.590 --> 05:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
um now I I certainly wouldn't presume to
 
05:20:15.470 --> 05:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
estimate what the mechanism of injury
 
05:20:18.150 --> 05:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
your daughter may have experienced was
 
05:20:21.310 --> 05:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
but given the sort of the the rapidity
 
05:20:23.190 --> 05:20:23.200 align:start position:0%
or the acute onset of of some of the
 
05:20:25.750 --> 05:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
issues I would ask because this is
 
05:20:28.510 --> 05:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
something we we uh heard about before
 
05:20:31.510 --> 05:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
lunch um I would ask if you
 
05:20:35.990 --> 05:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
aware that guidelines for how vaccines
 
05:20:39.510 --> 05:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
were to be administered was ch
 
05:20:43.190 --> 05:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
changed um in the leadup to
 
05:20:47.590 --> 05:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
covid-19 such that previously um and I
 
05:20:48.948 --> 05:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
was a healthc care provider for quite a
 
05:20:51.910 --> 05:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
long time so previously we were taught
 
05:20:53.470 --> 05:20:53.480 align:start position:0%
when administering an intramuscular
 
05:20:55.708 --> 05:20:55.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine you insert the serin you're the
 
05:20:57.868 --> 05:20:57.878 align:start position:0%
needle into the into the deltoid muscle
 
05:20:59.910 --> 05:20:59.920 align:start position:0%
group and you pull back a little on the
 
05:21:02.030 --> 05:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
plunger to see if you're you if you get
 
05:21:03.310 --> 05:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
blood you would indicate you're in a
 
05:21:04.990 --> 05:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
blood vessel and you cannot
 
05:21:08.150 --> 05:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
inject um before lunch we heard from a a
 
05:21:08.160 --> 05:21:09.430 align:start position:0%
inject um before lunch we heard from a a
gentleman

05:21:09.430 --> 05:21:09.440 align:start position:0%
gentleman
 
05:21:13.230 --> 05:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
an almost unbelievable story about the
 
05:21:17.350 --> 05:21:17.360 align:start position:0%
CDC changing their guidelines away from
 
05:21:21.948 --> 05:21:21.958 align:start position:0%
aspiration solely for the cause of it
 
05:21:24.548 --> 05:21:24.558 align:start position:0%
might be more painful if you aspirate so
 
05:21:26.470 --> 05:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
I actually went on and I pulled this
 
05:21:28.868 --> 05:21:28.878 align:start position:0%
this pink uh book that he told us about
 
05:21:30.788 --> 05:21:30.798 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to just read briefly from
 
05:21:32.910 --> 05:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
it because I couldn't believe it
 
05:21:35.590 --> 05:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
myself aspiration is not recommended
 
05:21:37.830 --> 05:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
before administering a vaccine
 
05:21:40.070 --> 05:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
aspiration prior to injecting and
 
05:21:42.150 --> 05:21:42.160 align:start position:0%
injecting medication slowly are
 
05:21:45.270 --> 05:21:45.280 align:start position:0%
practices that have not been evaluated
 
05:21:47.948 --> 05:21:47.958 align:start position:0%
scientifically aspiration was originally
 
05:21:50.110 --> 05:21:50.120 align:start position:0%
recommended for theoretical safety
 
05:21:52.670 --> 05:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
reasons and injecting medication slowly
 
05:21:55.190 --> 05:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
was thought to decrease pain from Sudden
 
05:21:58.270 --> 05:21:58.280 align:start position:0%
distension of muscle tissue aspiration
 
05:22:00.190 --> 05:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
can increase pain because of the
 
05:22:02.270 --> 05:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
combined effects of a longer needle
 
05:22:03.990 --> 05:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
dwelling time in the tissues and
 
05:22:07.390 --> 05:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
shearing action wiggling of the needle
 
05:22:09.470 --> 05:22:09.480 align:start position:0%
it it is exactly what was described
 
05:22:13.270 --> 05:22:13.280 align:start position:0%
before launch that for some reason
 
05:22:16.390 --> 05:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
despite not citing any medical evidence
 
05:22:20.110 --> 05:22:20.120 align:start position:0%
uh that it was safe to make this change
 
05:22:24.070 --> 05:22:24.080 align:start position:0%
it was simply less painful in theory
 
05:22:26.510 --> 05:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
they would no longer aspirate to see if
 
05:22:28.230 --> 05:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
they were in a blood vessel before
 
05:22:30.030 --> 05:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
injecting is that something you were
 
05:22:32.548 --> 05:22:32.558 align:start position:0%
aware of I was not aware that they had
 
05:22:35.830 --> 05:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
changed the policies however my sister
 
05:22:40.310 --> 05:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
is an RN and we had had conversations
 
05:22:42.310 --> 05:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
about the method of
 
05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
injections um after all of this and she
 
05:22:49.830 --> 05:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
was had told me about aspiration and um
 
05:22:52.190 --> 05:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
how she used to always deliver
 
05:22:54.868 --> 05:22:54.878 align:start position:0%
injections but I was not aware thank you
 
05:22:56.548 --> 05:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
because the official recommendation for
 
05:22:58.590 --> 05:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
the method to deliver the covid-19
 
05:23:01.830 --> 05:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
vaccines was to deliver them rapidly and
 
05:23:01.840 --> 05:23:03.150 align:start position:0%
vaccines was to deliver them rapidly and
without

05:23:03.150 --> 05:23:03.160 align:start position:0%
without
 
05:23:06.708 --> 05:23:06.718 align:start position:0%
aspiration with as far as I can tell no
 
05:23:10.150 --> 05:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
scientific backing
 
05:23:13.390 --> 05:23:13.400 align:start position:0%
for possibly injecting these into an
 
05:23:16.310 --> 05:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
artery or a vein do you have a date on
 
05:23:19.070 --> 05:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
which that policy changed by any chance
 
05:23:20.628 --> 05:23:20.638 align:start position:0%
uh I I'll look at this to see if I can
 
05:23:22.230 --> 05:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
find a date on it this is the pink sheet
 
05:23:24.868 --> 05:23:24.878 align:start position:0%
PDF I'm looking at from the CDC website
 
05:23:27.190 --> 05:23:27.200 align:start position:0%
um but I I don't know the date but I'll
 
05:23:30.670 --> 05:23:30.680 align:start position:0%
look for it okay thank you represent
 
05:23:32.948 --> 05:23:32.958 align:start position:0%
Penza so I had a question I know you're
 
05:23:34.708 --> 05:23:34.718 align:start position:0%
going to talk about it um in regards
 
05:23:38.910 --> 05:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
with theirs so um as you I'm sure of B
 
05:23:41.390 --> 05:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
well aware the the percentage is is
 
05:23:43.830 --> 05:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
extremely high like I I I don't even
 
05:23:46.708 --> 05:23:46.718 align:start position:0%
know at this point 90% probably that
 
05:23:49.590 --> 05:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
they're not doctors nurses medical
 
05:23:51.310 --> 05:23:51.320 align:start position:0%
they're just not trained in even knowing
 
05:23:53.030 --> 05:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
how to report it's very cumbersome all
 
05:23:55.470 --> 05:23:55.480 align:start position:0%
of that kind of stuff so when you knew
 
05:23:56.948 --> 05:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
because you knew right away that this
 
05:24:01.708 --> 05:24:01.718 align:start position:0%
was a vaccine injury did you ask um did
 
05:24:03.990 --> 05:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
you ask the doctor was this at the ER
 
05:24:05.788 --> 05:24:05.798 align:start position:0%
did you who did you ask and how did that
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
process work when you said this needed
 
05:24:10.708 --> 05:24:10.718 align:start position:0%
to re be reported to vs so when all of
 
05:24:14.190 --> 05:24:14.200 align:start position:0%
this happened I wasn't thinking about
 
05:24:16.750 --> 05:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
anything but my daughter it wasn't until
 
05:24:20.270 --> 05:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
after she was home and later
 
05:24:24.350 --> 05:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
on um that I some someone I mentioned
 
05:24:27.350 --> 05:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
said have you made sure this is reported
 
05:24:29.590 --> 05:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
they then told me that I wanted to make
 
05:24:32.548 --> 05:24:32.558 align:start position:0%
sure that it was reported by The
 
05:24:34.628 --> 05:24:34.638 align:start position:0%
Physician and not
 
05:24:37.270 --> 05:24:37.280 align:start position:0%
self-reported due to the weight that it
 
05:24:39.150 --> 05:24:39.160 align:start position:0%
carried when a physician reported it
 
05:24:41.310 --> 05:24:41.320 align:start position:0%
versus self-reporting
 
05:24:44.030 --> 05:24:44.040 align:start position:0%
so I called the hospital to see if it
 
05:24:46.470 --> 05:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
was reported and it took 10 different
 
05:24:46.480 --> 05:24:47.350 align:start position:0%
was reported and it took 10 different
phone

05:24:47.350 --> 05:24:47.360 align:start position:0%
phone
 
05:24:51.788 --> 05:24:51.798 align:start position:0%
calls um before I got to somebody um
 
05:24:53.270 --> 05:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
many of the people that I spoke with
 
05:24:56.230 --> 05:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
didn't even know what theirs was um they
 
05:24:58.110 --> 05:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
had no idea who was responsible for
 
05:25:01.310 --> 05:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
entering it into the V system I finally
 
05:25:03.708 --> 05:25:03.718 align:start position:0%
got put in touch with the director of
 
05:25:03.718 --> 05:25:05.070 align:start position:0%
got put in touch with the director of
infectious

05:25:05.070 --> 05:25:05.080 align:start position:0%
infectious
 
05:25:08.548 --> 05:25:08.558 align:start position:0%
diseases at exitor hospital and at after
 
05:25:10.910 --> 05:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
looking into it he agreed to enter it
 
05:25:14.830 --> 05:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
himself um he was not her physician he
 
05:25:18.628 --> 05:25:18.638 align:start position:0%
had never met her however he agreed to
 
05:25:21.548 --> 05:25:21.558 align:start position:0%
enter it in since nobody they had no
 
05:25:25.708 --> 05:25:25.718 align:start position:0%
idea who should do it um so he actually
 
05:25:27.788 --> 05:25:27.798 align:start position:0%
entered the data in and he sent me the
 
05:25:29.110 --> 05:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
v's ID
 
05:25:32.910 --> 05:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
number so when I then looked up the v's
 
05:25:35.030 --> 05:25:35.040 align:start position:0%
ID number to make sure the information
 
05:25:38.670 --> 05:25:38.680 align:start position:0%
was accurate and entered correctly
 
05:25:41.910 --> 05:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
um you all can imagine how I felt when
 
05:25:44.750 --> 05:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
the number that was given to me pulled
 
05:25:48.868 --> 05:25:48.878 align:start position:0%
up a woman in her late 20s who had
 
05:25:51.910 --> 05:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
experienced a reaction a reaction to the
 
05:25:54.590 --> 05:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
flu vaccine years
 
05:25:56.948 --> 05:25:56.958 align:start position:0%
ago rather than my
 
05:25:59.430 --> 05:25:59.440 align:start position:0%
daughter so I reached back out to the
 
05:26:01.708 --> 05:26:01.718 align:start position:0%
director and I explained what I was
 
05:26:04.110 --> 05:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
seeing and I asked confirmed did you
 
05:26:06.390 --> 05:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
send me the right number because
 
05:26:10.390 --> 05:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
something isn't a in here and he goes
 
05:26:12.390 --> 05:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
yeah he goes I entered it myself I got
 
05:26:13.910 --> 05:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
the number and he pulled it up for
 
05:26:16.868 --> 05:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
himself and he goes Tara I'm seeing
 
05:26:19.390 --> 05:26:19.400 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're seeing and he goes I
 
05:26:20.910 --> 05:26:20.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what
 
05:26:24.628 --> 05:26:24.638 align:start position:0%
happened um I entered the data myself
 
05:26:26.628 --> 05:26:26.638 align:start position:0%
this isn't
 
05:26:29.788 --> 05:26:29.798 align:start position:0%
right at this point I'll be honest I
 
05:26:29.798 --> 05:26:30.548 align:start position:0%
right at this point I'll be honest I
gave

05:26:30.548 --> 05:26:30.558 align:start position:0%
gave
 
05:26:32.990 --> 05:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
up um
 
05:26:36.070 --> 05:26:36.080 align:start position:0%
I I threw my hands up in the air because
 
05:26:39.510 --> 05:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
what can you do how far can you push
 
05:26:43.030 --> 05:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
this um so that's when I started writing
 
05:26:46.830 --> 05:26:46.840 align:start position:0%
to all of our elected officials um
 
05:26:48.390 --> 05:26:48.400 align:start position:0%
because I'm
 
05:26:51.830 --> 05:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
like you know what what where can I take
 
05:26:54.230 --> 05:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
this the hospital I'm at the director of
 
05:26:55.990 --> 05:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
the and
 
05:27:00.430 --> 05:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:04.030 --> 05:27:04.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:06.830 --> 05:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
Potenza I don't know if you real I mean
 
05:27:09.110 --> 05:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure you do how huge that is
 
05:27:12.750 --> 05:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
like that is the that is humongous so if
 
05:27:17.548 --> 05:27:17.558 align:start position:0%
if you have on on record um and if you
 
05:27:19.750 --> 05:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
can get on
 
05:27:22.310 --> 05:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
record the date that was entered you
 
05:27:24.750 --> 05:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
know um the director of infectious
 
05:27:27.230 --> 05:27:27.240 align:start position:0%
disease and everything that he put in
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
and he States through like a sworn
 
05:27:33.350 --> 05:27:33.360 align:start position:0%
Affidavit of this and then what is what
 
05:27:37.548 --> 05:27:37.558 align:start position:0%
is presented this is humongous so I
 
05:27:37.558 --> 05:27:38.750 align:start position:0%
is presented this is humongous so I
texted

05:27:38.750 --> 05:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
texted
 
05:27:40.670 --> 05:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
back and forth with him we were on a
 
05:27:44.270 --> 05:27:44.280 align:start position:0%
text basis and I um unfortunately my my
 
05:27:46.030 --> 05:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
phone dropped to the bottom of the lake
 
05:27:50.708 --> 05:27:50.718 align:start position:0%
oh my God but I've also had emails and I

representative and he has spent
 
05:28:21.270 --> 05:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of time looking into
 
05:28:23.830 --> 05:28:23.840 align:start position:0%

research and looking into what happened
 
05:28:38.990 --> 05:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
um as well so it might be worthwhile to
 
05:28:41.270 --> 05:28:41.280 align:start position:0%
follow up with definely could you repeat
 
05:28:43.070 --> 05:28:43.080 align:start position:0%

put it in our files that you brought um
 
05:29:03.390 --> 05:29:03.400 align:start position:0%

any emails regarding the theirs data yep
 
05:29:08.750 --> 05:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
that would
 
05:29:08.760 --> 05:29:10.948 align:start position:0%
that would
be

05:29:10.948 --> 05:29:10.958 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:29:10.958 --> 05:29:12.470 align:start position:0%
be
extremely

05:29:12.470 --> 05:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
05:29:15.670 --> 05:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
helpful um for this committee I mean I
 
05:29:17.868 --> 05:29:17.878 align:start position:0%
can't even imagine as a mom what you're
 
05:29:20.868 --> 05:29:20.878 align:start position:0%
still going through um I'm sure it's a
 
05:29:23.868 --> 05:29:23.878 align:start position:0%
living nightmare every day
 
05:29:27.628 --> 05:29:27.638 align:start position:0%
um and out of curiosity has your
 
05:29:30.510 --> 05:29:30.520 align:start position:0%
daughter been able to connect with any
 
05:29:34.510 --> 05:29:34.520 align:start position:0%
other injured vacine injured people um
 
05:29:34.520 --> 05:29:35.350 align:start position:0%
other injured vacine injured people um
for

05:29:35.350 --> 05:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:29:38.750 --> 05:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
support so
 
05:29:41.070 --> 05:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
I'd have to follow back up with her on
 
05:29:47.390 --> 05:29:47.400 align:start position:0%
that um she has a close friend who was
 
05:29:50.910 --> 05:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
um injured by the HPV
 
05:29:54.470 --> 05:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
vaccine um but I don't know as she's got
 
05:29:57.150 --> 05:29:57.160 align:start position:0%
someone that she's directly connecting
 
05:29:59.470 --> 05:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
with over the covid there have been
 
05:29:59.480 --> 05:30:00.548 align:start position:0%
with over the covid there have been
support

05:30:00.548 --> 05:30:00.558 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:30:04.350 --> 05:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
groups one thing I would say is when I
 
05:30:06.788 --> 05:30:06.798 align:start position:0%
was on a lot of those support groups
 
05:30:09.788 --> 05:30:09.798 align:start position:0%
some of them got shut down
 
05:30:12.868 --> 05:30:12.878 align:start position:0%
and and may I ask were those like on
 
05:30:15.070 --> 05:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
Facebook they were on Facebook and they
 
05:30:17.350 --> 05:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
were were shut down yeah so going back
 
05:30:21.548 --> 05:30:21.558 align:start position:0%
to your question earlier about you know
 
05:30:24.708 --> 05:30:24.718 align:start position:0%
future and what we can
 
05:30:28.390 --> 05:30:28.400 align:start position:0%
do that's why I brought up you know the
 
05:30:31.310 --> 05:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
blocks that we ran into and why we felt
 
05:30:34.548 --> 05:30:34.558 align:start position:0%
nobody cared and our Voice couldn't be
 
05:30:34.558 --> 05:30:36.110 align:start position:0%
nobody cared and our Voice couldn't be
heard

05:30:36.110 --> 05:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
heard
 
05:30:39.830 --> 05:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
um people we know other individuals who
 
05:30:42.310 --> 05:30:42.320 align:start position:0%
were injured by the covid
 
05:30:44.590 --> 05:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine a lot of them don't want to
 
05:30:44.600 --> 05:30:45.990 align:start position:0%
vaccine a lot of them don't want to
speak

05:30:45.990 --> 05:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
speak
 
05:30:49.310 --> 05:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
out um may I ask wh why do you feel that
 
05:30:52.430 --> 05:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
they don't want to speak out I I guess I
 
05:30:55.548 --> 05:30:55.558 align:start position:0%
mean are they embarrassed are they
 
05:30:59.948 --> 05:30:59.958 align:start position:0%
confused um do they feel uh they'll be
 
05:31:03.350 --> 05:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh stigmatized I mean I can't speak for
 
05:31:05.910 --> 05:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
recently but I can speak for when this
 
05:31:09.150 --> 05:31:09.160 align:start position:0%
first happened
 
05:31:10.788 --> 05:31:10.798 align:start position:0%
we lost
 
05:31:10.798 --> 05:31:12.750 align:start position:0%
we lost
friends

05:31:12.750 --> 05:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
friends
 
05:31:15.350 --> 05:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
um over my daughter getting injured by
 
05:31:15.360 --> 05:31:16.310 align:start position:0%
um over my daughter getting injured by
the

05:31:16.310 --> 05:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:31:21.190 --> 05:31:21.200 align:start position:0%
vaccine you know it was a taboo
 
05:31:24.430 --> 05:31:24.440 align:start position:0%
subject people didn't want to hear it
 
05:31:27.230 --> 05:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
because it made it
 
05:31:30.708 --> 05:31:30.718 align:start position:0%
real I don't I can't tell you why I
 
05:31:33.470 --> 05:31:33.480 align:start position:0%

oh it's not
 
05:32:45.510 --> 05:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
working hit another one

accurate information but thank you for
 
05:33:07.030 --> 05:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
sharing it with us and fighting for your
 
05:33:10.990 --> 05:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
daughter and for other daughters and as
 
05:33:13.948 --> 05:33:13.958 align:start position:0%
her injury happened in
 
05:33:16.830 --> 05:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
2021 and in
 
05:33:19.190 --> 05:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
2023 State
 
05:33:22.830 --> 05:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
epidemiologist Dr Benjamin Chan uh
 
05:33:27.590 --> 05:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
testified in state house uh uh that
 
05:33:29.948 --> 05:33:29.958 align:start position:0%
covid vaccines are safe but he did
 
05:33:34.110 --> 05:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
recognize that there's some increase in
 
05:33:38.310 --> 05:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
my my carditis but mostly in boys my
 
05:33:38.320 --> 05:33:39.350 align:start position:0%
my my carditis but mostly in boys my
young

05:33:39.350 --> 05:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
young
 
05:33:43.670 --> 05:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
males and uh uh if it's too personal you
 
05:33:45.590 --> 05:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
don't have to answer but my
 
05:33:48.510 --> 05:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is your daughter is not
 
05:33:51.990 --> 05:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
was not born as a boy so do you know
 
05:33:54.708 --> 05:33:54.718 align:start position:0%
like uh if
 
05:33:59.350 --> 05:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh if other women were uh if there are
 
05:34:02.470 --> 05:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
other women who were injured by by this
 
05:34:11.270 --> 05:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:14.230 --> 05:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
yes um as a matter of
 
05:34:17.430 --> 05:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
fact after what happened to my daughter
 
05:34:19.350 --> 05:34:19.360 align:start position:0%
I was talking to the mother of one of
 
05:34:22.230 --> 05:34:22.240 align:start position:0%
her classmates from her Elementary
 
05:34:22.240 --> 05:34:23.150 align:start position:0%
her classmates from her Elementary
School

05:34:23.150 --> 05:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
School
 
05:34:27.548 --> 05:34:27.558 align:start position:0%
suy um so SE is not a huge school but
 
05:34:31.708 --> 05:34:31.718 align:start position:0%
there was a another girl who went to
 
05:34:32.990 --> 05:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
school with
 
05:34:36.270 --> 05:34:36.280 align:start position:0%
Abby and had to get the vaccine for
 
05:34:38.548 --> 05:34:38.558 align:start position:0%
college same thing
 
05:34:40.708 --> 05:34:40.718 align:start position:0%
and she ended up being rushed to the
 
05:34:44.590 --> 05:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
hospital afterwards with very similar um
 
05:34:48.590 --> 05:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
the rapid heart rate not feeling well um
 
05:34:50.628 --> 05:34:50.638 align:start position:0%
the same day that she had gotten her
 
05:34:53.948 --> 05:34:53.958 align:start position:0%
vaccine we also know of another
 
05:34:57.230 --> 05:34:57.240 align:start position:0%
individual who lost the feeling in her
 
05:34:59.430 --> 05:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
legs after the
 
05:34:59.440 --> 05:35:01.430 align:start position:0%
legs after the
vaccine

05:35:01.430 --> 05:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
05:35:04.390 --> 05:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know the status of that
 
05:35:04.400 --> 05:35:05.350 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know the status of that
person

05:35:05.350 --> 05:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
person
 
05:35:08.350 --> 05:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
now we also know
 
05:35:10.590 --> 05:35:10.600 align:start position:0%
um someone else whose diabetes went out
 
05:35:12.590 --> 05:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
of control
 
05:35:16.548 --> 05:35:16.558 align:start position:0%
after so there were numerous and it
 
05:35:20.310 --> 05:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
seems Now everywhere we go people are
 
05:35:23.070 --> 05:35:23.080 align:start position:0%
now ready to share a little bit more
 
05:35:25.150 --> 05:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
about their experience and what happened
 
05:35:29.948 --> 05:35:29.958 align:start position:0%
to them after it um but back in
 
05:35:36.150 --> 05:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:39.230 --> 05:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
discussed represent beler thank you
 
05:35:43.150 --> 05:35:43.160 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you again um so I
 
05:35:44.910 --> 05:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
I can I can speak to the veracity of
 
05:35:46.470 --> 05:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
many of the things you've said because I
 
05:35:49.430 --> 05:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
too have experienced them I was fairly
 
05:35:52.350 --> 05:35:52.360 align:start position:0%
significantly injured um after an mRNA
 
05:35:57.430 --> 05:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
vaccine I uh to had the distinct
 
05:36:01.390 --> 05:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
impression sometimes that when some
 
05:36:02.948 --> 05:36:02.958 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers would learn that I
 
05:36:05.390 --> 05:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
was a vaccine injury patient their
 
05:36:08.270 --> 05:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
attitude would shift significantly
 
05:36:10.548 --> 05:36:10.558 align:start position:0%
yeah I too
 
05:36:12.868 --> 05:36:12.878 align:start position:0%
experienced uh censorship when I
 
05:36:15.430 --> 05:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
attempted to tell about what had
 
05:36:17.948 --> 05:36:17.958 align:start position:0%
happened to me uh my social media
 
05:36:20.788 --> 05:36:20.798 align:start position:0%
accounts were suspended I was not able
 
05:36:23.868 --> 05:36:23.878 align:start position:0%
to access them um now I'm a little
 
05:36:26.590 --> 05:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
little bit older uh it irritated me to
 
05:36:29.430 --> 05:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
no end being censored but it didn't
 
05:36:33.670 --> 05:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
devastate me to lose my social media
 
05:36:37.670 --> 05:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
Accounts at the time now younger people
 
05:36:41.190 --> 05:36:41.200 align:start position:0%
are much more tied in on social media I
 
05:36:43.270 --> 05:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
can only imagine that that experience
 
05:36:47.990 --> 05:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
for them to lose access to their friends
 
05:36:50.190 --> 05:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
and their primary means of communication
 
05:36:54.110 --> 05:36:54.120 align:start position:0%
I expect in many cases would be much
 
05:36:57.110 --> 05:36:57.120 align:start position:0%
more traumatic than it was for me so I
 
05:36:59.390 --> 05:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
guess my question for you is do you
 
05:37:02.590 --> 05:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
think that the censorship that did exist
 
05:37:05.430 --> 05:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
around this losing access to social
 
05:37:08.548 --> 05:37:08.558 align:start position:0%
media because she simply tried to tell
 
05:37:10.470 --> 05:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
her friends in the world what had
 
05:37:13.990 --> 05:37:14.000 align:start position:0%
happened what her experience was um do
 
05:37:15.708 --> 05:37:15.718 align:start position:0%
you believe that that contributed to a
 
05:37:20.670 --> 05:37:20.680 align:start position:0%
sort of environment of um of trying to
 
05:37:22.948 --> 05:37:22.958 align:start position:0%
of trying to prevent people from talking
 
05:37:25.270 --> 05:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
or or keeping people from talk speaking
 
05:37:28.070 --> 05:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
out about about their situation yeah so
 
05:37:30.948 --> 05:37:30.958 align:start position:0%
I guess first of all um I'll be clear my
 
05:37:34.670 --> 05:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
daughter never lost access to her social
 
05:37:38.430 --> 05:37:38.440 align:start position:0%
media um but she was hesitant on what to
 
05:37:41.990 --> 05:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
post and when she finally did post they
 
05:37:44.708 --> 05:37:44.718 align:start position:0%
tagged it
 
05:37:48.910 --> 05:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
um she I think that definitely made her
 
05:37:54.510 --> 05:37:54.520 align:start position:0%
hesitant to share anymore um I know as
 
05:37:58.868 --> 05:37:58.878 align:start position:0%
an adult with it it made me hesitant to
 
05:38:01.110 --> 05:38:01.120 align:start position:0%
want to share
 
05:38:03.868 --> 05:38:03.878 align:start position:0%
information um and I know a lot of other
 
05:38:06.788 --> 05:38:06.798 align:start position:0%
people were hesitant to share or speak
 
05:38:06.798 --> 05:38:08.070 align:start position:0%
people were hesitant to share or speak
out

05:38:08.070 --> 05:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:38:08.080 --> 05:38:09.548 align:start position:0%
out
because

05:38:09.548 --> 05:38:09.558 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:38:12.150 --> 05:38:12.160 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:38:15.070 --> 05:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
perception there was a narrative in my
 
05:38:17.150 --> 05:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
opinion in my personal opinion there
 
05:38:18.670 --> 05:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
were certain things you were allowed to
 
05:38:20.510 --> 05:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
say and you were not allowed to say
 
05:38:23.310 --> 05:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
talking about vaccine injuries and harm
 
05:38:29.030 --> 05:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:31.150 --> 05:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
allowed represent
 
05:38:34.150 --> 05:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth uh it's not a question more a
 
05:38:36.788 --> 05:38:36.798 align:start position:0%
comment to committee I agree that we
 
05:38:40.468 --> 05:38:40.478 align:start position:0%
need to look look what happens uh with
 
05:38:45.070 --> 05:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
uh virus database but I heard from
 
05:38:48.468 --> 05:38:48.478 align:start position:0%
reputable sources that they have double
 
05:38:51.510 --> 05:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
numeration so there's like not a single
 
05:38:54.390 --> 05:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
number but there are two sets of number
 
05:38:57.670 --> 05:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
and when report is uh
 
05:39:00.868 --> 05:39:00.878 align:start position:0%
submitted people receive one number but
 
05:39:04.868 --> 05:39:04.878 align:start position:0%
then when database is squared is it's
 
05:39:07.590 --> 05:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
different set of numbers so they don't
 
05:39:10.910 --> 05:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
much and uh there were some other cases
 
05:39:14.270 --> 05:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
when it was causing a confusion so not
 
05:39:18.150 --> 05:39:18.160 align:start position:0%
saying it should be this way but there
 
05:39:21.510 --> 05:39:21.520 align:start position:0%
might be some explanation to it besides
 
05:39:21.520 --> 05:39:22.910 align:start position:0%
might be some explanation to it besides
like

05:39:22.910 --> 05:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
like
 
05:39:27.070 --> 05:39:27.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh just something we need to consider
 
05:39:28.910 --> 05:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:39:31.070 --> 05:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
representative does anyone else have any
 
05:39:31.080 --> 05:39:32.548 align:start position:0%
representative does anyone else have any
other

05:39:32.548 --> 05:39:32.558 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:39:32.558 --> 05:39:35.670 align:start position:0%
other
questions

05:39:35.670 --> 05:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:38.548 --> 05:39:38.558 align:start position:0%
um again I just want to say thank you so
 
05:39:40.350 --> 05:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
much is there anything else you'd like
 
05:39:43.628 --> 05:39:43.638 align:start position:0%
to add or that you would want to say to

happened with our family um I think the
 
05:40:01.990 --> 05:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
other things that I'd like to share is
 
05:40:05.948 --> 05:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
from my husband um this morning the one
 
05:40:08.150 --> 05:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
thing he wanted me to make sure sure
 
05:40:08.160 --> 05:40:09.310 align:start position:0%
thing he wanted me to make sure sure
everybody

05:40:09.310 --> 05:40:09.320 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
05:40:09.320 --> 05:40:10.830 align:start position:0%
everybody
heard

05:40:10.830 --> 05:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
heard
 
05:40:14.708 --> 05:40:14.718 align:start position:0%
was before our daughter received the
 
05:40:17.468 --> 05:40:17.478 align:start position:0%
vaccine everybody cared about her
 
05:40:17.478 --> 05:40:19.468 align:start position:0%
vaccine everybody cared about her
vaccine

05:40:19.468 --> 05:40:19.478 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
05:40:24.190 --> 05:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
status after she got her vaccine and was
 
05:40:29.750 --> 05:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
injured nobody cared about her vaccine
 
05:40:31.868 --> 05:40:31.878 align:start position:0%
injury and
 
05:40:35.110 --> 05:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
that you know you couldn't go to
 
05:40:37.750 --> 05:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
restaurants you museums
 
05:40:40.868 --> 05:40:40.878 align:start position:0%
people wanted vaccine ID cards maybe not
 
05:40:42.910 --> 05:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
here in the state of New Hampshire some
 
05:40:50.070 --> 05:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
did some did um nobody cared
 
05:40:54.750 --> 05:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
um so the second thing is just going
 
05:40:58.510 --> 05:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
back to what the state should look into
 
05:41:02.230 --> 05:41:02.240 align:start position:0%
never let these School schools close
 
05:41:04.708 --> 05:41:04.718 align:start position:0%
down these kids should never have been
 
05:41:07.070 --> 05:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
removed from school and not allowed to
 
05:41:10.830 --> 05:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
have have that education and that social
 
05:41:13.350 --> 05:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
interaction we harmed our
 
05:41:18.788 --> 05:41:18.798 align:start position:0%
children so much more um and it never
 
05:41:21.230 --> 05:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
should have lasted as long as it
 
05:41:21.240 --> 05:41:23.750 align:start position:0%
should have lasted as long as it
did

05:41:23.750 --> 05:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
did
 
05:41:29.310 --> 05:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:33.310 --> 05:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
system it it's not it doesn't
 
05:41:35.670 --> 05:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
work uh represent PS off then
 
05:41:38.708 --> 05:41:38.718 align:start position:0%
representative Penza
 
05:41:40.788 --> 05:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you for taking my
 
05:41:43.830 --> 05:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
other question and if it's to personal
 
05:41:47.788 --> 05:41:47.798 align:start position:0%
don't answer but like we are often told
 
05:41:50.750 --> 05:41:50.760 align:start position:0%
that as as as you were explained that
 
05:41:53.270 --> 05:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
it's for the better good and some small
 
05:41:55.788 --> 05:41:55.798 align:start position:0%
cases happen and we are told that uh
 
05:41:57.990 --> 05:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
there's a special fund created by
 
05:42:00.788 --> 05:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
government that compensate in cases of
 
05:42:03.270 --> 05:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury I'm here that it's almost
 
05:42:05.708 --> 05:42:05.718 align:start position:0%
impossible to get that compensation and
 
05:42:09.510 --> 05:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
it expires quite quickly in couple years
 
05:42:13.030 --> 05:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
so did you ever tried did you ever get
 
05:42:17.830 --> 05:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
anything well first there was a lot of
 
05:42:20.510 --> 05:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
misinformation um provided in terms of
 
05:42:23.230 --> 05:42:23.240 align:start position:0%
what you could and couldn't do at least
 
05:42:27.948 --> 05:42:27.958 align:start position:0%
to me the second thing was by the
 
05:42:31.910 --> 05:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
time there was one policy that was not
 
05:42:35.190 --> 05:42:35.200 align:start position:0%
covid vaccines were not eligible for and
 
05:42:37.468 --> 05:42:37.478 align:start position:0%
then the other one that you could be
 
05:42:39.390 --> 05:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
eligible for expired I believe it was
 
05:42:41.548 --> 05:42:41.558 align:start position:0%
one year after the date of
 
05:42:44.788 --> 05:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
vaccination but it was a minimum amount
 
05:42:47.230 --> 05:42:47.240 align:start position:0%
and because my student was a college age
 
05:42:48.948 --> 05:42:48.958 align:start position:0%
student she didn't have loss or I mean a
 
05:42:51.548 --> 05:42:51.558 align:start position:0%
high school student she didn't have loss
 
05:42:54.830 --> 05:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
of income and her health insurance
 
05:42:57.628 --> 05:42:57.638 align:start position:0%
covered bills so she didn't have
 
05:43:02.150 --> 05:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
anything to go ask for from that and
 
05:43:04.948 --> 05:43:04.958 align:start position:0%
then it expired within a year so by the
 
05:43:06.830 --> 05:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
time we learned about it even to look
 
05:43:10.510 --> 05:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
into to it she wasn't eligible anymore
 
05:43:12.548 --> 05:43:12.558 align:start position:0%
um but no there's there nobody's been
 
05:43:15.030 --> 05:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
held accountable or
 
05:43:15.040 --> 05:43:17.270 align:start position:0%
held accountable or
helped

05:43:17.270 --> 05:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
helped
 
05:43:21.230 --> 05:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
um from that standpoint yeah thank you
 
05:43:21.240 --> 05:43:24.628 align:start position:0%
um from that standpoint yeah thank you
represent

05:43:24.628 --> 05:43:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:26.990 --> 05:43:27.000 align:start position:0%
Venza so I'm I'm trying to find the
 
05:43:28.788 --> 05:43:28.798 align:start position:0%
article and my computer's about to die
 
05:43:30.670 --> 05:43:30.680 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to be able to um so
 
05:43:33.468 --> 05:43:33.478 align:start position:0%
there was just a it was recent it's got
 
05:43:38.150 --> 05:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
to be in maybe the last week or two um
 
05:43:40.510 --> 05:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it's a if it's a
 
05:43:42.708 --> 05:43:42.718 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical company I think it might
 
05:43:45.270 --> 05:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
be could be fizer possibly or if it was
 
05:43:48.868 --> 05:43:48.878 align:start position:0%
the CDC but so in addition of theirs I'm
 
05:43:50.708 --> 05:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
sure you're familiar with there were
 
05:43:52.430 --> 05:43:52.440 align:start position:0%
there's was a couple different Avenues
 
05:43:55.510 --> 05:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
right so a manufacturers were taking in
 
05:43:57.230 --> 05:43:57.240 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
05:44:01.868 --> 05:44:01.878 align:start position:0%
injuries uh reports uh CDC was taking in
 
05:44:04.270 --> 05:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
a piece of those as well and then of
 
05:44:07.230 --> 05:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
course the cumbers ve system and which
 
05:44:09.948 --> 05:44:09.958 align:start position:0%
is very EAS um hard for people to like
 
05:44:11.628 --> 05:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
get data from and all of that kind of
 
05:44:14.390 --> 05:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
stuff so they just released uh one
 
05:44:16.548 --> 05:44:16.558 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical company just were forced
 
05:44:18.590 --> 05:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
to compelled by the government to
 
05:44:21.390 --> 05:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
release the level of like calls and all
 
05:44:22.868 --> 05:44:22.878 align:start position:0%
of that kind of stuff for injuries are
 
05:44:25.468 --> 05:44:25.478 align:start position:0%
you familiar with that I'm not okay so
 
05:44:26.830 --> 05:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
I'd love to I'm going to find that
 
05:44:30.590 --> 05:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
information and and get that to you
 
05:44:33.948 --> 05:44:33.958 align:start position:0%
um I would love to have our committee
 
05:44:37.910 --> 05:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
follow up with any pieces to have your
 
05:44:40.548 --> 05:44:40.558 align:start position:0%
story and um and to see whatever we can
 
05:44:44.990 --> 05:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
do within our power to make sure um that
 
05:44:47.310 --> 05:44:47.320 align:start position:0%
there's that there's things that are
 
05:44:51.310 --> 05:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
held accountable um especially timelines
 
05:44:54.270 --> 05:44:54.280 align:start position:0%
with the school and and that's extremely
 
05:44:56.270 --> 05:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
important to me
 
05:44:58.948 --> 05:44:58.958 align:start position:0%
um yeah I can't even imagine the level
 
05:45:00.990 --> 05:45:01.000 align:start position:0%
of medical bills and all of that other
 
05:45:03.030 --> 05:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff that have that have
 
05:45:05.590 --> 05:45:05.600 align:start position:0%
surmounted in this in this whole thing
 
05:45:08.070 --> 05:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
but I'd also love to help you with a
 
05:45:10.670 --> 05:45:10.680 align:start position:0%
whole community of of folks as well
 
05:45:12.708 --> 05:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
because I I really think that they the
 
05:45:15.430 --> 05:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
voices are there some people are scared
 
05:45:17.110 --> 05:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
um but it needs to come out but the
 
05:45:19.390 --> 05:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
community is Big we're kind of our own
 
05:45:22.468 --> 05:45:22.478 align:start position:0%
family so my daughter's vaccine injured
 
05:45:24.628 --> 05:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
so listening to you I just I just want
 
05:45:26.390 --> 05:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
to cry I was crying pretty much half the
 
05:45:28.430 --> 05:45:28.440 align:start position:0%
time so there's there's a lot of them a
 
05:45:32.628 --> 05:45:32.638 align:start position:0%
lot of but it just there needs to
 
05:45:37.468 --> 05:45:37.478 align:start position:0%
be a bigger voice an official voice
 
05:45:40.110 --> 05:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
and we need to look at everything and
 
05:45:43.750 --> 05:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
make sure we don't run into this covid
 
05:45:46.628 --> 05:45:46.638 align:start position:0%
experience again it needs to be handled
 
05:45:46.638 --> 05:45:48.708 align:start position:0%
experience again it needs to be handled
better

05:45:48.708 --> 05:45:48.718 align:start position:0%
better
 
05:45:51.590 --> 05:45:51.600 align:start position:0%
um uh and that is the mission of this
 
05:45:54.750 --> 05:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
committee is to see what we got right
 
05:45:59.070 --> 05:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
what we got wrong um going forward and
 
05:46:00.628 --> 05:46:00.638 align:start position:0%

05:46:55.868 --> 05:46:55.878 align:start position:0%
morning first we opened up with some
 
05:46:57.948 --> 05:46:57.958 align:start position:0%
possibly some brainstorming for some
 
05:47:00.150 --> 05:47:00.160 align:start position:0%
questions to DHS do we shall we just
 
05:47:02.830 --> 05:47:02.840 align:start position:0%

Homeland Security also um to forward
 
05:47:13.430 --> 05:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
those also to me um because in looking
 
05:47:15.548 --> 05:47:15.558 align:start position:0%
at the email that
 
05:47:18.270 --> 05:47:18.280 align:start position:0%
um representative eel read this morning
 
05:47:20.150 --> 05:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
you know she talked about how they also
 
05:47:23.350 --> 05:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
handled part of the financial portions
 
05:47:25.390 --> 05:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
uh some of the federal monies regarding
 
05:47:28.628 --> 05:47:28.638 align:start position:0%
the rollout um so it looks like they had
 
05:47:30.548 --> 05:47:30.558 align:start position:0%
a pretty big hand in
 
05:47:34.150 --> 05:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
things um so yes if anyone has any
 
05:47:35.868 --> 05:47:35.878 align:start position:0%
