good morning
 
00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
everyone um pledge allegiance
 
00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 align:start position:0%
us thank
 
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 align:start position:0%
you so before we jump into all of the
 
00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 align:start position:0%
fun stuff that I want to remind
 
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
everybody of or introduce them too um I
 
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
am your chairman uh representative Greg
 
00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
Hill been here since 2010 uh been
 
00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 align:start position:0%
chairing this
 
00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:43.880 align:start position:0%
committee I think this is the third
 
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah good segue this is our vice
 
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
chairman uh or co-chairman as I
 
00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes say um Vanessa Sheen uh this
 
00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
is her second term as Vice chair she
 
00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 align:start position:0%
previously sat as clerk in this
 
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
committee um so we've the advantage is
 
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
for everyone is we've seen a lot of
 
00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 align:start position:0%
these bills before um and we kind of
 
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:15.120 align:start position:0%
know what's coming so uh that's a good
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
thing I think um in addition to
 
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration I've also
 
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
served on education labor with
 
00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
representative turot um election law
 
00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:29.749 align:start position:0%
representative turot um election law
transportation

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:32.879 align:start position:0%
and this so um I've got kind of a
 
00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
working knowledge of wherever you want
 
00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440 align:start position:0%
to go I don't think anybody else is in
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
second committees right you only have
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
one committee yeah so that um we both
 
00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
are in second committees so you'll find
 
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:48.440 align:start position:0%
for us sometimes there's overlap and we
 
00:07:51.149 --> 00:07:51.159 align:start position:0%
have information from what went on in a
 
00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
different committee um and that that too
 
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:54.670 align:start position:0%
different committee um and that that too
is

00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:07:58.510 --> 00:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
helpful um we also have a new clerk who
 
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
is an experienced clerk you came from
 
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
Edna Edna last year which is Vanessa's
 
00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
second committee so uh it's kind of
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
every Small World stuff um do you want
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
to tell us a little bit about
 
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.240 align:start position:0%
yourself um well is my second term I've
 
00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
enjoyed it um Edna was very busy
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
committee and um too busy for me so I'd
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
asked to uh to be on a less busy one so
 
00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
here I am more important but less busy
 
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
so but yeah it's got a lot of good
 
00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:33.800 align:start position:0%
people here so I look forward to it
 
00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
working with with with you all so we're
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
probably going to need a
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
pronunciation okay we were just talking
 
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
about that oh um my family pronounced it
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
sway sway sir sway it's sway yeah the
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
original pronunciation would be sir but
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
my family says sway okay like I
 
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
explained to them it breaks the
 
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
association with the French King which
 
00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
is what the is so it's not a it it is it
 
00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
from um are you French Canadian so my
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
family settled into northern Maine but
 
00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
they were sent here from the French can
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
to populate that's what the S with Sir W
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
means is gentleman of the
 
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.630 align:start position:0%
means is gentleman of the
C

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
C
 
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.949 align:start position:0%
C
okay

00:09:17.949 --> 00:09:17.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
um never mind um so why don't we um at
 
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
least uh run around quickly around the
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
friendly committee um it's generally not
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
an a partisan committee uh it
 
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
is we all seem to be working the the the
 
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
way things used to work here um we we
 
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:48.360 align:start position:0%
tend to look at bills on their merits
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
and uh regardless of who Prime sponsors
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
are or other sponsors we look at uh
 
00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's a good piece of legislation
 
00:09:57.389 --> 00:09:57.399 align:start position:0%
and whether it will
 
00:10:00.190 --> 00:10:00.200 align:start position:0%
help State of New Hampshire and
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
primarily the legislature operate um so
 
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
uh those that have been in this before I
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
think will testify that it is um it is
 
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:12.790 align:start position:0%
think will testify that it is um it is
a

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:10:16.990 --> 00:10:17.000 align:start position:0%
um easy committee to work with um we
 
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.389 align:start position:0%
um easy committee to work with um we
tend

00:10:19.389 --> 00:10:19.399 align:start position:0%
tend
 
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
to she's locked down Karen um we tend to
 
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh um quite a few bills that even even
 
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
though we have a very small number we
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
tend to have a very large number great
 
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
um of bills that end up on the consent
 
00:10:41.069 --> 00:10:41.079 align:start position:0%
calendar um so uh which speaks a little
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
bit to um to how we do our work and that
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
we talk things out before we uh finally
 
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.160 align:start position:0%
vote in exec
 
00:10:52.949 --> 00:10:52.959 align:start position:0%
session um yeah maybe that's
 
00:10:52.959 --> 00:10:55.790 align:start position:0%
session um yeah maybe that's
best

00:10:55.790 --> 00:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
um this is interesting
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
okay um so what we have uh this is while
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
while I have the opportunity um this is
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:25.160 align:start position:0%
there's still possibility of additional
 
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:36.269 --> 00:11:36.279 align:start position:0%

00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
funding education policy Transportation
 
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:39.590 align:start position:0%

services

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.240 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
and oh nothing no big deal no big deal
 
00:12:48.590 --> 00:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
um can you also talk to us a little bit
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
about um committee reports and your
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
involvement with
 
00:13:06.949 --> 00:13:06.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
auth on theft
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
to so in the past we've had people with
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
very poor
 
00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:24.839 align:start position:0%
penmanship um so we have uh talked about
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
um whether it would be better and it's
 
00:13:28.790 --> 00:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
kind of up to all of us to decide
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
whether would be better to submit
 
00:13:37.949 --> 00:13:37.959 align:start position:0%
um to submit in uh electronically if you
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
prefer that I think it probably helps
 
00:13:43.069 --> 00:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
you so that you can cut and paste and
 
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:48.440 align:start position:0%

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
day you can be our security officer for
 
00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
the day
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah all right um I don't know if
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
everybody knows but this is uh the
 
00:14:14.629 --> 00:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
ranking member uh Janet wall um who has
 
00:14:16.749 --> 00:14:16.759 align:start position:0%
served on this committee
 
00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:21.759 align:start position:0%
for more than I have um but um and also
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
been chair of Judiciary and a number of
 
00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
other things um if if she doesn't know
 
00:14:30.990 --> 00:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
it the answer to your question that it
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't it hasn't come up before um so
 
00:14:37.749 --> 00:14:37.759 align:start position:0%
as far as the committee um reports if
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
there was a way of making
 
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
sure um they're legible and uh once once
 
00:14:47.509 --> 00:14:47.519 align:start position:0%
you complete them I have to sign off on
 
00:14:50.749 --> 00:14:50.759 align:start position:0%
them so um that'll be the first catch if
 
00:14:53.269 --> 00:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
I can't read it um I'll probably coming
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
back and saying how do we do this
 
00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
Jamie's laughing already because she uh
 
00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
saw me do that several times um but uh
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
it would be great if we can get those in
 
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:05.800 align:start position:0%
as quickly as we can so that we can get
 
00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
them into the calendar and into um um
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
the house as quickly as possible and as
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
cleanly as possible and as U written as
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
well as possible
 
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.790 align:start position:0%
well as possible
um

00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
right um anything we need from Karen now
 
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.910 --> 00:15:42.920 align:start position:0%
yep yeah that would be great I when we
 
00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
get the notice about the bills can they
 
00:15:48.309 --> 00:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
attach this to the email with all the
 
00:15:50.189 --> 00:15:50.199 align:start position:0%
details because I like to print them out
 
00:15:52.710 --> 00:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
ahead of time I don't know what you're
 
00:15:54.309 --> 00:15:54.319 align:start position:0%
saying do you know when you send the
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
when she sends out the email that says
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
we're having a hearing or this or that
 
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
that attach sometimes it was just I
 
00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
think one of the emails was just like
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
the schedule but didn't attach the
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
actual email the actual bill PDF of the
 
00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
bill stuff yeah well you should have all
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
of the bills now she's passing oh she's
 
00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
passing them okay great so when you get
 
00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:17.800 align:start position:0%
that note you you can combine them okay
 
00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.509 --> 00:16:29.519 align:start position:0%
you yep yep so you should be set um I
 
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959 align:start position:0%
tend to keep all of mine in a three-
 
00:16:37.189 --> 00:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
ring binder um just because I can but um
 
00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:40.720 align:start position:0%
you do what you do you um one thing that
 
00:16:42.749 --> 00:16:42.759 align:start position:0%
is going to be different that I'm going
 
00:16:45.949 --> 00:16:45.959 align:start position:0%
to try and I'm going to ask you if you
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
can if I can
 
00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
um if you can volunteer for this so um
 
00:16:55.949 --> 00:16:55.959 align:start position:0%
you'll notice when I schedule those and
 
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
this is what triggered it when you
 
00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:00.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned the scheduling p P um you'll
 
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:04.600 align:start position:0%
notice that I schedule things usually 15
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
20 minutes apart and and the reason for
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
that is it irritates me it's very hard
 
00:17:15.309 --> 00:17:15.319 align:start position:0%
to schedule or know how long um a
 
00:17:18.669 --> 00:17:18.679 align:start position:0%
hearing is going to go so
 
00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:22.280 align:start position:0%
um you can either guess and and
 
00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:25.079 align:start position:0%
invariably I add too much time to it or
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
I did in the past and that meant we were
 
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
sitting around for 15 minutes or 20
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
minutes before we can start the next
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
hearing don't like wasting anybody's
 
00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320 align:start position:0%
time so instead what I do is schedule
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
them usually shorter than I think that
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to go and then um I just
 
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
uh keep running right through all of
 
00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
them we don't have any breaks for the
 
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
committee the downside to that is people
 
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
may show up um expecting a bill to be
 
00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:02.360 align:start position:0%
heard at 9 30 and we've started one at
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
9:15 and it may go to 9:30 um that's the
 
00:18:10.669 --> 00:18:10.679 align:start position:0%
tradeoff but what I want to do is is
 
00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:13.919 align:start position:0%
have and I've I think um Vanessa talked
 
00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
to you yesterday having a h piece of
 
00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
paper with a large font to say what the
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
bill number is and have it sit on the
 
00:18:29.110 --> 00:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
witness table so that that camera when
 
00:18:31.510 --> 00:18:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's pointing at the witness table will
 
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
indicate which Bill we're working on um
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
and then at least people will see that
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
are watching on on YouTube um see what
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
Bill we're we're playing with and they
 
00:18:49.710 --> 00:18:49.720 align:start position:0%
and know this doesn't sound like what I
 
00:18:53.110 --> 00:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
wanted to hear at 9:30 um but we're
 
00:18:54.789 --> 00:18:54.799 align:start position:0%
going to it's going to be important that
 
00:18:58.549 --> 00:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
we we keep up with that um that we we
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
have the right Bill shown um so is that
 
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:04.200 align:start position:0%
something that I can ask you to do
 
00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:08.480 align:start position:0%
representative Boy Thanks um I'm going
 
00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:10.799 align:start position:0%
to kind of skip out of order for some of
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
this so that we can get people back to
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
where they want to be um you'll these
 
00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
are The Usual Suspects that we have in
 
00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:21.320 align:start position:0%
our in our committee um we don't
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
generally have large
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
audiences um for whatever reason we
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
generally don't have lobbyists um in
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
this committee who we have are uh are
 
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
are three um and first I'm going to ask
 
00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
um our extraordinary researcher we're
 
00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:43.520 align:start position:0%
very blessed that we have the top
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
researcher in the in the country I think
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
um but uh but Jennifer is here to make
 
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
us look good and does um you'll already
 
00:19:58.350 --> 00:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
seen a piece of her work I had asked J
 
00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
to put together uh the files for bills
 
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:05.080 align:start position:0%
that we've heard previously so that you
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
have some knowledge about what's coming
 
00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
and and what we did about it and what we
 
00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:12.400 align:start position:0%
said about it so that was all uh the
 
00:20:14.909 --> 00:20:14.919 align:start position:0%
kind of work that that Jen does
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
everything that she does comes through
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
me or Vanessa um so we would appreciate
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
knowing what what's going on um and nine
 
00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
times out of 10 we'll say that's fine
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll talk to Jen or or you can
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
talk to Jen um do you want to introduce
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
yourself and say a few enlightening
 
00:20:38.039 --> 00:21:03.149 align:start position:0%
yourself and say a few enlightening
things

00:21:03.149 --> 00:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.159 --> 00:21:46.990 align:start position:0%
 
nice

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:51.029 --> 00:21:51.039 align:start position:0%
okay in Prior years we had Jen on the
 
00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:53.960 align:start position:0%
fourth floor we had a committee room on
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
the third floor our our committee
 
00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
assistant was on the second floor and um
 
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:03.640 align:start position:0%
and legislative Administration has an
 
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:06.200 align:start position:0%
office on the first floor so uh you'll
 
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
get your steps in somewhere along the
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
line here um now we're a little bit
 
00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:13.520 align:start position:0%
better we're at least two things on the
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
on the third floor um you're you're good
 
00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
I I think yeah I don't think we need any
 
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:21.559 align:start position:0%
as long as we can get that uh for this
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
afternoon we can we can get that new
 
00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:26.360 align:start position:0%
placard that would be great for the
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%

to be with my favorite Committee of the
 
00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
house and um the reason it is my
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
favorite Committee of the house is
 
00:24:29.029 --> 00:24:29.039 align:start position:0%
because this was my committee when I was
 
00:24:32.029 --> 00:24:32.039 align:start position:0%
in the house 20 plus years ago uh I
 
00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:34.440 align:start position:0%
actually U was fortunate enough to be
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
the clerk of this committee uh when I
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
was a member um and that really being on
 
00:24:43.149 --> 00:24:43.159 align:start position:0%
this committee um really sort of helped
 
00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
Foster my love for the institution and
 
00:24:48.990 --> 00:24:49.000 align:start position:0%
the process and uh so I am grateful uh
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
for that um couple of things just to as
 
00:24:55.630 --> 00:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
as Jim mentioned um of course I am a
 
00:24:57.310 --> 00:24:57.320 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan officer of the house and I
 
00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:00.320 align:start position:0%
do appear frequent in in this committee
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh to testify and it is always to give
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
informational purpose uh for
 
00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:07.640 align:start position:0%
informational purposes um you will see
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
me uh this afternoon uh there will be a
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation um that that I will
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
be testifying on uh and that is because
 
00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh uh it amends the law that I was a
 
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
sponsor of uh 22 years ago um and I was
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
going I'm going to give sort of a
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
historical uh reference to why that was
 
00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:29.840 align:start position:0%
enacted uh at that time um and again
 
00:25:32.549 --> 00:25:32.559 align:start position:0%
that that is part of what I do hear uh
 
00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
uh Jen mentioned uh you know
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
corresponding with other uh you know
 
00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
ncsl and that sort of thing I also have
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
um uh a former president of the American
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
Society of legislative clerks and
 
00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
secretaries and we have um we
 
00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:47.559 align:start position:0%
communicate a lot uh about various
 
00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
issues affecting all of our legislator
 
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
um uh there will you'll have a bill on
 
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
pslf uh for legislators coming up um and
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
I've been asked to give testimony on
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
that again um and uh I have information
 
00:26:04.669 --> 00:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
from other states where clerks are uh
 
00:26:07.510 --> 00:26:07.520 align:start position:0%
part of that process so um those are the
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
kind of things that you'll you'll see me
 
00:26:11.789 --> 00:26:11.799 align:start position:0%
here for um you'll also see me just kind
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
of um Jim and I just kind of sitting in
 
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
the back um uh not always testifying
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
just just here to keep an eye as he said
 
00:26:21.789 --> 00:26:21.799 align:start position:0%
a watchful eye over the the stored
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
institution um but again if you have
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
questions um about anything particularly
 
00:26:30.549 --> 00:26:30.559 align:start position:0%
um you know regarding uh our our
 
00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
practices our customs our preceden Etc
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
uh I'm always available uh to answer
 
00:26:39.070 --> 00:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
those uh for you um you know this this
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
committee is special because it is about
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
our internal processes um and not just
 
00:26:46.389 --> 00:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
our internal processes in the house but
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
really the whole legislature um and and
 
00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
you know so so sometimes uh as Jim
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned you you might hear us talking
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
about our our current practices and some
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
of our current practices are because
 
00:27:01.669 --> 00:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
they are our practices and so the
 
00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
question is should we let the other body
 
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
in the executive branch weigh in on our
 
00:27:09.669 --> 00:27:09.679 align:start position:0%
practices uh when when bills come before
 
00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:11.320 align:start position:0%
you so those are those are some things
 
00:27:14.190 --> 00:27:14.200 align:start position:0%
to think about uh while while you all uh
 
00:27:16.389 --> 00:27:16.399 align:start position:0%
deliberate on them do we need the Senate
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
to weigh in on how the house runs Etc so
 
00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:21.320 align:start position:0%
U those are those are some of the
 
00:27:22.909 --> 00:27:22.919 align:start position:0%
questions that you'll you'll think about
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
when you're deliberating um again uh it
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
is it is a a pleasure to be here um I'm
 
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
always happy to uh be available and
 
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:34.440 align:start position:0%

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
rules I I'm real big fan of rules uh our
 
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
house rules and and and our
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%

00:27:46.269 --> 00:27:46.279 align:start position:0%

00:27:51.870 --> 00:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
session um probably next month um in the
 
00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
chamber where we're going to really deep
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
dive into parliamentary procedure uh so
 
00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:57.799 align:start position:0%
you'll you'll see me really geek out
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
that day
 
00:28:00.549 --> 00:28:00.559 align:start position:0%
um but you know anytime you have
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
questions about the the why as well as
 
00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:05.240 align:start position:0%
the how um I'm always happy to talk
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
about that stuff so thank you very much
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
and I look forward to working with you
 
00:28:13.389 --> 00:28:13.399 align:start position:0%
this term thank you very much any
 
00:28:19.389 --> 00:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
questions for the Clark no we're good um
 
00:28:21.990 --> 00:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
couple of things uh and and in fact uh
 
00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:24.440 align:start position:0%
one that you saw earlier conversation
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
that I was having um because I had
 
00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.350 align:start position:0%
that I was having um because I had
submitted

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
submitted
 
00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
a possible schedule for the rest of our
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
bills and uh and it appears that um I've
 
00:28:39.269 --> 00:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
screwed up for the first time here um
 
00:28:41.549 --> 00:28:41.559 align:start position:0%
because I've put us on uh the day that
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
the governor is going to be introducing
 
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
uh her budget so um you'll see I don't
 
00:28:50.389 --> 00:28:50.399 align:start position:0%
think it'll show up in the calendar but
 
00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:53.240 align:start position:0%
you would have seen our remaining eight
 
00:28:56.149 --> 00:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
bills um after we have the four this
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon the remaining eight bills I
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
had scheduled for the 20th uh no 13th of
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
um of February um that's going to be the
 
00:29:08.509 --> 00:29:08.519 align:start position:0%
day when the governor submits her budget
 
00:29:13.269 --> 00:29:13.279 align:start position:0%
so we need to decide amongst ourselves
 
00:29:16.430 --> 00:29:16.440 align:start position:0%
whether we push that for another week um
 
00:29:21.389 --> 00:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
to the 20th or um would it suit everyone
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
here uh we're only missing one person I
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
think uh no two um um whether it would
 
00:29:34.070 --> 00:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
be better to do it on say the 12th um a
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
Wednesday um we we are sharing this room
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
with Transportation they typically have
 
00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so um it's really up to us to
 
00:29:47.669 --> 00:29:47.679 align:start position:0%
decide what other day we want to do this
 
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
so while I've just already given you
 
00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
some information
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
um my information is only as good as as
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
right after I tell you it and then it
 
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
seems like uh it's it's gone so um I
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
don't know what everyone uh what
 
00:30:08.549 --> 00:30:08.559 align:start position:0%
everyone um prefers um is there a
 
00:30:10.789 --> 00:30:10.799 align:start position:0%
preference yep Mr chairman hi everyone
 
00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
I'm Beth Richards and I represent
 
00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
conquer and this is I think my third I
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
think third um yeah and and then prior
 
00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:22.200 align:start position:0%
to this I was two uh terms in
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
environment and agriculture so another
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
committee that was represented um and it
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
is really helpful um for you to let us
 
00:30:33.789 --> 00:30:33.799 align:start position:0%
know well in advance and I really
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
appreciate that when you do that I would
 
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
also love to try to lock in on a typical
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
day um because I run an establishment
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's open seven days a week um so that
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
is really helpful um so if you're taking
 
00:30:55.149 --> 00:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
you know favorite days I would love
 
00:30:56.590 --> 00:30:56.600 align:start position:0%
Thursday the
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
20th um
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
here's here we have somewhat of an
 
00:31:03.310 --> 00:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
advantage because these are going to be
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
hearings that that we're having those
 
00:31:08.629 --> 00:31:08.639 align:start position:0%
remaining eight bills on the 13th
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
schedule now um so because all of them
 
00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:16.679 align:start position:0%
are recorded um you would have the
 
00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
ability to to hear them at your leisure
 
00:31:23.710 --> 00:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be although um it
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
is in the calendar that um it would be
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
exec itive sessions are possible in that
 
00:31:33.629 --> 00:31:33.639 align:start position:0%
time um and again this gets back to the
 
00:31:36.990 --> 00:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
idea of not wasting anybody's time if we
 
00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
ran into something where all of a sudden
 
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:41.320 align:start position:0%
we had a big block of time that was
 
00:31:44.669 --> 00:31:44.679 align:start position:0%
available um under rules this year we
 
00:31:49.870 --> 00:31:49.880 align:start position:0%
are able to exec um a bill um as we have
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
time so yeah follow up that sure you
 
00:31:54.909 --> 00:31:54.919 align:start position:0%
mentioned exact would you be expecting
 
00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:56.200 align:start position:0%
that the bills that we're hearing this
 
00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
afternoon that you would look to exact
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
those on the same day and uh on the 20th
 
00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:03.480 align:start position:0%
that that was seem to be often a
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
practice that we would hear the bills
 
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
and then the next time we meet we would
 
00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
exact with the possibility but that a
 
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
Contin those are those would be the The
 
00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
Logical ones that I would uh I always
 
00:32:21.310 --> 00:32:21.320 align:start position:0%
hesitate I think as most chairs do um to
 
00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
exec a bill the day that we're hearing
 
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
it um I just don't I think it's good
 
00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:29.480 align:start position:0%
idea for people to mull over what
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
they've heard um but um but so those
 
00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:35.080 align:start position:0%
four that we hear today would be the
 
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
logical ones that we would fill in if
 
00:32:41.190 --> 00:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
there is time um on
 
00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:44.519 align:start position:0%
the whatever day we pick I I recall that
 
00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
you would often indicate that on the
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
public statements as well so that's um
 
00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:56.000 align:start position:0%
helpful the public yeah so I in the
 
00:32:58.590 --> 00:32:58.600 align:start position:0%
schedule that I had sent in and for the
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
13th I had that line that um
 
00:33:05.629 --> 00:33:05.639 align:start position:0%
executive um executing bills would be
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
possible I guess to my point is that I
 
00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880 align:start position:0%
recalled you indicated the exact bills
 
00:33:14.830 --> 00:33:14.840 align:start position:0%
from that previous week in that manner
 
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
in addition to the catchall line yeah
 
00:33:19.269 --> 00:33:19.279 align:start position:0%
well we didn't have the catchall line
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
last term so so we had remembering okay
 
00:33:25.389 --> 00:33:25.399 align:start position:0%
so we had to do that but um and I still
 
00:33:28.509 --> 00:33:28.519 align:start position:0%
intend to do that when I know
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
you know the remaining eight that we're
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
doing my intention is to just schedule
 
00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
one day of executing all of those eight
 
00:33:39.909 --> 00:33:39.919 align:start position:0%
um and and theoretically that would
 
00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:43.120 align:start position:0%
cover us for this whole half the session
 
00:33:47.710 --> 00:33:47.720 align:start position:0%
so y sure and and another bill related
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the followup uh is that um
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
at the time of exec um how would you
 
00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
like to handle sign
 
00:34:01.789 --> 00:34:01.799 align:start position:0%
or making comments of what has been
 
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
received and comment about the bill that
 
00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
came from the public um so in my
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
recollection over the years we would
 
00:34:10.710 --> 00:34:10.720 align:start position:0%
hear you know there
 
00:34:14.349 --> 00:34:14.359 align:start position:0%
were uh you know
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
27 uh submittal and now I'm forgetting
 
00:34:19.669 --> 00:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
where we are at in our blue cards and
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
our pink cards but making a statement of
 
00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:24.919 align:start position:0%
what that was as
 
00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:28.040 align:start position:0%
we began our discussion so that we're
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
all informed with the same information
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
um is that something quite frankly quite
 
00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't I I I'm not very good at
 
00:34:39.869 --> 00:34:39.879 align:start position:0%
that um and I
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
don't um it is up to us to I feel
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
um to review whatever online testimony
 
00:34:53.069 --> 00:34:53.079 align:start position:0%
that comes in or not I will occasionally
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
if there is something that I see that is
 
00:35:02.109 --> 00:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
particularly on point or um or helpful I
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
may ask Jen to provide that to all of us
 
00:35:09.270 --> 00:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
um and and I don't know that maybe
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
happened twice last year I don't yeah um
 
00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
but um but
 
00:35:19.030 --> 00:35:19.040 align:start position:0%
generally uh the idea of
 
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:23.240 align:start position:0%
announcing um who or how many votes came
 
00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:27.119 align:start position:0%
in on on either the signin um sheets the
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
the blue sheet sheets or
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
online um because there's 24 hours
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
after um our hearing to do that I've
 
00:35:38.829 --> 00:35:38.839 align:start position:0%
never really thought that there's much
 
00:35:42.550 --> 00:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
use to it um perhaps on on exec session
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
day um someone is perfectly well welcome
 
00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:50.280 align:start position:0%
to offer that information but um you
 
00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:52.720 align:start position:0%
know that's nothing that that uh either
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
Vanessa or I are are in on our list of
 
00:35:59.470 --> 00:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
things to do
 
00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.670 align:start position:0%
things to do
yep

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
representating thank you getting back to
 
00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:05.720 align:start position:0%
the uh schedule um if you push it to the
 
00:36:07.950 --> 00:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
20th are we sure there's no house
 
00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:10.359 align:start position:0%
session scheduled that day as of the
 
00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
moment uh we looked at the magic uh list
 
00:36:16.349 --> 00:36:16.359 align:start position:0%
that uh the house clerk has and and it's
 
00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:20.200 align:start position:0%
not there but again that's possible um
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
anything is possible um
 
00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
so it would be
 
00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
safer um if we went off of that Thursday
 
00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:31.750 align:start position:0%
safer um if we went off of that Thursday
um

00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
idea um but it would be
 
00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.040 align:start position:0%
um it's completely up to us whatever we
 
00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
want to do for the record I'm I'm okay
 
00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:45.079 align:start position:0%
with either either way you you
 
00:36:48.750 --> 00:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned um I don't
 
00:36:52.430 --> 00:36:52.440 align:start position:0%
know maybe uh the vice chair can remind
 
00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:56.839 align:start position:0%
me was there any was there any dates or
 
00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:58.359 align:start position:0%
times that
 
00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839 align:start position:0%
um people could not meet they there were
 
00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:04.160 align:start position:0%
one um one of the members that's not
 
00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:07.720 align:start position:0%
here as I recall couldn't make hearings
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
or exec sessions on the last week of
 
00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.349 align:start position:0%
or exec sessions on the last week of
every

00:37:11.349 --> 00:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
month is that right um but that wouldn't
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
affect this so um that's the only one I
 
00:37:22.309 --> 00:37:22.319 align:start position:0%
know so I believe I may have indicated
 
00:37:24.270 --> 00:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
on a Tuesday it's very difficult
 
00:37:26.390 --> 00:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays are difficult yeah well we
 
00:37:28.309 --> 00:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
won't be doing Tuesday is because that
 
00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
is uh transportation in this room so
 
00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
that's out um yep are we vot or giving a
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
preference right now if you have one
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
mine would be the 20th yeah thank you
 
00:37:44.829 --> 00:37:44.839 align:start position:0%
you'd push it the week for
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
further um anybody else preference no
 
00:37:57.790 --> 00:37:57.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
so that could be done too the 12th
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.589 --> 00:38:10.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.599 --> 00:38:13.589 align:start position:0%
 
about

00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:17.760 align:start position:0%
okay um representative wall you
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
have ah see that's the ideal answer
 
00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:24.510 align:start position:0%
have ah see that's the ideal answer
right

00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
um well um we'll have to uh maybe we'll
 
00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:39.560 align:start position:0%
send off an email to the others um that
 
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:41.240 align:start position:0%
are coming in
 
00:38:44.829 --> 00:38:44.839 align:start position:0%
or um more mundane things we also have
 
00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:47.800 align:start position:0%
to uh start picking up and I have a list
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
of those um let's let's put that off for
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
well maybe we need to do it um I'd hate
 
00:38:57.470 --> 00:38:57.480 align:start position:0%
to schedule it for the 20th and then
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
find that we have a session a day um
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
then we're in another pickle
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
um and we have one bill that is an early
 
00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
bill which means March
 
00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
6th um that has to be acted upon um and
 
00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
and if we go to the 20th we would
 
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:23.710 align:start position:0%
and if we go to the 20th we would
still

00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
need I'm inclined to go to the 12th um
 
00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
is that going to is that going to mess
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:36.630 --> 00:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
L depends how many Valentine's Day
 
00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:38.560 align:start position:0%
dinners I
 
00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:43.589 align:start position:0%
dinners I
found

00:39:43.589 --> 00:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
um well the 19th not an option Mr the
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
19th the
 
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:55.030 align:start position:0%
19th the
Wednesday

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
um do you have any anyone else have any
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
problem with the 19th it's only gaining
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
us a day but um but it would protect us
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
if a session day comes in I try well
 
00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
here again it's hard to have everything
 
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:14.880 align:start position:0%
but I'm trying to not make it so that
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
for some people it's difficult for them
 
00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
to take two days in one week and if they
 
00:40:22.470 --> 00:40:22.480 align:start position:0%
do have a session and we have
 
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:26.280 align:start position:0%
um oh well maybe not I mean it we do
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
have um
 
00:40:32.470 --> 00:40:32.480 align:start position:0%
we do have a small schedule so
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
um what do you think of that what do you
 
00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
think of the 19th that work too and
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's not your no appointments that day
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
um is that part of can you look up uh
 
00:40:46.910 --> 00:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
representative ral's schedule I think
 
00:40:49.710 --> 00:40:49.720 align:start position:0%
that's outside that
 
00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
too why don't we why don't we um why
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
don't we say that let's say the 19th and
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
then we're
 
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
then we're good and if we can tell Karen
 
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.079 align:start position:0%
that we'll make everything as the same
 
00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:08.640 align:start position:0%
schedule um we'll do everything on the
 
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
19th okay so let's okay with that
 
00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.510 align:start position:0%
19th okay so let's okay with that

19th um good
 
00:41:20.589 --> 00:41:20.599 align:start position:0%
uh so here's this is probably a
 
00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:22.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate time to start talking about
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
absences um we have I have one
 
00:41:32.190 --> 00:41:32.200 align:start position:0%

side please let um our ranking member

00:41:58.750 --> 00:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
24 hours is necessary to replace you for
 
00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.589 align:start position:0%
24 hours is necessary to replace you for
exact

00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
exact
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
sessions thank
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
you you need anything from us let us
 
00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.950 align:start position:0%
you you need anything from us let us
know

00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.510 align:start position:0%
know
okay

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:10.030 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

00:42:10.030 --> 00:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:14.599 align:start position:0%
um and so um it's even things like
 
00:42:16.990 --> 00:42:17.000 align:start position:0%
amendments um if there's an amendment
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
that you're working on on a specific
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
bill that we've heard let us know um the
 
00:42:26.309 --> 00:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
the worst part of any of this is uh as
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
um representative wall will say is our
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
surprises um it's the it's the hardest
 
00:42:34.790 --> 00:42:34.800 align:start position:0%
thing to deal with so if we know that
 
00:42:37.349 --> 00:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
there there's an amendment coming in for
 
00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
instance and it hasn't been completed
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
yet we can maybe adjust the schedule for
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
that um that exact session day or
 
00:42:49.390 --> 00:42:49.400 align:start position:0%
something you know just let us know um
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
then even more mundane things we've got
 
00:42:56.349 --> 00:42:56.359 align:start position:0%
um um things like a new we have a new
 
00:42:59.230 --> 00:42:59.240 align:start position:0%
email address coming for everybody I I'm
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
assuming you are aware of all of that so
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
anybody that has business cards I think
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
that actually will work for the short
 
00:43:11.549 --> 00:43:11.559 align:start position:0%
term but eventually um there will be a a
 
00:43:15.790 --> 00:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
a.gov um email address um dress and
 
00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
um I've always said in the past try to
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
make sure you give an appearance as if
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
your mother was watching and she would
 
00:43:33.990 --> 00:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
be proud of you um so uh but that all
 
00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
goes uh from from the waist up as far as
 
00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
I'm concerned um I don't I don't think
 
00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:41.960 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea to have pink fuzzy
 
00:43:44.069 --> 00:43:44.079 align:start position:0%
slippers on underneath the counter but
 
00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
no one would know um we uh we voted down
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
our um the the rule Chang to uh have
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
business attire but um both most every
 
00:43:59.589 --> 00:43:59.599 align:start position:0%
everybody is looking pretty nicely today
 
00:44:02.109 --> 00:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
so I mean this kind of thing we just
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
want to uh present the image that we are
 
00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
Professional Organization so I'll leave
 
00:44:09.270 --> 00:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
it at that you're all
 
00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
professionals um food coffee
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
drink I prefer no food no drink on the
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
on the table um
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
yeah um it should be no food in the in
 
00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:28.000 align:start position:0%
the committee room actually um it should
 
00:44:33.750 --> 00:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
be um anything water is fine um but uh
 
00:44:35.230 --> 00:44:35.240 align:start position:0%
but anything else there are little
 
00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
shelves underneath here on the tables
 
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:41.640 align:start position:0%
that uh are a good place to put things
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
um I would uh I would prefer if someone
 
00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.549 align:start position:0%
um I would uh I would prefer if someone
is

00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:46.559 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
testifying um none of us are U are
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
grabbing our water bottles and uh and
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
um partaking so so um this is again kind
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
of uh an an office um and we want to
 
00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:06.160 align:start position:0%
project that image
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
um oh I should have asked do you happen
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
to know whether we have um lockable
 
00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:17.430 align:start position:0%
to know whether we have um lockable
draws

00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
draws
 
00:45:20.349 --> 00:45:20.359 align:start position:0%
anywhere um you know how all the other
 
00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:23.720 align:start position:0%
committees have U drawers that are
 
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
assigned to each yeah I it suddenly
 
00:45:30.390 --> 00:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
occurred to me this morning um I've
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
never used them but other people here do
 
00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:36.760 align:start position:0%
um that are stack lockable drawers just
 
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
for you for our committee um because
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
we're sharing this room with
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation I think those ones that
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
are in there are just strictly
 
00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:47.480 align:start position:0%
Transportation which means I have one
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
but I don't need it um but if if
 
00:45:54.349 --> 00:45:54.359 align:start position:0%
necessary if people would appreciate
 
00:45:57.430 --> 00:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
that um ability um I'll make make sure
 
00:46:01.589 --> 00:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
that we have them either here or in our
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
office down on the first floor
 
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
um yeah so um room 104 down below here
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
um is uh how do I describe where that is
 
00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh it's actually behind the ladies room
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
um on the in in the lobby area what' you
 
00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
okay so so there's actually five because
 
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
I don't want mine um so if anybody wants
 
00:46:54.069 --> 00:46:54.079 align:start position:0%
a lockable drawer here um you can have
 
00:46:58.470 --> 00:46:58.480 align:start position:0%
one um please please see Karen I guess
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:28.720 align:start position:0%
yep questions no good um
 
00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
um my suggestion is not to leave food in
 
00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:36.240 align:start position:0%
those but um that's a another story I'll
 
00:47:38.230 --> 00:47:38.240 align:start position:0%
tell you it another time not
 
00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:39.950 align:start position:0%
tell you it another time not
online

00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
um any medical issues please let me know
 
00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
and uh and we can make accommodations I
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
have no requirements for seating um
 
00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
generally I would like um uh for
 
00:47:56.589 --> 00:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
security purposes for you to be near the
 
00:47:56.599 --> 00:47:57.710 align:start position:0%
security purposes for you to be near the
end

00:47:57.710 --> 00:47:57.720 align:start position:0%
end
 
00:47:59.950 --> 00:47:59.960 align:start position:0%
um if everybody is happy where they are
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's fine with me um if you want uh I
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
don't I you know some other chairs want
 
00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:08.200 align:start position:0%
to make sure that there's alternating
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
Republicans and Democrats or all of them
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
on one side or the other I I don't care
 
00:48:15.950 --> 00:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
you're you're professionals yep just to
 
00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:18.920 align:start position:0%
follow up on on seating because um if
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
you recall I tend to come in at the very
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
last minute or sometimes late so if you
 
00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:27.400 align:start position:0%
want to review what your prep ref es and
 
00:48:29.870 --> 00:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
a protocol for that y um around
 
00:48:32.349 --> 00:48:32.359 align:start position:0%
testimony and and things and and coming
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
into the committee room that be so um
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
testifying um if if you do come in uh as
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
always I prefer people get here on time
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
um prior to prior to testimony um I'm
 
00:48:51.230 --> 00:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
usually right on the number um sometimes
 
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
within five minutes of afterwards but um
 
00:48:57.190 --> 00:48:57.200 align:start position:0%
if you come in and someone is testified
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
I prefer you wait um until they have
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
completed their testimony and then you
 
00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
move to your your chair um it's uh to me
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
a common courtesy thing likewise if you
 
00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:16.160 align:start position:0%
have to leave um like the clerk does um
 
00:49:19.870 --> 00:49:19.880 align:start position:0%
you um I would wait until uh or try to
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
time it so that uh if someone is done
 
00:49:25.109 --> 00:49:25.119 align:start position:0%
testifying you get up and leave
 
00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
obviously if there's an emergency a
 
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
medical emergency um just go um but uh
 
00:49:34.829 --> 00:49:34.839 align:start position:0%
again this gets back to letting us know
 
00:49:38.390 --> 00:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
what what to expect so if you have
 
00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:40.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps a hearing that you have to
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
testify on um while we're in the middle
 
00:49:47.150 --> 00:49:47.160 align:start position:0%
of hearings just let um the vice chair
 
00:49:49.710 --> 00:49:49.720 align:start position:0%
or I know um that you'll be leaving at
 
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
such and such a
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
time um and then you know you would find
 
00:49:57.549 --> 00:49:57.559 align:start position:0%
a time in while they're testifying while
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
people are coming in and out to testify
 
00:50:01.589 --> 00:50:01.599 align:start position:0%
where you would get up and leave at the
 
00:50:03.910 --> 00:50:03.920 align:start position:0%
time someone was leaving at the witness
 
00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:08.440 align:start position:0%
table that's all um again it's just uh
 
00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:10.680 align:start position:0%
letting us know what's going
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
on um use of electronic devices uh some
 
00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:19.480 align:start position:0%
chairs are not a fan of us having um
 
00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:22.680 align:start position:0%
electronic devices up and running while
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
um while people are testifying
 
00:50:30.109 --> 00:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
I can understand that um but I also
 
00:50:31.990 --> 00:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
understand the helpful nature there are
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
some people that like to take their
 
00:50:38.870 --> 00:50:38.880 align:start position:0%
notes on on a pad um or um laptop I
 
00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
would prefer it not
 
00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.230 align:start position:0%
would prefer it not
be

00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
H I would prefer two things one that it
 
00:50:50.799 --> 00:50:52.430 align:start position:0%
H I would prefer two things one that it
doesn't

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
block you from the person testifying I
 
00:50:59.230 --> 00:50:59.240 align:start position:0%
don't I I don't want people to be hiding
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
behind it um and the second thing is I
 
00:51:05.710 --> 00:51:05.720 align:start position:0%
don't want um a great big uh I don't
 
00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:09.480 align:start position:0%
know Grateful Dead no that's not that's
 
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
not bad no um but I you know uh I hate
 
00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
fossil fuels and you get the guys from
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh you
 
00:51:20.309 --> 00:51:20.319 align:start position:0%
know something sitting on here that's
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
all if it's if you need to use it or you
 
00:51:27.589 --> 00:51:27.599 align:start position:0%
want to use it I would have no problem
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
my only concern is I want to make sure
 
00:51:33.950 --> 00:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
the people that take the time to come
 
00:51:35.069 --> 00:51:35.079 align:start position:0%
here and
 
00:51:39.309 --> 00:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
testify believe and understand that
 
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
their testimony is the most important
 
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
thing that's going on here so I don't
 
00:51:46.349 --> 00:51:46.359 align:start position:0%
want to hear the candy crushed sound
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
when uh you know if there is such a
 
00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
thing I don't even know um but it is it
 
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
is vital that we have people come
 
00:52:00.470 --> 00:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
anticipate to us it is therefore only
 
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
common courtesy for us to give them our
 
00:52:06.789 --> 00:52:06.799 align:start position:0%
full attention and then that goes
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
to the fact that uh if you have a
 
00:52:12.270 --> 00:52:12.280 align:start position:0%
question about how their testimony is
 
00:52:15.309 --> 00:52:15.319 align:start position:0%
going or or something a statement that
 
00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:19.240 align:start position:0%
they made that that you want
 
00:52:23.589 --> 00:52:23.599 align:start position:0%
clarified you come through the chair um
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
just generally what people do is just
 
00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:29.000 align:start position:0%
get catch my eye and make sure that I
 
00:52:31.390 --> 00:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
have a question or something along those
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
lines um I will call on you um and you
 
00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:38.839 align:start position:0%
will ask your question we're not here to
 
00:52:43.230 --> 00:52:43.240 align:start position:0%
debate we're not here to um disagree
 
00:52:46.349 --> 00:52:46.359 align:start position:0%
with or or
 
00:52:49.190 --> 00:52:49.200 align:start position:0%
um make it anything other than a
 
00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
clarifying question um did I hear you
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
say um that this is this or can you
 
00:52:58.349 --> 00:52:58.359 align:start position:0%
explain more fully what you meant by
 
00:53:01.510 --> 00:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
this um that's fine if they still are
 
00:53:05.710 --> 00:53:05.720 align:start position:0%
not answering your concern um you can
 
00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
request a follow-up question to me and
 
00:53:11.230 --> 00:53:11.240 align:start position:0%
and usually what people do is while
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
they're talking if it's clear they're
 
00:53:15.349 --> 00:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
not understanding what your question is
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
they again catch my eye and they'll
 
00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
they'll make a sybol like you know
 
00:53:22.150 --> 00:53:22.160 align:start position:0%
followup I'd like to do that and I will
 
00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
um Grant the followup so um but the key
 
00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:28.760 align:start position:0%
thing is we are going to listen to
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
whatever they tell us um and not
 
00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
um I have already spoken to
 
00:53:44.109 --> 00:53:44.119 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd um
 
00:53:46.829 --> 00:53:46.839 align:start position:0%
about in this day and age we need to
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
have someone that is keyed in as our
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
security person so if we have if we have
 
00:54:00.230 --> 00:54:00.240 align:start position:0%
someone um that is is unruly and I'm I'm
 
00:54:02.270 --> 00:54:02.280 align:start position:0%
telling you there's almost no chance in
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
this committee we have very few people
 
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
come and testify anyway but um but if
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's somebody that is unruly or
 
00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
disruptive I will um ask them to control
 
00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:15.720 align:start position:0%
themselves and if it appears to be
 
00:54:19.549 --> 00:54:19.559 align:start position:0%
escalating um I will ask I would usually
 
00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
my way of doing it is saying
 
00:54:25.150 --> 00:54:25.160 align:start position:0%
Representative Steve can you go see if
 
00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.670 align:start position:0%
Representative Steve can you go see if
um

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
um someone you know someone is available
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
the Representative Steve rather than
 
00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative Boyd is the hint for you
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
know you need to go get someone and um
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
and so I'm going to ask that you know
 
00:54:45.789 --> 00:54:45.799 align:start position:0%
either you make your way quietly off um
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
off stage and and get some assistance
 
00:54:50.670 --> 00:54:50.680 align:start position:0%
the other Advantage we have is because
 
00:54:52.470 --> 00:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
these are recorded and someone is
 
00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:53.960 align:start position:0%
theoretically listening to these
 
00:54:57.069 --> 00:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
somewhere else um they may on their way
 
00:54:59.870 --> 00:54:59.880 align:start position:0%
already um so I may not even do that if
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
I'm certain that someone is already
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
listening um but that's we can have
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
other discussions about that fire
 
00:55:11.309 --> 00:55:11.319 align:start position:0%
escapes um we're going to go out the
 
00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:13.520 align:start position:0%
door and turn left and go all the way
 
00:55:15.390 --> 00:55:15.400 align:start position:0%
down to the end of the hall and then
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
down and into the legislative parking
 
00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
garage unless the fire is there then
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to go that way and you can
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
go either direction down those stairs
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
don't do the elev
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
right um what else we got uh committee
 
00:55:35.670 --> 00:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
seating I'm okay I don't care um
 
00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:38.240 align:start position:0%
currently we have 12 bills one early
 
00:55:41.750 --> 00:55:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill um I've already mentioned that
 
00:55:45.829 --> 00:55:45.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittees I'm not a fan um and
 
00:55:47.870 --> 00:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
typically if we do have a bill that
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
needs work uh I will ask and do a
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
committee of the whole um doesn't happen
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
very often it did last term when we
 
00:56:00.029 --> 00:56:00.039 align:start position:0%
worked on the ethics bill the recusal
 
00:56:03.750 --> 00:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
bill um but it always seemed that we
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
were better off having that discussion
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
as an entire group rather than um a
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
small group trying to work on it and
 
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
then bringing in explaining what they're
 
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
doing it just made more sense to me as a
 
00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:16.160 align:start position:0%
whole so I would do
 
00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.069 align:start position:0%
whole so I would do
that

00:56:18.069 --> 00:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:56:21.510 --> 00:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
um second committee work uh not an issue
 
00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
because it's only Vanessa and I that are
 
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
on other committees so we don't have to
 
00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
worry about that
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
um for your information though I learned
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
something um if if the second committee
 
00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
is having you can p put this in your in
 
00:56:39.589 --> 00:56:39.599 align:start position:0%
your list of things that you didn't know
 
00:56:41.990 --> 00:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
um if the second committee is having an
 
00:56:44.190 --> 00:56:44.200 align:start position:0%
exec session on the same
 
00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
day I've always thought that because uh
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
you were in the building you couldn't be
 
00:56:54.109 --> 00:56:54.119 align:start position:0%
replaced but apparently um we have a not
 
00:56:57.029 --> 00:56:57.039 align:start position:0%
a rule we have a
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
practice that allows I'm looking for
 
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:12.950 align:start position:0%
 
nothing

00:57:12.950 --> 00:57:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.870 --> 00:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
oh okay so not that it's going to come
 
00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:19.440 align:start position:0%
up but from for my purposes because
 
00:57:24.230 --> 00:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
Vanessa is serving in um
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
Edna I was concerned that if they if we
 
00:57:29.950 --> 00:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
schedule an exec session at the same
 
00:57:33.309 --> 00:57:33.319 align:start position:0%
time here while she's in an exec session
 
00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:35.960 align:start position:0%
there how are we going we were going to
 
00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:39.799 align:start position:0%
lose uh a vote on this side because um
 
00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
she would be in that and we couldn't
 
00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
yep yeah well I don't like working it
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
out I like the ability to uh to just say
 
00:58:02.470 --> 00:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
all right we'll have somebody else here
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
voting for that but I didn't know by the
 
00:58:09.150 --> 00:58:09.160 align:start position:0%
way um we are also kenti we also are a
 
00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
little unusual because we're probably
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
the only committee that has
 
00:58:17.910 --> 00:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
three past chairs or past and current
 
00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
chairs um in the committee so uh
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative wall uh has been chair
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
and representative turot has has also
 
00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:29.559 align:start position:0%
been share so um there may be times
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
while I'll say what did I screw up what
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
can we do um or what um is there
 
00:58:38.670 --> 00:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
something that I'm missing and I'm
 
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.160 align:start position:0%
counting on the two of you to jump in um
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
along with uh with our vice chair if uh
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
we get too far down a rabbit hole
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
somewhere along here just so you know
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
um committee Replacements uh minimum 24
 
00:58:57.910 --> 00:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
hours you need to know that before and
 
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
and let your ranking member or or
 
00:59:02.670 --> 00:59:02.680 align:start position:0%
Vanessa or I or the majority office
 
00:59:05.710 --> 00:59:05.720 align:start position:0%
know uh I've already done all the public
 
00:59:09.430 --> 00:59:09.440 align:start position:0%
hearing items there is a conflict of
 
00:59:11.829 --> 00:59:11.839 align:start position:0%
interest in recusal as I mentioned we we
 
00:59:16.349 --> 00:59:16.359 align:start position:0%
wrote it her names on it um so if you
 
00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:19.760 align:start position:0%
have uh a conflict that you believe um
 
00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:21.160 align:start position:0%
with any of the bills that were coming
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
up let us know and we'll help you with
 
00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:26.440 align:start position:0%
that um no surprise amendments I said
 
00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
that our bills are often times consent
 
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
um meaning that everybody is going the
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
same way on that um which is a good
 
00:59:39.910 --> 00:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
thing uh most of our bills are well
 
00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:43.720 align:start position:0%
known to us so that um I have no problem
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
reusing committee reports so if someone
 
00:59:50.349 --> 00:59:50.359 align:start position:0%
makes the motion um of whatever itl to
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
pass whatever the motion happens to be
 
00:59:55.710 --> 00:59:55.720 align:start position:0%
um we may already have the committee
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
report report pre-written so um that may
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
make it easier for somebody to make
 
01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.630 align:start position:0%
make it easier for somebody to make
those

01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
motions uh I think that's all done
 
01:00:10.029 --> 01:00:10.039 align:start position:0%
um we already talked about Jennifer
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
where she is she's up by the pool on the
 
01:00:12.319 --> 01:00:13.510 align:start position:0%
where she is she's up by the pool on the
fourth

01:00:13.510 --> 01:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
fourth
 
01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.390 align:start position:0%
fourth
floor

01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:15.400 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
um internet access uh we're going to
 
01:00:23.109 --> 01:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
deal with that um privately not
 
01:00:27.470 --> 01:00:27.480 align:start position:0%
online and there is a computer um in our
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
office on the fourth floor if you need
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
that um let us know we'll make
 
01:00:35.990 --> 01:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
sure you pretty much seem to have to
 
01:00:40.190 --> 01:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
just get in room 104 our office is off
 
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
the back of room 104 and but that door
 
01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:47.200 align:start position:0%
is usually unlocked right so um if you
 
01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
need a computer in there let us know
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
there's a computer and printer
 
01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:53.270 align:start position:0%
there's a computer and printer
so

01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
um what else um
 
01:00:59.630 --> 01:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
we've already done where to stay when
 
01:01:03.150 --> 01:01:03.160 align:start position:0%
the you're testifying somewhere else
 
01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
um we may have
 
01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
one um one bill that we end up working
 
01:01:12.390 --> 01:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
on as a as a collective and it's the
 
01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:15.640 align:start position:0%
lobbying bill um for those of you that
 
01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
were on the committee last time we had
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
that bill last time and we ended up
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
amending it and then it
 
01:01:26.589 --> 01:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
was um it was in it was indefinitely
 
01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:29.240 align:start position:0%
postponed wasn't it
 
01:01:31.789 --> 01:01:31.799 align:start position:0%
yes okay so it was indefinitely
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
postponed um I don't know if we're going
 
01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:37.480 align:start position:0%
to go the same route um or whether we
 
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
are going
 
01:01:42.150 --> 01:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
to um modify it in some way shape or
 
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
form but but the key thing is because it
 
01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
is an early
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
bill um the reason it's an early bill is
 
01:01:54.269 --> 01:01:54.279 align:start position:0%
it has um money attached to it uh
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
penalties or fees I forget now um and
 
01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:01.480 align:start position:0%
and we are going to um without question
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
at least amend that part out which would
 
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
mean it wouldn't qualify at that point
 
01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
as an early bill but we still need to
 
01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:10.760 align:start position:0%
get it
 
01:02:15.789 --> 01:02:15.799 align:start position:0%
done um and I asked uh representative
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
turot to almost make that his baby um so
 
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
U we are we are going to uh keep an eye
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
on that one
 
01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:27.630 align:start position:0%
on that one
[Music]

01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
um I think that's about all I have that
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
is important conflict recusal I've got
 
01:02:38.430 --> 01:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
that committee reports um intended to be
 
01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
clear concise summary of what happened
 
01:02:44.309 --> 01:02:44.319 align:start position:0%
um couple of times I had
 
01:02:52.069 --> 01:02:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.230 --> 01:02:57.240 align:start position:0%
and I um I try not to change change what
 
01:03:00.109 --> 01:03:00.119 align:start position:0%
you're intending but sometimes I have to
 
01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
um I will always talk with you if we
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
need to do something with it um either
 
01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
it it can't well we'll talk about it as
 
01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
it comes along I guess you there there
 
01:03:16.029 --> 01:03:16.039 align:start position:0%
are certain rules for committee reports
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
you can't just say you know the other
 
01:03:20.470 --> 01:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
side are a bunch of idiots and this is
 
01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
why we can't do this
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
um we have yeah go ahead you'll be this
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
suggest suggested AI for
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
the I am I am um but it also is not just
 
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
me um I have had a couple of times when
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
the speaker or the clerk has sent back
 
01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:42.880 align:start position:0%
um a committee report and
 
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
said is this accurate or is this correct
 
01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
and we have had to modify it um the one
 
01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
thing that I do want to talk about and
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
and this will be the last thing
 
01:04:00.430 --> 01:04:00.440 align:start position:0%
um this is true of the entire house from
 
01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
the time that
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
we when when a bill comes in it becomes
 
01:04:07.789 --> 01:04:07.799 align:start position:0%
ours right it's not it's no longer the
 
01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:10.440 align:start position:0%
prime sponsors it's our bill at that
 
01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
point this committee um from the time
 
01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:16.960 align:start position:0%
that we vote on it and exec it and send
 
01:04:19.630 --> 01:04:19.640 align:start position:0%
it into the calendar to the
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
house all the way from that point to the
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
point that it comes out of a committee
 
01:04:29.029 --> 01:04:29.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:33.309 --> 01:04:33.319 align:start position:0%
Senate we need to develop a way of of
 
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
still maintaining ownership of the work
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
that we've done in this committee so we
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
have coincidentally we have 12 bills we
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
have 12 members um but I think it would
 
01:04:52.349 --> 01:04:52.359 align:start position:0%
be a good idea if we um use people's
 
01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
talents to be able
 
01:04:58.750 --> 01:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
to own this bill as it leaves here
 
01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:02.240 align:start position:0%
whether that means um that person is
 
01:05:04.829 --> 01:05:04.839 align:start position:0%
testifying on it or setting up someone
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
to testify at the house level Andor
 
01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
whatever happens in the house
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
level um to be the person that also
 
01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:16.359 align:start position:0%
introduces it in the Senate and explains
 
01:05:19.150 --> 01:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
what we've done with this policy uh with
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
this um this bill and and why we did
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
what we did there has to be a way that
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
we don't just wash our hands of it and
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
say all right well we voted on it it's
 
01:05:32.670 --> 01:05:32.680 align:start position:0%
in the calendar it's all yours um there
 
01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be something someone some way
 
01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
from this committee to be able to um
 
01:05:42.670 --> 01:05:42.680 align:start position:0%
each own or or maybe we have one group
 
01:05:44.950 --> 01:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
that owns it from that point on but I'm
 
01:05:47.430 --> 01:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
open to suggestions um don't have to
 
01:05:49.109 --> 01:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
come up with them now but if there's a
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:56.839 align:start position:0%
maintain ownership um um because it is
 
01:05:58.589 --> 01:05:58.599 align:start position:0%
our bill as it comes out of this
 
01:06:01.269 --> 01:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
committee and uh and we are the ones
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
that theoretically know more about the
 
01:06:06.029 --> 01:06:06.039 align:start position:0%
subject matter than anyone else um so we
 
01:06:09.789 --> 01:06:09.799 align:start position:0%
should be the ones that tell um the the
 
01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:11.029 align:start position:0%
should be the ones that tell um the the
senate

01:06:11.029 --> 01:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:15.079 align:start position:0%
committee why we did what we did agreed
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
or does that
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
work um I also don't want to yeah sure
 
01:06:23.870 --> 01:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
with the just a follow-up question on
 
01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
that so in that role for example if we
 
01:06:28.630 --> 01:06:28.640 align:start position:0%
pull the thread all the way through that
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
would that person representing that
 
01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.589 align:start position:0%
would that person representing that
would

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:06:39.630 --> 01:06:39.640 align:start position:0%
almost um provide a synopsis but of both
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
sides of the discussion that would be
 
01:06:43.510 --> 01:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
something that I think as committee
 
01:06:45.549 --> 01:06:45.559 align:start position:0%
members we should kind of pledge to each
 
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
other that there would be what the
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
majority vote was and what we knew but
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
also the part that there should
 
01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
be maybe not equal but
 
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.160 align:start position:0%
a mention of the minority because that
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
gives the fullest picture of what
 
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
happened in the room I just so I think
 
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
this gets back to that communication
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
idea um and first off as I mentioned
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
most of our bills are consent um so
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
there is that but um but there's nothing
 
01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:18.950 align:start position:0%
there is that but um but there's nothing
wrong

01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
with um either the both the person that
 
01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:26.119 align:start position:0%
if there is a minority blurb for
 
01:07:28.950 --> 01:07:28.960 align:start position:0%
instance um which is a committee report
 
01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:31.960 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I keep reverting back to that
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
old vernacular um but if there is both
 
01:07:38.589 --> 01:07:38.599 align:start position:0%
then um there's nothing wrong with
 
01:07:42.510 --> 01:07:42.520 align:start position:0%
saying to um the minority person I
 
01:07:44.910 --> 01:07:44.920 align:start position:0%
intend to go to the Senate and testify
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
on what the majority position is if if
 
01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
you want to come as well and explain the
 
01:07:54.829 --> 01:07:54.839 align:start position:0%
other side you know have at it um uh
 
01:07:54.839 --> 01:07:56.230 align:start position:0%
other side you know have at it um uh
otherwise

01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
01:07:59.670 --> 01:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
you're right I mean there there's always
 
01:08:01.750 --> 01:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
not always but there's two sides to a
 
01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
story sometimes um keep in mind that
 
01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.150 align:start position:0%
story sometimes um keep in mind that
there's

01:08:06.150 --> 01:08:06.160 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
probably you're almost I'm looking at it
 
01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
as you're almost replacing the prime
 
01:08:13.269 --> 01:08:13.279 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the bill if we are amending
 
01:08:17.829 --> 01:08:17.839 align:start position:0%
it in this in this committee so um I
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
don't know I I'm I'm open the
 
01:08:19.799 --> 01:08:22.990 align:start position:0%
don't know I I'm I'm open the
suggestions

01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:32.870 --> 01:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
it's still our bill at that point I mean
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
yes I mean it may be that the prime
 
01:08:39.070 --> 01:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor would still be at the Senate
 
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
hearing but we are too um and it is and
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:49.070 --> 01:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
our our ownership I there may be a much
 
01:08:52.349 --> 01:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
lesser role if the bill goes through or
 
01:08:54.789 --> 01:08:54.799 align:start position:0%
um exactly the way it was originally
 
01:08:56.749 --> 01:08:56.759 align:start position:0%
written but
 
01:08:59.269 --> 01:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
um I don't know I'm just looking for a
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
way to still be attached to um our bill
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
when it's at the Senate same thing is
 
01:09:08.829 --> 01:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
when it comes out of the Senate you
 
01:09:11.910 --> 01:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
typically see one of the Senators um
 
01:09:15.110 --> 01:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
that will come and it's not always the
 
01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:18.199 align:start position:0%
um the senator that wrote it um someone
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
from the Senate will come and talk on
 
01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:23.159 align:start position:0%
one of their bills same thing but um
 
01:09:26.110 --> 01:09:26.120 align:start position:0%
anyway that's just I always look for a
 
01:09:28.910 --> 01:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
way to to pass it along
 
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
yeah for followup I tend to look at how
 
01:09:36.349 --> 01:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
implementation of this might work I like
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
the idea but once this starts to happen
 
01:09:43.030 --> 01:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
this afternoon in our discussion it
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
moves out of here potentially or at
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
least by the end of the month are you
 
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
then looking
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
for individuals to
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
volunteer in the same way that we have
 
01:09:57.590 --> 01:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
that discussion at the end of the Bill
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
of who's writing the
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
um so part of the other conversation is
 
01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:06.520 align:start position:0%
whether we are going to ever get into a
 
01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:09.080 align:start position:0%
situation where a bill either gets
 
01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
pulled off consent and and who is going
 
01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:14.510 align:start position:0%
pulled off consent and and who is going
to

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
um you all right tickle yeah um who is
 
01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
ever going to
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
um um Express the committee point
 
01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.229 align:start position:0%
um um Express the committee point
generally

01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
generally
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
um I mean we have we have to have
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
someone named from the committee on
 
01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
every um on every bill just in case
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
something somebody pulls something off
 
01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:45.880 align:start position:0%
or um so whether that is the person that
 
01:10:48.910 --> 01:10:48.920 align:start position:0%
wrote the blur or I I fully understand
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
that there are people that don't want to
 
01:10:53.310 --> 01:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
go to the floor and talk on things I
 
01:10:56.550 --> 01:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
also understand that some of our bills
 
01:10:58.990 --> 01:10:59.000 align:start position:0%
are great learning experiences for you
 
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
to do that um
 
01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
so um I think we have to be flexible on
 
01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:09.400 align:start position:0%
that who who is doing what um but if
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's something that you feel strongly
 
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.750 align:start position:0%
there's something that you feel strongly
about

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
um let one of us know that I would like
 
01:11:18.950 --> 01:11:18.960 align:start position:0%
to speak on the floor or not speak on
 
01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.149 align:start position:0%
to speak on the floor or not speak on
the

01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
floor that answer what you were saying
 
01:11:25.030 --> 01:11:25.040 align:start position:0%
or no yeah I I don't have I don't think
 
01:11:27.149 --> 01:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
I have a definitive answer for you I
 
01:11:29.550 --> 01:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
think it is a case by casee basis and we
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
only have 12 of them so um it's kind of
 
01:11:35.070 --> 01:11:35.080 align:start position:0%
simple it's not like we have 80 bills
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
and we have to divide up you know 15 of
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
them to everyone anyway that's I think
 
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
I'll leave it from there if you have
 
01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
suggestions and as we get to a bill I
 
01:11:48.910 --> 01:11:48.920 align:start position:0%
may you know whoever makes the motion
 
01:11:51.149 --> 01:11:51.159 align:start position:0%
I'll say you know is there going to or
 
01:11:54.189 --> 01:11:54.199 align:start position:0%
or whoever votes in the minority is
 
01:11:57.070 --> 01:11:57.080 align:start position:0%
there a minority BL and do you intend
 
01:12:01.110 --> 01:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
to um bring up the minority point of
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
view on the floor and then whatever
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
happens with it there's too many options
 
01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:08.400 align:start position:0%
at that point you know whether it gets
 
01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
amended on the floor who owns it all of
 
01:12:12.110 --> 01:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
those things so I don't know how we
 
01:12:13.629 --> 01:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
would ever get
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
there I think that's all I have
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
um unless somebody has you have ideas of
 
01:12:24.229 --> 01:12:24.239 align:start position:0%
what else we didn't touch on that we
 
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
should have um
 
01:12:31.709 --> 01:12:31.719 align:start position:0%
um no yes yep um we you started talking
 
01:12:33.430 --> 01:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
about having people kind of introduce
 
01:12:35.629 --> 01:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
themselves kind of like to Sure know
 
01:12:40.149 --> 01:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
about everybody here um why don't you
 
01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
start I'd like to go I'd like to go last
 
01:12:44.590 --> 01:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
no I don't I don't really care that's
 
01:12:46.870 --> 01:12:46.880 align:start position:0%
fine uh represent Len turot uh other
 
01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
than in professional situations I go by
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
Len not representative turot um fifth
 
01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:54.679 align:start position:0%
term uh first two terms I served on
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
labor first one with representative Hill
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
on my third term I was on labor Finance
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
redistricting and Senior advisor in the
 
01:13:05.669 --> 01:13:05.679 align:start position:0%
majority office last term uh chair of
 
01:13:07.870 --> 01:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County this term I
 
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
requested no committee um until
 
01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
representative Hill called me and said
 
01:13:14.990 --> 01:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
would you mind being on legi admin and I
 
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:17.560 align:start position:0%
said since it's a light committee I
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
would uh love to do that so and I came
 
01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:23.400 align:start position:0%
through with that I only have 12 bills
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
right I mean my AP
 
01:13:27.750 --> 01:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
Steve Boyd hooks at
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
dun what other committee you also served
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
on labor for a while I'm on uh this is
 
01:13:37.189 --> 01:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
my third term I've been on labor and
 
01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
Edna and why not on those now because
 
01:13:44.110 --> 01:13:44.120 align:start position:0%
this is a light load here and you ask me
 
01:13:46.629 --> 01:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
specifically to be on your committee you
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:52.950 --> 01:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
theme uh Carrie senson I represent
 
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
psmith this is my first term
 
01:13:58.990 --> 01:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
um which is unusual in this committee by
 
01:14:02.310 --> 01:14:02.320 align:start position:0%
the way um up until last year this used
 
01:14:06.629 --> 01:14:06.639 align:start position:0%
to be um you know you had to I was not
 
01:14:09.709 --> 01:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
sure when I asked for this committee
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
whether I would qualify because I had
 
01:14:15.149 --> 01:14:15.159 align:start position:0%
only five terms at that point um it used
 
01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
to be you were and and it used to be
 
01:14:22.470 --> 01:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
populated with the um the speaker the
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
majority leader the um you know Deputy
 
01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:27.400 align:start position:0%
something it used to oh yeah I'm getting
 
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:31.080 align:start position:0%
nodding from it used to be um almost
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
like rules committee that you you were
 
01:14:37.790 --> 01:14:37.800 align:start position:0%
here for a while and knew how the
 
01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
legislature operated for a good reason I
 
01:14:42.950 --> 01:14:42.960 align:start position:0%
think but last term I think we ended up
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
with six six freshman um so you're not

committee I I can be on a committee but
 
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
it's not overwhelming with the time
 
01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
commitment so I like that I just uh
 
01:17:57.550 --> 01:17:57.560 align:start position:0%

way P or P it doesn't matter okay yeah I
 
01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:07.600 align:start position:0%
I was going to apologize but I guess
 
01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:23.750 align:start position:0%
I was going to apologize but I guess
no

01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:53.709 align:start position:0%
 
Janet

01:19:44.629 --> 01:19:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
um something I you said that that
 
01:19:51.270 --> 01:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
trigger a question and now it's gone um
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
yeah um you'll notice that that another
 
01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
part of the scheduling that we've always
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
tried to do these are these are um
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
temporary walls that come in so if they
 
01:20:05.310 --> 01:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
happen to be in in session at the same
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
time it can get loud um for a while we
 
01:20:12.669 --> 01:20:12.679 align:start position:0%
were working in double rooms and it was
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
much better I thought but uh but these
 
01:20:18.149 --> 01:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
these can get loud so uh I apologize for
 
01:20:20.510 --> 01:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
that in advance can't remember what it
 
01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
is I was going to ask you
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
um doesn't matter it'll come
 
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:28.510 align:start position:0%

back

01:20:28.510 --> 01:20:28.520 align:start position:0%

to the the
 
01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
term um I think I did I already say what
 
01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
I am I am I've been here since 2010
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
um uh nothing else I guess um I've been
 
01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
on a whole bunch of other committees um
 
01:21:01.990 --> 01:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
I try to use our time efficiently that's
 
01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
my goal um so I apologize in advance if
 
01:21:08.910 --> 01:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
there's things that I'll do that um that
 
01:21:11.149 --> 01:21:11.159 align:start position:0%
don't fit your particular schedule but
 
01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to get everybody um as close
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
to U being uniform as we can we do have
 
01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
two additional members um one that
 
01:21:23.110 --> 01:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
you'll meet this afternoon for the
 
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
hearing at 1 um and the who you probably
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
don't is he a
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
freshman um representative Barton yes he
 
01:21:37.390 --> 01:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
is okay um so I have not met him either
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
but um representative Barton is the
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
Freshman he'll be here at one and
 
01:21:44.990 --> 01:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
representative verville is the other um
 
01:21:48.030 --> 01:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
he is I don't know five terms maybe
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:57.510 --> 01:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
that right right um he too opted out of
 
01:22:00.870 --> 01:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
being um having a committee I think and
 
01:22:02.790 --> 01:22:02.800 align:start position:0%
uh and just when he thought he was out
 
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
we dragged him back in but um he is uh
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
um because of work he has difficulty
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
making times um and I as I mentioned
 
01:22:17.510 --> 01:22:17.520 align:start position:0%
earlier he's out for the last week of
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
traveling uh for his business um so um
 
01:22:23.590 --> 01:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
he'll he'll be in and out but he's
 
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
always an active grou member um anything
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
else that uh we need to
 
01:22:33.709 --> 01:22:33.719 align:start position:0%
do see what happens with scheduling um
 
01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
so our hearing is at 1 um if there's
 
01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:41.149 align:start position:0%
so our hearing is at 1 um if there's
anything

01:22:41.149 --> 01:22:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
now and the and the downside of that
 
01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.270 align:start position:0%
now and the and the downside of that
is

01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
um we um if I'll be here probably for a
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
half hour or so if there are things that
 
01:23:01.629 --> 01:23:01.639 align:start position:0%
people privately want to discuss with
 
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
Vanessa or I um you know may maybe there
 
01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
are issues that that want want need
 
01:23:11.510 --> 01:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
personal attention um other than that um
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
we have a hearing beginning at
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
1 I don't see any reason that we won't
 
01:23:21.950 --> 01:23:21.960 align:start position:0%
be done by two but uh I'm often wrong as
 
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
I uh as I have announced already
 
01:23:28.590 --> 01:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
um with that I'm happy to close the
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
orientation and move oh yes represent
 
01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:39.550 align:start position:0%
orientation and move oh yes represent

proceedings allowing a 10-minute break
 
03:03:20.070 --> 03:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
after three-hour continuous legislative
 
03:03:22.150 --> 03:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
session would be highly beneficial
 
03:03:25.110 --> 03:03:25.120 align:start position:0%
beneficial to older employed parent and
 
03:03:27.309 --> 03:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
caretaker legislators for several
 
03:03:30.630 --> 03:03:30.640 align:start position:0%

from sitting for extended periods a
 
03:03:38.190 --> 03:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
short break provides an opportunity to
 
03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
stand stretch and move around helping to
 
03:03:42.750 --> 03:03:42.760 align:start position:0%

that can arise from prolonged sitting
 
03:03:50.389 --> 03:03:50.399 align:start position:0%
this is crucial for maintaining
 
03:03:53.070 --> 03:03:53.080 align:start position:0%
long-term health and preventing burnout
 
03:03:54.830 --> 03:03:54.840 align:start position:0%

03:03:57.389 --> 03:03:57.399 align:start position:0%
be V more vulnerable to these physical
 
03:04:00.269 --> 03:04:00.279 align:start position:0%

legislative duties a 10-minute break
 
03:04:29.229 --> 03:04:29.239 align:start position:0%

feeling
 
03:05:13.510 --> 03:05:13.520 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed it is our role as elected
 
03:05:15.550 --> 03:05:15.560 align:start position:0%
officials to emulate the behavior we
 
03:05:18.469 --> 03:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
wish to see in others if a constituent
 
03:05:20.510 --> 03:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
contacted me and told me that her
 
03:05:22.469 --> 03:05:22.479 align:start position:0%
employer demanded she worked 7 hours
 
03:05:24.590 --> 03:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
straight without a bathroom break or any
 
03:05:26.710 --> 03:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
kind of break you can be sure that I
 
03:05:28.190 --> 03:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
would look into that
 
03:05:31.670 --> 03:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
situation House Bill 96 uh I'm sorry

would be willing to take
 
03:06:27.309 --> 03:06:27.319 align:start position:0%
questions correct yeah are there any
 
03:06:30.510 --> 03:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
questions for the prime
 
03:06:32.670 --> 03:06:32.680 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative
 
03:06:35.950 --> 03:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
Bon what's what's the present
 
03:06:38.750 --> 03:06:38.760 align:start position:0%
practice the present practice is we come
 
03:06:40.710 --> 03:06:40.720 align:start position:0%
back after lunch which is approximately
 
03:06:43.510 --> 03:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
1 o'clock and sometimes we can go to 4 5
 
03:06:46.469 --> 03:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
6 7:00 at night sometimes even later
 
03:06:50.070 --> 03:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
with non no stop no break at all and um
 
03:06:52.990 --> 03:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
I follow up you will ask for yeah if I
 
03:06:56.229 --> 03:06:56.239 align:start position:0%
if I can follow up um if someone needed
 
03:06:58.710 --> 03:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
to to take a break or use the bathroom
 
03:07:02.630 --> 03:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
could they not request from the chair to
 
03:07:06.670 --> 03:07:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:09.910 --> 03:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
break I don't think that's I've ever
 
03:07:11.830 --> 03:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
heard of that happening and but this is
 
03:07:15.469 --> 03:07:15.479 align:start position:0%
also for the floor um in when we have
 
03:07:17.750 --> 03:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
session so I don't think you can ask the
 
03:07:23.309 --> 03:07:23.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:26.309 --> 03:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
person I would I would follow up with if
 
03:07:29.510 --> 03:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
if a member needed to use the bathroom
 
03:07:32.190 --> 03:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
during session what would that member do
 
03:07:34.630 --> 03:07:34.640 align:start position:0%
so I'm glad you brought that up because
 
03:07:36.550 --> 03:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
this is something that we have discussed
 
03:07:38.670 --> 03:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
what we do is we figure out the people
 
03:07:40.830 --> 03:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
that that speak longer and we sort of
 
03:07:43.389 --> 03:07:43.399 align:start position:0%
time it so that we are using the
 
03:07:46.229 --> 03:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
bathroom um when these people who who
 
03:07:49.510 --> 03:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
typically speak longer go forcing us to
 
03:07:51.590 --> 03:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
not do our job because we can't hear
 
03:07:53.870 --> 03:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
that person speak while we're while
 
03:07:55.710 --> 03:07:55.720 align:start position:0%
we're using the bathroom or checking in
 
03:07:57.590 --> 03:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
on our kids at home or checking in at
 
03:08:00.510 --> 03:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
work so this is not just the bathroom we
 
03:08:03.950 --> 03:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
also have some older Representatives who
 
03:08:07.110 --> 03:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
uh use uh incontinence pads and this
 
03:08:09.950 --> 03:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
would allow them the dignity to to
 
03:08:12.110 --> 03:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
change their pad on a regular basis or
 
03:08:14.670 --> 03:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
something um it would just give everyone
 
03:08:18.110 --> 03:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
a break a a deserved
 
03:08:21.229 --> 03:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
break thank you any further
 
03:08:25.670 --> 03:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
questions I have one oh sure um do I
 
03:08:29.150 --> 03:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
understand that uh you're saying um
 
03:08:34.110 --> 03:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
someone has asked for from the chair or
 
03:08:37.269 --> 03:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
um or anyone else I can understand the
 
03:08:39.830 --> 03:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
the floor being different um but asked
 
03:08:44.229 --> 03:08:44.239 align:start position:0%
for um a break in in a committee room
 
03:08:47.990 --> 03:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
and been not given it I am I
 
03:08:49.550 --> 03:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
I have no experience with that I've
 
03:08:51.710 --> 03:08:51.720 align:start position:0%
never seen that in my committee um I've
 
03:08:53.349 --> 03:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
not heard of it happening in other
 
03:08:55.750 --> 03:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
committees so I I can't I can't really
 
03:08:57.870 --> 03:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
say for sure I've just I've never seen
 
03:09:00.830 --> 03:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
that I've never seen a session being I
 
03:09:04.309 --> 03:09:04.319 align:start position:0%
mean a a session being stopped like that
 
03:09:09.910 --> 03:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:13.550 --> 03:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
um yes um like chairman
 
03:09:16.550 --> 03:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
she um has there ever been a time where
 
03:09:18.349 --> 03:09:18.359 align:start position:0%
a session has has gone on for seven
 
03:09:20.910 --> 03:09:20.920 align:start position:0%
hours straight where no break was taken
 
03:09:24.389 --> 03:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
because if I recall the speaker
 
03:09:27.429 --> 03:09:27.439 align:start position:0%
um had to provide a lunch break if we I
 
03:09:30.510 --> 03:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
mean an evening supper break if we went
 
03:09:32.590 --> 03:09:32.600 align:start position:0%
past six o'clock I
 
03:09:32.600 --> 03:09:34.910 align:start position:0%
past six o'clock I
believe

03:09:34.910 --> 03:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
believe
 
03:09:34.920 --> 03:09:36.630 align:start position:0%
believe
um

03:09:36.630 --> 03:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:39.269 --> 03:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
I I think the clerk might be able to
 
03:09:42.269 --> 03:09:42.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:46.710 --> 03:09:46.720 align:start position:0%
me um however if we have a dinner break
 
03:09:49.229 --> 03:09:49.239 align:start position:0%
that's typically at 5 or 6 we still come
 
03:09:52.349 --> 03:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
from from after launch to 5 or 6 without
 
03:09:52.359 --> 03:09:53.710 align:start position:0%
from from after launch to 5 or 6 without
a

03:09:53.710 --> 03:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:09:53.720 --> 03:10:04.790 align:start position:0%
a
break

03:10:04.790 --> 03:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:08.750 --> 03:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
non-stop yes um is there anything that
 
03:10:11.150 --> 03:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
would uh prohibit a member either in
 
03:10:14.510 --> 03:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
committee or on the floor um from making
 
03:10:17.510 --> 03:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
a motion for a brief recess
 
03:10:20.190 --> 03:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
and getting a a vote of the membership
 
03:10:22.469 --> 03:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
instead of mandator it m making it
 
03:10:23.990 --> 03:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory in
 
03:10:27.190 --> 03:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
law I don't believe I have the answer to
 
03:10:38.890 --> 03:10:38.900 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:38.900 --> 03:10:51.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:10:51.190 --> 03:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:54.110 --> 03:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
probably thank you Mr chairman
 
03:10:56.710 --> 03:10:56.720 align:start position:0%
I thank you I appreciate it um I'll be
 
03:10:59.790 --> 03:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
brief uh I just wanted to give uh some
 
03:11:03.830 --> 03:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
testimony uh to back this up um the
 
03:11:08.030 --> 03:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
reason I would find it really helpful um
 
03:11:11.150 --> 03:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
in legislative sessions particularly is
 
03:11:14.349 --> 03:11:14.359 align:start position:0%
because last year last term I underwent
 
03:11:17.590 --> 03:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
two knee surgeries um in which case I
 
03:11:19.429 --> 03:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
was either in a wheelchair or on
 
03:11:22.389 --> 03:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
crutches I don't know if you guys if any
 
03:11:24.990 --> 03:11:25.000 align:start position:0%
of you have had the chance to walk from
 
03:11:28.750 --> 03:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
section four or or crutch or wheelchair
 
03:11:31.710 --> 03:11:31.720 align:start position:0%
from section four all the way to the
 
03:11:34.910 --> 03:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
women's bathroom and then all the way
 
03:11:37.990 --> 03:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
back to your seat while worrying about
 
03:11:41.910 --> 03:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
missing any testimony missing any um any
 
03:11:43.950 --> 03:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
hearings or or any anything that we
 
03:11:47.349 --> 03:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
needed to be hearing um but it is
 
03:11:50.590 --> 03:11:50.600 align:start position:0%
certainly very scary um at times because
 
03:11:53.030 --> 03:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
I worried that I'd miss a vote I'd miss
 
03:11:56.349 --> 03:11:56.359 align:start position:0%
a roll call um and in my incapacitated
 
03:11:58.429 --> 03:11:58.439 align:start position:0%
state it was very difficult to get back
 
03:12:01.510 --> 03:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
in the allotted um time of the speaker
 
03:12:03.990 --> 03:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
and know when the speaker would start or
 
03:12:07.710 --> 03:12:07.720 align:start position:0%
stop um it is quite a long walk
 
03:12:12.070 --> 03:12:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:15.269 --> 03:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative W um I
 
03:12:16.429 --> 03:12:16.439 align:start position:0%
don't know if you might have the answer
 
03:12:19.150 --> 03:12:19.160 align:start position:0%
to this but um do you know if there's a
 
03:12:21.389 --> 03:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
reason that this was brought as a House
 
03:12:24.349 --> 03:12:24.359 align:start position:0%
Bill rather than a rule
 
03:12:26.670 --> 03:12:26.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily sorry that might I don't
 
03:12:28.830 --> 03:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
know I could I could possibly refer to
 
03:12:31.110 --> 03:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor uh representative
 
03:12:33.870 --> 03:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
Thomas um but I don't personally
 
03:12:37.190 --> 03:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
know she can come back up after we're
 
03:12:39.150 --> 03:12:39.160 align:start position:0%
done with representative
 
03:12:42.870 --> 03:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
Lloyd any further questions yes thank
 
03:12:44.269 --> 03:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
03:12:45.910 --> 03:12:45.920 align:start position:0%
testimony I hadn't thought of it that
 
03:12:49.790 --> 03:12:49.800 align:start position:0%
way although I've been position um is
 
03:12:51.190 --> 03:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
there anything to stop this from being
 
03:12:52.630 --> 03:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
in house
 
03:12:55.269 --> 03:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
rules again I would have to refer to the
 
03:12:59.309 --> 03:12:59.319 align:start position:0%
prime um sponsor thank um I have this I
 
03:13:02.309 --> 03:13:02.319 align:start position:0%
heard about this uh this legislation um
 
03:13:04.070 --> 03:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
a little while ago so I just wanted to
 
03:13:07.349 --> 03:13:07.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that I gave my assessment of
 
03:13:10.950 --> 03:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
how difficult it was last term for me
 
03:13:14.229 --> 03:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
personally thank you any further
 
03:13:17.590 --> 03:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
questions representative Bon
 
03:13:20.750 --> 03:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
would um would there be anything that
 
03:13:23.790 --> 03:13:23.800 align:start position:0%
would prohibit a member from making a
 
03:13:26.790 --> 03:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
request of the speaker um or the the
 
03:13:28.910 --> 03:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
chairman in cases of of committee
 
03:13:32.229 --> 03:13:32.239 align:start position:0%
meetings for reasonable accommodation to
 
03:13:35.389 --> 03:13:35.399 align:start position:0%
uh for for a reassignment of a seat or a
 
03:13:37.429 --> 03:13:37.439 align:start position:0%
temporary seat that's closer to the
 
03:13:39.630 --> 03:13:39.640 align:start position:0%
bathroom sure um I appreciate that
 
03:13:42.950 --> 03:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
question um so as it stands right now
 
03:13:44.510 --> 03:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
because of our assigned seats we're
 
03:13:47.630 --> 03:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
typically uh anybody reassigned to
 
03:13:50.550 --> 03:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
um a a seat needing extra Services I
 
03:13:52.510 --> 03:13:52.520 align:start position:0%
believe the clerk might actually be able
 
03:13:55.790 --> 03:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
to answer this better but um we were put
 
03:13:58.910 --> 03:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
kind of at the back of um of the house
 
03:14:02.150 --> 03:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
floor either in the chairs or um when I
 
03:14:03.630 --> 03:14:03.640 align:start position:0%
was in a wheelchair it was kind of
 
03:14:08.670 --> 03:14:08.680 align:start position:0%
behind section four um and uh in order
 
03:14:11.309 --> 03:14:11.319 align:start position:0%
to make a motion I would have had to get
 
03:14:15.150 --> 03:14:15.160 align:start position:0%
myself down to the podium to make that
 
03:14:18.150 --> 03:14:18.160 align:start position:0%
motion um either via whe chair and have
 
03:14:21.950 --> 03:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
someone push me or um or crutch all the
 
03:14:24.389 --> 03:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
way down there um potentially like
 
03:14:27.670 --> 03:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
interrupting some legislation um and
 
03:14:30.990 --> 03:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
causing some concern and or just simple
 
03:14:33.429 --> 03:14:33.439 align:start position:0%
embarrassment um of having to ask for a
 
03:14:36.309 --> 03:14:36.319 align:start position:0%
bathroom break for myself specifically
 
03:14:38.950 --> 03:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
um and that weighs a lot on me because I
 
03:14:43.229 --> 03:14:43.239 align:start position:0%
do not want to impede the legislative um
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
process from happening because I
 
03:14:49.269 --> 03:14:49.279 align:start position:0%
personally need to go to the bathroom um
 
03:14:52.710 --> 03:14:52.720 align:start position:0%
so I I would follow up um Mr chairman
 
03:14:55.750 --> 03:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
would um you will I I will I'll Grant
 
03:14:57.229 --> 03:14:57.239 align:start position:0%
you the
 
03:15:00.750 --> 03:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
followup thank you very much um uh I'm
 
03:15:03.030 --> 03:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
gonna restate my question if I I didn't
 
03:15:06.190 --> 03:15:06.200 align:start position:0%
state it properly uh my question was is
 
03:15:08.590 --> 03:15:08.600 align:start position:0%
there anything prohibiting a member from
 
03:15:11.630 --> 03:15:11.640 align:start position:0%
making a request of the speaker or the
 
03:15:14.469 --> 03:15:14.479 align:start position:0%
chairman outside of session or outside
 
03:15:18.710 --> 03:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
of committee for the accommodation
 
03:15:21.990 --> 03:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
um it would it would still require the I
 
03:15:24.630 --> 03:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
believe the best way I could answer that
 
03:15:27.710 --> 03:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
is it would still require the speaker to
 
03:15:30.750 --> 03:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
pause the H the general court session in
 
03:15:32.990 --> 03:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
order to allow for that type of a break
 
03:15:35.389 --> 03:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
and to ask for that for one person on
 
03:15:37.670 --> 03:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
the house floor it would be really
 
03:15:39.150 --> 03:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
difficult despite the fact that there
 
03:15:41.429 --> 03:15:41.439 align:start position:0%
may be other people who would also need
 
03:15:45.030 --> 03:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
to go at that point in time um but it is
 
03:15:47.429 --> 03:15:47.439 align:start position:0%
very difficult to have one member
 
03:15:50.070 --> 03:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
stand up and say can we request a motion
 
03:15:52.590 --> 03:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
there it has been done a couple of times
 
03:15:56.389 --> 03:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
on lengthy um lengthy uh session days I
 
03:15:59.750 --> 03:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
believe but um it again you have to
 
03:16:01.670 --> 03:16:01.680 align:start position:0%
basically judge it within yourself to
 
03:16:04.750 --> 03:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
say I really really really need to go
 
03:16:06.990 --> 03:16:07.000 align:start position:0%
and that's a bit
 
03:16:09.349 --> 03:16:09.359 align:start position:0%
embarrassing thank you one one more
 
03:16:15.510 --> 03:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
followup sure um sure last quickly um I
 
03:16:17.950 --> 03:16:17.960 align:start position:0%
uh I I guess
 
03:16:20.070 --> 03:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
is there anything prohibiting a member
 
03:16:22.710 --> 03:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
from making that request outside of
 
03:16:25.110 --> 03:16:25.120 align:start position:0%
session or committee or must the request
 
03:16:28.030 --> 03:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
be made during I would have sorry um I
 
03:16:30.429 --> 03:16:30.439 align:start position:0%
didn't mean to jump the gun there but um
 
03:16:33.070 --> 03:16:33.080 align:start position:0%
I would have to know ahead of time what
 
03:16:35.110 --> 03:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
specific breaks I would need and when I
 
03:16:37.469 --> 03:16:37.479 align:start position:0%
would need them um sometimes it was just
 
03:16:40.229 --> 03:16:40.239 align:start position:0%
to take pain meds um so that I was not
 
03:16:42.469 --> 03:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
taking pain meds on the house floor
 
03:16:45.150 --> 03:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
sometimes it was to get to the bathroom
 
03:16:48.030 --> 03:16:48.040 align:start position:0%
um but if I knew a ahead of time that if
 
03:16:49.150 --> 03:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
03:16:51.309 --> 03:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
three-hour break or the three-hour
 
03:16:53.189 --> 03:16:53.199 align:start position:0%
session and then there would be a break
 
03:16:56.550 --> 03:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
I could um I I'm sure manage to get to
 
03:16:58.429 --> 03:16:58.439 align:start position:0%
that three-hour
 
03:17:00.990 --> 03:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
Mark okay thank you very much for your
 
03:17:03.790 --> 03:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
testimony uh there was one question if
 
03:17:06.550 --> 03:17:06.560 align:start position:0%
um representative Thomas wants to do her
 
03:17:09.349 --> 03:17:09.359 align:start position:0%
best with a quick answer that would be
 
03:17:12.150 --> 03:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
great thank you Mr chair I intend to do
 
03:17:15.750 --> 03:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
my best um that that actually is a
 
03:17:17.550 --> 03:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
question that has come up why wasn't
 
03:17:19.990 --> 03:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
this introduced as a rule as opposed to
 
03:17:23.429 --> 03:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
a bill um and the reason is that we know
 
03:17:25.550 --> 03:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
from previous experience that rules can
 
03:17:27.950 --> 03:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
be overturned by the party that is in
 
03:17:30.590 --> 03:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
the majority this is not something that
 
03:17:32.269 --> 03:17:32.279 align:start position:0%
should ever be overturned this is a
 
03:17:34.229 --> 03:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
protection that should be permanent for
 
03:17:36.510 --> 03:17:36.520 align:start position:0%
all legislators going
 
03:17:39.910 --> 03:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
forward you're welcome thank
 
03:17:44.030 --> 03:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
you uh I have no other pink cards um I
 
03:17:46.229 --> 03:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
don't know if the clerk would like to
 
03:17:48.750 --> 03:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
chime in on anything that was brought up
 
03:17:56.429 --> 03:17:56.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:00.870 --> 03:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
um um we we can discuss that in in exec
 
03:18:04.349 --> 03:18:04.359 align:start position:0%
session if we need to um seeing no other
 
03:18:07.070 --> 03:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
pink cards um I will close the hearing
 
03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
on uh House Bill 118 and uh just a brief
 
03:18:18.349 --> 03:18:18.359 align:start position:0%
time to reset um like the new the new
 
03:18:22.110 --> 03:18:22.120 align:start position:0%
tag on the on the witness table um we'll
 
03:19:12.950 --> 03:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:16.790 --> 03:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
the time being 1:40 I'll open the
 
03:19:21.229 --> 03:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
hearing on uh House Bill 347 recognize
 
03:19:25.510 --> 03:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor um representative
 
03:19:29.870 --> 03:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:32.510 --> 03:19:32.520 align:start position:0%
back I think that was the briefest break
 
03:19:35.269 --> 03:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
I have possibly had in a while um thank
 
03:19:36.790 --> 03:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
03:19:40.070 --> 03:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
hearing me um I'll try to be as brief as
 
03:19:41.590 --> 03:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
possible I was before this committee
 
03:19:43.910 --> 03:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
last term uh with this basically
 
03:19:48.269 --> 03:19:48.279 align:start position:0%
identical bill um the the reason I am
 
03:19:51.790 --> 03:19:51.800 align:start position:0%
submitting this as a bill um it possibly
 
03:19:56.389 --> 03:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
got lost last term um I gave a a brief
 
03:19:58.429 --> 03:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
description of my personal experience
 
03:20:01.910 --> 03:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
and why this was an issue um in which
 
03:20:05.870 --> 03:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
case I had an employer who um agreed at
 
03:20:08.309 --> 03:20:08.319 align:start position:0%
the onset that I could go ahead and do
 
03:20:10.950 --> 03:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
legislative Ser like my legislative
 
03:20:14.349 --> 03:20:14.359 align:start position:0%
tasks and duties and attend session days
 
03:20:17.269 --> 03:20:17.279 align:start position:0%
um however at one point it just became
 
03:20:19.870 --> 03:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
untenable to them and so they decided
 
03:20:22.070 --> 03:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
that I could not attend legislative
 
03:20:25.389 --> 03:20:25.399 align:start position:0%
sessions and prohibited me from doing so
 
03:20:28.590 --> 03:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
um which then basically led to me
 
03:20:32.269 --> 03:20:32.279 align:start position:0%
needing to schedule um a a break in
 
03:20:36.469 --> 03:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
order to do my legislative Duty um this
 
03:20:40.070 --> 03:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
particular bill would set up a leave of
 
03:20:43.469 --> 03:20:43.479 align:start position:0%
absence policy basically essentially um
 
03:20:45.389 --> 03:20:45.399 align:start position:0%
it keeps coming to ledge admin because
 
03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
it has to do with our job but
 
03:20:48.710 --> 03:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
technically it's kind of more of an
 
03:20:52.550 --> 03:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
employment protection um for folks who
 
03:20:55.910 --> 03:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
are needing to work um and also needing
 
03:20:59.030 --> 03:20:59.040 align:start position:0%
to attend legislative sessions it's just
 
03:21:01.349 --> 03:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
for house session days when we are it's
 
03:21:04.309 --> 03:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
mandatory that we're there it is not
 
03:21:07.309 --> 03:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
meant for committee work it's not meant
 
03:21:10.510 --> 03:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
for any type of meetings or um any type
 
03:21:10.520 --> 03:21:12.229 align:start position:0%
for any type of meetings or um any type
of

03:21:12.229 --> 03:21:12.239 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:21:14.950 --> 03:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
uh things that we need to do for
 
03:21:17.510 --> 03:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
campaigning any of that type of stuff it
 
03:21:19.990 --> 03:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
specifically is for days when we are
 
03:21:22.150 --> 03:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
required to be in our seat for our vote
 
03:21:25.469 --> 03:21:25.479 align:start position:0%
to be counted um last term when I was
 
03:21:27.469 --> 03:21:27.479 align:start position:0%
looking into this legislation the
 
03:21:30.349 --> 03:21:30.359 align:start position:0%
biggest concern that I found when I was
 
03:21:35.550 --> 03:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
considering it is um the fact
 
03:21:39.309 --> 03:21:39.319 align:start position:0%
that our house calendar is publicized
 
03:21:40.750 --> 03:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
which is fine that's that's the way it
 
03:21:41.950 --> 03:21:41.960 align:start position:0%
should be the public should know what
 
03:21:44.670 --> 03:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
we're voting on in on certain days but
 
03:21:47.830 --> 03:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
my biggest concern here is that if we
 
03:21:50.630 --> 03:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
had a closely tied session like we had
 
03:21:53.469 --> 03:21:53.479 align:start position:0%
last term um an employer could see what
 
03:21:56.110 --> 03:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
is on the docket and basically tell
 
03:21:58.910 --> 03:21:58.920 align:start position:0%
their employee no you can't go and then
 
03:22:01.070 --> 03:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
that puts that particular rep in a
 
03:22:04.189 --> 03:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
position of deciding whether or not they
 
03:22:07.910 --> 03:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
can continue their job um or if they
 
03:22:10.550 --> 03:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
disregard their employer and come in and
 
03:22:13.349 --> 03:22:13.359 align:start position:0%
vote anyway in legislative session um we
 
03:22:16.830 --> 03:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
did have one uh one rep testify that she
 
03:22:18.990 --> 03:22:19.000 align:start position:0%
felt her employer had done that last
 
03:22:22.670 --> 03:22:22.680 align:start position:0%
term um so or they testified last term
 
03:22:25.150 --> 03:22:25.160 align:start position:0%
but it was in a prior um term that they
 
03:22:28.389 --> 03:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
felt their employer had done that so I
 
03:22:30.469 --> 03:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
thought about it and I was like what can
 
03:22:33.630 --> 03:22:33.640 align:start position:0%
we do in order to protect our
 
03:22:36.710 --> 03:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
legislative duties here um and make sure
 
03:22:38.830 --> 03:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
that those are prioritized over any type
 
03:22:40.910 --> 03:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
of um employment that we have outside of
 
03:22:42.550 --> 03:22:42.560 align:start position:0%
the state because we are representing
 
03:22:45.510 --> 03:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
our people and I hold that very very
 
03:22:49.070 --> 03:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
high um in my regard
 
03:22:52.269 --> 03:22:52.279 align:start position:0%
um I didn't want to submit any type of a
 
03:22:54.870 --> 03:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
bill or legislation to increase payments
 
03:22:57.670 --> 03:22:57.680 align:start position:0%
to us because I don't feel like that
 
03:23:00.349 --> 03:23:00.359 align:start position:0%
should be passed down to the taxpayer um
 
03:23:02.189 --> 03:23:02.199 align:start position:0%
and this was the best thing that I could
 
03:23:04.830 --> 03:23:04.840 align:start position:0%
think of that would not cause any type
 
03:23:07.670 --> 03:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
of um an increase in our salary but it
 
03:23:09.189 --> 03:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
would still allow us to do what we
 
03:23:11.110 --> 03:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
needed to do on the days that we needed
 
03:23:13.550 --> 03:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
to do it for the session dates that
 
03:23:15.670 --> 03:23:15.680 align:start position:0%
didn't have anything except for
 
03:23:17.990 --> 03:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory atten
 
03:23:21.590 --> 03:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
um I've been working in nonprofit for 18
 
03:23:24.189 --> 03:23:24.199 align:start position:0%
plus years I don't know of any other
 
03:23:26.710 --> 03:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
organization that says this is volunteer
 
03:23:28.870 --> 03:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
work and it's okay for you to volunteer
 
03:23:32.590 --> 03:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
and potentially lose your job um I have
 
03:23:36.469 --> 03:23:36.479 align:start position:0%
been working in payroll and and Human
 
03:23:39.389 --> 03:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
Resources all of those years I will say
 
03:23:42.229 --> 03:23:42.239 align:start position:0%
that in the past I'd say five or so
 
03:23:45.030 --> 03:23:45.040 align:start position:0%
years I have seen an increase in
 
03:23:47.229 --> 03:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
employers requiring some sort of
 
03:23:49.550 --> 03:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
documentation in order to allow a
 
03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
variance to their employment policies
 
03:23:54.389 --> 03:23:54.399 align:start position:0%
right now a lot of employers have a
 
03:23:56.870 --> 03:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
policy in place where it states that you
 
03:23:59.590 --> 03:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
can be absent for up to three days
 
03:24:02.189 --> 03:24:02.199 align:start position:0%
before you have to have a doctor's note
 
03:24:05.910 --> 03:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
um it is very diff I foresee a point in
 
03:24:10.110 --> 03:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
time where we will get uh to questioning
 
03:24:13.269 --> 03:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
why we need this many days or this many
 
03:24:17.070 --> 03:24:17.080 align:start position:0%
hours um to be at the state house and I
 
03:24:19.750 --> 03:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
foresee any issues um or I foresee a lot
 
03:24:22.429 --> 03:24:22.439 align:start position:0%
of issues around that so that's why I
 
03:24:24.110 --> 03:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
had come up with this it kind of sets it
 
03:24:27.910 --> 03:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
up like jury duty um where the employer
 
03:24:30.189 --> 03:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
does not need to pay the employee for
 
03:24:33.150 --> 03:24:33.160 align:start position:0%
that time off all they need to do is
 
03:24:35.469 --> 03:24:35.479 align:start position:0%
understand that those session days are
 
03:24:37.469 --> 03:24:37.479 align:start position:0%
guaranteed to that legislator so that
 
03:24:38.950 --> 03:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
they can be there to fulfill their
 
03:24:38.960 --> 03:24:40.150 align:start position:0%
they can be there to fulfill their
legislative

03:24:40.150 --> 03:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
legislative
 
03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
Duty um
 
03:24:45.750 --> 03:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
so that is that piece of it I'm open to
 
03:24:47.790 --> 03:24:47.800 align:start position:0%
any question
 
03:24:50.150 --> 03:24:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony um are
 
03:24:53.070 --> 03:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
there questions for representative
 
03:24:55.910 --> 03:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
Lloyd yes representative
 
03:24:59.229 --> 03:24:59.239 align:start position:0%
weight uh yes thank you Mr chair um so
 
03:25:00.990 --> 03:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
how did you end up arriving or
 
03:25:05.990 --> 03:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
calculating the specific 168 hours sure
 
03:25:09.189 --> 03:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
um so that that piece of things I'm open
 
03:25:11.349 --> 03:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
to change the number of hours I came up
 
03:25:13.550 --> 03:25:13.560 align:start position:0%
with it by looking at how many days we
 
03:25:17.429 --> 03:25:17.439 align:start position:0%
were asked to reserve off in the 2020 to
 
03:25:19.189 --> 03:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
legislative calendar and then
 
03:25:21.830 --> 03:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
multiplying that by eight hours um per
 
03:25:24.189 --> 03:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
day uh so that that way I could come up
 
03:25:26.790 --> 03:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
with some sort of number um I would like
 
03:25:30.189 --> 03:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
to do a review of the number of days
 
03:25:31.910 --> 03:25:31.920 align:start position:0%
that we've actually been called into
 
03:25:34.189 --> 03:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
session and potentially come up with a
 
03:25:37.550 --> 03:25:37.560 align:start position:0%
better average um I would be open to um
 
03:25:39.910 --> 03:25:39.920 align:start position:0%
changing that number slightly but it is
 
03:25:41.790 --> 03:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
quite a number of hours and so I wanted
 
03:25:44.469 --> 03:25:44.479 align:start position:0%
to cap it off so that it was not too
 
03:25:46.990 --> 03:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
much of a burden on employer
 
03:25:52.269 --> 03:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:55.910 --> 03:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
2022 thank you um and then how would
 
03:25:58.550 --> 03:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
this function for out of state employers
 
03:25:59.950 --> 03:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
as well compared to New Hampshire
 
03:26:04.110 --> 03:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
employers sure um so technically I I
 
03:26:06.429 --> 03:26:06.439 align:start position:0%
would not necessarily benefit directly
 
03:26:08.830 --> 03:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
from this uh change because I work in
 
03:26:11.510 --> 03:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts in my 9 to5 job uh this
 
03:26:14.790 --> 03:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
would I foresee this happening for New
 
03:26:18.070 --> 03:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers um because we can't
 
03:26:20.990 --> 03:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
really legislate for I would love to see
 
03:26:22.630 --> 03:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
this go Federal that would be great but
 
03:26:24.349 --> 03:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
uh we can't legislate for employers that
 
03:26:26.150 --> 03:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
are beyond our state borders however
 
03:26:28.870 --> 03:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
what I foresee this doing is allowing
 
03:26:31.309 --> 03:26:31.319 align:start position:0%
people like myself who may work in other
 
03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:34.160 align:start position:0%
states to have at least an argument to
 
03:26:36.870 --> 03:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
bring to their employer and say in New
 
03:26:39.630 --> 03:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they're required to do this so
 
03:26:42.670 --> 03:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
it it would be beneficial if I could get
 
03:26:46.870 --> 03:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
into um get to do what I need to do
 
03:26:49.550 --> 03:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
thank you that's all for me further
 
03:26:53.990 --> 03:26:54.000 align:start position:0%
questions represent s thank you chairman
 
03:26:58.309 --> 03:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
um so do you have an idea of how many
 
03:27:00.750 --> 03:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
employees an employer has to have before
 
03:27:04.950 --> 03:27:04.960 align:start position:0%
this Tak effect I did not put a minimum
 
03:27:08.110 --> 03:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
employee requirement in there however um
 
03:27:09.670 --> 03:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
it's not that I wouldn't be amable to
 
03:27:12.670 --> 03:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
doing that it I did put a hardship
 
03:27:15.150 --> 03:27:15.160 align:start position:0%
clause in there and I tried to keep the
 
03:27:18.389 --> 03:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
legislation as efficient as possible um
 
03:27:21.110 --> 03:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
by not including redundant pieces of
 
03:27:23.990 --> 03:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
material so basically if an employer had
 
03:27:26.150 --> 03:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
a hardship because they have too few
 
03:27:29.229 --> 03:27:29.239 align:start position:0%
employees or if they had an employee who
 
03:27:31.870 --> 03:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
was um the only person serving in that
 
03:27:34.150 --> 03:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
particular department they would be able
 
03:27:40.910 --> 03:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:44.309 --> 03:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
Exempted no further comment I I have one
 
03:27:47.070 --> 03:27:47.080 align:start position:0%
sure um so in that instance that you're
 
03:27:49.710 --> 03:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
talking about uh that they would claim a
 
03:27:52.590 --> 03:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
hardship um actually it's a two-part
 
03:27:55.510 --> 03:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
question who would they claim that too
 
03:27:58.990 --> 03:27:59.000 align:start position:0%
um is that someone like the house Clerk
 
03:28:01.229 --> 03:28:01.239 align:start position:0%
or is that someone like uh the
 
03:28:03.630 --> 03:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor and and the second
 
03:28:07.229 --> 03:28:07.239 align:start position:0%
part of the question is
 
03:28:11.750 --> 03:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
um what if it's or or is that able to be
 
03:28:16.309 --> 03:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
um denied or um what what happens if if
 
03:28:19.389 --> 03:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
they refuse to do that that is the piece
 
03:28:22.830 --> 03:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
that I would really um like to dig into
 
03:28:25.510 --> 03:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
more with um ideally I was hoping this
 
03:28:28.670 --> 03:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
would kind of go to the um labor and
 
03:28:31.309 --> 03:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
Industrial um offices because they tend
 
03:28:33.510 --> 03:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
to deal with leave of absences and those
 
03:28:36.950 --> 03:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
types of of uh legisla legislative
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
requirements um but I believe it I mean
 
03:28:42.590 --> 03:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
we have a process already for jury duty
 
03:28:46.110 --> 03:28:46.120 align:start position:0%
exemptions um I don't know who uh who
 
03:28:48.670 --> 03:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
exempts for jury duty um but I would
 
03:28:51.870 --> 03:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
assume it would follow a similar
 
03:28:56.030 --> 03:28:56.040 align:start position:0%
process okay um any further questions
 
03:28:57.790 --> 03:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
03:29:01.750 --> 03:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
testimony um I have only one other pink
 
03:29:05.630 --> 03:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
card uh for this um and it happens to be
 
03:29:08.790 --> 03:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
from uh the Department of Labor um chair
 
03:29:10.790 --> 03:29:10.800 align:start position:0%
calls uh John
 
03:29:16.189 --> 03:29:16.199 align:start position:0%
garion who is neutral on Bill thank you
 
03:29:17.670 --> 03:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
thank you chair members of the committee
 
03:29:19.630 --> 03:29:19.640 align:start position:0%
my name is John garan I am general
 
03:29:22.670 --> 03:29:22.680 align:start position:0%
counsel with the Department of Labor uh
 
03:29:24.830 --> 03:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
the department is neutral on the bill
 
03:29:26.550 --> 03:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
I'm just here today to provide some
 
03:29:28.309 --> 03:29:28.319 align:start position:0%
technical guidance and procedural
 
03:29:30.269 --> 03:29:30.279 align:start position:0%
information specifically about section
 
03:29:34.830 --> 03:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
five uh of the bill um RSA
 
03:29:38.229 --> 03:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
2731 11a uh that's the general penalty
 
03:29:39.790 --> 03:29:39.800 align:start position:0%
provision that the Department of Labor
 
03:29:42.670 --> 03:29:42.680 align:start position:0%
relies on when it's enforcing labor laws
 
03:29:46.590 --> 03:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
um the way that works is uh a first time
 
03:29:48.309 --> 03:29:48.319 align:start position:0%
violation um there's a statut
 
03:29:49.950 --> 03:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
requirement that the commissioner
 
03:29:53.269 --> 03:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
provide a warning to the employer and
 
03:29:55.830 --> 03:29:55.840 align:start position:0%
then the employer has 30 days to cure or
 
03:29:59.349 --> 03:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
correct um whatever violative condition
 
03:30:01.870 --> 03:30:01.880 align:start position:0%
there is any subsequent violations would
 
03:30:04.750 --> 03:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
be subject to a penalty of up to
 
03:30:04.760 --> 03:30:06.269 align:start position:0%
be subject to a penalty of up to
$2,500

03:30:06.269 --> 03:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
$2,500
 
03:30:10.269 --> 03:30:10.279 align:start position:0%
um one note um that we saw when
 
03:30:13.870 --> 03:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
reviewing this bill is while RSA 2731
 
03:30:16.750 --> 03:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
11a provides a penalty it does not not
 
03:30:19.750 --> 03:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
kind of in and of itself provide a
 
03:30:21.950 --> 03:30:21.960 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction or authorization for the
 
03:30:23.950 --> 03:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
Department to engage in any sort of
 
03:30:25.870 --> 03:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
Investigation um if the committee's
 
03:30:28.110 --> 03:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
intent was to have uh the department
 
03:30:30.429 --> 03:30:30.439 align:start position:0%
investigate the situations and then
 
03:30:33.630 --> 03:30:33.640 align:start position:0%
bring enforcement actions um that our
 
03:30:35.710 --> 03:30:35.720 align:start position:0%
suggestion would be to um amend the
 
03:30:39.389 --> 03:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
language to add um a either
 
03:30:41.429 --> 03:30:41.439 align:start position:0%
authorization within the bill itself or
 
03:30:44.030 --> 03:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
to amend either one of the provisions of
 
03:30:48.150 --> 03:30:48.160 align:start position:0%
RSA 273 or perhaps RSA 275 to allow for
 
03:30:49.790 --> 03:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
that and the department is happy to work
 
03:30:51.830 --> 03:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
with the committee on actual kind of
 
03:30:53.429 --> 03:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
recommended language to achieve that
 
03:30:57.030 --> 03:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
effect but that I'm happy to take
 
03:30:59.349 --> 03:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
03:31:01.469 --> 03:31:01.479 align:start position:0%
there uh representative
 
03:31:03.630 --> 03:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
turot thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
03:31:05.790 --> 03:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
taking the question uh does the
 
03:31:07.830 --> 03:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor have jurisdiction
 
03:31:10.750 --> 03:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
outside of the State of New Hampshire no
 
03:31:10.760 --> 03:31:12.710 align:start position:0%
outside of the State of New Hampshire no
thank

03:31:12.710 --> 03:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:31:17.189 --> 03:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
you any further questions so so I will
 
03:31:19.750 --> 03:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
piggyback on that
 
03:31:22.870 --> 03:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
um Would we not be setting up a
 
03:31:28.030 --> 03:31:28.040 align:start position:0%
situation where um non domestic um
 
03:31:30.469 --> 03:31:30.479 align:start position:0%
employers would be treated differently
 
03:31:35.630 --> 03:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
than International or or out of state
 
03:31:38.710 --> 03:31:38.720 align:start position:0%
companies um there could be times where
 
03:31:40.150 --> 03:31:40.160 align:start position:0%
there are employers that operate in
 
03:31:41.550 --> 03:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
multiple States including New Hampshire
 
03:31:43.349 --> 03:31:43.359 align:start position:0%
we would certainly have uh jurisdiction
 
03:31:46.030 --> 03:31:46.040 align:start position:0%
over those types of employers but uh If
 
03:31:47.950 --> 03:31:47.960 align:start position:0%
an employer operated solely outside of
 
03:31:49.910 --> 03:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
the state or solely on an international
 
03:31:51.710 --> 03:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
basis we would not have jurisdiction
 
03:31:55.710 --> 03:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
over them so there could be times where
 
03:31:57.750 --> 03:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
under this the commissioner could impose
 
03:31:59.110 --> 03:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
penalties against certain companies but
 
03:32:00.630 --> 03:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
not others
 
03:32:05.030 --> 03:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um further
 
03:32:07.189 --> 03:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:32:08.309 --> 03:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
much for your
 
03:32:12.389 --> 03:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
testimony um I have again no
 
03:32:16.710 --> 03:32:16.720 align:start position:0%
further pink cards um anyone else
 
03:32:19.790 --> 03:32:19.800 align:start position:0%
wanting to speak seeing none I'll close
 
03:32:21.990 --> 03:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
03:32:24.189 --> 03:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
on what was that
 
03:32:29.030 --> 03:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
347 thank you um actually we're right on
 
03:32:34.750 --> 03:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
time if we want to uh reset the banner
 
03:32:36.349 --> 03:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh we'll be ready to go
 
03:32:39.189 --> 03:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
shortly while I have a quick second
 
03:32:41.990 --> 03:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
though um you missed a couple of pieces
 
03:32:45.830 --> 03:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
from this morning's um orientation one
 
03:32:49.550 --> 03:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
one is um we ask for no drink or food on
 
03:32:53.030 --> 03:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
the on the table um there is a little uh
 
03:32:56.030 --> 03:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
shelf underneath on the underneath the
 
03:32:59.389 --> 03:32:59.399 align:start position:0%
table here that uh they keep there um
 
03:33:03.110 --> 03:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
the other part is um the procedure for
 
03:33:06.469 --> 03:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
um questions of the of the um people
 
03:33:09.229 --> 03:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
coming and giving us testimony so
 
03:33:12.269 --> 03:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
typically um the one thing that is
 
03:33:16.670 --> 03:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
mandatory is we are um and not casting
 
03:33:19.630 --> 03:33:19.640 align:start position:0%
aspersions here but we are here to get
 
03:33:24.550 --> 03:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
information from them um we are um in no
 
03:33:30.990 --> 03:33:31.000 align:start position:0%
way going to try to um uh qu question
 
03:33:34.110 --> 03:33:34.120 align:start position:0%
them like you would see on uh on out of
 
03:33:36.189 --> 03:33:36.199 align:start position:0%
the any of the Committees in Washington
 
03:33:39.070 --> 03:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
you know where um and we are trying to
 
03:33:41.830 --> 03:33:41.840 align:start position:0%
just understand what information they
 
03:33:44.590 --> 03:33:44.600 align:start position:0%
are trying to Pro provide to us we are
 
03:33:47.189 --> 03:33:47.199 align:start position:0%
looking for clar ifying questions
 
03:33:50.830 --> 03:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
basically um and the procedure is um if
 
03:33:54.189 --> 03:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
they are answering a question either
 
03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
that you didn't ask um or not answering
 
03:34:01.150 --> 03:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
your question um during their testimony
 
03:34:04.950 --> 03:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
you would look over ask for a followup
 
03:34:07.150 --> 03:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
with a and Signal or something like that
 
03:34:09.189 --> 03:34:09.199 align:start position:0%
and then I will ask if you have a
 
03:34:11.389 --> 03:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
followup and then and then we go from
 
03:34:17.150 --> 03:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:19.510 --> 03:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
we don't have
 
03:34:22.229 --> 03:34:22.239 align:start position:0%

of the department um the department has
 
03:36:16.389 --> 03:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
serious concerns with HB 315
 
03:36:17.990 --> 03:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh as you see from the proposed
 
03:36:22.510 --> 03:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
legislation uh it amends RSA 17 D3 uh
 
03:36:24.349 --> 03:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with legislative investigations
 
03:36:27.229 --> 03:36:27.239 align:start position:0%
and most specifically found on lines 10
 
03:36:30.269 --> 03:36:30.279 align:start position:0%
through 14 if an employee it states if
 
03:36:32.469 --> 03:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
an employee of a state agency knowingly
 
03:36:34.309 --> 03:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
provides false information before the
 
03:36:36.790 --> 03:36:36.800 align:start position:0%

or FAL saring under RSA 64 1 colon 2 and
 
03:36:48.870 --> 03:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
tampering with Witnesses and informant
 
03:36:50.990 --> 03:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
03:36:54.309 --> 03:36:54.319 align:start position:0%
6415 uh it also amends the statute
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
involving stated employees appearing
 
03:36:58.510 --> 03:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
before the legislature uh and it
 
03:37:00.309 --> 03:37:00.319 align:start position:0%
requires us to wearing our
 
03:37:01.990 --> 03:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
identification badges this was a law
 
03:37:04.349 --> 03:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
that was created back in 2005 because of
 
03:37:05.750 --> 03:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
transparency in government it was
 
03:37:07.630 --> 03:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
important to know who is coming before
 
03:37:09.150 --> 03:37:09.160 align:start position:0%
the legislative committees you'll see I
 
03:37:11.349 --> 03:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
honor this every occasion I don't think
 
03:37:13.790 --> 03:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
uh on any exception I've been without it
 
03:37:15.110 --> 03:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh my landyard might have broke but my
 
03:37:18.269 --> 03:37:18.279 align:start position:0%
card was always still there um passage
 
03:37:20.910 --> 03:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
of the um bill would create a chilling
 
03:37:23.269 --> 03:37:23.279 align:start position:0%
effect for state employees including
 
03:37:24.950 --> 03:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
those at the department to communicate
 
03:37:26.590 --> 03:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
with the legislature to provide you with
 
03:37:28.830 --> 03:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
the important information needed for you
 
03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
to develop State
 
03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
policy um respecting the Constitutional
 
03:37:35.590 --> 03:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
doctrine of separations of power and for
 
03:37:37.710 --> 03:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
those of you who I've testified before I
 
03:37:40.630 --> 03:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
I honor that um like you do I we all
 
03:37:42.429 --> 03:37:42.439 align:start position:0%
taken an oath at some point I did as an
 
03:37:44.710 --> 03:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
attorney when I swore into the Barb New
 
03:37:46.429 --> 03:37:46.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to hold the constitution of
 
03:37:47.670 --> 03:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
the state and the United States of
 
03:37:50.550 --> 03:37:50.560 align:start position:0%
America as well and we do respect that
 
03:37:52.110 --> 03:37:52.120 align:start position:0%
but it's also understood that the
 
03:37:53.910 --> 03:37:53.920 align:start position:0%
branches of government work best and
 
03:37:55.550 --> 03:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
most efficiently when they communicate
 
03:37:57.469 --> 03:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
effectively between each other whether
 
03:37:59.469 --> 03:37:59.479 align:start position:0%
it's the now legislative branch
 
03:38:01.950 --> 03:38:01.960 align:start position:0%
communicating with the digital Branch or
 
03:38:03.389 --> 03:38:03.399 align:start position:0%
the executive branch communicating with
 
03:38:05.269 --> 03:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch or our branch of
 
03:38:06.510 --> 03:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
government the executive branch
 
03:38:08.710 --> 03:38:08.720 align:start position:0%
communicating with you and you more
 
03:38:10.469 --> 03:38:10.479 align:start position:0%
importantly communicating back with us
 
03:38:13.070 --> 03:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
in the development of really good policy
 
03:38:14.309 --> 03:38:14.319 align:start position:0%
and and
 
03:38:18.750 --> 03:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
legislation um with that um said uh
 
03:38:21.429 --> 03:38:21.439 align:start position:0%
there's already in place um the for both
 
03:38:24.150 --> 03:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
branches of government under the um um
 
03:38:26.229 --> 03:38:26.239 align:start position:0%
for legislator and to the executive
 
03:38:28.990 --> 03:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
branch agencies for for um uh the Ethics
 
03:38:30.830 --> 03:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
Committee so if there is an occasion
 
03:38:32.389 --> 03:38:32.399 align:start position:0%
where there's any impropriety whether
 
03:38:36.389 --> 03:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
it's a conflict of interest or um other
 
03:38:39.510 --> 03:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh improprieties before this body there
 
03:38:41.710 --> 03:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
is a remedy to go before at least in our
 
03:38:43.510 --> 03:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
occasion the ethics the legislative
 
03:38:44.830 --> 03:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
executive branch Ethics Committee
 
03:38:47.229 --> 03:38:47.239 align:start position:0%
there's a very formal process they swear
 
03:38:49.910 --> 03:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
uh Witnesses in and they adjudicate
 
03:38:51.750 --> 03:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
those matters when they come before them
 
03:38:53.870 --> 03:38:53.880 align:start position:0%
also in addition to that for uh folks
 
03:38:56.309 --> 03:38:56.319 align:start position:0%
like myself who are licensed I am an
 
03:38:57.790 --> 03:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
active member of the New Hampshire bar
 
03:39:00.189 --> 03:39:00.199 align:start position:0%
although my current role before you now
 
03:39:02.469 --> 03:39:02.479 align:start position:0%
is as legislative director that I'm also
 
03:39:03.830 --> 03:39:03.840 align:start position:0%
accountable to the New Hampshire Bar
 
03:39:05.309 --> 03:39:05.319 align:start position:0%
Association for what I do before this
 
03:39:06.870 --> 03:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
committee and cander towards this
 
03:39:09.429 --> 03:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
committee is as important as cander
 
03:39:11.990 --> 03:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
towards a tribunal and in a court and we
 
03:39:13.550 --> 03:39:13.560 align:start position:0%
take that very very seriously when we
 
03:39:17.670 --> 03:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
come before the legislature HB 1315
 
03:39:20.590 --> 03:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
singles out only the executive branch
 
03:39:22.910 --> 03:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
government it doesn't uh focus on the
 
03:39:24.870 --> 03:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
legislative branch the judicial branch
 
03:39:26.910 --> 03:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
or any other individuals who come before
 
03:39:26.920 --> 03:39:27.630 align:start position:0%
or any other individuals who come before
this

03:39:27.630 --> 03:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:39:29.469 --> 03:39:29.479 align:start position:0%
committee um I'm just going to get to
 
03:39:30.510 --> 03:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
the point because I'm keeping to that
 
03:39:32.389 --> 03:39:32.399 align:start position:0%
three minute time repres Hill uh
 
03:39:34.590 --> 03:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
chairman Hill uh here and I will be
 
03:39:36.790 --> 03:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
providing you with a copy of my bulleted
 
03:39:38.750 --> 03:39:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh testimony but the New Hampshire
 
03:39:40.590 --> 03:39:40.600 align:start position:0%
tradition is one of transparency of
 
03:39:42.750 --> 03:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
government and working together with you
 
03:39:45.389 --> 03:39:45.399 align:start position:0%
and providing a law that would create a
 
03:39:48.030 --> 03:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
criminal offense or at least the
 
03:39:49.790 --> 03:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
possibility of being accused of a
 
03:39:52.870 --> 03:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
criminal offense would create a chilling
 
03:39:54.670 --> 03:39:54.680 align:start position:0%
effect for that very positive
 
03:39:56.309 --> 03:39:56.319 align:start position:0%
communication that happens New Hampshire
 
03:39:58.630 --> 03:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
does it right we have it right and there
 
03:40:00.269 --> 03:40:00.279 align:start position:0%
are already checks and balances in the
 
03:40:02.189 --> 03:40:02.199 align:start position:0%
process in the system to ensure the
 
03:40:04.349 --> 03:40:04.359 align:start position:0%
Integrity of that process this bill is
 
03:40:06.510 --> 03:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
not only need not needed but it would go
 
03:40:08.590 --> 03:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
completely opposite of the way we do
 
03:40:09.750 --> 03:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
things here in New Hampshire and with
 
03:40:11.830 --> 03:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
that chairman Hill I'm available to
 
03:40:13.110 --> 03:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
answer questions from the committee I'm
 
03:40:14.830 --> 03:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
here today on behalf of the Department
 
03:40:16.990 --> 03:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
of Health services but I would represent
 
03:40:18.710 --> 03:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
to you this is obviously a concern to
 
03:40:21.150 --> 03:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
many other state agencies within uh our
 
03:40:23.510 --> 03:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
state government thank you very much for
 
03:40:26.710 --> 03:40:26.720 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
03:40:30.790 --> 03:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
questions I have one um you mentioned uh
 
03:40:33.070 --> 03:40:33.080 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee and and that being
 
03:40:36.469 --> 03:40:36.479 align:start position:0%
a viable process for handling situations
 
03:40:38.830 --> 03:40:38.840 align:start position:0%
like this has that ever been done to
 
03:40:40.389 --> 03:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
your knowledge I would have well
 
03:40:42.070 --> 03:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
fortunately for me I've not been before
 
03:40:43.950 --> 03:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee so I don't have was
 
03:40:45.870 --> 03:40:45.880 align:start position:0%
accusing you of anything personal
 
03:40:48.150 --> 03:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that uh but I do believe
 
03:40:49.189 --> 03:40:49.199 align:start position:0%
that that's handled through the
 
03:40:51.309 --> 03:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and certainly you
 
03:40:53.309 --> 03:40:53.319 align:start position:0%
could inquire uh through your legal
 
03:40:55.110 --> 03:40:55.120 align:start position:0%
council a wonderful attorney general for
 
03:40:56.309 --> 03:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to provide her with
 
03:40:58.710 --> 03:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
contact information for more detail but
 
03:41:00.830 --> 03:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
if you look to the actual RSA the
 
03:41:02.670 --> 03:41:02.680 align:start position:0%
statute it's very very specific in terms
 
03:41:05.469 --> 03:41:05.479 align:start position:0%
of the process uh the oath uh bringing
 
03:41:08.750 --> 03:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and uh very very clear that
 
03:41:10.750 --> 03:41:10.760 align:start position:0%
it's to prevent the types of things that
 
03:41:13.030 --> 03:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation reportedly would be
 
03:41:15.830 --> 03:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
trying to prevent
 
03:41:18.070 --> 03:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
03:41:22.229 --> 03:41:22.239 align:start position:0%
no thank you all set I think um I have
 
03:41:24.149 --> 03:41:24.159 align:start position:0%
uh one other pin card on this bill House
 
03:41:28.630 --> 03:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
Bill 315 um from uh commissioner
 
03:41:32.030 --> 03:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
Jasper welcome uh to leg I think you've
 
03:41:34.070 --> 03:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
been in this room once or twice before
 
03:41:36.590 --> 03:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
just a few but I I wanted to point out
 
03:41:38.550 --> 03:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
that I specifically said that I'm
 
03:41:41.950 --> 03:41:41.960 align:start position:0%
representing myself right um and I'm
 
03:41:44.830 --> 03:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm not wearing a badge and
 
03:41:47.110 --> 03:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
part of this is to point out the flaw in
 
03:41:50.229 --> 03:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
this bill which there are many hopefully
 
03:41:53.229 --> 03:41:53.239 align:start position:0%
you you've seen
 
03:41:55.510 --> 03:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
um and what I want to point out this
 
03:41:58.309 --> 03:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
talks in the first section in lines uh
 
03:42:01.469 --> 03:42:01.479 align:start position:0%
11 through 14 talks about false swearing
 
03:42:02.910 --> 03:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
and tampering with
 
03:42:05.269 --> 03:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
Witnesses and informance I certainly
 
03:42:07.750 --> 03:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
don't understand how that would
 
03:42:10.070 --> 03:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
apply um there's nothing in here that
 
03:42:13.469 --> 03:42:13.479 align:start position:0%
talks about anyone being sworn in but it
 
03:42:15.870 --> 03:42:15.880 align:start position:0%
would appear that
 
03:42:18.229 --> 03:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
um state employees would be held to that
 
03:42:20.990 --> 03:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
standard without actually having taken
 
03:42:24.349 --> 03:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
an oath uh I think that's problematic
 
03:42:26.389 --> 03:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
and there's also a lack of due process
 
03:42:30.710 --> 03:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
in both sections of this and that uh it
 
03:42:33.790 --> 03:42:33.800 align:start position:0%
just knowingly is a very high
 
03:42:36.670 --> 03:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
standard and but there is no due process
 
03:42:39.149 --> 03:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
in this as to who makes the
 
03:42:41.710 --> 03:42:41.720 align:start position:0%
determination what the judicial process
 
03:42:44.510 --> 03:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
is this would appear to just say well
 
03:42:46.670 --> 03:42:46.680 align:start position:0%
committee can just decide that can
 
03:42:49.389 --> 03:42:49.399 align:start position:0%
somebody has appeared and um knowingly
 
03:42:51.469 --> 03:42:51.479 align:start position:0%
done that well knowingly is a standard
 
03:42:54.309 --> 03:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
that um is extremely hard to meet I mean
 
03:42:56.750 --> 03:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
literally you would have to I believe
 
03:42:56.760 --> 03:42:57.870 align:start position:0%
literally you would have to I believe
have

03:42:57.870 --> 03:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
03:43:01.870 --> 03:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
a person on taper and a written document
 
03:43:05.030 --> 03:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
that contradicted the information that
 
03:43:08.070 --> 03:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
he or she provided to the committee um
 
03:43:10.070 --> 03:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
just believing that somebody knew that
 
03:43:12.149 --> 03:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
they were providing information is not a
 
03:43:15.790 --> 03:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
standard that you could hold anyone to
 
03:43:18.830 --> 03:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
um so I think that um really I just want
 
03:43:22.110 --> 03:43:22.120 align:start position:0%
to say that I hope you look at this very
 
03:43:25.030 --> 03:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
carefully and understand that this is
 
03:43:28.149 --> 03:43:28.159 align:start position:0%
not something that
 
03:43:31.630 --> 03:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
um should be done or probably could be
 
03:43:34.790 --> 03:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
done uh because of the the issue of
 
03:43:37.429 --> 03:43:37.439 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights and again I'm here
 
03:43:40.030 --> 03:43:40.040 align:start position:0%
as a private citizen now I will tell you
 
03:43:41.590 --> 03:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
that the governor knows that I'm here
 
03:43:44.469 --> 03:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
today but I'm still I also informed the
 
03:43:46.670 --> 03:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
governor that I is coming as a private
 
03:43:50.149 --> 03:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
citizen um so what would you do in a
 
03:43:52.189 --> 03:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
situation like that attempt to take away
 
03:43:54.429 --> 03:43:54.439 align:start position:0%
the rights of a private citizen to come
 
03:43:56.670 --> 03:43:56.680 align:start position:0%
and testify and the first part is really
 
03:43:59.110 --> 03:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
not about public hearings it's about
 
03:44:02.510 --> 03:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
investigations um the second is about um
 
03:44:08.110 --> 03:44:08.120 align:start position:0%
hearings and testimony and um again you
 
03:44:10.590 --> 03:44:10.600 align:start position:0%
know to take away the ability for
 
03:44:13.269 --> 03:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
someone to come in and oppose or support
 
03:44:15.950 --> 03:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
a bill I think
 
03:44:18.070 --> 03:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
what I almost forgot to tell you is when
 
03:44:20.550 --> 03:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
I first read this bill the first thing I
 
03:44:23.110 --> 03:44:23.120 align:start position:0%
thought of was the three monkeys See No
 
03:44:25.110 --> 03:44:25.120 align:start position:0%
Evil Hear no evil speak no
 
03:44:27.950 --> 03:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
evil that you know somebody clearly
 
03:44:30.830 --> 03:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to have all the information
 
03:44:33.149 --> 03:44:33.159 align:start position:0%
that would be out there and so I hope
 
03:44:34.630 --> 03:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
you find this bill in expedient to
 
03:44:37.189 --> 03:44:37.199 align:start position:0%
legislate I'm glad to take any questions
 
03:44:39.950 --> 03:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um are there any Comm any
 
03:44:44.149 --> 03:44:44.159 align:start position:0%
questions for uh private citizen um
 
03:44:44.159 --> 03:44:45.830 align:start position:0%
questions for uh private citizen um
Jasper

03:44:45.830 --> 03:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
Jasper
 
03:44:49.030 --> 03:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
I have one um if I can ask you to draw
 
03:44:53.910 --> 03:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
on your experiences as a speaker um if
 
03:44:57.510 --> 03:44:57.520 align:start position:0%
it were a chair that U that asked for a
 
03:45:00.950 --> 03:45:00.960 align:start position:0%
meeting with the speaker and and asked
 
03:45:04.790 --> 03:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
um that in the future the speaker would
 
03:45:08.229 --> 03:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
um communicate to the executive branch
 
03:45:12.229 --> 03:45:12.239 align:start position:0%
Andor the commissioner um that they
 
03:45:16.070 --> 03:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
would uh request a a different Lea on
 
03:45:20.189 --> 03:45:20.199 align:start position:0%
from a um an agency um would that be
 
03:45:21.950 --> 03:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
permissible I think it would be
 
03:45:24.830 --> 03:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
permissible and um I certainly would
 
03:45:28.429 --> 03:45:28.439 align:start position:0%
have no problem with with that and it
 
03:45:31.830 --> 03:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
also um makes me think of a couple of
 
03:45:34.510 --> 03:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
incidents on the the house house floor
 
03:45:37.469 --> 03:45:37.479 align:start position:0%
when I was presiding and I knew that
 
03:45:39.990 --> 03:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
members were saying things that were not
 
03:45:43.550 --> 03:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
true and demonstrably so I interrupted
 
03:45:45.910 --> 03:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
those members and pointed that out and
 
03:45:48.070 --> 03:45:48.080 align:start position:0%
did not let them to continue and I think
 
03:45:50.990 --> 03:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's within the purview of a committee
 
03:45:54.149 --> 03:45:54.159 align:start position:0%
to challenge someone who is providing
 
03:45:56.309 --> 03:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
testimony which you believe not to be
 
03:45:58.510 --> 03:45:58.520 align:start position:0%
true but I don't think that we can then
 
03:46:01.110 --> 03:46:01.120 align:start position:0%
take away that person's right to to ever
 
03:46:03.389 --> 03:46:03.399 align:start position:0%
testify or come forward but I I think
 
03:46:05.950 --> 03:46:05.960 align:start position:0%
that we absolutely have a duty to
 
03:46:08.349 --> 03:46:08.359 align:start position:0%
challenge things that we believe and
 
03:46:11.830 --> 03:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
could provide evidence of being
 
03:46:15.309 --> 03:46:15.319 align:start position:0%
false thank you for your testimony um
 
03:46:17.910 --> 03:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
any further questions seeing none thank
 
03:46:19.630 --> 03:46:19.640 align:start position:0%
you very much we'll see you in a few
 
03:46:24.550 --> 03:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
minutes I think um I would ask um
 
03:46:29.389 --> 03:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
um John Williams um if he would also uh
 
03:46:32.429 --> 03:46:32.439 align:start position:0%
chime in on that um that comment of of
 
03:46:35.870 --> 03:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
whether it would be all right um for or
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
what would happen um in the situation
 
03:46:43.349 --> 03:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
from a legal standpoint at at DHHS if uh
 
03:46:48.630 --> 03:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
if uh you received a a notice from the
 
03:46:51.070 --> 03:46:51.080 align:start position:0%
speaker or through the governor's office
 
03:46:53.510 --> 03:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
that uh such and such a committee has
 
03:46:56.429 --> 03:46:56.439 align:start position:0%
had requested to have a a different Lia
 
03:46:59.229 --> 03:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
on to a committee is that is that
 
03:47:01.269 --> 03:47:01.279 align:start position:0%
something that's ever done or Endor
 
03:47:04.189 --> 03:47:04.199 align:start position:0%
would that ever be accepted or taken in
 
03:47:06.670 --> 03:47:06.680 align:start position:0%
the spirit that it was intended so
 
03:47:08.670 --> 03:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
drawing on my memory from doing this
 
03:47:10.750 --> 03:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
closely going on Two and a Half decades
 
03:47:12.349 --> 03:47:12.359 align:start position:0%
now doing legislative work before this
 
03:47:15.870 --> 03:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
body I I've not received such a request
 
03:47:18.030 --> 03:47:18.040 align:start position:0%
um for not having a particular
 
03:47:19.790 --> 03:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
individual coming before committee but
 
03:47:22.510 --> 03:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
what I can um express to you is we're
 
03:47:24.189 --> 03:47:24.199 align:start position:0%
very thoughtful in terms of making sure
 
03:47:26.349 --> 03:47:26.359 align:start position:0%
we have the right staff um if staff
 
03:47:27.870 --> 03:47:27.880 align:start position:0%
comes before a committee that doesn't
 
03:47:29.229 --> 03:47:29.239 align:start position:0%
know the subject matter they shouldn't
 
03:47:31.550 --> 03:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
be before you and I've had concerns
 
03:47:33.389 --> 03:47:33.399 align:start position:0%
raised in the past and we then worked
 
03:47:34.710 --> 03:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
harder to make sure we got the right
 
03:47:36.429 --> 03:47:36.439 align:start position:0%
people in front of the committee but it
 
03:47:38.149 --> 03:47:38.159 align:start position:0%
wasn't such a formal request of saying
 
03:47:40.030 --> 03:47:40.040 align:start position:0%
we shall not want to see that person
 
03:47:42.750 --> 03:47:42.760 align:start position:0%
ever again before our our committee I I
 
03:47:44.349 --> 03:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
think there might be some Personnel
 
03:47:46.189 --> 03:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
rules that might be at play for us to
 
03:47:48.070 --> 03:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
telling somebody they can't come and do
 
03:47:50.710 --> 03:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
their job but I'm not prepared today to
 
03:47:52.870 --> 03:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
get into all the legalities regarding
 
03:47:54.670 --> 03:47:54.680 align:start position:0%
that and I'm looking for um our
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
wonderful person for the Department of
 
03:47:57.910 --> 03:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
Labor maybe he can chime in on on that
 
03:47:59.510 --> 03:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
as I'm going down a slippery slope of
 
03:48:01.269 --> 03:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
knowledge that I don't have a great deal
 
03:48:03.870 --> 03:48:03.880 align:start position:0%
subject matter knowledge of um but I do
 
03:48:05.830 --> 03:48:05.840 align:start position:0%
think that state agencies are very
 
03:48:07.950 --> 03:48:07.960 align:start position:0%
receptive they they hear you when you
 
03:48:10.070 --> 03:48:10.080 align:start position:0%
say wonderful things about us we we love
 
03:48:12.670 --> 03:48:12.680 align:start position:0%
that and when you say things that are of
 
03:48:14.870 --> 03:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
concern we you have our total attention
 
03:48:16.910 --> 03:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
we want to address those concerns very
 
03:48:19.269 --> 03:48:19.279 align:start position:0%
meaningfully uh and if it's a particular
 
03:48:21.590 --> 03:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
individual coming for a committee uh
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
that you feel has been less than either
 
03:48:26.510 --> 03:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
transparent or doesn't know their um
 
03:48:28.630 --> 03:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
subject matter we would work to address
 
03:48:31.149 --> 03:48:31.159 align:start position:0%
those issues thank you for your answer
 
03:48:33.750 --> 03:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
um it would also not preclude that
 
03:48:35.790 --> 03:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
person from coming and testifying as an
 
03:48:38.590 --> 03:48:38.600 align:start position:0%
individual as well right I would agree
 
03:48:40.229 --> 03:48:40.239 align:start position:0%
with that and also with commissioner
 
03:48:43.269 --> 03:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
Jasper's uh um thoughts as well on that
 
03:48:45.269 --> 03:48:45.279 align:start position:0%
subject thank you very much you're
 
03:48:49.070 --> 03:48:49.080 align:start position:0%
welcome um any further comments seeing
 
03:48:53.149 --> 03:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
none um we do have a pin card um from
 
03:48:55.229 --> 03:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor and since I have not
 
03:48:58.550 --> 03:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
closed the hearing um I will accept uh
 
03:49:00.870 --> 03:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor for coming in speaking
 
03:49:09.309 --> 03:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:11.630 --> 03:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
315 representative
 
03:49:15.349 --> 03:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
Penza yes
 
03:49:18.309 --> 03:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:21.630 --> 03:49:21.640 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you Mr chair um sorry I'm
 
03:49:24.910 --> 03:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
late there was two two huge big
 
03:49:26.790 --> 03:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
Lumbertown trucks in front of me and
 
03:49:30.950 --> 03:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
they were caused me to be late so um I
 
03:49:32.469 --> 03:49:32.479 align:start position:0%
know that somebody already introduced
 
03:49:34.750 --> 03:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
the bill um I think we're reading into
 
03:49:37.189 --> 03:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
the bill a lot more than um than we
 
03:49:39.149 --> 03:49:39.159 align:start position:0%
should I also there was an amendment I'm
 
03:49:41.670 --> 03:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
not sure if it was passed out or not um
 
03:49:43.469 --> 03:49:43.479 align:start position:0%
that just changes the bill so it
 
03:49:46.229 --> 03:49:46.239 align:start position:0%
actually says before any house committee
 
03:49:52.030 --> 03:49:52.040 align:start position:0%
not just the committee um So currently
 
03:49:55.510 --> 03:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
everyone that is coming in front of um
 
03:49:58.189 --> 03:49:58.199 align:start position:0%
to testify in front of the legislature
 
03:50:00.269 --> 03:50:00.279 align:start position:0%
it's a known fact that it they are
 
03:50:03.110 --> 03:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
coming in providing um truthful
 
03:50:05.309 --> 03:50:05.319 align:start position:0%
testimony so there doesn't I'm not
 
03:50:07.389 --> 03:50:07.399 align:start position:0%
talking about Oaths I'm not talking
 
03:50:10.750 --> 03:50:10.760 align:start position:0%
about any of those things um we're just
 
03:50:13.269 --> 03:50:13.279 align:start position:0%
saying basically that um that's already
 
03:50:15.189 --> 03:50:15.199 align:start position:0%
a known Factor
 
03:50:18.550 --> 03:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
um the other piece here is it only
 
03:50:20.590 --> 03:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
implies to government of course and and
 
03:50:22.510 --> 03:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
public employees members you know you
 
03:50:25.189 --> 03:50:25.199 align:start position:0%
know if they're appointed some to some
 
03:50:27.030 --> 03:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
executive state government you know
 
03:50:28.110 --> 03:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
Council or
 
03:50:28.120 --> 03:50:30.110 align:start position:0%
Council or
Association

03:50:30.110 --> 03:50:30.120 align:start position:0%
Association
 
03:50:33.990 --> 03:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
um the part of in a sense reporting
 
03:50:38.229 --> 03:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
false testimony is not to have a gotcha
 
03:50:42.950 --> 03:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's not to um um go after these people
 
03:50:45.790 --> 03:50:45.800 align:start position:0%
for a crime it's it's not any of those
 
03:50:48.870 --> 03:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
things um I think it keeps people honest
 
03:50:51.030 --> 03:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
and since we don't have Oaths that are
 
03:50:52.790 --> 03:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
going on or any of that kind of stuff
 
03:50:55.349 --> 03:50:55.359 align:start position:0%
which we see all the time in other
 
03:50:57.550 --> 03:50:57.560 align:start position:0%
legislatur across the country as well as
 
03:50:59.710 --> 03:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
in our federal government I think having
 
03:51:02.229 --> 03:51:02.239 align:start position:0%
this in place um gets it key that there
 
03:51:04.750 --> 03:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
is a pathway um I have been in the
 
03:51:06.990 --> 03:51:07.000 align:start position:0%
legislature this is my second term but
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
before that I came to hearings all the
 
03:51:13.070 --> 03:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
time and I would watch agencies give
 
03:51:15.469 --> 03:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
false testimony all the time and I could
 
03:51:18.309 --> 03:51:18.319 align:start position:0%
give multitudes of examples which I will
 
03:51:21.269 --> 03:51:21.279 align:start position:0%
email the committee um where I'm going
 
03:51:23.950 --> 03:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
to show you the video what they said and
 
03:51:27.149 --> 03:51:27.159 align:start position:0%
what is actually the truth um a few
 
03:51:30.429 --> 03:51:30.439 align:start position:0%
years back actually in our HHS committee
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
there was an attorney that was um so
 
03:51:35.710 --> 03:51:35.720 align:start position:0%
hired by
 
03:51:39.349 --> 03:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
DHHS um that was providing false
 
03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and was spoken to I don't know
 
03:51:43.990 --> 03:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
if it was reported to ethics I think it
 
03:51:46.790 --> 03:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
was um and then he just didn't come
 
03:51:49.429 --> 03:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
testify anymore this makes it a formal
 
03:51:53.469 --> 03:51:53.479 align:start position:0%
process so let's say for example um
 
03:51:54.950 --> 03:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's someone here and they're giving
 
03:51:57.429 --> 03:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of false testimony um on a you
 
03:51:59.870 --> 03:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
know whether it be legislature whatever
 
03:52:02.429 --> 03:52:02.439 align:start position:0%
it may be current rsas laws whatever
 
03:52:04.670 --> 03:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
that's in place and you as a committee
 
03:52:06.830 --> 03:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
come together when you're caucusing and
 
03:52:08.910 --> 03:52:08.920 align:start position:0%
you realize that that's you know not
 
03:52:10.830 --> 03:52:10.840 align:start position:0%
true you can actually just put in a
 
03:52:13.429 --> 03:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
formal complaint into ethics and they
 
03:52:15.229 --> 03:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
could look at it if they wanted to go
 
03:52:17.670 --> 03:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
further and do an investigation or call
 
03:52:19.990 --> 03:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
witnesses they have we have all of that
 
03:52:22.070 --> 03:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
Authority I just think that there should
 
03:52:24.590 --> 03:52:24.600 align:start position:0%
be a pathway and something that is set
 
03:52:29.149 --> 03:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
in stone um that says when you're coming
 
03:52:32.269 --> 03:52:32.279 align:start position:0%
here to testify you're it's it's a given
 
03:52:33.830 --> 03:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
that you're supposed to be telling the
 
03:52:36.030 --> 03:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
truth and if you're not telling the
 
03:52:37.990 --> 03:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
truth you could be held accountable and
 
03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
we already have all of those Pathways
 
03:52:42.750 --> 03:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
that can be done so even if this bill
 
03:52:47.469 --> 03:52:47.479 align:start position:0%
isn't passed we already have um so for
 
03:52:48.910 --> 03:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
example the committee could pull the
 
03:52:50.590 --> 03:52:50.600 align:start position:0%
information together chair would report
 
03:52:52.870 --> 03:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
to ethics ethics if they wanted to take
 
03:52:54.189 --> 03:52:54.199 align:start position:0%
action like if they want to do a
 
03:52:56.670 --> 03:52:56.680 align:start position:0%
criminal penalty they go for to the AG
 
03:52:58.590 --> 03:52:58.600 align:start position:0%
for a criminal charge they could induce
 
03:53:01.389 --> 03:53:01.399 align:start position:0%
a resolution to the house to recommend
 
03:53:03.389 --> 03:53:03.399 align:start position:0%
investigation those are all things that
 
03:53:06.990 --> 03:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
we have right now in our Tools in our
 
03:53:10.349 --> 03:53:10.359 align:start position:0%
toolbox um the Ethics Committee could
 
03:53:13.630 --> 03:53:13.640 align:start position:0%
even conduct uh their own investigation
 
03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
cross-examine in um get Witnesses they
 
03:53:19.590 --> 03:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
could issue a report um they could refer
 
03:53:22.229 --> 03:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
to the house for a vote for contempt the
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
house of course has constitutional
 
03:53:26.309 --> 03:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
punishment power um that can vote to
 
03:53:28.349 --> 03:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
prohibit that person from testifying
 
03:53:32.309 --> 03:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
before the house um I think it's really
 
03:53:35.269 --> 03:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
interesting to say to be clear here that
 
03:53:36.950 --> 03:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of this has to do with separation
 
03:53:39.590 --> 03:53:39.600 align:start position:0%
of powers um a lot of this has to do
 
03:53:43.110 --> 03:53:43.120 align:start position:0%
with um you know when an executive
 
03:53:45.110 --> 03:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
branch is employing they you know if
 
03:53:47.149 --> 03:53:47.159 align:start position:0%
they're testifying they're not
 
03:53:48.990 --> 03:53:49.000 align:start position:0%
testifying usually as a natural person
 
03:53:50.950 --> 03:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
with their rights they're testifying in
 
03:53:53.070 --> 03:53:53.080 align:start position:0%
their quote unquote official capacity
 
03:53:55.429 --> 03:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
and so they only have privileges the
 
03:53:57.710 --> 03:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
Privileges here are are all always
 
03:54:00.469 --> 03:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
designated to the people now of course
 
03:54:03.110 --> 03:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
if someone comes in and um they've taken
 
03:54:05.550 --> 03:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
the vacation day from their from their
 
03:54:08.229 --> 03:54:08.239 align:start position:0%
job whether they work for an agency or
 
03:54:10.070 --> 03:54:10.080 align:start position:0%
let's say they're you know a New
 
03:54:11.469 --> 03:54:11.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state trooper or whatever it
 
03:54:13.830 --> 03:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
may be that's all fine and dandy so then
 
03:54:15.910 --> 03:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're all on the same level playing
 
03:54:20.590 --> 03:54:20.600 align:start position:0%
field but when you're in a sense um and
 
03:54:22.870 --> 03:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
I wanted to say it's clear and statute
 
03:54:24.110 --> 03:54:24.120 align:start position:0%
it I think it was
 
03:54:27.550 --> 03:54:27.560 align:start position:0%
421 times that I saw um I'm I won't
 
03:54:29.910 --> 03:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
burden the committee with that um it's
 
03:54:33.309 --> 03:54:33.319 align:start position:0%
clear in Statute in law and in even our
 
03:54:35.910 --> 03:54:35.920 align:start position:0%
constitution um any person so for
 
03:54:37.710 --> 03:54:37.720 align:start position:0%
example 141
 
03:54:41.149 --> 03:54:41.159 align:start position:0%
c21 um they all it automatically has a
 
03:54:43.630 --> 03:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
different layer for the people versus
 
03:54:45.670 --> 03:54:45.680 align:start position:0%
the government any person who shall
 
03:54:47.990 --> 03:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
violate disobey refuse omit or neglect
 
03:54:49.710 --> 03:54:49.720 align:start position:0%
to comply with any of the provisions of
 
03:54:52.790 --> 03:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
RSA 141c or the rules adopted pursuant
 
03:54:55.830 --> 03:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
to it shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
 
03:54:59.189 --> 03:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
if a natural person or guilty of a
 
03:55:02.830 --> 03:55:02.840 align:start position:0%
felony if any other person that would be
 
03:55:05.910 --> 03:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
government so government does not have
 
03:55:08.590 --> 03:55:08.600 align:start position:0%
rights it has granted duties authorities
 
03:55:11.670 --> 03:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
and privileges this is covered very
 
03:55:14.910 --> 03:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
clearly in Worster V Plymouth it was
 
03:55:16.670 --> 03:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
universally understood by the founders
 
03:55:19.189 --> 03:55:19.199 align:start position:0%
of our institutions that jury trial and
 
03:55:21.269 --> 03:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
other usual provisions of Bill of Rights
 
03:55:23.389 --> 03:55:23.399 align:start position:0%
were not grants of rights to the public
 
03:55:26.149 --> 03:55:26.159 align:start position:0%
body politic but reservations of private
 
03:55:28.990 --> 03:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
rights of the subject Paramount to all
 
03:55:31.510 --> 03:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
governmental Authority and this
 
03:55:34.830 --> 03:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
constitutional principle has never been
 
03:55:38.189 --> 03:55:38.199 align:start position:0%
abandoned so that's kind of where I'm at
 
03:55:40.710 --> 03:55:40.720 align:start position:0%
if you know the committee would be open
 
03:55:43.229 --> 03:55:43.239 align:start position:0%
to you know if they feel as if it's you
 
03:55:45.269 --> 03:55:45.279 align:start position:0%
know too harsh to list literally the
 
03:55:47.229 --> 03:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
criminal penalties in there we could
 
03:55:49.429 --> 03:55:49.439 align:start position:0%
discuss that I just think it should be
 
03:55:52.590 --> 03:55:52.600 align:start position:0%
stated that um having this in law in
 
03:55:55.110 --> 03:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
statute is
 
03:55:58.070 --> 03:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
important thank you for your testimony
 
03:55:58.080 --> 03:56:00.389 align:start position:0%
important thank you for your testimony
um

03:56:00.389 --> 03:56:00.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:02.830 --> 03:56:02.840 align:start position:0%
questions representative Barton yes
 
03:56:06.070 --> 03:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I have just one
 
03:56:09.429 --> 03:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
simple question um you you spoke about
 
03:56:12.590 --> 03:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh a witness that you know gave false
 
03:56:15.590 --> 03:56:15.600 align:start position:0%
testimony what was the bir you used uh
 
03:56:19.030 --> 03:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
to determine that that witness did so
 
03:56:21.670 --> 03:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
knowingly if you're talking about the
 
03:56:23.269 --> 03:56:23.279 align:start position:0%
incident that I wasn't part of that
 
03:56:25.630 --> 03:56:25.640 align:start position:0%
committee with the lawyer that has
 
03:56:27.469 --> 03:56:27.479 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with me uh the burden of
 
03:56:29.830 --> 03:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
proof if if we're talking about
 
03:56:31.550 --> 03:56:31.560 align:start position:0%
something else where I was at a bill and
 
03:56:34.750 --> 03:56:34.760 align:start position:0%
I was testifying this had to do with a
 
03:56:38.950 --> 03:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
department stating that stating fact
 
03:56:42.950 --> 03:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
that they do not promote um they didn't
 
03:56:46.790 --> 03:56:46.800 align:start position:0%
didn't promote a certain um uh biologic
 
03:56:50.750 --> 03:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
injection for children at all and then
 
03:56:52.349 --> 03:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
um said that it was nowhere on their
 
03:56:55.950 --> 03:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
website we went and saw the posting
 
03:56:58.030 --> 03:56:58.040 align:start position:0%
right on their website like a flyer
 
03:57:01.149 --> 03:57:01.159 align:start position:0%
promoting it and then within two days of
 
03:57:03.910 --> 03:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
that hearing then magically that flyer
 
03:57:07.550 --> 03:57:07.560 align:start position:0%
was disappeared online so we were in the
 
03:57:10.149 --> 03:57:10.159 align:start position:0%
hearing they were told it is you're
 
03:57:12.309 --> 03:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
saying here you don't do it and then
 
03:57:14.550 --> 03:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
you're telling parents to do it it's
 
03:57:17.429 --> 03:57:17.439 align:start position:0%
clear as day right on your website um on
 
03:57:18.590 --> 03:57:18.600 align:start position:0%
the department's website on the
 
03:57:20.990 --> 03:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
government website and then of course it
 
03:57:23.269 --> 03:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
magically disappears that's a great
 
03:57:26.189 --> 03:57:26.199 align:start position:0%
example I could give follow
 
03:57:29.950 --> 03:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
up um how did you know that the
 
03:57:34.110 --> 03:57:34.120 align:start position:0%
witness had that knowledge in their
 
03:57:36.710 --> 03:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
head because they doubled down after
 
03:57:38.550 --> 03:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
they were told that it was specifically
 
03:57:41.309 --> 03:57:41.319 align:start position:0%
right there on the website they
 
03:57:45.149 --> 03:57:45.159 align:start position:0%
literally said no it is not
 
03:57:47.429 --> 03:57:47.439 align:start position:0%
so I mean that we're talking about like
 
03:57:49.710 --> 03:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
a third in command at the
 
03:57:49.720 --> 03:57:51.429 align:start position:0%
a third in command at the
department

03:57:51.429 --> 03:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:57:55.429 --> 03:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
so okay um representative Wade thank you
 
03:57:59.550 --> 03:57:59.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um so to clarify you you'd
 
03:58:02.030 --> 03:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned a process going through the
 
03:58:04.790 --> 03:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee so in the scenario
 
03:58:07.790 --> 03:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
where this uh law is
 
03:58:10.070 --> 03:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
implemented would the Ethics Committee
 
03:58:13.790 --> 03:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
be the ones who make that determination
 
03:58:16.349 --> 03:58:16.359 align:start position:0%
that the person
 
03:58:16.359 --> 03:58:17.990 align:start position:0%
that the person
knowingly

03:58:17.990 --> 03:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
knowingly
 
03:58:22.990 --> 03:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
um uh made false testimony and how how
 
03:58:25.269 --> 03:58:25.279 align:start position:0%
would they clear that
 
03:58:27.870 --> 03:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
bar I really think that this would be
 
03:58:29.710 --> 03:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
something that is probably not going to
 
03:58:32.830 --> 03:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
happen very often I think once something
 
03:58:35.790 --> 03:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
like this is in place I think it gives a
 
03:58:39.630 --> 03:58:39.640 align:start position:0%
a pathway of accountability
 
03:58:42.349 --> 03:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
um you know when people have been in the
 
03:58:45.309 --> 03:58:45.319 align:start position:0%
house for a long time they know who
 
03:58:48.309 --> 03:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
comes to their committees and um and who
 
03:58:51.349 --> 03:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't that says that are like known
 
03:58:53.429 --> 03:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
fibers like that's just kind of a thing
 
03:58:55.950 --> 03:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
in the house um you know I'm not saying
 
03:58:58.269 --> 03:58:58.279 align:start position:0%
anything that uh CES and Reps don't know
 
03:59:02.070 --> 03:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
about and so um I think that that will
 
03:59:04.710 --> 03:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
end maybe that some of that behavior I
 
03:59:07.389 --> 03:59:07.399 align:start position:0%
don't believe that um yes they would I
 
03:59:08.950 --> 03:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
think the Ethics Committee would make
 
03:59:11.149 --> 03:59:11.159 align:start position:0%
that based upon the evidence that was
 
03:59:13.070 --> 03:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
provided from the committee from the
 
03:59:14.990 --> 03:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
chair of the committee specifically if
 
03:59:16.389 --> 03:59:16.399 align:start position:0%
there was a caucus and that would there
 
03:59:19.229 --> 03:59:19.239 align:start position:0%
was a problem um and to be honest I
 
03:59:20.910 --> 03:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
think that it would just prove probably
 
03:59:23.990 --> 03:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
a a discussion a notice a warning from
 
03:59:26.269 --> 03:59:26.279 align:start position:0%
ethics to say hey that seems like that
 
03:59:27.910 --> 03:59:27.920 align:start position:0%
was out of line whether we can prove
 
03:59:30.469 --> 03:59:30.479 align:start position:0%
that you knowingly did or not but you
 
03:59:32.710 --> 03:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
know can you be careful in the future I
 
03:59:35.269 --> 03:59:35.279 align:start position:0%
think holding everyone accountable to
 
03:59:37.149 --> 03:59:37.159 align:start position:0%
include everyone that's sitting in this
 
03:59:40.110 --> 03:59:40.120 align:start position:0%
room all the legislators um and all
 
03:59:41.990 --> 03:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
government employees is important and I
 
03:59:46.349 --> 03:59:46.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:48.630 --> 03:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
further questions oh representative
 
03:59:51.790 --> 03:59:51.800 align:start position:0%
Turka welcome representative pend I have
 
03:59:54.349 --> 03:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
uh one question for you um on both of
 
03:59:58.389 --> 03:59:58.399 align:start position:0%
the um New paragraphs it talks about the
 
04:00:00.189 --> 04:00:00.199 align:start position:0%
individual being prohibited from
 
04:00:02.429 --> 04:00:02.439 align:start position:0%
testifying before the committee what is
 
04:00:04.710 --> 04:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
the timeline on that that would just be
 
04:00:07.189 --> 04:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
within the term because you can't bind
 
04:00:10.389 --> 04:00:10.399 align:start position:0%
any future um you can't b a future
 
04:00:13.189 --> 04:00:13.199 align:start position:0%
legislative uh do you know what I'm
 
04:00:13.199 --> 04:00:17.550 align:start position:0%
legislative uh do you know what I'm
saying

04:00:17.550 --> 04:00:17.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:20.590 --> 04:00:20.600 align:start position:0%
the yes but the
 
04:00:23.269 --> 04:00:23.279 align:start position:0%
these these paragraphs apply to an
 
04:00:26.750 --> 04:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
employee of a state agency so why would
 
04:00:29.750 --> 04:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
the a term determine how long the
 
04:00:29.760 --> 04:00:33.349 align:start position:0%
the a term determine how long the
individual

04:00:33.349 --> 04:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:35.790 --> 04:00:35.800 align:start position:0%
can't I I see what you're saying I just
 
04:00:39.469 --> 04:00:39.479 align:start position:0%
think that this it would be um I yeah
 
04:00:41.790 --> 04:00:41.800 align:start position:0%
you're right because they're not it's
 
04:00:44.149 --> 04:00:44.159 align:start position:0%
not like they are an elected rep
 
04:00:47.469 --> 04:00:47.479 align:start position:0%
representative I just um I just didn't
 
04:00:48.790 --> 04:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
want to have something where I thought
 
04:00:52.269 --> 04:00:52.279 align:start position:0%
it was a maybe a conflict in putting
 
04:00:54.510 --> 04:00:54.520 align:start position:0%
something in that was going to um you
 
04:00:56.830 --> 04:00:56.840 align:start position:0%
know even bind the next leg you know the
 
04:00:59.469 --> 04:00:59.479 align:start position:0%
next legislature um so I think that
 
04:01:01.670 --> 04:01:01.680 align:start position:0%
that's enough I mean if you think about
 
04:01:03.790 --> 04:01:03.800 align:start position:0%
it let's say if it's the beginning of
 
04:01:05.590 --> 04:01:05.600 align:start position:0%
the term and this happens and they're
 
04:01:10.510 --> 04:01:10.520 align:start position:0%
not able to um to testify in a committee
 
04:01:14.510 --> 04:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
for a year or a year and a half um then
 
04:01:18.070 --> 04:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
that's you know um I think that's enough
 
04:01:20.510 --> 04:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
of a punishment in a sense that maybe
 
04:01:21.710 --> 04:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
they come back and they've learned their
 
04:01:24.269 --> 04:01:24.279 align:start position:0%
lesson for you know the next term so I
 
04:01:26.469 --> 04:01:26.479 align:start position:0%
don't have really any problem with that
 
04:01:29.750 --> 04:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
piece um I also like if it's someone
 
04:01:32.630 --> 04:01:32.640 align:start position:0%
that's a repeat offender then that's
 
04:01:35.830 --> 04:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
where you know maybe maybe penalties
 
04:01:38.149 --> 04:01:38.159 align:start position:0%
like real penalties come in I I can't
 
04:01:40.189 --> 04:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
see that happening at this point I think
 
04:01:43.189 --> 04:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
that this bill will correct a problem
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
that we've had for quite some time
 
04:01:53.469 --> 04:01:53.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:57.870 --> 04:01:57.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:00.510 --> 04:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
one is it your intention with this
 
04:02:03.910 --> 04:02:03.920 align:start position:0%
legislation to prohibit that person uh
 
04:02:06.910 --> 04:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
unilaterally from testifying or or
 
04:02:09.870 --> 04:02:09.880 align:start position:0%
testifying from the agency could could
 
04:02:12.550 --> 04:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
that person still come and testify sign
 
04:02:15.670 --> 04:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
up with a pink card and testify as
 
04:02:19.389 --> 04:02:19.399 align:start position:0%
themselves of course they could yes okay
 
04:02:21.870 --> 04:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you very much for your up I
 
04:02:24.590 --> 04:02:24.600 align:start position:0%
have one followup all right sorry thank
 
04:02:29.469 --> 04:02:29.479 align:start position:0%
you wores um so uh last question so um
 
04:02:32.070 --> 04:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
assuming with the amendment you said any
 
04:02:34.469 --> 04:02:34.479 align:start position:0%
house committee so would that then mean
 
04:02:38.349 --> 04:02:38.359 align:start position:0%
if they were found liable for providing
 
04:02:40.189 --> 04:02:40.199 align:start position:0%
false testimony under one committee they
 
04:02:43.550 --> 04:02:43.560 align:start position:0%
would be barred from testifying in their
 
04:02:47.229 --> 04:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
Capac in their state capacity from any
 
04:02:50.469 --> 04:02:50.479 align:start position:0%
committee corre at all okay correct
 
04:02:53.110 --> 04:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
really good question and uh sorry last
 
04:02:55.710 --> 04:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
follow up so and I think you said any
 
04:02:55.720 --> 04:02:56.590 align:start position:0%
follow up so and I think you said any
house

04:02:56.590 --> 04:02:56.600 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:02:59.309 --> 04:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
committee yes correct so would not apply
 
04:03:03.590 --> 04:03:03.600 align:start position:0%
to the Senate um actually this is it
 
04:03:05.550 --> 04:03:05.560 align:start position:0%
applies to the general court so the
 
04:03:07.189 --> 04:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
general court is the Senate so we would
 
04:03:11.030 --> 04:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
apply to them as well okay thank
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%

close the hearing on House Bill 315 and
 
04:03:32.510 --> 04:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
while we reset the label on the
 
04:03:35.469 --> 04:03:35.479 align:start position:0%
testimony table um and then we will be
 
04:03:42.710 --> 04:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:42.720 --> 04:04:12.710 align:start position:0%
 
456

04:04:12.710 --> 04:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:05.389 --> 04:05:05.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
the time pass the state of time of 145 I
 
04:05:13.110 --> 04:05:13.120 align:start position:0%

04:05:15.429 --> 04:05:15.439 align:start position:0%
and call the prime sponsor
 
04:05:15.439 --> 04:05:17.710 align:start position:0%
and call the prime sponsor
representative

04:05:17.710 --> 04:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:05:20.750 --> 04:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
Penza who's asked for three
 
04:05:22.790 --> 04:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
minutes welcome
 
04:05:26.510 --> 04:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
back I never really left thank you um
 
04:05:29.790 --> 04:05:29.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um this is a real
 
04:05:33.910 --> 04:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
simple Bill uh it's adding basically uh
 
04:05:39.630 --> 04:05:39.640 align:start position:0%
two lines to current statute um 17 de
 
04:05:43.950 --> 04:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
and 98 F1 um
 
04:05:48.910 --> 04:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:52.429 --> 04:05:52.439 align:start position:0%
um because here we have um a state
 
04:05:54.670 --> 04:05:54.680 align:start position:0%
agency they shall only provide
 
04:05:56.110 --> 04:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
information to the committee at the
 
04:05:58.030 --> 04:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
committee's request and shall not take a
 
04:06:01.030 --> 04:06:01.040 align:start position:0%
position in support of or in opposition
 
04:06:05.349 --> 04:06:05.359 align:start position:0%
to a matter before the legislature um
 
04:06:08.990 --> 04:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
and the reason and then there's um this
 
04:06:14.269 --> 04:06:14.279 align:start position:0%
just modifies in section line 14 98 F1
 
04:06:16.070 --> 04:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
um it just basically it's another piece
 
04:06:18.790 --> 04:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
of legislation that just talks about
 
04:06:20.429 --> 04:06:20.439 align:start position:0%
state employees wearing Badges and we
 
04:06:22.590 --> 04:06:22.600 align:start position:0%
just added that in there too OLS did to
 
04:06:25.590 --> 04:06:25.600 align:start position:0%
make sure it was covered in both places
 
04:06:28.309 --> 04:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
um the reason why this is so important
 
04:06:32.309 --> 04:06:32.319 align:start position:0%
is because um there
 
04:06:35.790 --> 04:06:35.800 align:start position:0%
is we have a we have a problem with um
 
04:06:38.510 --> 04:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
testimony coming in all of the time to
 
04:06:44.110 --> 04:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:46.309 --> 04:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
they're giving factual information and
 
04:06:50.110 --> 04:06:50.120 align:start position:0%
then um and then they're saying oh well
 
04:06:51.750 --> 04:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
you know you shouldn't pass this bill
 
04:06:54.670 --> 04:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
because and there's a lot of I guess the
 
04:06:57.630 --> 04:06:57.640 align:start position:0%
word is wha ifs there's tons of wha ifs
 
04:07:00.189 --> 04:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
when um the separation of powers is so
 
04:07:02.429 --> 04:07:02.439 align:start position:0%
important and uh we've kind of lost our
 
04:07:06.389 --> 04:07:06.399 align:start position:0%
way with that um so coming in as a as an
 
04:07:10.389 --> 04:07:10.399 align:start position:0%
agency presenting factual information um
 
04:07:13.110 --> 04:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
is important um when there's a lot of
 
04:07:13.120 --> 04:07:14.269 align:start position:0%
is important um when there's a lot of
whatif

04:07:14.269 --> 04:07:14.279 align:start position:0%
whatif
 
04:07:15.990 --> 04:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh so for example in my committee it
 
04:07:19.269 --> 04:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
happens all of the time um there's just
 
04:07:21.590 --> 04:07:21.600 align:start position:0%
an undue influence that we know that's
 
04:07:24.229 --> 04:07:24.239 align:start position:0%
taking place um public comment for
 
04:07:26.990 --> 04:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
example on rules that took place uh that
 
04:07:29.510 --> 04:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
got passed were it was unbelievable to
 
04:07:32.349 --> 04:07:32.359 align:start position:0%
watch there was not one private person
 
04:07:35.469 --> 04:07:35.479 align:start position:0%
not one expert that came in that was for
 
04:07:38.990 --> 04:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
the rules and then um now every bill
 
04:07:41.349 --> 04:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
that we had to fix some of those rules
 
04:07:44.309 --> 04:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
through all that testimony was Den dened
 
04:07:46.189 --> 04:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
from the agency when all of the
 
04:07:48.790 --> 04:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
testimony that we have um based upon the
 
04:07:51.469 --> 04:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
public from the private people was all
 
04:07:53.710 --> 04:07:53.720 align:start position:0%
in support of everything that we've done
 
04:07:55.510 --> 04:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
um because there's you know private
 
04:07:57.710 --> 04:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
meetings that take place with industry
 
04:08:01.710 --> 04:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
and and stakeholders and um or even the
 
04:08:04.189 --> 04:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
executive branch and those things have
 
04:08:05.910 --> 04:08:05.920 align:start position:0%
to stop they really have to be very
 
04:08:08.750 --> 04:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
separate so facts are important in
 
04:08:11.389 --> 04:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
presenting it um someone can basically
 
04:08:14.830 --> 04:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
rip apart a bill by not saying that they
 
04:08:17.429 --> 04:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
are for or against uh by give just
 
04:08:19.309 --> 04:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
giving the facts that are stated and
 
04:08:21.229 --> 04:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
that's what's so important and I think
 
04:08:23.149 --> 04:08:23.159 align:start position:0%
what's really if you look at the rules
 
04:08:26.349 --> 04:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
of the house this is what we have passed
 
04:08:30.550 --> 04:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
um rule 63 is clear influencing
 
04:08:34.389 --> 04:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
legislation proh Pro prohibition of no
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
employee or adese of the house sergeant
 
04:08:41.590 --> 04:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
of arms shall directly or indirectly be
 
04:08:44.149 --> 04:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
personally involved with or or attempt
 
04:08:46.269 --> 04:08:46.279 align:start position:0%
to influence the passage or
 
04:08:49.630 --> 04:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
consideration of any measure whatsoever
 
04:08:53.750 --> 04:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
if any such employee or attache becomes
 
04:08:55.990 --> 04:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
involved with any such measure it shall
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
be grounds for summary
 
04:09:01.790 --> 04:09:01.800 align:start position:0%
dismissal so we have those rules for us
 
04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
but we're not giving those same rules to
 
04:09:06.790 --> 04:09:06.800 align:start position:0%
other branches like the executive branch
 
04:09:10.870 --> 04:09:10.880 align:start position:0%
for example um so the executive branch
 
04:09:13.950 --> 04:09:13.960 align:start position:0%
is not given this type of authority um
 
04:09:16.349 --> 04:09:16.359 align:start position:0%
the governor is given executive power to
 
04:09:18.429 --> 04:09:18.439 align:start position:0%
Faithfully make sure that the laws are
 
04:09:20.830 --> 04:09:20.840 align:start position:0%
followed and there's just our
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
constitution is so clear um with our our
 
04:09:25.950 --> 04:09:25.960 align:start position:0%
legislature you know part one article
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
two um it's just it talks about you know
 
04:09:31.070 --> 04:09:31.080 align:start position:0%
the supreme legislative power within the
 
04:09:32.550 --> 04:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
state shall be vested in the Senate and
 
04:09:34.510 --> 04:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
the House of Representatives each will
 
04:09:37.030 --> 04:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
have you know a negative on uh on the
 
04:09:39.389 --> 04:09:39.399 align:start position:0%
other which really shows that checks and
 
04:09:43.870 --> 04:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
balances um Article 5 is very clear so I
 
04:09:46.469 --> 04:09:46.479 align:start position:0%
just really um that I've talked to other
 
04:09:48.750 --> 04:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
fellow reps that are now in their second
 
04:09:51.670 --> 04:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
term and third term um that are very
 
04:09:54.149 --> 04:09:54.159 align:start position:0%
supportive of this as well um there
 
04:09:57.630 --> 04:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be anyone that um it just
 
04:10:00.389 --> 04:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
basically keeps keeps things clean keeps
 
04:10:04.790 --> 04:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
checks and balances and um makes you
 
04:10:06.830 --> 04:10:06.840 align:start position:0%
know government employees um when
 
04:10:08.950 --> 04:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
they're coming in in those capacities
 
04:10:11.990 --> 04:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
basically talk on merits and use facts
 
04:10:19.269 --> 04:10:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:24.910 --> 04:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
done that questions sure sure um see
 
04:10:27.550 --> 04:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
representative wait thank you Mr chair
 
04:10:29.510 --> 04:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
um so have other questions specifically
 
04:10:33.550 --> 04:10:33.560 align:start position:0%
on line 11 uh of the bill um which
 
04:10:35.630 --> 04:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
states that a state agency shall only
 
04:10:38.070 --> 04:10:38.080 align:start position:0%
provide information to the committee at
 
04:10:40.389 --> 04:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
the committee's request so in the
 
04:10:41.990 --> 04:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
context of something like a public
 
04:10:45.710 --> 04:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
hearing with that then mean that the
 
04:10:47.830 --> 04:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
committee would have to request a state
 
04:10:51.870 --> 04:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
agency to come ahead of time um so what
 
04:10:53.469 --> 04:10:53.479 align:start position:0%
what what does at the committee's
 
04:10:56.030 --> 04:10:56.040 align:start position:0%
request mean in the context of of
 
04:10:57.990 --> 04:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
providing that
 
04:11:00.469 --> 04:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
information so when we have a hearing
 
04:11:02.710 --> 04:11:02.720 align:start position:0%
that's we're already requesting it from
 
04:11:05.670 --> 04:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
that so ol this is their language and
 
04:11:07.269 --> 04:11:07.279 align:start position:0%
they said that this was that's how it
 
04:11:09.269 --> 04:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
should be written here specifically when
 
04:11:11.790 --> 04:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
they added that line um that's their
 
04:11:14.189 --> 04:11:14.199 align:start position:0%
legal language so
 
04:11:17.109 --> 04:11:17.119 align:start position:0%
um we right now we put an a we have a
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
public hearing we have it open that's
 
04:11:21.469 --> 04:11:21.479 align:start position:0%
basically we're requesting information
 
04:11:23.910 --> 04:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
for people to come in so if that is of
 
04:11:25.910 --> 04:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
course a private person or someone that
 
04:11:28.950 --> 04:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
is an agency that's that's how it works
 
04:11:30.389 --> 04:11:30.399 align:start position:0%
and so that's why I was told that
 
04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
because I picked up on that as well but
 
04:11:34.910 --> 04:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's the language that they'
 
04:11:39.109 --> 04:11:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:40.610 --> 04:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
used yes
 
04:11:40.620 --> 04:11:41.910 align:start position:0%
used yes
[Music]

04:11:41.910 --> 04:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:11:45.510 --> 04:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
so to to understand so the the standard
 
04:11:47.990 --> 04:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
of a public hearing counts as the
 
04:11:51.309 --> 04:11:51.319 align:start position:0%
committee's request so to my
 
04:11:54.269 --> 04:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
understanding um state employees or
 
04:11:54.279 --> 04:11:55.269 align:start position:0%
understanding um state employees or
state

04:11:55.269 --> 04:11:55.279 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:11:58.870 --> 04:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
agencies wouldn't need to have um
 
04:12:00.670 --> 04:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
addition a specific request from the
 
04:12:03.189 --> 04:12:03.199 align:start position:0%
committee for bills to come in and
 
04:12:05.469 --> 04:12:05.479 align:start position:0%
testify for they would still be able to
 
04:12:07.229 --> 04:12:07.239 align:start position:0%
come in on their own
 
04:12:09.269 --> 04:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
accord of course that's the standard
 
04:12:11.030 --> 04:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
that it is now that doesn't change at
 
04:12:14.309 --> 04:12:14.319 align:start position:0%
all um as you know and representative
 
04:12:16.510 --> 04:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
Hill you've been doing this for a while
 
04:12:19.149 --> 04:12:19.159 align:start position:0%
um that does happen of course chairs uh
 
04:12:21.550 --> 04:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
you know request people to come in um
 
04:12:23.790 --> 04:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
request agencies to come in request
 
04:12:25.349 --> 04:12:25.359 align:start position:0%
other people to come back up and speak
 
04:12:26.870 --> 04:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
on something to maybe ask another
 
04:12:30.070 --> 04:12:30.080 align:start position:0%
question that's all um standard but it's
 
04:12:31.830 --> 04:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
not changing any sort of process
 
04:12:38.429 --> 04:12:38.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:41.309 --> 04:12:41.319 align:start position:0%
placees representative Barton thank you
 
04:12:43.910 --> 04:12:43.920 align:start position:0%
um I would follow on uh representative
 
04:12:46.469 --> 04:12:46.479 align:start position:0%
Wade's um questions and concerns about
 
04:12:49.830 --> 04:12:49.840 align:start position:0%
line 11 this the the language here says
 
04:12:53.950 --> 04:12:53.960 align:start position:0%
a state agency shall shall only provide
 
04:12:57.109 --> 04:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
um limiting the the state agency if I'm
 
04:12:59.750 --> 04:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
reading the language like that uh my my
 
04:13:02.630 --> 04:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
question is um
 
04:13:06.030 --> 04:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
and I'll I'll say that the house can
 
04:13:08.590 --> 04:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
pass resolutions and those res
 
04:13:10.269 --> 04:13:10.279 align:start position:0%
resolutions can be delivered to the
 
04:13:11.870 --> 04:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
federal government and so I think it's
 
04:13:14.229 --> 04:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
Federalist 45
 
04:13:17.149 --> 04:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
um essentially makes the state a
 
04:13:20.510 --> 04:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
constituent of of the federal government
 
04:13:22.510 --> 04:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
uh so my question would be would would a
 
04:13:24.590 --> 04:13:24.600 align:start position:0%
state agency or a representative of a
 
04:13:28.269 --> 04:13:28.279 align:start position:0%
state agency constitute a um constituent
 
04:13:31.510 --> 04:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
of the state and would they would they
 
04:13:35.149 --> 04:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
be limited um in providing information
 
04:13:38.269 --> 04:13:38.279 align:start position:0%
based on the language of um of 10 and 11
 
04:13:41.309 --> 04:13:41.319 align:start position:0%
in this proposed
 
04:13:44.590 --> 04:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
legislation I don't believe so
 
04:13:47.630 --> 04:13:47.640 align:start position:0%
um I can look into that further talk
 
04:13:50.630 --> 04:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
with one of the attorneys to see but um
 
04:13:53.950 --> 04:13:53.960 align:start position:0%
you know if that created an issue then
 
04:13:56.429 --> 04:13:56.439 align:start position:0%
you know we could we could fix that
 
04:14:00.910 --> 04:14:00.920 align:start position:0%
language um like I said I was I made it
 
04:14:03.950 --> 04:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
Crystal Clear of what the bill was um
 
04:14:07.189 --> 04:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
which was can't take a position provide
 
04:14:10.950 --> 04:14:10.960 align:start position:0%
factual information um and that's it
 
04:14:13.550 --> 04:14:13.560 align:start position:0%
they wrote that like that specifically
 
04:14:16.630 --> 04:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of known hearing they
 
04:14:19.710 --> 04:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
come in of course we already know that
 
04:14:21.830 --> 04:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
Representatives chairs Vice chairs
 
04:14:23.710 --> 04:14:23.720 align:start position:0%
request you know expert testimony that
 
04:14:25.189 --> 04:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
are coming in from government agencies
 
04:14:27.750 --> 04:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
all the time so if that seems to be an
 
04:14:30.070 --> 04:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
issue we can fix that that's not a
 
04:14:34.030 --> 04:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
problem um if we feel that it
 
04:14:38.510 --> 04:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
is um if if the uh if the agency is
 
04:14:39.870 --> 04:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
considered a
 
04:14:42.229 --> 04:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
constituent um wouldn't they have the
 
04:14:45.790 --> 04:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
rights to to uh take a
 
04:14:48.429 --> 04:14:48.439 align:start position:0%
position they have to come in they would
 
04:14:53.910 --> 04:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
have to not be on their work hours so um
 
04:14:58.550 --> 04:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
coming in in their private capacity
 
04:15:00.870 --> 04:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
yes they can take whatever position they
 
04:15:04.109 --> 04:15:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:06.389 --> 04:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
capacity thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
04:15:09.030 --> 04:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
for your testimony represent potential
 
04:15:11.590 --> 04:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
what happens if a bill comes in and I
 
04:15:13.550 --> 04:15:13.560 align:start position:0%
don't have an example of the top of my
 
04:15:17.149 --> 04:15:17.159 align:start position:0%
head um that truly negatively impacts
 
04:15:20.429 --> 04:15:20.439 align:start position:0%
the practices of a particular agency
 
04:15:23.269 --> 04:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
that agency is not able to defend itself
 
04:15:25.349 --> 04:15:25.359 align:start position:0%
then or
 
04:15:30.670 --> 04:15:30.680 align:start position:0%
what no I mean I I if they're um the
 
04:15:33.189 --> 04:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
legislature creates the law so if they
 
04:15:35.189 --> 04:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
want to come in and they want to testify
 
04:15:38.070 --> 04:15:38.080 align:start position:0%
in their own private capacity as an
 
04:15:40.189 --> 04:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
employee of an agency they have every
 
04:15:41.630 --> 04:15:41.640 align:start position:0%
right to do that but they can't
 
04:15:43.429 --> 04:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
represent the agency but they can give
 
04:15:46.269 --> 04:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
all of the facts it's very easy to say
 
04:15:48.550 --> 04:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
to say you know I we strongly oppose
 
04:15:51.750 --> 04:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
this bill for XYZ just don't say you
 
04:15:53.710 --> 04:15:53.720 align:start position:0%
strongly oppose the bill but these are
 
04:15:56.510 --> 04:15:56.520 align:start position:0%
the reasons why I I feel or even an
 
04:15:58.870 --> 04:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
agency can come in and say this
 
04:16:01.830 --> 04:16:01.840 align:start position:0%
bill I feel on behalf of the agency is
 
04:16:04.830 --> 04:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
inherently flawed because of X Y and Z
 
04:16:07.349 --> 04:16:07.359 align:start position:0%
it's about taking a position they can't
 
04:16:09.429 --> 04:16:09.439 align:start position:0%
you can't come in and say we're strongly
 
04:16:12.510 --> 04:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
opposed to this we strongly support this
 
04:16:14.990 --> 04:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying because that's
 
04:16:17.870 --> 04:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
the gaming of the system that is a
 
04:16:20.670 --> 04:16:20.680 align:start position:0%
problem the legislature makes ra laws we
 
04:16:22.990 --> 04:16:23.000 align:start position:0%
have separation of powers we have to
 
04:16:25.309 --> 04:16:25.319 align:start position:0%
keep it as clean as we possibly can
 
04:16:27.550 --> 04:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
facts are facts and that's great it's
 
04:16:30.469 --> 04:16:30.479 align:start position:0%
not going to stop anything you know I
 
04:16:32.990 --> 04:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
want as much truthful factual
 
04:16:35.109 --> 04:16:35.119 align:start position:0%
information for us to be able to do our
 
04:16:37.030 --> 04:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
jobs as best we
 
04:16:40.030 --> 04:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
can represent
 
04:16:42.950 --> 04:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
senson thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:16:46.030 --> 04:16:46.040 align:start position:0%
for your bill um so you mentioned the
 
04:16:48.670 --> 04:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
executive branch earlier and it's my
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
understanding that the governor's budget
 
04:16:53.590 --> 04:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
is a proposal that she's advocating for
 
04:16:56.269 --> 04:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
so she's specifically taking a stand how
 
04:17:00.630 --> 04:17:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:04.830 --> 04:17:04.840 align:start position:0%
bill so um it really doesn't because she
 
04:17:07.149 --> 04:17:07.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't come testify in front of the
 
04:17:10.750 --> 04:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
legislature the the bill actually
 
04:17:14.309 --> 04:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
goes I mean going through one budget
 
04:17:16.189 --> 04:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
already I've kind of watched that
 
04:17:19.229 --> 04:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
process and when we get you know s when
 
04:17:23.830 --> 04:17:23.840 align:start position:0%
we get like um s sp1 and sb2 we're you
 
04:17:25.389 --> 04:17:25.399 align:start position:0%
know and all of the different components
 
04:17:29.189 --> 04:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
to it um her proposal is put forward and
 
04:17:31.550 --> 04:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
then it goes to the legislature it's not
 
04:17:35.710 --> 04:17:35.720 align:start position:0%
as if she's coming in and testifying or
 
04:17:38.750 --> 04:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
for or against or whatever it's it it
 
04:17:40.229 --> 04:17:40.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't really work in what I'm talking
 
04:17:46.750 --> 04:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:48.309 --> 04:17:48.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:17:50.990 --> 04:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony can I clarify a statement
 
04:17:53.149 --> 04:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
that you just made that the governor
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
does not um provide testimony to all of
 
04:17:59.830 --> 04:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
us when it's on our calendar that the
 
04:18:02.750 --> 04:18:02.760 align:start position:0%
governor is making your budget
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
address yes I know that was confusing no
 
04:18:07.189 --> 04:18:07.199 align:start position:0%
I understand where you're coming from
 
04:18:10.189 --> 04:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
she of course puts forward in her
 
04:18:13.710 --> 04:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
address to the whole house we're talking
 
04:18:18.510 --> 04:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
about like a specific Bill item she's
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
going to give her you know put her foot
 
04:18:26.030 --> 04:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
forward but this is It's I'm not I don't
 
04:18:28.710 --> 04:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
know I think we're making this bigger
 
04:18:31.349 --> 04:18:31.359 align:start position:0%
into than what we than what we're saying
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
here I don't um the budget is a little
 
04:18:37.790 --> 04:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
bit different than just passing uh one
 
04:18:41.710 --> 04:18:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:44.469 --> 04:18:44.479 align:start position:0%
legislation thank you chairman um
 
04:18:48.389 --> 04:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
question please I believe I've seen um
 
04:18:50.309 --> 04:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
where like for example the state police
 
04:18:52.950 --> 04:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
come in and testify on a committee are
 
04:18:54.149 --> 04:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
you saying they would have to come in on
 
04:18:55.950 --> 04:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
their own time to testify about
 
04:18:57.830 --> 04:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
legislation and how it might affect
 
04:18:59.229 --> 04:18:59.239 align:start position:0%
their operations they'd have to come in
 
04:19:00.670 --> 04:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
as a private citizen they couldn't come
 
04:19:03.750 --> 04:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
in while they're on the job no they
 
04:19:04.950 --> 04:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
could totally come in while they're on
 
04:19:11.189 --> 04:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:18.710 --> 04:19:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative B yes I have a a question
 
04:19:20.750 --> 04:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
this goes back to considering if we were
 
04:19:23.950 --> 04:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
considering a estate agency as a
 
04:19:27.109 --> 04:19:27.119 align:start position:0%
constituent uh would we be restricting
 
04:19:31.750 --> 04:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
their rights to um say yay or or nay if
 
04:19:33.790 --> 04:19:33.800 align:start position:0%
they're on the clock why wouldn't they
 
04:19:36.790 --> 04:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
be able to to come in on on the clock
 
04:19:39.149 --> 04:19:39.159 align:start position:0%
because taxpayers are paying for for
 
04:19:42.070 --> 04:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
them and they they can't you can't you
 
04:19:43.750 --> 04:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
can't do that the government doesn't
 
04:19:45.910 --> 04:19:45.920 align:start position:0%
have the right to do that that's the
 
04:19:49.630 --> 04:19:49.640 align:start position:0%
separation of powers and that's why um
 
04:19:51.229 --> 04:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
we that's why it would be different if
 
04:19:53.109 --> 04:19:53.119 align:start position:0%
they're going to take a day off from
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
work and they want to speak and go
 
04:20:00.389 --> 04:20:00.399 align:start position:0%
against or for something then then that
 
04:20:03.950 --> 04:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
is um that's their right to do that as a
 
04:20:05.389 --> 04:20:05.399 align:start position:0%
private citizen in their private
 
04:20:08.070 --> 04:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
capacity but as a paid employee of the
 
04:20:09.950 --> 04:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
state if they're going to come in and
 
04:20:11.389 --> 04:20:11.399 align:start position:0%
say I strongly
 
04:20:14.229 --> 04:20:14.239 align:start position:0%
oppose they can't do
 
04:20:20.030 --> 04:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
that if if we were yes if we were to um
 
04:20:22.030 --> 04:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
as as a how the governor were to to
 
04:20:26.229 --> 04:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
deliver a house resolution to let's say
 
04:20:28.670 --> 04:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
the president would they have to do it
 
04:20:31.670 --> 04:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
on their own personal
 
04:20:34.750 --> 04:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
time if the governor was to deliver a
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
resolution for I don't understand what
 
04:20:41.510 --> 04:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
you're saying if if the the the Senate
 
04:20:43.630 --> 04:20:43.640 align:start position:0%
and the house passed let's say a joint
 
04:20:47.550 --> 04:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
house resolution on subject X and the
 
04:20:51.189 --> 04:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
governor signed it uh and subject X is
 
04:20:53.910 --> 04:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
now a passed resolution would that
 
04:20:56.830 --> 04:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
resolution have to be delivered to uh
 
04:20:59.830 --> 04:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
our federal delegation or to the Office
 
04:21:03.109 --> 04:21:03.119 align:start position:0%
of the President uh on the governor's
 
04:21:06.389 --> 04:21:06.399 align:start position:0%
personal time or would it be able to be
 
04:21:11.189 --> 04:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
delivered on state state taxpayers time
 
04:21:13.109 --> 04:21:13.119 align:start position:0%
a resolution is not
 
04:21:28.389 --> 04:21:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:30.710 --> 04:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
apply I'm new at
 
04:21:34.550 --> 04:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
this um I'm going to ask private citizen
 
04:21:39.349 --> 04:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:45.269 --> 04:21:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:47.630 --> 04:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
again thank you Mr chairman members of
 
04:21:50.109 --> 04:21:50.119 align:start position:0%
the committee I am Sean Jasper private
 
04:21:53.990 --> 04:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
citizen Hudson representing myself um
 
04:21:56.670 --> 04:21:56.680 align:start position:0%
and I apologize because my three monkeys
 
04:21:58.710 --> 04:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
comment was actually meant to be for
 
04:22:00.830 --> 04:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
this bill not the previous
 
04:22:04.269 --> 04:22:04.279 align:start position:0%
one um
 
04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
and I think there are a lot of a lot of
 
04:22:10.149 --> 04:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
problems uh with this idea and and the
 
04:22:12.630 --> 04:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
first one I want to correct is just
 
04:22:15.189 --> 04:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
because some people have not seen a
 
04:22:17.469 --> 04:22:17.479 align:start position:0%
governor come and testify before
 
04:22:20.750 --> 04:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
committee does not mean that it does not
 
04:22:22.950 --> 04:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
happen because I've certainly served in
 
04:22:26.070 --> 04:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
the legislature when it has happened um
 
04:22:27.630 --> 04:22:27.640 align:start position:0%
as Speaker I had
 
04:22:30.030 --> 04:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
encouraged Governor sonunu to come and
 
04:22:34.189 --> 04:22:34.199 align:start position:0%
testify just for pick a bill any Bill to
 
04:22:35.990 --> 04:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
come in and testify so that committee
 
04:22:38.189 --> 04:22:38.199 align:start position:0%
members would become familiar with how
 
04:22:39.630 --> 04:22:39.640 align:start position:0%
that happened unfortunately I don't
 
04:22:41.750 --> 04:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
think that did and clearly now there's
 
04:22:43.550 --> 04:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
some idea that Governors don't testify
 
04:22:45.910 --> 04:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
on bills but I'm sure that
 
04:22:47.830 --> 04:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative wall could testify that
 
04:22:50.469 --> 04:22:50.479 align:start position:0%
over the years that has happened on more
 
04:22:52.750 --> 04:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
than one occasion
 
04:22:57.309 --> 04:22:57.319 align:start position:0%
um the idea that we we could come in and
 
04:22:57.319 --> 04:22:58.590 align:start position:0%
um the idea that we we could come in and
provide

04:22:58.590 --> 04:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
provide
 
04:23:01.630 --> 04:23:01.640 align:start position:0%
information um as a head of a state
 
04:23:04.269 --> 04:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
agency without directly or
 
04:23:08.109 --> 04:23:08.119 align:start position:0%
indirectly um taking a position is is
 
04:23:10.269 --> 04:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive if you're providing
 
04:23:12.950 --> 04:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
information there are going to be times
 
04:23:16.149 --> 04:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
when it's very clear what the position
 
04:23:18.109 --> 04:23:18.119 align:start position:0%
is based on the information that we're
 
04:23:20.229 --> 04:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
providing and that would be in the
 
04:23:22.189 --> 04:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
testimony would be in conflict with what
 
04:23:25.109 --> 04:23:25.119 align:start position:0%
you just heard I'm going to give you a
 
04:23:27.990 --> 04:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh an example of a bill that I will be
 
04:23:32.309 --> 04:23:32.319 align:start position:0%
testifying on um in this session uh as a
 
04:23:33.670 --> 04:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
matter of fact when I was asked for
 
04:23:37.189 --> 04:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal note I refused to provide the
 
04:23:39.389 --> 04:23:39.399 align:start position:0%
information because it this said the
 
04:23:42.510 --> 04:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
bill is a direct violation of federal
 
04:23:46.670 --> 04:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
law and I will not provide information
 
04:23:50.670 --> 04:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
on a bill which violates federal law and
 
04:23:53.229 --> 04:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
so I will be testifying and I have to
 
04:23:57.189 --> 04:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
testify to the consequences of that bill
 
04:24:00.349 --> 04:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
and why I have to oppose it because
 
04:24:02.510 --> 04:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
while the intent may be
 
04:24:06.630 --> 04:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
good the reality is that it would put
 
04:24:06.640 --> 04:24:07.910 align:start position:0%
good the reality is that it would put
private

04:24:07.910 --> 04:24:07.920 align:start position:0%
private
 
04:24:12.790 --> 04:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
citizens at risk of violating public
 
04:24:15.590 --> 04:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
federal law being subject to a
 
04:24:19.149 --> 04:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and $1,000 fine per
 
04:24:21.750 --> 04:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
violation but they would be doing so
 
04:24:26.710 --> 04:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
under cover of estate law and in this
 
04:24:28.630 --> 04:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
this particular subject which has to do
 
04:24:33.189 --> 04:24:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:36.109 --> 04:24:36.119 align:start position:0%
197 the federal government has taken it
 
04:24:39.070 --> 04:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
on their responsibility for food
 
04:24:41.309 --> 04:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
protection um you can actually read my
 
04:24:44.149 --> 04:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
comments on on uh the website of the
 
04:24:47.309 --> 04:24:47.319 align:start position:0%
department with my uh my weekly column
 
04:24:49.189 --> 04:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
which I don't necessarily write weekly
 
04:24:51.070 --> 04:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
but this one is called The Jungle which
 
04:24:54.229 --> 04:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
is a reference to uh uh the book The
 
04:24:57.870 --> 04:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
Jungle written by Upton Sinclair in
 
04:25:02.189 --> 04:25:02.199 align:start position:0%
194 um so there are times when it is in
 
04:25:05.750 --> 04:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
the best interest and it is imperative
 
04:25:10.030 --> 04:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
for departments to be giving that uh
 
04:25:12.670 --> 04:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
that testimony that could be very
 
04:25:15.510 --> 04:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
directly uh in opposition to the bill
 
04:25:18.149 --> 04:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
simply giving information first of all
 
04:25:20.950 --> 04:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
as I said would pretty easily be seen
 
04:25:22.670 --> 04:25:22.680 align:start position:0%
one way or the other but it is
 
04:25:26.670 --> 04:25:26.680 align:start position:0%
imperative the second uh case is and the
 
04:25:28.389 --> 04:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
government just gave all the
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and department heads this
 
04:25:32.630 --> 04:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
directive yesterday we are not to
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
testify on bills unless we have had the
 
04:25:39.630 --> 04:25:39.640 align:start position:0%
approval of the governor to do so
 
04:25:41.550 --> 04:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
because specifically she does not want
 
04:25:44.510 --> 04:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
us to be at odds with her position so we
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
have to run it through her office to say
 
04:25:48.309 --> 04:25:48.319 align:start position:0%
we have a bill that we have we're either
 
04:25:51.510 --> 04:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
in support or opposition to and we would
 
04:25:53.349 --> 04:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
like to testify then we get the
 
04:25:56.389 --> 04:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
permission to do so so you know we need
 
04:25:59.550 --> 04:25:59.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to represent the person who
 
04:26:02.670 --> 04:26:02.680 align:start position:0%
appointed us to office we are in essence
 
04:26:05.349 --> 04:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
here on the governor's behalf I think
 
04:26:08.309 --> 04:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
you need to have the information and and
 
04:26:10.710 --> 04:26:10.720 align:start position:0%
you all need to do as the legislature
 
04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
has done for you know if you go back to
 
04:26:15.710 --> 04:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
Colonial times well over 300 years you
 
04:26:18.149 --> 04:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
have to take the information that is
 
04:26:20.349 --> 04:26:20.359 align:start position:0%
provided to you in weigh that rather
 
04:26:22.229 --> 04:26:22.239 align:start position:0%
it's truth truthful whether it makes
 
04:26:23.189 --> 04:26:23.199 align:start position:0%
sense to
 
04:26:26.229 --> 04:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
you and and use that to come to your
 
04:26:28.750 --> 04:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
best judgment but you should not put the
 
04:26:31.630 --> 04:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
legislature in a in a situation where
 
04:26:34.750 --> 04:26:34.760 align:start position:0%
there are opinions and thoughts and
 
04:26:37.710 --> 04:26:37.720 align:start position:0%
ideas that are held back I think that
 
04:26:41.710 --> 04:26:41.720 align:start position:0%
goes against the very idea of why the
 
04:26:45.389 --> 04:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
legisl is here and I'll I'll end my
 
04:26:48.670 --> 04:26:48.680 align:start position:0%
testimony there thank you uh private
 
04:26:53.590 --> 04:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
citizen U Jasper um any any
 
04:26:55.950 --> 04:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative way thank
 
04:26:58.790 --> 04:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony um so I'm I'm a
 
04:27:00.429 --> 04:27:00.439 align:start position:0%
freshman rep but it's to my
 
04:27:02.710 --> 04:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
understanding that there are occasions
 
04:27:06.189 --> 04:27:06.199 align:start position:0%
where a state agency might reach out to
 
04:27:10.910 --> 04:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
a legislator um or um and and discuss
 
04:27:13.070 --> 04:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
proposing a bill in the first place if
 
04:27:16.510 --> 04:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
there um if if a state agency identifies
 
04:27:18.389 --> 04:27:18.399 align:start position:0%
an issue with current law or an
 
04:27:21.070 --> 04:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
improvement that could be made um
 
04:27:23.309 --> 04:27:23.319 align:start position:0%
specifically to benefit their operations
 
04:27:26.990 --> 04:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
and then that you know that the entire
 
04:27:28.990 --> 04:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
process is is in coordination with
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
estate agency um so how do you imagine
 
04:27:34.870 --> 04:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
this might impact those types of bills
 
04:27:36.590 --> 04:27:36.600 align:start position:0%
that get thank you for that question and
 
04:27:39.149 --> 04:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
I did Overlook that part of the the
 
04:27:41.550 --> 04:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
process in my testimony I've been
 
04:27:43.030 --> 04:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
thinking of that back there and then it
 
04:27:45.109 --> 04:27:45.119 align:start position:0%
slipped slipped my mind but you're
 
04:27:47.229 --> 04:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
absolutely right that is the only way
 
04:27:50.269 --> 04:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
that agencies can actually get a bill
 
04:27:53.149 --> 04:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
before the legislature is to find
 
04:27:56.469 --> 04:27:56.479 align:start position:0%
sponsors um and we do that all the time
 
04:27:58.590 --> 04:27:58.600 align:start position:0%
uh there are several bills before the
 
04:28:00.710 --> 04:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
before the legislature now that I have
 
04:28:02.990 --> 04:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
reached out to legislature legislators
 
04:28:05.630 --> 04:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
on and will be coming forward at our
 
04:28:08.710 --> 04:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
behas and um we will need to testify in
 
04:28:11.070 --> 04:28:11.080 align:start position:0%
favor of that we've asked legislators to
 
04:28:13.309 --> 04:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
go forward with these IDE idea and these
 
04:28:15.469 --> 04:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
ideas and these bills and the idea that
 
04:28:17.870 --> 04:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able to come in and then
 
04:28:20.830 --> 04:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
give them the full support uh again is
 
04:28:22.870 --> 04:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
something that just really doesn't make
 
04:28:26.710 --> 04:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense now we you know usually
 
04:28:30.149 --> 04:28:30.159 align:start position:0%
um you will find in those cases it may
 
04:28:31.550 --> 04:28:31.560 align:start position:0%
actually say this bill has been
 
04:28:33.349 --> 04:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
submitted at the request of the state of
 
04:28:35.030 --> 04:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
the Department of Agriculture markets
 
04:28:36.950 --> 04:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
and food you'll be aware of that but
 
04:28:39.109 --> 04:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
certainly most legislators would also
 
04:28:41.189 --> 04:28:41.199 align:start position:0%
say the department asked me to do that
 
04:28:42.550 --> 04:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
and then we would follow up with the
 
04:28:45.349 --> 04:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
testimony it is part of the process that
 
04:28:49.710 --> 04:28:49.720 align:start position:0%
has worked very well for hundreds of
 
04:28:52.630 --> 04:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
years thank you commissioner Jasper um
 
04:28:54.750 --> 04:28:54.760 align:start position:0%

04:28:56.590 --> 04:28:56.600 align:start position:0%
in the same
 
04:29:00.550 --> 04:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
testimony pretty good um no further
 
04:29:02.269 --> 04:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
questions I think we're all set thank
 
04:29:05.590 --> 04:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
you very much uh chair will
 
04:29:07.990 --> 04:29:08.000 align:start position:0%

04:29:11.640 --> 04:29:13.429 align:start position:0%
Smith our house clerk uh asked for two
minutes

04:29:13.429 --> 04:29:13.439 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
04:29:15.630 --> 04:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
not taking a position that's correct
 
04:29:16.910 --> 04:29:16.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for the record
 
04:29:18.830 --> 04:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
Paul Smith Clerk of the house wanted to
 
04:29:21.030 --> 04:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
give a little historical context uh to
 
04:29:23.870 --> 04:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
this to the underlying section of uh
 
04:29:27.550 --> 04:29:27.560 align:start position:0%
chapter 98 um in
 
04:29:30.910 --> 04:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
2005 uh legislation uh let let me give a
 
04:29:32.429 --> 04:29:32.439 align:start position:0%
more broad historical context in the
 
04:29:34.990 --> 04:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
early 2000s legislative ethics was sort
 
04:29:38.950 --> 04:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
of Paramount um and we revised our laws
 
04:29:42.550 --> 04:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
entirely um uh former representative
 
04:29:44.790 --> 04:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
Jasper was was chair of the legislative
 
04:29:47.030 --> 04:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee at one point uh I was a
 
04:29:49.990 --> 04:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
member of the House at that time and uh
 
04:29:54.349 --> 04:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
in fact uh I am a co-sponsor of the bill
 
04:29:57.229 --> 04:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
uh House Bill 43 in
 
04:30:01.149 --> 04:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
2005 that went to this committee um that
 
04:30:04.750 --> 04:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
specifically created chapter 98f the
 
04:30:09.269 --> 04:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
reason this was done was because in
 
04:30:12.189 --> 04:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
2003 and four when we were working on
 
04:30:15.870 --> 04:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
the legislative ethics chapter we uh we
 
04:30:18.469 --> 04:30:18.479 align:start position:0%
really got into the meat of RSA
 
04:30:21.630 --> 04:30:21.640 align:start position:0%
155 uh in in in the whole chapter of 15
 
04:30:24.830 --> 04:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
which is about um lobbying in behalf of
 
04:30:27.550 --> 04:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
in in front of the legisl excuse me in
 
04:30:29.710 --> 04:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
front of the legislature and the
 
04:30:33.269 --> 04:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
original um the original subsections
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
that we worked on uh was to create a not
 
04:30:40.710 --> 04:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
applicable to State Employees who were
 
04:30:43.670 --> 04:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
appearing to testify for a committee we
 
04:30:46.309 --> 04:30:46.319 align:start position:0%
amended that subsequently in creating
 
04:30:49.309 --> 04:30:49.319 align:start position:0%
the new chapter 98 as it was in 2005
 
04:30:53.189 --> 04:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
which is now 20 years old um and
 
04:30:56.229 --> 04:30:56.239 align:start position:0%
basically indicated that like lobbyists
 
04:30:58.670 --> 04:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
legisl or excuse me executive branch
 
04:31:02.710 --> 04:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
staff um must wear proper identification
 
04:31:05.229 --> 04:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
in their positions of taking positions
 
04:31:06.469 --> 04:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
just like
 
04:31:09.189 --> 04:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
lobbyists just like lobbyists we were
 
04:31:11.590 --> 04:31:11.600 align:start position:0%
equating legis excuse me executive
 
04:31:13.429 --> 04:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
branch staff I'm a legislative staff
 
04:31:17.109 --> 04:31:17.119 align:start position:0%
it's just the way I rock I apologize um
 
04:31:20.550 --> 04:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
but we wanted the executive agencies to
 
04:31:23.710 --> 04:31:23.720 align:start position:0%
be held to the same standard as
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
lobbyists who were also being paid uh to
 
04:31:29.870 --> 04:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
to give a position uh in front of the
 
04:31:32.750 --> 04:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
legislature so that is the history of
 
04:31:36.510 --> 04:31:36.520 align:start position:0%
how this particular statute developed uh
 
04:31:41.189 --> 04:31:41.199 align:start position:0%
and why um and and and to clarify that
 
04:31:44.710 --> 04:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
state employees and agencies had been
 
04:31:47.710 --> 04:31:47.720 align:start position:0%
for many years testifying on behalf of
 
04:31:50.109 --> 04:31:50.119 align:start position:0%
their agencies and keep in mind of
 
04:31:52.429 --> 04:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
course that Commissioners are
 
04:31:56.469 --> 04:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
technically not included as staff of
 
04:31:58.109 --> 04:31:58.119 align:start position:0%
executive of the executive branch
 
04:32:00.309 --> 04:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
because they are commissioned by the
 
04:32:02.109 --> 04:32:02.119 align:start position:0%
governor and Council just like the
 
04:32:06.510 --> 04:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
governor is not an employee um when he
 
04:32:08.269 --> 04:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
or she does testify in front of the
 
04:32:09.830 --> 04:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
legislature to present their budget they
 
04:32:11.870 --> 04:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
are not employees they are the Govern
 
04:32:13.429 --> 04:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
governor elected
 
04:32:16.950 --> 04:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
Etc um the the second point I wanted to
 
04:32:19.910 --> 04:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
just raise in in the first part of
 
04:32:24.149 --> 04:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
17d um in regarding investigations that
 
04:32:25.790 --> 04:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
the language as representative Wade
 
04:32:27.309 --> 04:32:27.319 align:start position:0%
pointed out earlier does say a state
 
04:32:29.750 --> 04:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
agency shall only provide information to
 
04:32:31.870 --> 04:32:31.880 align:start position:0%
the committee at the committee's request
 
04:32:35.389 --> 04:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
so that means preemptively if an agency
 
04:32:39.109 --> 04:32:39.119 align:start position:0%
saw House Bill 645 and saw that it was
 
04:32:42.830 --> 04:32:42.840 align:start position:0%
going to to cut 45 positions the agency
 
04:32:45.229 --> 04:32:45.239 align:start position:0%
could not send a letter to the committee
 
04:32:47.750 --> 04:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
unless requested to do so saying this
 
04:32:49.510 --> 04:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
will impact the state in the following
 
04:32:51.910 --> 04:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
ways not taking a position but this
 
04:32:53.309 --> 04:32:53.319 align:start position:0%
language would prohibit them from
 
04:32:55.109 --> 04:32:55.119 align:start position:0%
sending that letter until they were
 
04:32:57.389 --> 04:32:57.399 align:start position:0%
invited to do so by the chair of the
 
04:33:01.070 --> 04:33:01.080 align:start position:0%
committee um that is that is a a truism
 
04:33:03.469 --> 04:33:03.479 align:start position:0%
of of the language as it is before you
 
04:33:07.269 --> 04:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
uh again I don't take any position on um
 
04:33:10.949 --> 04:33:10.959 align:start position:0%
allowing uh agencies to to take a
 
04:33:13.349 --> 04:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
position on on legislation uh I can
 
04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
simply tell you the the legislative
 
04:33:18.670 --> 04:33:18.680 align:start position:0%
intent uh from 20 years ago um when I
 
04:33:21.990 --> 04:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
was sitting over on that side um and and
 
04:33:24.150 --> 04:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
why we are where we
 
04:33:27.070 --> 04:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
are thank you for your testimony uh
 
04:33:27.080 --> 04:33:28.230 align:start position:0%
are thank you for your testimony uh
further

04:33:28.230 --> 04:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
further
 
04:33:31.150 --> 04:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
04:33:34.629 --> 04:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
much um chair we'll call uh John
 
04:33:39.949 --> 04:33:39.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:43.070 --> 04:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
DHHS chairman Hill committee thank you
 
04:33:45.750 --> 04:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
again taking no position taking taking
 
04:33:50.429 --> 04:33:50.439 align:start position:0%
no position um so this I I think you've
 
04:33:52.390 --> 04:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
actually identified many of the key
 
04:33:55.029 --> 04:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
concerns that I was going to raise and
 
04:33:57.429 --> 04:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
you certainly got a well done history of
 
04:34:00.230 --> 04:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
the legislative background from uh clerk
 
04:34:02.551 --> 04:34:02.561 align:start position:0%
um Smith on on the bill uh there was
 
04:34:04.510 --> 04:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
just a couple of very quick um items
 
04:34:06.269 --> 04:34:06.279 align:start position:0%
just to bring to your attention um for
 
04:34:08.109 --> 04:34:08.119 align:start position:0%
example the Department of Revenue
 
04:34:10.470 --> 04:34:10.480 align:start position:0%
Administration they perform an important
 
04:34:12.429 --> 04:34:12.439 align:start position:0%
and critical role and this is just an
 
04:34:14.990 --> 04:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
example just speaking about how we work
 
04:34:17.269 --> 04:34:17.279 align:start position:0%
as state agencies with with the
 
04:34:19.429 --> 04:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
legislature as you go through the budget
 
04:34:20.910 --> 04:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
process one of the thresholds is
 
04:34:22.310 --> 04:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
identifying what are the revenues going
 
04:34:24.590 --> 04:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
to be and that happens during the course
 
04:34:26.750 --> 04:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
of the uh House phas of the budget the
 
04:34:29.551 --> 04:34:29.561 align:start position:0%
governor phase of the budget uh and the
 
04:34:31.990 --> 04:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
critical information that is received by
 
04:34:34.789 --> 04:34:34.799 align:start position:0%
the house Ways and Means Committee is so
 
04:34:37.629 --> 04:34:37.639 align:start position:0%
so important so this bill as currently
 
04:34:40.910 --> 04:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
written would prohibit them from coming
 
04:34:43.830 --> 04:34:43.840 align:start position:0%
unless they were were requested now one
 
04:34:45.470 --> 04:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
of the the items that did catch my
 
04:34:47.830 --> 04:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
attention uh in your discussion is about
 
04:34:50.429 --> 04:34:50.439 align:start position:0%
what mechanically would the process be
 
04:34:52.510 --> 04:34:52.520 align:start position:0%
for the committee themselves to actually
 
04:34:55.390 --> 04:34:55.400 align:start position:0%
make the request and as as and I would
 
04:34:57.269 --> 04:34:57.279 align:start position:0%
defer to attorney Jenifer for because
 
04:34:58.629 --> 04:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
she's your legal counsel for the
 
04:35:00.750 --> 04:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
committee on all things that are legal
 
04:35:02.429 --> 04:35:02.439 align:start position:0%
but I'm going to give you at least my my
 
04:35:03.830 --> 04:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
Impressions because I've been doing this
 
04:35:06.230 --> 04:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
work for some time but under statutory
 
04:35:08.310 --> 04:35:08.320 align:start position:0%
construction you look at the plain
 
04:35:09.949 --> 04:35:09.959 align:start position:0%
language in front of you and if you read
 
04:35:12.150 --> 04:35:12.160 align:start position:0%
it and it reads in a very clear way you
 
04:35:13.830 --> 04:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
don't get to the ambiguity of trying to
 
04:35:16.029 --> 04:35:16.039 align:start position:0%
figure out what the language means so in
 
04:35:18.590 --> 04:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
the sentences that you see in lines 10
 
04:35:20.470 --> 04:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
through 12 when it talks about a state
 
04:35:22.510 --> 04:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
agency shall only provide information to
 
04:35:24.670 --> 04:35:24.680 align:start position:0%
a committee at the committee's request
 
04:35:26.070 --> 04:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
not the committee's chair that could
 
04:35:28.470 --> 04:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
certainly call and say hey I would like
 
04:35:30.629 --> 04:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
uh uh um commissioner Jasper to come and
 
04:35:32.349 --> 04:35:32.359 align:start position:0%
talk to me about wonderful things
 
04:35:34.910 --> 04:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
happening in the world of Agriculture um
 
04:35:36.709 --> 04:35:36.719 align:start position:0%
apples blooming and things like that and
 
04:35:38.510 --> 04:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
and all that sort of stuff but what it
 
04:35:40.230 --> 04:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
says here specifically is that the
 
04:35:42.310 --> 04:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
committee has to make make the request
 
04:35:43.789 --> 04:35:43.799 align:start position:0%
so how does that even procedurally
 
04:35:45.109 --> 04:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
happen does that mean you have to meet
 
04:35:47.869 --> 04:35:47.879 align:start position:0%
as a committee convene then vote because
 
04:35:49.670 --> 04:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
right to know transparency of government
 
04:35:50.949 --> 04:35:50.959 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to do this in the
 
04:35:52.869 --> 04:35:52.879 align:start position:0%
open public for people to see and say
 
04:35:54.789 --> 04:35:54.799 align:start position:0%
yes we're voting on this bill we would
 
04:35:56.029 --> 04:35:56.039 align:start position:0%
like to see the department then you
 
04:35:58.429 --> 04:35:58.439 align:start position:0%
would close the hearing recalendar it
 
04:36:02.150 --> 04:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
per the the um house rules and then have
 
04:36:03.789 --> 04:36:03.799 align:start position:0%
the department come before you so I
 
04:36:06.230 --> 04:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
think you've identified many of the the
 
04:36:08.629 --> 04:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
mechanical issues and technical issues
 
04:36:10.910 --> 04:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
with the bill uh as commissioner Jasper
 
04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
said um and it was a great question that
 
04:36:15.189 --> 04:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
was raised by repr Wade many state
 
04:36:17.709 --> 04:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
agencies do request legislation to help
 
04:36:19.789 --> 04:36:19.799 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens and we reach out
 
04:36:21.830 --> 04:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
to you and we partner with you and we
 
04:36:23.629 --> 04:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
get uh if you're good at what you do you
 
04:36:25.310 --> 04:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
get bip partn support you get both
 
04:36:27.109 --> 04:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
senators and representatives on your
 
04:36:29.551 --> 04:36:29.561 align:start position:0%
bill in the analysis of the bill when
 
04:36:31.551 --> 04:36:31.561 align:start position:0%
you for those of you who are brand new
 
04:36:32.629 --> 04:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh right under here where it says
 
04:36:34.869 --> 04:36:34.879 align:start position:0%
analysis you're going to see indicated
 
04:36:36.269 --> 04:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
in there if it was a department
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
requested bill so it makes it really
 
04:36:39.830 --> 04:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
really clear that the department is
 
04:36:41.949 --> 04:36:41.959 align:start position:0%
requesting that legislation so what
 
04:36:44.830 --> 04:36:44.840 align:start position:0%
happens if this bill passes and clearly
 
04:36:46.269 --> 04:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
the Department's wanting to come in and
 
04:36:48.150 --> 04:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
taking a position on it whether it's
 
04:36:52.750 --> 04:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
implied or directly and now I and it
 
04:36:54.150 --> 04:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
raises a question the authority if I'm
 
04:36:56.750 --> 04:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
coming here as citizen Jasper um just
 
04:37:00.189 --> 04:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
for a second um or citizen Williams do I
 
04:37:01.910 --> 04:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
really am I vested with the authority
 
04:37:04.789 --> 04:37:04.799 align:start position:0%
that I've been given as a state um actor
 
04:37:06.949 --> 04:37:06.959 align:start position:0%
at that point in time and and it just
 
04:37:09.510 --> 04:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
raises lots of questions and I think you
 
04:37:11.070 --> 04:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
got it so with that that ends and
 
04:37:12.990 --> 04:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
concludes my observations uh chairman
 
04:37:14.709 --> 04:37:14.719 align:start position:0%

04:37:17.349 --> 04:37:17.359 align:start position:0%

you so much and I am here as the
 
04:38:21.189 --> 04:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
associate child advocate essentially I
 
04:38:23.869 --> 04:38:23.879 align:start position:0%
am the deputy for a very tiny agency
 
04:38:26.590 --> 04:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
that many of you may not have heard of I
 
04:38:28.029 --> 04:38:28.039 align:start position:0%
actually have not had the pleasure of
 
04:38:30.349 --> 04:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
appearing here before you or meeting
 
04:38:32.789 --> 04:38:32.799 align:start position:0%
most of you our child advocate Cassandra
 
04:38:35.230 --> 04:38:35.240 align:start position:0%
Sanchez wanted to be here today but she
 
04:38:37.910 --> 04:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
could not she is essentially the
 
04:38:40.830 --> 04:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner of our agency um the office
 
04:38:42.949 --> 04:38:42.959 align:start position:0%
of the child Advocate is a nine-person
 
04:38:45.949 --> 04:38:45.959 align:start position:0%
state agency we are administratively
 
04:38:47.949 --> 04:38:47.959 align:start position:0%
attached to dis because we are an
 
04:38:50.551 --> 04:38:50.561 align:start position:0%
independent oversight agency
 
04:38:54.029 --> 04:38:54.039 align:start position:0%
over all child serving executive branch
 
04:38:56.590 --> 04:38:56.600 align:start position:0%
agency so originally that was dcyf which
 
04:38:58.869 --> 04:38:58.879 align:start position:0%
is child protection Juvenile Justice it
 
04:39:02.109 --> 04:39:02.119 align:start position:0%
expanded in 2020 to include all child
 
04:39:04.789 --> 04:39:04.799 align:start position:0%
serving agencies executive branch
 
04:39:06.390 --> 04:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
agencies as well as their contracted
 
04:39:07.990 --> 04:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
providers that would also include
 
04:39:09.949 --> 04:39:09.959 align:start position:0%
residential facilities like Webster
 
04:39:12.230 --> 04:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
house it expands to
 
04:39:15.029 --> 04:39:15.039 align:start position:0%
YDC um as well as contracted providers
 
04:39:18.510 --> 04:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
like Waypoint so we are a very small
 
04:39:21.590 --> 04:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
agency um but we one of the reasons we
 
04:39:25.429 --> 04:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
were created in 2017 after some very
 
04:39:28.670 --> 04:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
high-profile um child deaths was in part
 
04:39:32.709 --> 04:39:32.719 align:start position:0%
two come present to and Advocate to the
 
04:39:35.590 --> 04:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
legislature the public other executive
 
04:39:38.590 --> 04:39:38.600 align:start position:0%
branch agencies um Outreach is a huge
 
04:39:41.868 --> 04:39:41.878 align:start position:0%
part of what we do um so I did include a
 
04:39:43.628 --> 04:39:43.638 align:start position:0%
big chunk of our Statute in the written
 
04:39:46.550 --> 04:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
testimony I tried to bold the relevant
 
04:39:49.628 --> 04:39:49.638 align:start position:0%
pieces um I just want to point to a
 
04:39:51.190 --> 04:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
couple things because I agree with
 
04:39:53.830 --> 04:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
private citizen Jasper who has left as
 
04:39:56.910 --> 04:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
well as my colleague John Williams um
 
04:39:58.590 --> 04:39:58.600 align:start position:0%
many of us sit on a commissioner
 
04:40:00.670 --> 04:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
legislative group which is a group of
 
04:40:02.948 --> 04:40:02.958 align:start position:0%
all of the sort of legislative Liaisons
 
04:40:06.150 --> 04:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
in state agencies um to come together on
 
04:40:09.750 --> 04:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
some bills so I did read that sentence
 
04:40:11.310 --> 04:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
in the same way that you did represent
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
representative Wade as far as the
 
04:40:16.470 --> 04:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
invitation the request to appear I agree
 
04:40:18.070 --> 04:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
with attorney Williams that that is the
 
04:40:20.030 --> 04:40:20.040 align:start position:0%
plain language of that it would seem as
 
04:40:22.750 --> 04:40:22.760 align:start position:0%
though unless the entire committee
 
04:40:24.948 --> 04:40:24.958 align:start position:0%
invited us to appear we could not
 
04:40:24.958 --> 04:40:25.910 align:start position:0%
invited us to appear we could not
present

04:40:25.910 --> 04:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
present
 
04:40:29.430 --> 04:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
testimony and um as many of you may not
 
04:40:30.868 --> 04:40:30.878 align:start position:0%
have been aware the office of the child
 
04:40:33.310 --> 04:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
advocate exists or that we might be
 
04:40:35.110 --> 04:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
interested in this bill so you wouldn't
 
04:40:38.030 --> 04:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
even know to invite us or request Our
 
04:40:40.628 --> 04:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
Testimony um we were created to
 
04:40:43.470 --> 04:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
specifically Advocate and give a voice
 
04:40:45.190 --> 04:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
to children in the system very
 
04:40:46.868 --> 04:40:46.878 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children who often don't have
 
04:40:49.190 --> 04:40:49.200 align:start position:0%
a voice um which is a little different
 
04:40:50.750 --> 04:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
than many state agencies most state
 
04:40:52.310 --> 04:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
agencies were not created specifically
 
04:40:53.750 --> 04:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
for that purpose even though they do
 
04:40:56.910 --> 04:40:56.920 align:start position:0%
that um and so there are many bills I am
 
04:40:59.830 --> 04:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
currently watching over 150 bills right
 
04:41:02.150 --> 04:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
now many of which may not appear on
 
04:41:04.670 --> 04:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
their face to impact children in the
 
04:41:07.230 --> 04:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
system however we are the experts in
 
04:41:10.310 --> 04:41:10.320 align:start position:0%
that area I was a dcyf attorney
 
04:41:12.550 --> 04:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
Prosecuting child use I've been a parent
 
04:41:14.788 --> 04:41:14.798 align:start position:0%
attorney contracted with the state I've
 
04:41:16.910 --> 04:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
also practiced private family law most
 
04:41:18.750 --> 04:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
of my colleagues are social workers
 
04:41:20.350 --> 04:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
they've worked within the system and
 
04:41:22.030 --> 04:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
without this of the system we are
 
04:41:25.230 --> 04:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
experts in our field as are most of the
 
04:41:27.030 --> 04:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
state agency employees I would hope that
 
04:41:30.150 --> 04:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
state agencies hire experts in their
 
04:41:34.150 --> 04:41:34.160 align:start position:0%
fields so they know about land use I sat
 
04:41:36.150 --> 04:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
through a bill on farming today there's
 
04:41:38.350 --> 04:41:38.360 align:start position:0%
a there's a specific agency may be
 
04:41:40.510 --> 04:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
implicated or that children may be
 
04:41:42.430 --> 04:41:42.440 align:start position:0%
implicated or that there may be an
 
04:41:44.670 --> 04:41:44.680 align:start position:0%
unintended consequence for children so
 
04:41:46.550 --> 04:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
we are particularly concerned about that
 
04:41:49.390 --> 04:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
language but more broadly this idea that
 
04:41:52.350 --> 04:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
state agencies should not be able to
 
04:41:54.750 --> 04:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly take a position
 
04:41:56.830 --> 04:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
does seem to fly in the face of what we
 
04:41:59.550 --> 04:41:59.560 align:start position:0%
do I appreciate your question about the
 
04:42:02.030 --> 04:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
budget every agency has to go before the
 
04:42:03.628 --> 04:42:03.638 align:start position:0%
house finance and the Senate finance
 
04:42:06.030 --> 04:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
committee and Advocate sometimes quite
 
04:42:08.390 --> 04:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
strongly for our budget to get funding
 
04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
especially in a challenging uh fiscal
 
04:42:13.030 --> 04:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
climate we also do have bills as
 
04:42:14.868 --> 04:42:14.878 align:start position:0%
attorney Williams mentioned and uh
 
04:42:17.470 --> 04:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner Jasper mentioned that our
 
04:42:20.628 --> 04:42:20.638 align:start position:0%
agency put forth and it says right on
 
04:42:22.470 --> 04:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
there put forth by the office of child
 
04:42:25.628 --> 04:42:25.638 align:start position:0%
advocate the uh Bill language for sb76
 
04:42:27.788 --> 04:42:27.798 align:start position:0%
just came out it's a cleanup bill for
 
04:42:30.788 --> 04:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
our statute we would necessarily need to
 
04:42:33.470 --> 04:42:33.480 align:start position:0%
go advocate for that about why those
 
04:42:36.150 --> 04:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
specific changes what needs to get fixed
 
04:42:38.030 --> 04:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
so as everyone else has already
 
04:42:39.910 --> 04:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the language of this is
 
04:42:42.270 --> 04:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
incredibly problematic for many
 
04:42:44.788 --> 04:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
reasons and would directly impact the
 
04:42:46.628 --> 04:42:46.638 align:start position:0%
office of child advocate especially
 
04:42:48.590 --> 04:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
because we have sort of a very unique
 
04:42:50.670 --> 04:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
role and I'd be happy to take any
 
04:42:53.030 --> 04:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
04:42:55.150 --> 04:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
uh I see one question one hand raised
 
04:42:57.270 --> 04:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
from representative
 
04:43:00.670 --> 04:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
Richards just for clarification in the
 
04:43:02.910 --> 04:43:02.920 align:start position:0%
notes that I was taking um in this
 
04:43:05.590 --> 04:43:05.600 align:start position:0%
language that we're many of folks that
 
04:43:08.110 --> 04:43:08.120 align:start position:0%
are testimony or pointing to around the
 
04:43:11.750 --> 04:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
invit the invitation of the committee um
 
04:43:14.270 --> 04:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
just to clarify that that is that
 
04:43:16.030 --> 04:43:16.040 align:start position:0%
invitation is something that committees
 
04:43:18.788 --> 04:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
do with every single bill at the point
 
04:43:21.230 --> 04:43:21.240 align:start position:0%
with every when every public hearing is
 
04:43:24.788 --> 04:43:24.798 align:start position:0%
announced so the statement from OS is
 
04:43:27.070 --> 04:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
that that is the committee's invitation
 
04:43:29.150 --> 04:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
did I hear
 
04:43:32.670 --> 04:43:32.680 align:start position:0%
that correctly but did I then also hear
 
04:43:36.190 --> 04:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
that um the agencies like yourself may
 
04:43:39.670 --> 04:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
be wanting to provide information as the
 
04:43:43.270 --> 04:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
clerk listed with the historical in uh
 
04:43:45.510 --> 04:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
intent of things that there would be
 
04:43:48.070 --> 04:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
times when an agency would send a letter
 
04:43:50.910 --> 04:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
to the committee in in advance of the
 
04:43:52.910 --> 04:43:52.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing being stated so they're
 
04:43:54.590 --> 04:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
aware at the start of the legislative
 
04:43:57.430 --> 04:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
session this bill is coming forward with
 
04:43:59.190 --> 04:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
certain language that's going to cut the
 
04:44:02.510 --> 04:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
45 employees as was mentioned earlier
 
04:44:05.070 --> 04:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
and at that point that anyone from that
 
04:44:09.550 --> 04:44:09.560 align:start position:0%
state agency could not do anything until
 
04:44:13.590 --> 04:44:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:17.430 --> 04:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
announced is are you following my logic
 
04:44:19.470 --> 04:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
I heard to whom is that question I'm
 
04:44:23.430 --> 04:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
kind of putting that question to you um
 
04:44:25.788 --> 04:44:25.798 align:start position:0%
and then I would also then put it back
 
04:44:27.670 --> 04:44:27.680 align:start position:0%
to the sponsor of the bill potentially
 
04:44:30.990 --> 04:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
to come back up because she did say that
 
04:44:35.070 --> 04:44:35.080 align:start position:0%
OS put that in my area of wanting to
 
04:44:38.830 --> 04:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
find the focus of concern is that you're
 
04:44:41.470 --> 04:44:41.480 align:start position:0%
restricting any of that agency to do
 
04:44:43.788 --> 04:44:43.798 align:start position:0%
anything until that public hearing is
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
scheduled and announced so my
 
04:44:50.030 --> 04:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
understanding if you'll allow me my
 
04:44:54.470 --> 04:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
understanding is um the notice in the
 
04:44:59.510 --> 04:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
calendar of the hearing date is um the
 
04:45:05.470 --> 04:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
offer to all um to um testify on this on
 
04:45:09.788 --> 04:45:09.798 align:start position:0%
this bill so um whether that's quote
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
unquote an invitation I think I think it
 
04:45:18.110 --> 04:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
would be um so regardless of whether um
 
04:45:20.910 --> 04:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
there's a personal invitation or not or
 
04:45:23.788 --> 04:45:23.798 align:start position:0%
um and and I did write down the note of
 
04:45:26.670 --> 04:45:26.680 align:start position:0%
um we may not even know they want to
 
04:45:32.470 --> 04:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
testify um I think it's encompassing or
 
04:45:36.670 --> 04:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
um uh incumbent on them um or whoever
 
04:45:39.868 --> 04:45:39.878 align:start position:0%
them is to to read the calendar and
 
04:45:41.830 --> 04:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
04:45:45.070 --> 04:45:45.080 align:start position:0%
may I follow up Mr chair yeah my my I
 
04:45:47.190 --> 04:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
guess I let me re try to restate this to
 
04:45:49.550 --> 04:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
be where I'm trying to get into the
 
04:45:51.788 --> 04:45:51.798 align:start position:0%
order of operations of what is
 
04:45:56.030 --> 04:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
restricting the state agencies is that
 
04:45:57.750 --> 04:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
um the state agency will only provide
 
04:45:58.910 --> 04:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
information at the committee at the
 
04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
committee's request um the committee's
 
04:46:06.030 --> 04:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
request is the public hearing which is
 
04:46:09.230 --> 04:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
calendared um and the agencies pay
 
04:46:11.310 --> 04:46:11.320 align:start position:0%
attention to that you follow your 100 50
 
04:46:14.270 --> 04:46:14.280 align:start position:0%
bills that language though is the state
 
04:46:17.430 --> 04:46:17.440 align:start position:0%
agency can only provide information at
 
04:46:20.270 --> 04:46:20.280 align:start position:0%
that point from that point forward so
 
04:46:22.788 --> 04:46:22.798 align:start position:0%
from February 19th on the rest of the
 
04:46:25.030 --> 04:46:25.040 align:start position:0%
eight bills no state agency could
 
04:46:27.590 --> 04:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
communicate with the committee in any
 
04:46:32.230 --> 04:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
fashion and that to me is what this is
 
04:46:36.470 --> 04:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
saying and if as Paul gave an example
 
04:46:40.470 --> 04:46:40.480 align:start position:0%
that a bill could be presented that cuts
 
04:46:43.910 --> 04:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
half of the workforce that no one the
 
04:46:45.910 --> 04:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
the commissioner appointed by the
 
04:46:47.590 --> 04:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
governor no one could communicate to
 
04:46:50.190 --> 04:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
anyone in the committee prior to that
 
04:46:53.510 --> 04:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
point okay so here's what we'll do um we
 
04:46:58.830 --> 04:46:58.840 align:start position:0%
will ask um both Jennifer and um
 
04:47:03.030 --> 04:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
attorney CN for for whether for
 
04:47:04.868 --> 04:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
clarification on that
 
04:47:07.628 --> 04:47:07.638 align:start position:0%
point okay
 
04:47:11.430 --> 04:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
good s way I I was G to quick this isn't
 
04:47:13.510 --> 04:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
a question it's more to to state that I
 
04:47:15.788 --> 04:47:15.798 align:start position:0%
think the the prime sponsor mentioned
 
04:47:18.470 --> 04:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
that OSS said that that language implied
 
04:47:21.470 --> 04:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
that the hearing counted as the
 
04:47:24.150 --> 04:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
committee's request but there are
 
04:47:25.708 --> 04:47:25.718 align:start position:0%
concerns from some of the other
 
04:47:27.990 --> 04:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
witnesses that the plain language of the
 
04:47:30.510 --> 04:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
bill if you were to just read it in
 
04:47:33.788 --> 04:47:33.798 align:start position:0%
isolation um a committee might think
 
04:47:35.430 --> 04:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
that you would have to get a formal
 
04:47:38.750 --> 04:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
request so yeah
 
04:47:55.948 --> 04:47:55.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:58.548 --> 04:47:58.558 align:start position:0%
you're I think everybody has covered it
 
04:48:01.230 --> 04:48:01.240 align:start position:0%
I think it's an open question that is my
 
04:48:03.788 --> 04:48:03.798 align:start position:0%
plain read reading of it that we would
 
04:48:05.670 --> 04:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
need to wait for a committee to reach
 
04:48:07.708 --> 04:48:07.718 align:start position:0%
out to the office of child advocate and
 
04:48:10.390 --> 04:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
say please we want you to speak to us
 
04:48:12.830 --> 04:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
because it's new language the the
 
04:48:16.070 --> 04:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
original language sort of had that as a
 
04:48:16.080 --> 04:48:17.470 align:start position:0%
original language sort of had that as a
public

04:48:17.470 --> 04:48:17.480 align:start position:0%
public
 
04:48:19.948 --> 04:48:19.958 align:start position:0%
invitation okay we'll get it clarified
 
04:48:23.110 --> 04:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative turkot thank you um Mr
 
04:48:25.070 --> 04:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
chairman thanks for the question this is
 
04:48:27.110 --> 04:48:27.120 align:start position:0%
probably a better question for the
 
04:48:30.430 --> 04:48:30.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor but I'll take your response on
 
04:48:32.628 --> 04:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
it also let's just assume that the words
 
04:48:34.868 --> 04:48:34.878 align:start position:0%
at the committee's request was not in
 
04:48:39.070 --> 04:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
there uh I think would you at that point
 
04:48:44.470 --> 04:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
think that the intent of the bill is to
 
04:48:48.110 --> 04:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
have agencies or state employees only
 
04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
provide inform provide information and
 
04:48:54.150 --> 04:48:54.160 align:start position:0%
not take a
 
04:48:58.310 --> 04:48:58.320 align:start position:0%
position does that make sense yes so
 
04:49:02.110 --> 04:49:02.120 align:start position:0%
so we have two distinct concerns with
 
04:49:06.030 --> 04:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
this bill one being the invitation only
 
04:49:10.350 --> 04:49:10.360 align:start position:0%
the second very much being that agencies
 
04:49:13.510 --> 04:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
would not not be able to take a position
 
04:49:15.670 --> 04:49:15.680 align:start position:0%
and I think commissioner Jasper as well
 
04:49:17.830 --> 04:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
as attorney Williams
 
04:49:20.948 --> 04:49:20.958 align:start position:0%
also said similarly whether you're
 
04:49:24.390 --> 04:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
indirectly or directly taking aition you
 
04:49:26.830 --> 04:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
know the office of the child advocate is
 
04:49:29.230 --> 04:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
very specifically created in order to
 
04:49:30.868 --> 04:49:30.878 align:start position:0%
advocate for children which would make
 
04:49:32.750 --> 04:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
it incredibly difficult for us to
 
04:49:34.670 --> 04:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
fulfill our statutory mandate but I
 
04:49:37.310 --> 04:49:37.320 align:start position:0%
think many state agencies it's very
 
04:49:39.590 --> 04:49:39.600 align:start position:0%
clear even if you're just giving
 
04:49:41.708 --> 04:49:41.718 align:start position:0%
information like this is going to harm
 
04:49:43.510 --> 04:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
the environment this is going to harm
 
04:49:46.230 --> 04:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
children this is going to harm the state
 
04:49:48.470 --> 04:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
police what you know whatever or help it
 
04:49:49.868 --> 04:49:49.878 align:start position:0%
could also be helped this will help
 
04:49:52.628 --> 04:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
children this will help State Police
 
04:49:55.230 --> 04:49:55.240 align:start position:0%
typically when a state agency is
 
04:49:57.708 --> 04:49:57.718 align:start position:0%
weighing in it's because the bill is
 
04:49:59.750 --> 04:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
going to have some sort of impact on
 
04:50:02.270 --> 04:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
their agency or more importantly their
 
04:50:04.270 --> 04:50:04.280 align:start position:0%
constituency um the office of child
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
advocate was very specifically
 
04:50:09.190 --> 04:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
created in order to be sort of a
 
04:50:11.590 --> 04:50:11.600 align:start position:0%
watchdog agency and specifically take
 
04:50:15.190 --> 04:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
positions and systemic reform um but all
 
04:50:17.830 --> 04:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
agencies um do directly or indirectly
 
04:50:19.750 --> 04:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
take positions including on our budgets
 
04:50:21.910 --> 04:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
as well as bills that we put forth uh
 
04:50:23.548 --> 04:50:23.558 align:start position:0%
right now we have five bills in front of
 
04:50:26.990 --> 04:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature that we sought a sponsor
 
04:50:29.750 --> 04:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
we help draft we provide assistance and
 
04:50:32.470 --> 04:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
advocacy for um so this would definitely
 
04:50:34.548 --> 04:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
tie the hands of I believe All State
 
04:50:36.470 --> 04:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
agencies but very explicitly the office
 
04:50:39.868 --> 04:50:39.878 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate H up thank you Mr
 
04:50:41.510 --> 04:50:41.520 align:start position:0%
chairman uh
 
04:50:44.830 --> 04:50:44.840 align:start position:0%
let me rephrase the question uh if the
 
04:50:46.788 --> 04:50:46.798 align:start position:0%
words at the committee's request were
 
04:50:48.750 --> 04:50:48.760 align:start position:0%
removed is it fair to say you'd only
 
04:50:51.390 --> 04:50:51.400 align:start position:0%
have one issue with this bill and that
 
04:50:55.948 --> 04:50:55.958 align:start position:0%
would be not being able to provide a
 
04:50:59.470 --> 04:50:59.480 align:start position:0%
um position correct except for it is
 
04:51:03.030 --> 04:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
worded differently the second the second
 
04:51:07.070 --> 04:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
section in 98 F1 is even
 
04:51:10.708 --> 04:51:10.718 align:start position:0%
broader um to include promoting opposing
 
04:51:13.070 --> 04:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly any legislation
 
04:51:14.830 --> 04:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
it'd be hard to imagine how I would even
 
04:51:18.868 --> 04:51:18.878 align:start position:0%
give information without potentially
 
04:51:20.750 --> 04:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
falling a foul of that language is
 
04:51:20.760 --> 04:51:27.350 align:start position:0%
falling a foul of that language is
incredibly

04:51:27.350 --> 04:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:31.788 --> 04:51:31.798 align:start position:0%
broad um very quickly um would you
 
04:51:39.110 --> 04:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:41.788 --> 04:51:41.798 align:start position:0%
information thank you for the
 
04:51:44.110 --> 04:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
question that feels a little bit like a
 
04:51:45.990 --> 04:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
chicken in an egg
 
04:51:50.750 --> 04:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
question um a position yes taking a
 
04:51:54.230 --> 04:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
information thank you um no further
 
04:51:59.390 --> 04:51:59.400 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
04:52:00.948 --> 04:52:00.958 align:start position:0%
much for your help um it's a pleasure to
 
04:52:02.430 --> 04:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
see all of you we never get to hang out
 
04:52:04.708 --> 04:52:04.718 align:start position:0%
over uh you're always welcome back at
 
04:52:07.070 --> 04:52:07.080 align:start position:0%
the legislative Administration I do see
 
04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
a hand up from the prime sponsor who um
 
04:52:13.788 --> 04:52:13.798 align:start position:0%
I hesitate but I would be happy to give
 
04:52:17.750 --> 04:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
you two or three minutes to uh answer
 
04:52:20.750 --> 04:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
whatever questions have popped up in the
 
04:52:28.750 --> 04:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:31.830 --> 04:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
like thank you Mr chair
 
04:52:38.150 --> 04:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
um position is Crystal Clear it's Pro or
 
04:52:40.830 --> 04:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
against you know the first thing comes
 
04:52:43.310 --> 04:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
out of the mouth usually when an agency
 
04:52:45.910 --> 04:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
is testifying we're strongly against or
 
04:52:48.310 --> 04:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
strongly for that's the only thing that
 
04:52:48.320 --> 04:52:49.990 align:start position:0%
strongly for that's the only thing that
this

04:52:49.990 --> 04:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:52:52.948 --> 04:52:52.958 align:start position:0%
changes I just talked to um commissioner
 
04:52:54.590 --> 04:52:54.600 align:start position:0%
Jasper in the hallway I see him all the
 
04:52:56.190 --> 04:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
time I'm an environment and agricult
 
04:52:57.628 --> 04:52:57.638 align:start position:0%
being any of that if it's going to
 
04:52:59.430 --> 04:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
violate federal law and you're going to
 
04:53:01.390 --> 04:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
give all of those facts all of that
 
04:53:04.750 --> 04:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
information it's about taking a position
 
04:53:07.350 --> 04:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
specifically that's it so whoever you're
 
04:53:09.788 --> 04:53:09.798 align:start position:0%
advocating for or not I didn't realize
 
04:53:12.628 --> 04:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
that this would be ripped apart I
 
04:53:14.230 --> 04:53:14.240 align:start position:0%
thought it was a simple bill I
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
definitely believe that if the committee
 
04:53:17.948 --> 04:53:17.958 align:start position:0%
is up for that I will put an amendment
 
04:53:20.310 --> 04:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
in or the commit it's your bill now um
 
04:53:21.948 --> 04:53:21.958 align:start position:0%
you could put an amendment in to wipe
 
04:53:25.110 --> 04:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
out the specific language that was from
 
04:53:28.990 --> 04:53:29.000 align:start position:0%
OS um in regards because you know and
 
04:53:31.110 --> 04:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
and look at the um talk to the attorney
 
04:53:32.788 --> 04:53:32.798 align:start position:0%
as well it was Jennifer that I worked
 
04:53:35.708 --> 04:53:35.718 align:start position:0%
with on this bill um so you know we
 
04:53:39.430 --> 04:53:39.440 align:start position:0%
could fix that it's just um I think it's
 
04:53:41.230 --> 04:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
it's really important
 
04:53:43.628 --> 04:53:43.638 align:start position:0%
um and there's there's a method to my
 
04:53:45.830 --> 04:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
madness and I will uh I will email the
 
04:53:47.948 --> 04:53:47.958 align:start position:0%
committee some very specifics about the
 
04:53:49.750 --> 04:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
reason why I think that's so
 
04:53:52.628 --> 04:53:52.638 align:start position:0%
important um when you're arguing your
 
04:53:55.230 --> 04:53:55.240 align:start position:0%
case for some for something or against
 
04:53:57.948 --> 04:53:57.958 align:start position:0%
something um the proof is in the pudding
 
04:53:59.110 --> 04:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be they're already
 
04:54:01.270 --> 04:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
doing that anyway this doesn't change
 
04:54:05.030 --> 04:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
that okay this um I wasn't giving you a
 
04:54:07.990 --> 04:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
second opportunity to do another
 
04:54:10.510 --> 04:54:10.520 align:start position:0%
testimony um I I wondered if you had
 
04:54:13.548 --> 04:54:13.558 align:start position:0%
specific answers to specific questions
 
04:54:17.110 --> 04:54:17.120 align:start position:0%
that we had so um representative
 
04:54:21.030 --> 04:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
Richards I um I see I heard exactly what
 
04:54:25.230 --> 04:54:25.240 align:start position:0%
you heard from um um from the clerk and
 
04:54:29.230 --> 04:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
so um now I don't believe that we ever
 
04:54:32.310 --> 04:54:32.320 align:start position:0%
get any testimony Before the bill gets
 
04:54:34.270 --> 04:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
gets a bill number and all of that it's
 
04:54:35.868 --> 04:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
before it goes onto the calendar and has
 
04:54:38.510 --> 04:54:38.520 align:start position:0%
a hearing it's not as if I've never
 
04:54:40.390 --> 04:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
received any sort of testimony in
 
04:54:42.670 --> 04:54:42.680 align:start position:0%
advance of a bill that's not already
 
04:54:46.230 --> 04:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
noticed so that piece I agree like the
 
04:54:49.788 --> 04:54:49.798 align:start position:0%
hearing with what the OS put forward was
 
04:54:51.628 --> 04:54:51.638 align:start position:0%
that was like the putting it out there
 
04:54:54.510 --> 04:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
inviting but um I can see where you're
 
04:54:56.270 --> 04:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
coming from with what he said like if
 
04:54:58.510 --> 04:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
that continuing you know would it be a
 
04:55:01.230 --> 04:55:01.240 align:start position:0%
One-Shot deal I wouldn't believe that I
 
04:55:04.070 --> 04:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
that was not my intent uh we get
 
04:55:07.750 --> 04:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
messages all the time for from the um
 
04:55:09.948 --> 04:55:09.958 align:start position:0%
agencies all throughout the cycle it's
 
04:55:12.350 --> 04:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
not a one and done so but I I hear what
 
04:55:14.590 --> 04:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
you were trying to say and I I think
 
04:55:18.310 --> 04:55:18.320 align:start position:0%
that that was a concern that um the cler
 
04:55:20.510 --> 04:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
answered for you great thank you very
 
04:55:23.350 --> 04:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
much for taking the time uh having no
 
04:55:25.150 --> 04:55:25.160 align:start position:0%
other pink cards and seeing no one else
 
04:55:27.948 --> 04:55:27.958 align:start position:0%
in the room that uh wants to speak I'll
 
04:55:30.230 --> 04:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on whatever this bill
 
04:55:31.868 --> 04:55:31.878 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
04:55:37.190 --> 04:55:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:42.590 --> 04:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:45.628 --> 04:55:45.638 align:start position:0%
um I will uh I think we're all set for
 
04:55:48.628 --> 04:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
the day um we've successfully gone
 
04:55:50.510 --> 04:55:50.520 align:start position:0%
through a third of our
 
04:55:54.350 --> 04:55:54.360 align:start position:0%
bills um and uh and we're all set now
 
04:55:56.628 --> 04:55:56.638 align:start position:0%

04:56:01.150 --> 04:56:01.160 align:start position:0%
19th um anything that comes up please

for how things went today um was there
 
04:56:15.510 --> 04:56:15.520 align:start position:0%

04:56:19.350 --> 04:56:19.360 align:start position:0%

04:56:21.270 --> 04:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
bit into ex session on that that last

04:56:28.830 --> 04:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so for a little while just about
 
04:56:31.110 --> 04:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
till crossover you can get away with
 
04:56:35.910 --> 04:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
saying I'm new here but after that um uh

we're all we're all the same um it
 
04:56:42.310 --> 04:56:42.320 align:start position:0%

so even even um even if you know the
 
04:56:48.470 --> 04:56:48.480 align:start position:0%

04:56:51.510 --> 04:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
better it you you read the room and and
 
04:56:53.390 --> 04:56:53.400 align:start position:0%

04:56:55.910 --> 04:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
better we have we have all this period
 
04:56:58.548 --> 04:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
