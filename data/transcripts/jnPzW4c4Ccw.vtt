four agencies possibly five
um

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
we're probably
 
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 align:start position:0%
after we hear
 
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
from the department of justice
 
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 align:start position:0%

two two uh bills that
 
00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 align:start position:0%
came back with senate messages that we
 
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 align:start position:0%
have to determine if we want to concur
 
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 align:start position:0%
or not so we'll just have a brief
 
00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
discussion on those two
 
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 align:start position:0%
and i'll talk about some of the other
 
00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
ones that we were second on
 
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
and i've already talked to the chairs of
 
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.030 align:start position:0%
and i've already talked to the chairs of
those

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
uh committees because they're the prime
 
00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
the the principal uh committees
 
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh i'll i'll cover that real quickly as
 
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
well so uh with that we're going to
 
00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
start with department of revenue
 
00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 align:start position:0%

and just everybody knows at the end of
 
00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 align:start position:0%
all this we are not we are not going to
 
00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
be voting revenues
 
00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 align:start position:0%

very large that we have we've
 
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
know we made it through march and april
 
00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
and waiting for the shoe to drop and the
 
00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
shoe didn't drop it actually dropped in
 
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
the other way
 
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
so we're
 
00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:20.799 align:start position:0%

everyone should have a copy hopefully of
 
00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
a presentation that says department of

dated today may 10th
 
00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
should look like this
 
00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.190 align:start position:0%
should look like this
okay

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 align:start position:0%
it's not as pretty
 
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.589 align:start position:0%
it's not as pretty
[Laughter]

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:02:48.869 --> 00:02:48.879 align:start position:0%
it's the second second thing in the
 
00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.790 align:start position:0%
it's the second second thing in the
packet

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
packet
 
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
we can um either chris or i can
 
00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 align:start position:0%
we have them
 
00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
we have the color copies okay so your
 
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 align:start position:0%
it should be in color that's right
 
00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
so thanks for having us today uh the dra
 
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
developed revised fiscal year 22 and 23
 
00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates for
 
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
the major dra the major taxes that dra
 
00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
collects the business taxes meals and
 
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
rentals tax tobacco interest and
 
00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
dividends communication services tax
 
00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax and utility
 
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
what we did is we adjusted fiscal year
 
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
22 plan based on currently available
 
00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 align:start position:0%
data through april as well as estimating
 
00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
revenues for may and june that formed
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
our 22 estimates and then we applied a
 
00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 align:start position:0%
growth rate either positive or negative
 
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
to our 22 plan to robot arrive at 23
 
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.630 align:start position:0%
to our 22 plan to robot arrive at 23
estimates

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
so on this first page here you will see
 
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
a summary
 
00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 plan
 
00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.710 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 plan
was

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.110 align:start position:0%
was
um

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 align:start position:0%
1.8 billion dollars year-to-date or
 
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
excuse me our revised estimates are just
 
00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 align:start position:0%
about 2.2 billion
 
00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 align:start position:0%
so compared to plan we are estimating to
 
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
end the year
 
00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 align:start position:0%
at 330
 
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
uh 331 and a half million dollars ahead
 
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
of planner 17.8 percent year to date
 
00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:24.199 align:start position:0%
through april um we are
 
00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
307.1 million or 22.3 percent ahead of
 
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.670 align:start position:0%
307.1 million or 22.3 percent ahead of
plan

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 align:start position:0%
looking at fiscal year 23
 
00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
original plan was 1.8 billion our
 
00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 align:start position:0%
revised estimates are 2.1 billion
 
00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 align:start position:0%
which is a 268 million dollar increase
 
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
or 14.6 percent
 
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
i will say that we expect some
 
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.150 align:start position:0%
i will say that we expect some
volatility

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
volatility
 
00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:49.919 align:start position:0%
in our estimates and in economic
 
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
performance in general in the near to
 
00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:53.759 align:start position:0%
long term
 
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
elements that are having a direct impact
 
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
on the economic outlook
 
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
include persisting inflation increasing
 
00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
interest rates low unemployment rate
 
00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
volatile fuel prices and supply chain
 
00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 align:start position:0%
constraints all of which are changing on
 
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
a daily basis so
 
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
basically as soon as we print these
 
00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
estimates they're probably outdated
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
so my goal today is to help you
 
00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 align:start position:0%
understand the factors that we're
 
00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
considering when we're looking at
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates over the next few
 
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:23.600 align:start position:0%
months the summer and through the fall
 
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
and um obviously these are subject to
 
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 align:start position:0%
change and will change as the months go
 
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.469 align:start position:0%
change and will change as the months go
on

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
lindsay can i interrupt you sure
 
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.430 align:start position:0%
lindsay can i interrupt you sure
so

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.469 align:start position:0%
so
uh

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
last month there was negative growth in
 
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.360 align:start position:0%
the country
 
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh so it takes three to say it's in it's
 
00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
a recession but
 
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that's weighing the back of
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
your mind as well i don't i didn't see
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
recession on this list but
 
00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
it is and you know chris and i were
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
chatting before we got started this
 
00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 align:start position:0%
morning and i think um we've been
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
waiting for this impending recession for
 
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
years now and every time we think it's
 
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
coming it hasn't come yet it hasn't come
 
00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
yet it hasn't come yet so not to say
 
00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:06.479 align:start position:0%
it's not coming i think it is it's
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
really just a question of when and i
 
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
think it has to do with these various
 
00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
factors here
 
00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
how they continue to persist
 
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
does inflation continue to rise is the
 
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
federal reserve successful with kind of
 
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
tampering legislation
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
it's all going to depend and it's all
 
00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:24.639 align:start position:0%
going to be things that we're looking at
 
00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:25.670 align:start position:0%
going to be things that we're looking at
um

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
and i guess we would know by the time we
 
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
have to project revenues again next
 
00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
you know january february correct
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
correct we will know where we're at
 
00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 align:start position:0%
we'll know we'll know better where we're
 
00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.510 align:start position:0%
we'll know we'll know better where we're
at

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:06:40.469 --> 00:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
at that point okay thank you sure
 
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
and actually that is a good point
 
00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why these estimates
 
00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 align:start position:0%
are looking so high compared to plan is
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
i think in many cases we were
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
anticipating the impacts of koba to
 
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
result in a recession and that fiscal
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
year 22 and 23 we were maybe going to be
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
in a recession and we're not yet so
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
that's why these revenue estimates look
 
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 align:start position:0%
so high compared to plan because the
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
plan you know we were anticipating at
 
00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
least some amount of an economic
 
00:07:04.319 --> 00:07:07.189 align:start position:0%
least some amount of an economic
downturn

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
on page two
 
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
this is just a nice visual to show that
 
00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 align:start position:0%
actual revenues compared to plan for
 
00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 to date so as i mentioned
 
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
we have consistently been above plan um
 
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the year again i think
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
when the plan estimates were developed
 
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:27.440 align:start position:0%
we were anticipating um some at least
 
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.280 align:start position:0%
some economic downturn as a result of
 
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.469 align:start position:0%
some economic downturn as a result of
cobit

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 align:start position:0%
cobit
 
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
and in many cases we just haven't seen
 
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
that so you can see we have performed
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
well the the increases in actual in plan
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
in september december and april um those
 
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 align:start position:0%
tie to the business tax estimates and
 
00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440 align:start position:0%
on page three we normally wait for
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
business taxes to do it at the end but
 
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
we're just going to dive right in head
 
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
first this time
 
00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:56.150 align:start position:0%
first this time
so

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:07:58.629 --> 00:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
at the top and you'll see this for every
 
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
tax that i'm going to go over this
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
morning you'll see a bar graph here of
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 revenue compared to 21
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
and 22 and then we've also noted fiscal
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
22 plan so it's kind of a nice visual
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
comparison about how revenues have been
 
00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
performing over the past few years
 
00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
so factors to consider with business
 
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.710 align:start position:0%
so factors to consider with business
taxes

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:20.720 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date we are
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
217.2 million or
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
and a half percent ahead of plan
 
00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
and we are
 
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
198.6 or 24.5 percent ahead of prior
 
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.070 align:start position:0%
198.6 or 24.5 percent ahead of prior
year

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:35.919 align:start position:0%
the u.s bureau of economic analysis
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
preliminary report in march showed that
 
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:40.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire had a 7.9 percent increase
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
in real gdp
 
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
in q4 of 2021 as compared to
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
q3 of 2021 so we are still at least at
 
00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:52.959 align:start position:0%
the end of 2021 we are experiencing an
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
increase in growth in our real gdp here
 
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:57.760 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
moving on to page four
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
the same group estimated a tempered
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
growth in u.s profits with quarter over
 
00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:08.959 align:start position:0%
quarter change from q3 2021 of 3.4
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
percent to q4 20 21 of 0.7 percent so
 
00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
again we're still growing at the end of
 
00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:18.320 align:start position:0%
21 but we're starting to see a little
 
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720 align:start position:0%
bit of a reduction in that growth
 
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
kiplinger forecast is a two and a half
 
00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:27.360 align:start position:0%
percent growth in gdp and 22 compared to
 
00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:30.880 align:start position:0%
21 that's down from a 5.7 percent in 21
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
compared to 20.
 
00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
and then talking about inflation
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
forecasting six percent annual inflation
 
00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:39.680 align:start position:0%
at the end of 22 down from the current
 
00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
eight and a half percent rate of
 
00:09:43.030 --> 00:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
inflation so
 
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:44.070 align:start position:0%
inflation so
again

00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
we're growing but that growth is
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:54.310 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
lindsay as i was coming in this morning
 
00:10:00.389 --> 00:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
i was listening to npr
 
00:10:00.399 --> 00:10:01.590 align:start position:0%
i was listening to npr
and

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.110 align:start position:0%
and
uh

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:10:05.829 --> 00:10:05.839 align:start position:0%
they they had someone on from the
 
00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
economic policy institute which i
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
frankly haven't heard of
 
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:11.670 align:start position:0%
frankly haven't heard of
before

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh so i don't know how good
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
they did say they were leftist
 
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
but they uh
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
they had calculated that of the profits
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
net profits that came out of
 
00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240 align:start position:0%
corporations this last year
 
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.990 align:start position:0%
corporations this last year
on

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
usually 20 of it goes to
 
00:10:33.839 --> 00:10:34.870 align:start position:0%
usually 20 of it goes to
on

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
shareholders and owners and
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
this last year it was over 50
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
and that on
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
leaving a lot less for reinvestment and
 
00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
right so that's another point to what
 
00:10:56.470 --> 00:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
potentially we could be seeing in the
 
00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
future in terms of our
 
00:11:01.269 --> 00:11:01.279 align:start position:0%
businesses adequately preparing for the
 
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
future in a potential economic downturn
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
when they are well prepared the impact
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
tends to be less if they're not as well
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
prepared we might see a greater impact
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
those of you who have been on on this
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
committee for quite a while um you know
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
generally when you when we experience a
 
00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
recession here in new hampshire
 
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.790 align:start position:0%
recession here in new hampshire
we

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
tend to not fall as far as maybe the
 
00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
national average but our recovery is
 
00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:29.920 align:start position:0%
longer in duration so we don't fall as
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
far but we don't recover as fast either
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
so just something to keep in mind for
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
when um if and when we do experience
 
00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
that economic downturn but certainly
 
00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
what representative almi brings up could
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
impact how far
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
um and how fast we fall if businesses
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
aren't prepared yes
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning good morning
 
00:11:50.639 --> 00:11:52.389 align:start position:0%
yeah good morning good morning
um

00:11:52.389 --> 00:11:52.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
about a year ago we were when we were
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
doing the estimates or whatever it was
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
we were concerned about refunds and uh
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
i think the ppp
 
00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.200 align:start position:0%
loan and the forgiveness of that were
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
sort of
 
00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:07.750 align:start position:0%
sort of
uncertainties

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
uncertainties
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
that stood out there and i can't really
 
00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
remember what else there were but there
 
00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:11.990 align:start position:0%
remember what else there were but there
were

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
concerns that related to
 
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
potentially large refunds and i'm
 
00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
wondering if you've seen any
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
indication of that
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
sure so i'll just
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
flip to my handy dandy book here
 
00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.389 align:start position:0%
flip to my handy dandy book here
um

00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
and so i can give you an update
 
00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
on where we stand
 
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.550 align:start position:0%
on where we stand
with

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:38.949 align:start position:0%
with
refunds

00:12:38.949 --> 00:12:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.509 --> 00:12:43.519 align:start position:0%
so for business taxes
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 22 year-to-date through
 
00:12:50.829 --> 00:12:50.839 align:start position:0%
april our refunds were 57.7
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
million that is up from 40 million last
 
00:12:59.110 --> 00:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
year so we've seen about a 44
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
increase we've just also seen such a
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
significant increase in revenue
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
that has kind of
 
00:13:08.949 --> 00:13:08.959 align:start position:0%
been able to offset that those refunds
 
00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
but yeah we've seen about a 17 18
 
00:13:14.389 --> 00:13:14.399 align:start position:0%
million dollar increase in in refunds
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
year to date
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
certainly at the time when we were
 
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
talking about those revenue estimates
 
00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
and the potential for refunds i think we
 
00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
were also a little bit uncertain about
 
00:13:25.509 --> 00:13:25.519 align:start position:0%
what the economy was going to be doing
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
and we see increased refund requests
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
when there's either uncertainty in the
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
economy or there's an economic downturn
 
00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
because businesses would prefer to have
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
that cash back in their accounts or in
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
their pockets for them to use when times
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
are good we see more businesses request
 
00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
credit carry forwards rather keep the
 
00:13:45.189 --> 00:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
money on the account as the economy is
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
doing well
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
and so that may also be a little bit of
 
00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
a difference in terms of the desire for
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
a cco versus a refund
 
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
 
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:56.550 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question
representative

00:13:56.550 --> 00:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
real time i i got a question so
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
we look at the revenue focus that's nets
 
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
out right so yeah all that extra money
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
we saw last month was net of refund
 
00:14:09.829 --> 00:14:09.839 align:start position:0%
return refunds right thank you
 
00:14:09.839 --> 00:14:11.350 align:start position:0%
return refunds right thank you
yeah

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
so it's already melt it's already built
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
into the numbers and i do um get a
 
00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
weekly report of pending refunds um and
 
00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:22.000 align:start position:0%
there is no you know significant backlog
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
or large pending refunds um that i'm
 
00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
aware of we're processing them as they
 
00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
come in so our you know weekly refund
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
run um is monitored consistently and and
 
00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
there's nothing there's no big shoe
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to drop in that respect all
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
right thank you uh yes representative
 
00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
thank you we were really worried about
 
00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:44.720 align:start position:0%
the ppp refunds
 
00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:46.069 align:start position:0%
the ppp refunds
and

00:14:46.069 --> 00:14:46.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
the the amount of refunds that we've got
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
to date is just a little bit more than
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
what we got two years ago
 
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.350 align:start position:0%
what we got two years ago
so

00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:57.509 --> 00:14:57.519 align:start position:0%
what do you have any idea what's going
 
00:14:59.269 --> 00:14:59.279 align:start position:0%
on with ppp
 
00:15:01.269 --> 00:15:01.279 align:start position:0%
well i think to kind of how i ended
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
representative ames's question um
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
i think we were anticipating refunds
 
00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
in that that's what businesses were
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
going to want given what was going on in
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
the economy i think the economy is in a
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
better place
 
00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
at least at the moment businesses at the
 
00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
time are competent about their position
 
00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
and so for any overpayments they just
 
00:15:25.509 --> 00:15:25.519 align:start position:0%
apply that as a credit and we have seen
 
00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
an increase in our credit carryovers
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
so i think it's just the shift between
 
00:15:31.910 --> 00:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
the two they can either treat the
 
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:34.000 align:start position:0%
overpayment as a refund or a credit
 
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.389 align:start position:0%
overpayment as a refund or a credit
carryover

00:15:36.389 --> 00:15:36.399 align:start position:0%
carryover
 
00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:37.990 align:start position:0%
carryover
yes

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:38.949 align:start position:0%
yes
so

00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:38.959 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
it sounds also like they aren't paying
 
00:15:44.069 --> 00:15:44.079 align:start position:0%
attention to the
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
reduction in credit carry forward that
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
isn't really starting yet but that we've
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
got in law correct it is in law it has
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
not go into effect effect yet what
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative elmi's referring to is
 
00:15:58.310 --> 00:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
hb2 from last year there's a cap on the
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
amount of busines of credit carry
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
forwards that businesses can hold on
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
their account it's capped at 500 percent
 
00:16:06.310 --> 00:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
and that'll be effective um
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
for taxable periods ending december 31st
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
of 22. so we haven't
 
00:16:15.110 --> 00:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
seen the full impact of that yet
 
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.110 align:start position:0%
seen the full impact of that yet
yes

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:17.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
yeah just on that but
 
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.110 align:start position:0%
yeah just on that but
then

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
i was thinking that there would be the
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
large businesses that would be affected
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
first that have over 500
 
00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
in there um that they
 
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
would prefer to start taking
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
part of it back now so that they
 
00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to take a huge hit at some
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
point in the future
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
agreed um
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
i think for some of those large
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
businesses it's um
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit of how much attention
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
are they paying to new hampshire
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
um where they might you know it might be
 
00:16:58.389 --> 00:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
a large amount of money to us but it
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
might be a rather small apportionment to
 
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.110 align:start position:0%
might be a rather small apportionment to
them

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:17:03.350 --> 00:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
um and so it's it's a matter of how does
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
um fit into their greater scheme of of
 
00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
taxes and for most large taxpayers were
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:15.669 --> 00:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
bill said
 
00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
okay representative supposedly then
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:23.470 --> 00:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
so in terms of projections for
 
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.189 align:start position:0%
so in terms of projections for
fy23

00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
fy23
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
um isn't the election
 
00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:30.559 align:start position:0%
to either take a refund now
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
or leave the overpayment in place in
 
00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
order to take a credit next year i'm
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
going to net to the exact same
 
00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
effect on our revenues it's just a
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
timing deferral
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
so in effect
 
00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:46.160 align:start position:0%
refunds not taken this year might
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
therefore make it more likely
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
that there is a reduction of net inflows
 
00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:54.720 align:start position:0%
next year potentially so we do have some
 
00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that consistently carry a
 
00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:58.150 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that consistently carry a
credit

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
credit
 
00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
credit carryover year to year to year to
 
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:00.789 align:start position:0%
credit carryover year to year to year to
year

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:02.310 align:start position:0%
year
um

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
the real the thing that will will
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
make the strongest impact will be that
 
00:18:09.190 --> 00:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
cap on the credit carryovers because
 
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
they won't have the opportunity to
 
00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
continue to carry a credit forward
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
that's greater than 500 it will have to
 
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
be a refund at that point for the over
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
500 percent um
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
so it's really each individual business
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
and and various factors and
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
considerations um
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
that that they take into account
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
but yes at the end of the day it is
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
over whether it's two years or 20 years
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
and i'm always the one
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
so you i didn't hear you mention or
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
maybe i just missed it uh
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
the course of the pandemic and whether
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
variants that are more transmissible or
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
carry into different sections of the
 
00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
country or things of that nature that
 
00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
are to do with medical stuff rather than
 
00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:17.120 align:start position:0%
sort of direct economic things
 
00:19:18.870 --> 00:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
and but of course we know it has
 
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
tremendous economic effect
 
00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:23.360 align:start position:0%
did do you see that as something that we
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
need to take into account
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
so your you didn't miss it i didn't
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
include it um in the factors to consider
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
we had listed the covet 19 pandemic as a
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
factor to consider
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
for a couple of the taxes as we were
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
doing revenue estimates
 
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.789 align:start position:0%
doing revenue estimates
previously

00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:19:40.799 --> 00:19:41.669 align:start position:0%
previously
and

00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
for the most part once the stay-at-home
 
00:19:46.150 --> 00:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
orders were lifted
 
00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:48.160 align:start position:0%
the pandemic didn't have a negative
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
effect in some cases it had a positive
 
00:19:51.590 --> 00:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
effect and you'll see this when we talk
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
about m r
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals revenue
 
00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.390 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals revenue
is

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
has maybe been positive again once we
 
00:20:01.270 --> 00:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
got through the stay-at-home order there
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
we may be seeing a positive effect just
 
00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of there was some pent up
 
00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:06.720 align:start position:0%
demand maybe people realized how much
 
00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
they liked going out to eat when they
 
00:20:09.669 --> 00:20:09.679 align:start position:0%
couldn't go out to eat certainly with
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax
 
00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
and what's happened with the housing
 
00:20:15.909 --> 00:20:15.919 align:start position:0%
economy the pandemic has kind of been a
 
00:20:15.919 --> 00:20:18.149 align:start position:0%
economy the pandemic has kind of been a
positive

00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
positive
 
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
factor in those taxes
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
and we haven't been able to
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
quantify really a direct correlation
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
between the pandemic and any of the
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
variants and the timing of the variants
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
or potential future variants
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
with kind of especially the impact on
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
business taxes and so
 
00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:39.840 align:start position:0%
we had looked into it in the past and
 
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.190 align:start position:0%
we had looked into it in the past and
it's

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to really make that
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
direct connection and like i said in
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
some instances things happened in the
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
opposite direction is what we would have
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
anticipated um so certainly something
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
that we will continue to watch and
 
00:20:55.029 --> 00:20:55.039 align:start position:0%
certainly if we there are future
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
variants that are significant and
 
00:20:59.350 --> 00:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
certainly have a you know hindering
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
impact on the economy that will be
 
00:21:03.029 --> 00:21:03.039 align:start position:0%
something that we'll want to look into
 
00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
in terms of revenues thank you very much
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.310 align:start position:0%
representative ames
yeah

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
a slightly a different uh question
 
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.510 align:start position:0%
a slightly a different uh question
is

00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:16.720 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering about big business versus
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
smaller businesses and we've had a large
 
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
increase in revenue
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
that's i guess an understatement
 
00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.630 align:start position:0%
that's i guess an understatement
but

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
query whether it's
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
the big businesses that are mostly
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
the source of that or
 
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
or smaller ones can you speak to that
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
sure so um
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
certainly if you're familiar with our
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
annual report in our triangles the
 
00:21:46.070 --> 00:21:46.080 align:start position:0%
majority of our revenue comes from a few
 
00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
number of businesses
 
00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
i suspect that to continue to be the
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
case we will update our triangles at the
 
00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
i know that you know during covid and we
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
talked about this that there were while
 
00:22:02.789 --> 00:22:02.799 align:start position:0%
certain businesses were feeling a
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
negative impact from covid there were
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
some very large businesses that were
 
00:22:10.230 --> 00:22:10.240 align:start position:0%
positively benefiting from the pandemic
 
00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of that was kind of retail whether
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
online or brick or more brick and mortar
 
00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
technology companies healthcare
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
companies so there were some winners
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
large winners during the pandemic i
 
00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
suspect that the triangles will remain
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
where we the majority of our revenue and
 
00:22:31.669 --> 00:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
much of the revenue growth is coming
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
from that bottom point but certainly
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
some of the factors we were talking
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
about in terms of you know unemployment
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
being able to hire that's really going
 
00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
to i think impact your smaller
 
00:22:43.510 --> 00:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
businesses more than your larger
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
businesses a smaller business doesn't
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
have as much cushion to absorb you know
 
00:22:49.190 --> 00:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
when they need to hire three more people
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
and they can't find those people that's
 
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
a very different calculus than for a
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
large business that can maybe absorb
 
00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
some higher vacancy rates so how these
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
various factors impact each business and
 
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
the size of the business varies and will
 
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
impact our revenue going forward but
 
00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
once the fiscal year closes we will be
 
00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you on two things one i've got a
 
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:16.950 align:start position:0%
thank you on two things one i've got a
draft

00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
draft
 
00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.470 align:start position:0%
draft
uh

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:22.149 --> 00:23:22.159 align:start position:0%
copy of the tax year 19 is that's what
 
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
is going to appear next or are we going
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
to be up to 20.
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
we should be at 20. oh good yep
 
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.230 align:start position:0%
we should be at 20. oh good yep
um

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
but also
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
we're about
 
00:23:37.830 --> 00:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
to start seeing the results of single
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
sales factor next year
 
00:23:39.919 --> 00:23:41.110 align:start position:0%
sales factor next year
correct

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
do you have on and we're in we've been
 
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:46.320 align:start position:0%
in market-based sourcing for
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
a full year we've been in market-based
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
sourcing for a full year so the first
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
returns that we're seeing for calendar
 
00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:54.559 align:start position:0%
year taxpayers were filed in march and
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
april but as you all know they can
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
extend their return till the fall so it
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
won't be until october november until we
 
00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
can fully digest those single sales
 
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:06.720 align:start position:0%
factor is in effect for calendar year
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
starting calendar year 2022 so it'll be
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
next spring when we start to get the
 
00:24:13.269 --> 00:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
single sales factor returns and then we
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
can better analyze the impact but you
 
00:24:18.789 --> 00:24:18.799 align:start position:0%
said that we'd have we'd get some idea
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
of what single sales factor would do to
 
00:24:21.039 --> 00:24:21.830 align:start position:0%
of what single sales factor would do to
us

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
from the market-based sourcing returns
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
correct so once we could be analyzable
 
00:24:29.669 --> 00:24:29.679 align:start position:0%
before january
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
correct so once we have the returns with
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
market-based sourcing as
 
00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:39.279 align:start position:0%
the sourcing methodology for services
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
and intangibles we can then move from
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
our three factor to single sales factor
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
so yes in the fall when we have closer
 
00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:51.279 align:start position:0%
to a full batch if you will full
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
calendar year of returns we can start to
 
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
do an analysis
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
of if
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
calendar year 21
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
repeated itself exactly the same in
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
calendar 22 and the only difference was
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
the shift to single sales factor we'll
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
be able to start quantifying those
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
numbers correct
 
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
thank you but if i could just add uh
 
00:25:19.430 --> 00:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
we'll be looking at a very atypical year
 
00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
to a very atypical year that may be down
 
00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
correct which is why i said if you if
 
00:25:26.149 --> 00:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
you assume that
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
21 is exactly the same as 22 correct
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
okay representative schaumburg has a
 
00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:32.070 align:start position:0%
okay representative schaumburg has a
question

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
 
00:25:33.679 --> 00:25:34.390 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner
uh

00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
going to representative ames is
 
00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:37.830 align:start position:0%
going to representative ames is
a

00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
point of maybe about the corporations
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
and your description of the inverted
 
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.750 align:start position:0%
and your description of the inverted
triangle

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
triangle
 
00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200 align:start position:0%
before i get to my question i just like
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
there were 80 corporations that paid
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
over a million in bpt
 
00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
as of 8 27 21
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
and 12 corporations that paid over a
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
million in bet
 
00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
and then the next category was a hundred
 
00:26:01.470 --> 00:26:01.480 align:start position:0%
thousand to a million
 
00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
591 paying the bpt and 237 paying the
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
bet now my question is has the growth of
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
revenue in new hampshire been static in
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
the number of businesses contributing to
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
the bpt slash bet or has there been an
 
00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:20.400 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of businesses
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
that have started doing business here in
 
00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to cause this
 
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:27.750 align:start position:0%
new hampshire to cause this
revenue

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:29.669 --> 00:26:29.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know for certain without all the
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
data in front of me but i suspect that
 
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.789 align:start position:0%
it is
unlikely

00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:36.799 align:start position:0%
unlikely
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
that there will be new business brand
 
00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
new businesses coming into that point of
 
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
the triangle it's likely existing
 
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
businesses that are going to move in
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
move down the triangle if you will
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
towards the point
 
00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:59.190 --> 00:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
um so estimates for
 
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.630 align:start position:0%
um so estimates for
22

00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:00.640 align:start position:0%
22
 
00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.190 align:start position:0%
22
so

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
we as you may remember we run a variety
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
of kind of scenarios to estimate when
 
00:27:10.149 --> 00:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
we're in a fiscal year how the fiscal
 
00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
year will end so
 
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.269 align:start position:0%
year will end so
for

00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:15.039 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22
 
00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:18.320 align:start position:0%
we are assuming actual with prior year
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
for our scenario for business taxes so
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
what that means is we take actual
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
year-to-date revenue
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
and we are going to include actuals for
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
may and june
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
of last year and that arrives at the
 
00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.630 align:start position:0%
of last year and that arrives at the
1.19

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
1.19
 
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.630 align:start position:0%
1.19
billion

00:27:36.630 --> 00:27:36.640 align:start position:0%
billion
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
we arrived at that scenario because june
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
estimates are the largest source of
 
00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
remaining revenue may is a typically a
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
pretty small revenue month but we have
 
00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
business tax estimates q2 estimates due
 
00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
in june and may and due revenue from
 
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
last year is roughly equal to the
 
00:27:54.149 --> 00:27:54.159 align:start position:0%
typical increase that we see in q2
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
estimates from q1
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
typically first quarter estimates are
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
the lowest estimates out of the four
 
00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:03.440 align:start position:0%
quarters for the year some taxpayers
 
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
they're aware of their credit carryover
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
for instance from the prior year
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
and so they may factor that that credit
 
00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
carry over and reduce that first quarter
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
estimate so we typically see an increase
 
00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
between q1 and q2 when you apply that
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
historic increase
 
00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
it basically at this point subject to
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
change but at this point looks like our
 
00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
june estimates will come in roughly the
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
same as last year
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 23
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
we applied a 3.2
 
00:28:37.669 --> 00:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
growth rate to our new fiscal 22
 
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:40.720 align:start position:0%
estimate and that 3.2 growth rate is the
 
00:28:43.350 --> 00:28:43.360 align:start position:0%
growth rate that was in hb1 from fiscal
 
00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
year 22 to 23. so we didn't change the
 
00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
growth rate we just changed the base
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
that it's being applied to
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know year-to-date
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
with business taxes
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
we are seeing a pretty significant
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
year-over-year growth of
 
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.000 align:start position:0%
about 27 percent
 
00:29:06.389 --> 00:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
so the 3.4 percent
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
assumes um a pretty substantial decrease
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
in the in your over here increase that
 
00:29:14.149 --> 00:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
we've been seeing so we're not yet
 
00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:16.240 align:start position:0%
projecting it to decrease we still think
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
there will be a small amount of growth
 
00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:21.600 align:start position:0%
from 22 to 23 but obviously that may
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
change as things move forward in the
 
00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
next few months
 
00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
um from that
 
00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year 22 grow
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
new fiscal year 22 estimate with a 3.2
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
percent growth rate we then subtracted
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
the surplus statement items that were
 
00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
included in hb1 as well and so that
 
00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
leaves you with the
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
1.16 billion for 23 which will be a 21.1
 
00:29:49.669 --> 00:29:49.679 align:start position:0%
percent increase over plan so again even
 
00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
though the growth rate is the same
 
00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:54.240 align:start position:0%
because fiscal year 22 has performed so
 
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:57.200 align:start position:0%
well that increases how we anticipate we
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
will perform versus plan in 23.
 
00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.389 align:start position:0%
will perform versus plan in 23.
okay

00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.269 --> 00:30:09.279 align:start position:0%
i guess the only other comment i make is
 
00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:10.230 align:start position:0%
i guess the only other comment i make is
that

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:12.389 --> 00:30:12.399 align:start position:0%
with the ukraine
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
war going on
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
it seems like we're we're providing a
 
00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
lot of uh
 
00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.029 align:start position:0%
lot of uh
defense

00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
defense
 
00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
military support and we do have
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
companies like bae
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
who provide a lot of the
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
components that go into a lot of these
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
things so i i would imagine
 
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
this will reflect next year's
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
their revenues certainly and this is
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
something we can't really talk about
 
00:30:38.149 --> 00:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
individual companies but i just did but
 
00:30:39.669 --> 00:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
but we can talk about the fact that i
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
think new hampshire has um
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
a fairly diverse um
 
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
base in terms of you know how we
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
generate our revenues in terms of
 
00:30:51.909 --> 00:30:51.919 align:start position:0%
various industries
 
00:30:53.990 --> 00:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
so we did fare better than some other
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
states in the early part of the pandemic
 
00:30:59.350 --> 00:30:59.360 align:start position:0%
if you take a state like hawaii that's
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
primarily driven by tourism
 
00:31:05.110 --> 00:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
um they saw significant impacts to their
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
revenues at the start of the pandemic we
 
00:31:09.830 --> 00:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
have a tourism component to our economy
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
but we also have other industries that
 
00:31:14.149 --> 00:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
performed well so i think our mix of
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
industries allows us to kind of weather
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
um changes in the economy better than
 
00:31:22.470 --> 00:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
some other states so when we have you
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
know a defense industry that's
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
performing well that can help if another
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
industry is being negatively impacted by
 
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
whatever is going on
 
00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
so that's a good segue to meals and
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
rooms tax great segue to meals and runs
 
00:31:34.399 --> 00:31:35.830 align:start position:0%
rooms tax great segue to meals and runs
tax

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
so historically the meals in rooms tax
 
00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
is about 80 meals 17 rooms and 3 percent
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
motor vehicles
 
00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:47.600 align:start position:0%
again the chart showing you fiscal year
 
00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
20 revenue where you can see which is in
 
00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
oh it's not colored for you it's the
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
first um line
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
on the left for each month you can see
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
in april may and june
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
the impact from covid initially
 
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
in 21 you can see
 
00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
some impact over the winter and then
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
some recovery in the spring and then 22
 
00:32:15.269 --> 00:32:15.279 align:start position:0%
we are performing fairly well compared
 
00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
to 20. if you do notice that or excuse
 
00:32:21.990 --> 00:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
me compared to 21 you will notice that
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
22 looks like it is performing below 21.
 
00:32:29.669 --> 00:32:29.679 align:start position:0%
that is on a net basis and that's due to
 
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:32.720 align:start position:0%
the municipal revenue fund transfer
 
00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:33.430 align:start position:0%
the municipal revenue fund transfer
so

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
we are now um
 
00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
distributing to municipalities 30
 
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.669 align:start position:0%
distributing to municipalities 30
percent

00:32:39.669 --> 00:32:39.679 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:32:42.149 --> 00:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
of the m revenue that's collected that
 
00:32:44.789 --> 00:32:44.799 align:start position:0%
goes on a monthly basis into a dedicated
 
00:32:44.799 --> 00:32:45.669 align:start position:0%
goes on a monthly basis into a dedicated
fund

00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
so when you
 
00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
under factors to consider we're 54.6
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
million or almost 20 percent ahead of
 
00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:53.430 align:start position:0%
million or almost 20 percent ahead of
plan

00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
but we're 4 million 4.7 million or 1.8
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
percent below prior year and that's
 
00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
because of the impact of the municipal
 
00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.070 align:start position:0%
because of the impact of the municipal
um

00:33:02.070 --> 00:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
revenue fund transfer next year when
 
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.120 align:start position:0%
we're comparing 23 to 22 you'll have an
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
apples-to-apples comparison you'll have
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
two years with the municipal fund
 
00:33:10.399 --> 00:33:12.230 align:start position:0%
two years with the municipal fund
transfer

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:13.110 align:start position:0%
transfer
um

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:13.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
yeah i think we're going to have a
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
little bit of discussion on all these
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
transfers a little later on yep coming
 
00:33:21.509 --> 00:33:21.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
um we are as i mentioned um
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
to representative tucker with her
 
00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:27.679 align:start position:0%
question we're receiving or we're
 
00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
experiencing a bit of return to normal
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
after our initial covet impacts um when
 
00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:34.480 align:start position:0%
things were shut down we've kind of come
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
back to pre-covered levels if not above
 
00:33:39.669 --> 00:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
pre-coded levels
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
inflation and cost of meals
 
00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
will continue to be something that we
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
will watch
 
00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
as well as hiring ability to hire in the
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
sort of hospitality industry it is
 
00:33:54.149 --> 00:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
difficult currently if it gets worse
 
00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
that could also potentially impact
 
00:33:59.669 --> 00:33:59.679 align:start position:0%
the revenue that we receive i know there
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
are some restaurants on main street that
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
aren't open for lunch because they just
 
00:34:04.549 --> 00:34:04.559 align:start position:0%
can't get the people
 
00:34:07.590 --> 00:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
to staff both a lunch and a dinner um so
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
that is something that we'll need to
 
00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.389 align:start position:0%
that is something that we'll need to
watch

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
watch
 
00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
and then as representative abrami
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's two transfers that
 
00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:15.679 align:start position:0%
come out of m r each month first is the
 
00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:17.919 align:start position:0%
school building aid transfer and the
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
second on page six is the municipal
 
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
revenue fund transfer that i mentioned
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
we'll provide details about both of
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
those transfers on the subsequent pages
 
00:34:29.669 --> 00:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
but when we look to estimate m r revenue
 
00:34:31.589 --> 00:34:31.599 align:start position:0%
we add back in the municipal fund
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
transfer and we add back in the school
 
00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
building aid transfer because that is
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
money that we've collected
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
we then apply the growth rate and then
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
subtract out the transfer amounts so
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
we appropriately account for any
 
00:34:45.669 --> 00:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
positive or negative growth on all of
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
the revenue that we've received
 
00:34:50.149 --> 00:34:50.159 align:start position:0%
so where do we think m r is going to end
 
00:34:52.230 --> 00:34:52.240 align:start position:0%
22 um
 
00:34:54.790 --> 00:34:54.800 align:start position:0%
we are assuming that the percent that
 
00:34:57.589 --> 00:34:57.599 align:start position:0%
we've been above plan will remain for
 
00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
the next two months um year to date we
 
00:35:03.829 --> 00:35:03.839 align:start position:0%
are i had a plan by 26.9
 
00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
and we will anticipate that same
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
increase for the next two months
 
00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:10.240 align:start position:0%
generally throughout 20 fiscal year 22
 
00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
we've been roughly 20 to 30 percent
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
ahead of plan um so that 26.9 is right
 
00:35:17.349 --> 00:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
in that range and again this is net of
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
that municipal fund transfer
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
for fiscal for fiscal 23 um we kept the
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
same 5 growth over 22 that we assumed in
 
00:35:29.359 --> 00:35:30.790 align:start position:0%
same 5 growth over 22 that we assumed in
hb1

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:32.880 align:start position:0%
um as i mentioned that's applied to the
 
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
new gross fiscal year 22 growth gross
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
estimate and then we removed seven
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the school building
 
00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:41.560 align:start position:0%
aid transfer
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
120.1 million for the municipal transfer
 
00:35:46.230 --> 00:35:46.240 align:start position:0%
and then there was a surplus statement
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
item um
 
00:35:50.310 --> 00:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
relative to the m rate change of 19
 
00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.589 align:start position:0%
relative to the m rate change of 19
million

00:35:51.589 --> 00:35:51.599 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
that rate change went into effect in
 
00:35:55.829 --> 00:35:55.839 align:start position:0%
october of 20
 
00:35:55.839 --> 00:35:56.950 align:start position:0%
october of 20
october

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
october
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
of fiscal 22 so we didn't have a full
 
00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:02.320 align:start position:0%
year impact yet so we account for the
 
00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
remainder of that input
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
on page seven this is the school
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
building aid transfer
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
basically there's a portion of m r every
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
year that we then divide into every
 
00:36:22.630 --> 00:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
month that is
 
00:36:26.069 --> 00:36:26.079 align:start position:0%
to pay bonds for school building aid and
 
00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
so the amount this started in 2010
 
00:36:29.599 --> 00:36:30.710 align:start position:0%
so the amount this started in 2010
um

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
and the amount has been a high of 14 and
 
00:36:36.390 --> 00:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
a half million in fiscal year 2012.
 
00:36:39.589 --> 00:36:39.599 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 22 it's just under 8.1
 
00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:42.480 align:start position:0%
million and in fiscal 23 it'll be just
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
over 7 million
 
00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.030 align:start position:0%
over 7 million
so

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:45.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
this is a dedicated amount that comes
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
out every month but like i said we
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
include it
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
we add it back in before we apply any
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
growth estimates because it's just a
 
00:36:56.470 --> 00:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
portion of the revenue so this is
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
already netted out though when you see
 
00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.950 --> 00:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
on page eight this is the municipal fund
 
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
transfer this was in hb2 uh the last of
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
so treasury distributes m revenue to
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
cities and towns
 
00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
equal to 30 percent
 
00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh every year
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
but we put revenue into this fund on a
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
monthly basis
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
and so what you can see here in the
 
00:37:27.349 --> 00:37:27.359 align:start position:0%
chart is the monthly amounts that are
 
00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
put in um during fiscal year 22 and the
 
00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
reason why the amount changes each month
 
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:34.880 align:start position:0%
is so that it kind of tracks with how
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
revenue performs each month so if it's a
 
00:37:39.190 --> 00:37:39.200 align:start position:0%
lower revenue month we will put less
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
into the municipal
 
00:37:43.190 --> 00:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
revenue fund
 
00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
and then this amount will update each
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
year based on the revenue received in
 
00:37:49.349 --> 00:37:49.359 align:start position:0%
the prior year because it is 30
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
of the revenue that will go to cities
 
00:37:54.069 --> 00:37:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.870 --> 00:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
if there's no other
 
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:57.990 align:start position:0%
if there's no other
value

00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
value
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
yeah just checking so what you're saying
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the year using the
 
00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
plan which didn't work
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
you decide how much money each month is
 
00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
going to go
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
yes so at the beginning of the year
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
we will know the amount that will go and
 
00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
so we will split it over the course of
 
00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
the months and over the years over the
 
00:38:21.990 --> 00:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
year yep and it'll like i said track
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
with revenues so that we don't take an
 
00:38:27.190 --> 00:38:27.200 align:start position:0%
unequal hit to general fund revenue in a
 
00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
month where revenues are low we'll do a
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
smaller transfer but yeah we determine
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
all that at the beginning suddenly
 
00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
because of for instance the
 
00:38:36.310 --> 00:38:36.320 align:start position:0%
the weather
 
00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.470 align:start position:0%
the weather
on

00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.589 align:start position:0%
on
march

00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
march
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
is a great month it will still be
 
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:45.920 align:start position:0%
be the amount that was shed at the
 
00:38:48.150 --> 00:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
beginning of the year correct
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
correct right we set the amounts at the
 
00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:51.520 align:start position:0%
beginning year we try to track it
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
towards general performance um
 
00:38:57.829 --> 00:38:57.839 align:start position:0%
but it is it won't be adjusted um when
 
00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.349 --> 00:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
and again this is what you see in the
 
00:39:07.109 --> 00:39:07.119 align:start position:0%
revenue focus is net of this transfer
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
can you can you explain one more time uh
 
00:39:11.829 --> 00:39:11.839 align:start position:0%
on the the we we did reduce the rate and
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
do they want to put effect in
 
00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.030 align:start position:0%
do they want to put effect in
january

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
january
 
00:39:17.430 --> 00:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
of 0.5 percent
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
so that shows in the surplus statement
 
00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
is that what i'm reading here yes how
 
00:39:23.670 --> 00:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
does that work again so when you're
 
00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:26.160 align:start position:0%
estimating revenues at the time
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
of the budget you're estimating them
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
based on current law
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
and so because of
 
00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:35.680 align:start position:0%
the rate change we had a surplus
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
statement item in 23. and so we've
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
included that here because even though
 
00:39:45.030 --> 00:39:45.040 align:start position:0%
we're using 22 as our base that
 
00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:46.640 align:start position:0%
rate change impact is not fully
 
00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:48.079 align:start position:0%
accounted for in that year because it
 
00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
happened part way through the year
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
on to the next okay tobacco tax
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
okay so tobacco tax is um not based on
 
00:40:03.589 --> 00:40:03.599 align:start position:0%
or made up of 90
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
of cigarette stamps so that's a stamp
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
that goes on the bottom of each package
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
of cigarettes and then 10 from other
 
00:40:12.550 --> 00:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
tobacco products so that can be
 
00:40:15.670 --> 00:40:15.680 align:start position:0%
your loose tobacco um that also now
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
includes e-cigarettes
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
so again you can see the chart of the
 
00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:27.589 --> 00:40:27.599 align:start position:0%
you may remember that during covid we
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
saw a pretty
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:40:38.390 --> 00:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
i think due to a couple of reasons
 
00:40:41.750 --> 00:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
um one generally the conditions of the
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic early on
 
00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:44.470 align:start position:0%
pandemic early on
were

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
stressful and maybe not the most
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
conducive to folks that were trying to
 
00:40:51.349 --> 00:40:51.359 align:start position:0%
um smoke less
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
also you'll see under factors to
 
00:40:56.309 --> 00:40:56.319 align:start position:0%
consider there is a ban in massachusetts
 
00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
of all flavor tobacco products so we
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
have seen an increase here in new
 
00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.069 align:start position:0%
have seen an increase here in new
hampshire

00:41:02.069 --> 00:41:02.079 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
of mentholated cigarettes in particular
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
as well as other flavored tobacco
 
00:41:08.710 --> 00:41:08.720 align:start position:0%
products as people kind of come across
 
00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:10.480 align:start position:0%
the border from massachusetts to
 
00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
purchase products here that they cannot
 
00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.190 align:start position:0%
purchase products here that they cannot
purchase

00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
00:41:15.430 --> 00:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts
 
00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:18.160 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date we are 5.2 percent
 
00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
below plan um
 
00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:24.400 align:start position:0%
or 10.6 million and we are
 
00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:27.839 align:start position:0%
14 million or 6.8 percent below prior
 
00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:29.510 align:start position:0%
14 million or 6.8 percent below prior
year

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
fiscal year to date through april stamp
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
sales are 7 below
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
but above 20 by 8 percent so what i
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
think is happening is that
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
when we made when we built plan
 
00:41:46.069 --> 00:41:46.079 align:start position:0%
we were anticipating that this
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
kind of high water mark from covid was
 
00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
going to continue
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
and instead we see it tracking back to
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
as representative almirae remember our
 
00:41:57.910 --> 00:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
normal trend of about a three to five
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
percent decrease year over year so we're
 
00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
still ahead of where we were
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic but we are starting to
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
track um that normal decrease that we
 
00:42:10.230 --> 00:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
see in year-over-year
 
00:42:12.790 --> 00:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
reduction in tobacco
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
i just want to comment that's
 
00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.430 align:start position:0%
i just want to comment that's
it's

00:42:15.430 --> 00:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
it's just a coincidence that we're down
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
10.6 million but the tobacco settlement
 
00:42:22.150 --> 00:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
came in 10.8 more we're going to be
 
00:42:24.950 --> 00:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
tobacco is neutral
 
00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:28.150 align:start position:0%
tobacco is neutral
yeah

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm trying i don't remember when
 
00:42:38.870 --> 00:42:38.880 align:start position:0%
they banned the men's up saw
 
00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.829 align:start position:0%
they banned the men's up saw
but

00:42:41.829 --> 00:42:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:46.550 --> 00:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
i think that's about right
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
yeah it was the end of calendar 2020.
 
00:42:53.109 --> 00:42:53.119 align:start position:0%
so we're
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
we're past a full year now i'm wondering
 
00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
if we could look at how much
 
00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
massachusetts is losing
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
in its tobacco tax versus how much we're
 
00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.510 align:start position:0%
in its tobacco tax versus how much we're
losing

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
losing
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
i may have that
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
because they could also be
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
finally getting off of menthol
 
00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.870 align:start position:0%
finally getting off of menthol
cigarettes

00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
cigarettes
 
00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
they yeah and that's going to be my next
 
00:43:19.589 --> 00:43:19.599 align:start position:0%
point so um massachusetts is down about
 
00:43:19.599 --> 00:43:22.069 align:start position:0%
point so um massachusetts is down about
24

00:43:22.069 --> 00:43:22.079 align:start position:0%
24
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
based on data i had back in february
 
00:43:28.470 --> 00:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
um but from from the year that included
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
pre-ban yeah yes
 
00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:32.790 align:start position:0%
pre-ban yeah yes
um

00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:34.790 --> 00:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
but that leads to my next point which is
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
we all might be experiencing
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
this ban if it happens at a federal
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
level so
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
the federal government is considering a
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
national ban on menthol cigarettes and
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
flavored cigars this is on the top of
 
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
page 10. it is expected to be proposed
 
00:43:52.710 --> 00:43:52.720 align:start position:0%
by the fda by the end of this calendar
 
00:43:54.870 --> 00:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
year and that it would have an effective
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
date a year later so we would be looking
 
00:44:00.630 --> 00:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
at january roughly january of 24 as a
 
00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:01.990 align:start position:0%
at january roughly january of 24 as a
potential

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.510 align:start position:0%
potential
um

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:05.349 --> 00:44:05.359 align:start position:0%
start of when
 
00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:07.040 align:start position:0%
mentholated products
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
and flavored products would not be
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
available to anyone so that is something
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
we are going to watch closely because we
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
would need to factor that into
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
our revenue estimates for the next
 
00:44:20.470 --> 00:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
biennium so we have not at this point
 
00:44:23.030 --> 00:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
because it's still it's anticipated but
 
00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
it hasn't been proposed and there's not
 
00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
you know details on timing but that is
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
something that that we'll watch closely
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
so is this going to be through federal
 
00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
legislation or okay yep this is is that
 
00:44:34.870 --> 00:44:34.880 align:start position:0%
in the hopper or is it
 
00:44:39.430 --> 00:44:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
00:44:43.349 --> 00:44:43.359 align:start position:0%
know exactly how close to the top or
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
bottom however works um but it it is
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
suspected that we may have a proposal
 
00:44:53.349 --> 00:44:53.359 align:start position:0%
um by the fda by the end of this
 
00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
calendar year and then it takes about a
 
00:44:56.950 --> 00:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
year from that point once it's been
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
formally proposed by the fda it would be
 
00:45:01.349 --> 00:45:01.359 align:start position:0%
a year before it went into effect yeah
 
00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
that'll be a double whammy for us
 
00:45:05.270 --> 00:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
because we the massachusetts correct
 
00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
correct so we would lose not only our
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
own revenue on mentholated and flavored
 
00:45:11.109 --> 00:45:11.119 align:start position:0%
products but then the increase that
 
00:45:12.630 --> 00:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the past few years from
 
00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:16.950 align:start position:0%
we've seen in the past few years from
massachusetts

00:45:16.950 --> 00:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
yes so it has to go through congress
 
00:45:22.870 --> 00:45:22.880 align:start position:0%
no just fda oh okay yep
 
00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i thought you were saying congress
 
00:45:27.109 --> 00:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
oh no i'm sorry i mean
 
00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:30.160 align:start position:0%
it's not it's just fda just yeah that's
 
00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:32.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding
 
00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
of what it is let's assume there's well
 
00:45:36.230 --> 00:45:36.240 align:start position:0%
in two years if there's an
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
administration change could that turn
 
00:45:37.839 --> 00:45:38.630 align:start position:0%
administration change could that turn
back

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:38.640 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.349 align:start position:0%
back
yeah

00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:45:39.359 --> 00:45:40.390 align:start position:0%
yeah
correct

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
oh rip is in line
 
00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
so two things effectively on the
 
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
flavored ban was june 1st of 2020
 
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:51.750 align:start position:0%
flavored ban was june 1st of 2020
and

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:53.670 --> 00:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
this also looks like let two bills in
 
00:45:55.349 --> 00:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
massachusetts illustration to repeal
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
that ban
 
00:45:59.109 --> 00:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
and take and allow flavor tobacco again
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
you know do you i always have to either
 
00:46:04.870 --> 00:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.309 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't say just so that there's two
 
00:46:07.839 --> 00:46:08.790 align:start position:0%
doesn't say just so that there's two
bills

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
bills
 
00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:12.079 align:start position:0%
to repeal the uh 2018
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
um tobacco got it i i always ask you
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
that question is is that what's going on
 
00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
in mass and
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
i decided not to ask that question this
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
time because i assumed nothing but
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
that was good
 
00:46:25.829 --> 00:46:25.839 align:start position:0%
represent tucker
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
there is no attraction in massachusetts
 
00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:30.400 align:start position:0%
okay but i think it's important to
 
00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
mention that the reason that ventilated
 
00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh and flavored uh cigarettes are being
 
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
considered for repeal is that
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
it has been
 
00:46:40.839 --> 00:46:42.390 align:start position:0%
it has been
a

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
policy of tobacco companies
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
to target
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
black neighborhoods and there's a very
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
much higher
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
use of these cigarettes with the
 
00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.030 align:start position:0%
use of these cigarettes with the
resultant

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
resultant
 
00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:57.109 align:start position:0%
resultant
health

00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:46:57.119 --> 00:46:58.630 align:start position:0%
health
consequences

00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
consequences
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
and earlier deaths are shown in the
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
mortality figures so this is a very
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
this isn't really a revenue
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
issue alone this has to do with general
 
00:47:11.599 --> 00:47:12.710 align:start position:0%
issue alone this has to do with general
health

00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:15.760 align:start position:0%
of people in the united states and
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
whether they're in our neighboring state
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
or whether they're in this state
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
we need to hope that more people will
 
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
not smoke
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
it has
 
00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.750 align:start position:0%
it has
very

00:47:25.750 --> 00:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:47:28.549 --> 00:47:28.559 align:start position:0%
bad effects on the human body and it
 
00:47:31.270 --> 00:47:31.280 align:start position:0%
costs a great deal of money and that is
 
00:47:32.950 --> 00:47:32.960 align:start position:0%
why we get the money
 
00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
is because there's costs
 
00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.030 align:start position:0%
is because there's costs
to

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:38.480 align:start position:0%
treating people
 
00:47:42.549 --> 00:47:42.559 align:start position:0%
who are affected by tobacco use
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
and we've mentioned before too
 
00:47:45.359 --> 00:47:46.390 align:start position:0%
and we've mentioned before too
we

00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
the majority of the cigarettes that we
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
sell in this state are not consumed by
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
people in this state we have the lowest
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
tax rate of the neighboring of all of
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
our surrounding states um and so we are
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
a large exporter of of cigarettes um
 
00:48:07.109 --> 00:48:07.119 align:start position:0%
so we'll certainly watch um what a
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
if and when a federal ban may come into
 
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:10.710 align:start position:0%
if and when a federal ban may come into
effect

00:48:10.710 --> 00:48:10.720 align:start position:0%
effect
 
00:48:14.790 --> 00:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
but these amounts are assuming no ban
 
00:48:17.430 --> 00:48:17.440 align:start position:0%
so for fiscal year 22
 
00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.470 align:start position:0%
so for fiscal year 22
we

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
are assuming that the um negative 5.2
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
percent that we've experienced year to
 
00:48:25.589 --> 00:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
date compared to plan will continue for
 
00:48:26.950 --> 00:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
may and june
 
00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
and then for fiscal year 23 we apply to
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
negative 3 growth again that is the
 
00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
original growth rate from
 
00:48:35.839 --> 00:48:37.349 align:start position:0%
original growth rate from
hb1

00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:37.359 align:start position:0%
hb1
 
00:48:37.359 --> 00:48:38.390 align:start position:0%
hb1
so

00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
the reason why it's not the five percent
 
00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
is i do think we're kind of normalizing
 
00:48:43.589 --> 00:48:43.599 align:start position:0%
a little bit which is why we're seeing
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
that significant decrease i don't think
 
00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's necessarily going to decrease
 
00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
another five percent but it will kind of
 
00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
temper and go back to that three percent
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
that we typically see year to year
 
00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
um and that's generally like i said what
 
00:48:59.589 --> 00:48:59.599 align:start position:0%
we saw before covid okay
 
00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:04.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:06.549 --> 00:49:06.559 align:start position:0%
next is interest and dividends tax um
 
00:49:08.069 --> 00:49:08.079 align:start position:0%
interest and dividends is made up of
 
00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
41.5 from distributions
 
00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.390 align:start position:0%
41.5 from distributions
39

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:12.400 align:start position:0%
39
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
from dividend income
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
two percent from interest income and
 
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
seven point three four percent from
 
00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:21.440 align:start position:0%
federally tax-exempt income so that's
 
00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
income that's exempt federally but not
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
exempt here in new hampshire
 
00:49:27.750 --> 00:49:27.760 align:start position:0%
um you'll see in the chart interest and
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
dividends on the majority of our revenue
 
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:32.079 align:start position:0%
comes in in april
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
um so through april uh year to date we
 
00:49:39.190 --> 00:49:39.200 align:start position:0%
are 19.6 or 16.9 percent ahead of plan
 
00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
and 24.4 million or 22 percent ahead of
 
00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
prior year
 
00:49:46.470 --> 00:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
ind can fluctuate pretty significantly
 
00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
year to year it's a volatile tax um
 
00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of things that make up how
 
00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
the tax performs as i mentioned it's not
 
00:49:57.190 --> 00:49:57.200 align:start position:0%
just interest in dividends distributions
 
00:49:59.270 --> 00:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
are a significant portion of the revenue
 
00:50:00.790 --> 00:50:00.800 align:start position:0%
and as representative almy mentioned
 
00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:04.160 align:start position:0%
earlier if businesses choose to issue
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
higher amounts of distributions than
 
00:50:07.750 --> 00:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
they have historically that would have a
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
positive impact here on ind
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
obviously we are watching interest rates
 
00:50:15.829 --> 00:50:15.839 align:start position:0%
we're watching the fluctuations um in
 
00:50:18.150 --> 00:50:18.160 align:start position:0%
the stock market as those tend to be
 
00:50:21.270 --> 00:50:21.280 align:start position:0%
indicators maybe not uh direct
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
tracking of but tend to be indicators of
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
how ind performs
 
00:50:29.109 --> 00:50:29.119 align:start position:0%
on page 12 just a reminder the ind tax
 
00:50:32.390 --> 00:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
is set to be repealed so we are going
 
00:50:36.069 --> 00:50:36.079 align:start position:0%
through a number of rate reductions that
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
is starting with a one percent reduction
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
to four percent for taxable periods
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
ending on or after december 31st of 23
 
00:50:45.670 --> 00:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
you see that that goes to three percent
 
00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
for 24 2 for 25 1 for 26 and then it's
 
00:50:52.390 --> 00:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
fully repealed for taxable periods
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
beginning after december 31st of 2026.
 
00:50:59.910 --> 00:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
so we are in a decline of ind
 
00:50:59.920 --> 00:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
so we are in a decline of ind
um

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:00.250 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:00.250 --> 00:51:02.710 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.990 align:start position:0%
[Music]
yeah

00:51:03.990 --> 00:51:04.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
45 41.5 percent distribution in 2020
 
00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
when things were not so good
 
00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:12.790 align:start position:0%
when things were not so good
on

00:51:12.790 --> 00:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
and what i was just talking about that
 
00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
that on
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
they say that
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
over i think it was 54
 
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:25.109 align:start position:0%
over i think it was 54
of

00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:51:28.309 --> 00:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
the net profits had gone to the owners
 
00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:29.920 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:33.750 align:start position:0%
last year
um

00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
no distribution would go to anybody that
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
was earning
 
00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:39.510 align:start position:0%
was earning
under

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
under
 
00:51:42.630 --> 00:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
50 000 a year
 
00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.150 align:start position:0%
50 000 a year
this

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:45.190 align:start position:0%
this
on

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
so that part of this is only a tax on
 
00:51:54.069 --> 00:51:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:57.440 align:start position:0%
and dividend income is partially
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
interested partially
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
so and that's a good point as you know
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
things change potentially with
 
00:52:06.309 --> 00:52:06.319 align:start position:0%
distributions as things change with the
 
00:52:08.470 --> 00:52:08.480 align:start position:0%
interest rate um as things change with
 
00:52:09.750 --> 00:52:09.760 align:start position:0%
the stock market and potentially
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
dividends received from there this
 
00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
breakdown of what makes up ind
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
can shift from year to year and as we
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
get into more revenue estimating into
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
the fall we can talk about how that has
 
00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:22.160 align:start position:0%
kind of shift
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
how that makeup has changed over time
 
00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:26.480 align:start position:0%
and we may want to consider looking at
 
00:52:27.990 --> 00:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
that as we're developing revenue
 
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.190 align:start position:0%
that as we're developing revenue
estimates

00:52:31.190 --> 00:52:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:34.720 align:start position:0%
um for fiscal year 22 we are assuming
 
00:52:37.510 --> 00:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
that our percent versus plan
 
00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
will remain
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
through the last two months of may and
 
00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:43.520 align:start position:0%
june we did have some anomalous payments
 
00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.280 align:start position:0%
that we've received year-to-date so
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
we've removed those so that we don't
 
00:52:49.349 --> 00:52:49.359 align:start position:0%
artificially inflate the growth rate so
 
00:52:51.190 --> 00:52:51.200 align:start position:0%
without the anomalous payments that
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
we've received we're only about 1.1
 
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:55.680 align:start position:0%
percent ahead of plan um so that's what
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
we're anticipating for may and june
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
and then for 23 we assumed the same 3
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
growth rate that was in the original hb1
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
applied to the new revenue estimate for
 
00:53:14.549 --> 00:53:14.559 align:start position:0%
22 and then removed the impact of the um
 
00:53:16.870 --> 00:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
surplus statement items for the decrease
 
00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
in the ind tax which will start to phase
 
00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:20.240 align:start position:0%
out and we will start to feel the
 
00:53:25.990 --> 00:53:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
so again another tax to keep your eye on
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
as the um things going on in the market
 
00:53:33.589 --> 00:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
and in the economy could potentially um
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
have an impact here
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
okay i got it
 
00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
i want one comment our question have you
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
looked at you know 401ks were a
 
00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
phenomenon that started somewhere my
 
00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.470 align:start position:0%
phenomenon that started somewhere my
mid-career

00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
mid-career
 
00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:49.670 align:start position:0%
mid-career
um

00:53:49.670 --> 00:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:52.950 --> 00:53:52.960 align:start position:0%
now i'm i have to take distributions
 
00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:53.750 align:start position:0%
now i'm i have to take distributions
right

00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
and they're taxable right that's delayed
 
00:53:58.549 --> 00:53:58.559 align:start position:0%
taxing on their 401 concept
 
00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:01.200 align:start position:0%
but i as that as the population ages
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot more of that
 
00:54:04.790 --> 00:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
going on that people are going to do i
 
00:54:06.069 --> 00:54:06.079 align:start position:0%
know when i
 
00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:08.640 align:start position:0%
put my ind i have taken to a fact that i
 
00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
got a distribution
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's taxable
 
00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.270 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's taxable
um

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
so i just throw that out
 
00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
i we haven't tried to quantify that
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
specifically but that's certainly
 
00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
something we're probably going to see in
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
a trend and we'll see if we look at the
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
breakdown of ind based on the various
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
factors from year to year and to your
 
00:54:32.710 --> 00:54:32.720 align:start position:0%
point you might see a greater shift
 
00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
towards distributions when the economy
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
is doing well with an aging population
 
00:54:38.069 --> 00:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
there could be a number of things that
 
00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:40.400 align:start position:0%
potentially impact
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
that makeup of that pie of ind revenue
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
and they they raised the year uh they
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
gave a year
 
00:54:51.349 --> 00:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
more before you have to take that
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
distribution and i would think that that
 
00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:54.950 align:start position:0%
distribution and i would think that that
likely

00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
likely
 
00:54:58.069 --> 00:54:58.079 align:start position:0%
will happen again this is a very popular
 
00:54:58.079 --> 00:55:00.470 align:start position:0%
will happen again this is a very popular
um

00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:03.589 --> 00:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
thing to do for people who have money
 
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:06.880 align:start position:0%
and so very quietly they've added a year
 
00:55:09.109 --> 00:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
so you have to be 71 and a half now
 
00:55:11.349 --> 00:55:11.359 align:start position:0%
rather than 70 and a half to start
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
taking minimum
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
distribution right
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
yeah correct and so that i think looking
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's something some are still taking
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
like i i took it anyway i d but anyway
 
00:55:21.359 --> 00:55:22.069 align:start position:0%
like i i took it anyway i d but anyway
but

00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:24.309 --> 00:55:24.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just me but
 
00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
with bursting i just they're required to
 
00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.789 align:start position:0%
with bursting i just they're required to
talk

00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:28.799 align:start position:0%
talk
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
yeah they're required right it's
 
00:55:32.789 --> 00:55:32.799 align:start position:0%
required yeah part
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
right and there was a little they they
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
put a hold on that
 
00:55:36.079 --> 00:55:37.030 align:start position:0%
put a hold on that
right

00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
now there's more than wealthy wealthy
 
00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:53.839 align:start position:0%
people who are
 
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:55.589 align:start position:0%
i mean
has

00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
i mean defined benefit plans are have
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
been reduced significantly i think not
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
many employees have defined benefit
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
plans anymore
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
they're pretty much 401 to find
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
contribution plans these days
 
00:56:09.829 --> 00:56:09.839 align:start position:0%
and i think and that that includes all
 
00:56:12.630 --> 00:56:12.640 align:start position:0%
levels of people salaries people so
 
00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:16.069 align:start position:0%
levels of people salaries people so
anyway

00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
or they might not get them right
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
with companies that do offer
 
00:56:23.349 --> 00:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
pension plans
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
um that's the case
 
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
okay moving on to communication services
 
00:56:31.599 --> 00:56:34.309 align:start position:0%
okay moving on to communication services
tax

00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
so at the chart at the top of the page
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
you'll notice
 
00:56:37.839 --> 00:56:38.789 align:start position:0%
you'll notice
um

00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:43.030 --> 00:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:45.119 align:start position:0%
in revenue that's a bit of a timing
 
00:56:47.510 --> 00:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
issue it's an anomaly um so just wanted
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
to point point that out because it's
 
00:56:52.630 --> 00:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
somewhat obvious um for fiscal year 21.
 
00:56:56.150 --> 00:56:56.160 align:start position:0%
so factors to consider with cst so we
 
00:56:59.270 --> 00:56:59.280 align:start position:0%
are 7.1 million or 22 percent below plan
 
00:57:03.910 --> 00:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
8.1 million or 24.3 below prior year
 
00:57:05.750 --> 00:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
this tax has
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
he has had years of fluctuation then we
 
00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:09.200 align:start position:0%
had some time it was performing pretty
 
00:57:11.109 --> 00:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
consistently now we're getting into some
 
00:57:13.589 --> 00:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
bit of fluctuation so
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
some things that have happened recently
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
that impact this tax the taxability of
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
video conferencing and the increased use
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
of that product
 
00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:21.510 align:start position:0%
of that product
over

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
over
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
um the pandemic we've seen increased use
 
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:25.760 align:start position:0%
of video conferencing so that kind of
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
has a positive impact on
 
00:57:28.319 --> 00:57:29.670 align:start position:0%
has a positive impact on
cst

00:57:29.670 --> 00:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
cst
 
00:57:33.589 --> 00:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
the ongoing reduction in landlines
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
we've mentioned that for years so that
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
has a negative effect on cst
 
00:57:40.230 --> 00:57:40.240 align:start position:0%
we've talked about how you know
 
00:57:42.870 --> 00:57:42.880 align:start position:0%
landlines have reduced but we had seen a
 
00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:45.280 align:start position:0%
shift to wireless right so in my
 
00:57:47.349 --> 00:57:47.359 align:start position:0%
household we don't have a landline but
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
my husband and i both have cell phones
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
so you kind of trade two for one um
 
00:57:55.030 --> 00:57:55.040 align:start position:0%
the wireless market is
 
00:57:57.270 --> 00:57:57.280 align:start position:0%
getting a bit more saturated we're not
 
00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.390 align:start position:0%
getting a bit more saturated we're not
seeing

00:57:58.390 --> 00:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
seeing
 
00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:01.359 align:start position:0%
that you know significant increase
 
00:58:01.359 --> 00:58:02.150 align:start position:0%
that you know significant increase
in

00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
the wireless market that we had seen in
 
00:58:06.710 --> 00:58:06.720 align:start position:0%
the past right so for a number of years
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
more and more people were getting cell
 
00:58:08.559 --> 00:58:09.589 align:start position:0%
more and more people were getting cell
phones

00:58:09.589 --> 00:58:09.599 align:start position:0%
phones
 
00:58:11.589 --> 00:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
now most grown adults have a cell phone
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
or if they don't maybe they're not going
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
to get one and it's really just
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
the kids the younger
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
kids kind of coming on
 
00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.230 align:start position:0%
kids kind of coming on
um

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:20.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:22.710 --> 00:58:22.720 align:start position:0%
with cell phones and so maybe as people
 
00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
are tapering off and younger kids are
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
coming on it's not having that same
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
growth that we kind of saw for years
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
with wireless
 
00:58:35.190 --> 00:58:35.200 align:start position:0%
um the other thing to note
 
00:58:36.630 --> 00:58:36.640 align:start position:0%
that i think is what's happening at
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
least somewhat recently which is
 
00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.190 align:start position:0%
least somewhat recently which is
potentially

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:40.710 align:start position:0%
impacting our
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:41.829 align:start position:0%
impacting our
[Music]

00:58:41.829 --> 00:58:41.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
decrease in cst revenue is that wireless
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
service providers
 
00:58:48.549 --> 00:58:48.559 align:start position:0%
and how they bifurcate the amount that
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
they charge you for voice versus the
 
00:58:53.990 --> 00:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
amount that they charge you for data
 
00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:54.789 align:start position:0%
amount that they charge you for data
so

00:58:54.789 --> 00:58:54.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:56.950 --> 00:58:56.960 align:start position:0%
voice is the only thing that's taxable
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
under cst
 
00:59:02.390 --> 00:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
your data on your wireless bill is not
 
00:59:05.109 --> 00:59:05.119 align:start position:0%
we did tax internet access years ago we
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
do not um under cst anymore
 
00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:09.589 align:start position:0%
do not um under cst anymore
so

00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
as wireless providers kind of change
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
how that that split between voice and
 
00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
data is accounted for on customers bills
 
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:21.920 align:start position:0%
that can have an impact on the amount of
 
00:59:24.309 --> 00:59:24.319 align:start position:0%
cst that we receive
 
00:59:26.950 --> 00:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
i for one don't talk on my cell phone
 
00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:28.720 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of either texts or using it
 
00:59:33.750 --> 00:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
for email um and so i think you know in
 
00:59:35.349 --> 00:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
particular if my wireless provider
 
00:59:37.270 --> 00:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
looked at how much i was actually using
 
00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
it for two-way communication for voice
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
it would be much less than what i'm
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
using it for other types of
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
communication so i i think the the shift
 
00:59:49.349 --> 00:59:49.359 align:start position:0%
in how customers are being billed by
 
00:59:51.430 --> 00:59:51.440 align:start position:0%
their wireless providers is starting to
 
00:59:53.030 --> 00:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
impact the amount of cst that we're
 
00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:56.069 align:start position:0%
impact the amount of cst that we're
collecting

00:59:56.069 --> 00:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:58.950 --> 00:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
yeah i do talk on my cell phone a lot
 
01:00:01.589 --> 01:00:01.599 align:start position:0%
i'm paying less in tax
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
than i did when i had a landline only
 
01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:05.990 align:start position:0%
than i did when i had a landline only
and

01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh but i'm wondering about
 
01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
are you
 
01:00:13.349 --> 01:00:13.359 align:start position:0%
collecting for video conferencing
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
we are um and that is as that kind of i
 
01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
think we've talked about this before as
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
that um
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
method of communication
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh became more prevalent um we have
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
audit programs related to that and so
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
we're making sure um that we are
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
collecting um the tax that's due on
 
01:00:36.549 --> 01:00:36.559 align:start position:0%
those services
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
so and
 
01:00:39.829 --> 01:00:39.839 align:start position:0%
on what basis
 
01:00:41.510 --> 01:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:00:44.470 --> 01:00:44.480 align:start position:0%
there are the people that get licenses
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
so that they can run zone conferences
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
and then there are people who just use
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
them that if i remember correctly don't
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
pay anything
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
right so the tax is on what you pay um
 
01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's a portion of
 
01:00:58.309 --> 01:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
what you pay so
 
01:00:58.319 --> 01:00:59.190 align:start position:0%
what you pay so
free

01:00:59.190 --> 01:00:59.200 align:start position:0%
free
 
01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
products may not have a tax associated
 
01:01:03.190 --> 01:01:03.200 align:start position:0%
with it because it needs we need to
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
apply the tax rate to some sort of base
 
01:01:08.390 --> 01:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
but again that is another thing that may
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
fluctuate over time
 
01:01:13.030 --> 01:01:13.040 align:start position:0%
i think there was a lot of free options
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
available early in the pandemic when
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
folks were starting to use this product
 
01:01:18.309 --> 01:01:18.319 align:start position:0%
and now folks have realized it is a very
 
01:01:19.829 --> 01:01:19.839 align:start position:0%
valuable product and maybe they are
 
01:01:22.069 --> 01:01:22.079 align:start position:0%
willing to pay for it and so we may see
 
01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
that shift occur as well so it's it's
 
01:01:25.829 --> 01:01:25.839 align:start position:0%
just something else that we will need to
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
continue to monitor um with respect to
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
this test
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
we taxed the license
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
to the extent that it's two-way
 
01:01:35.349 --> 01:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
communication that's taxable under cst
 
01:01:35.359 --> 01:01:36.390 align:start position:0%
communication that's taxable under cst
correct

01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
so you outreach to all these different
 
01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:40.640 align:start position:0%
companies we have our ways of
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
consciousness oh i can imagine
 
01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.630 align:start position:0%
consciousness oh i can imagine
okay

01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
yeah if if i could
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
i've got a license i don't know why i
 
01:01:50.789 --> 01:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
have a license i'm thinking that i may
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
have to run a meeting at some point
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
but on i get charged a flat 150 a year
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
they don't say anything about taxes
 
01:02:04.069 --> 01:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
so i can't comment on specific products
 
01:02:06.549 --> 01:02:06.559 align:start position:0%
or specific vendors but it it is
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
something that we are consider when we
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
are reviewing um the various products
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
that are available on the market well
 
01:02:14.789 --> 01:02:14.799 align:start position:0%
they they may the company may choose to
 
01:02:17.109 --> 01:02:17.119 align:start position:0%
absorb that right and not show it to the
 
01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:20.640 align:start position:0%
potentially correct yeah thank you
 
01:02:23.109 --> 01:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
so with cst we are assuming for the rest
 
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
of this year that our performance
 
01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:27.680 align:start position:0%
against plan will be sustained and then
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
um we're assuming
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
that 22 to 23 will be relatively flat we
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
do have um some credit carryovers that
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
are being utilized and so we've taken
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
those into account um
 
01:02:43.750 --> 01:02:43.760 align:start position:0%
in our 23 estimates but my suspicion is
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
that you know hopefully this this tax is
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
kind of kind of level out
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:56.309 --> 01:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
page 15 real estate transfer tax
 
01:02:59.029 --> 01:02:59.039 align:start position:0%
oh boy okay um so
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
the first thing i would point out is on
 
01:03:04.069 --> 01:03:04.079 align:start position:0%
the chart at the top
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 plan is going to be
 
01:03:10.230 --> 01:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
the line furthest to the right in each
 
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
of the months
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
if you look at that
 
01:03:16.950 --> 01:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
you will see that we anticipated
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
a decrease
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
um to occur if you look at february
 
01:03:22.230 --> 01:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
march april
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
we really kind of anticipated a low
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
point in march
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
we just haven't seen it um plan this
 
01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:30.799 align:start position:0%
year anticipated a three percent
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
year-over-year reduction over prior year
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
we back-loaded that three percent into
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
the plan figuring that the year would
 
01:03:39.029 --> 01:03:39.039 align:start position:0%
start strong but once the winter months
 
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
hit we would start to see that decrease
 
01:03:43.670 --> 01:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
in rent that we anticipated
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
obviously that didn't happen um so
 
01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
we are 31.1 million or 19 ahead of plan
 
01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:57.680 align:start position:0%
we are 26.9 million or 16 ahead of prior
 
01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:58.390 align:start position:0%
we are 26.9 million or 16 ahead of prior
year

01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
again these amounts are net of the five
 
01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
million dollar transfer to the
 
01:04:04.950 --> 01:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund that is a new
 
01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.150 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund that is a new
transfer

01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
two years ago
 
01:04:09.829 --> 01:04:09.839 align:start position:0%
that happens every october in october we
 
01:04:11.109 --> 01:04:11.119 align:start position:0%
send five million dollars to the
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
affordable housing fund
 
01:04:16.309 --> 01:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
things that are impacting rent so
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
inventory shortage we know all know that
 
01:04:21.670 --> 01:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
that exists but prices are still making
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
up for that reduction of inventory so
 
01:04:25.829 --> 01:04:25.839 align:start position:0%
we're seeing fewer transactions but
 
01:04:28.230 --> 01:04:28.240 align:start position:0%
they're happening at a much higher price
 
01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:29.109 align:start position:0%
they're happening at a much higher price
so

01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:31.270 --> 01:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax continues
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association of realtors
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
reported that last month's supply of
 
01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
inventory was an 11 decrease from last
 
01:04:40.319 --> 01:04:41.349 align:start position:0%
inventory was an 11 decrease from last
year

01:04:41.349 --> 01:04:41.359 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
i would have thought last year was a
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
pretty low month into you know low time
 
01:04:47.910 --> 01:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of real estate inventory this
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
is even lower
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
um the same group publishes a new
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire housing affordability index
 
01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
i'm on the top of page 16
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
which measures housing affordability for
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
the region so as an example of index of
 
01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:05.119 align:start position:0%
120 means that household income is 120
 
01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
of what is necessary to qualify for a
 
01:05:09.190 --> 01:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
median priced home
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
under the prevailing interest rates
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
march 2020
 
01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
at an affordability index of 80 had the
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
lowest month in the last year on the
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
affordability index for single family
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
homes so basically median income is not
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
enough money you're not making enough
 
01:05:27.839 --> 01:05:28.789 align:start position:0%
enough money you're not making enough
money

01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:05:28.799 --> 01:05:29.670 align:start position:0%
money
to

01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:30.950 align:start position:0%
to
qualify

01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
qualify
 
01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:31.829 align:start position:0%
qualify
for

01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:05:33.670 --> 01:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
a median price home at the current
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
interest rates
 
01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
but houses continue to sell um so
 
01:05:41.349 --> 01:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
i think this is just
 
01:05:41.359 --> 01:05:42.150 align:start position:0%
i think this is just
it's

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.160 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:05:44.069 --> 01:05:44.079 align:start position:0%
a bit of a ticking time bomb i don't
 
01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
think it's necessarily going to explode
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
but at some point we're going to see a
 
01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
decrease we're just the the prices um
 
01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:52.960 align:start position:0%
people are not going to be able to
 
01:05:56.470 --> 01:05:56.480 align:start position:0%
afford them and so the lack of inventory
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
in the higher prices are not going to
 
01:06:05.029 --> 01:06:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:07.039 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i misspoke
 
01:06:07.039 --> 01:06:09.109 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i misspoke
yeah

01:06:09.109 --> 01:06:09.119 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
any other questions that just might
 
01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
yeah and the realtors keep on saying
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
that it's a fairly very small percentage
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
of the people that are buying these
 
01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
incredibly expensive houses
 
01:06:27.910 --> 01:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
on that come from out of state
 
01:06:30.390 --> 01:06:30.400 align:start position:0%
but there's been some uh
 
01:06:32.470 --> 01:06:32.480 align:start position:0%
controversy about
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
on whether they really are from out of
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
state but had been vacationing here or
 
01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:38.720 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.230 align:start position:0%
something like that
uh

01:06:40.230 --> 01:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.589 align:start position:0%
uh
so

01:06:41.589 --> 01:06:41.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
do you i think that the new hampshire
 
01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.589 align:start position:0%
do you i think that the new hampshire
finance

01:06:45.589 --> 01:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
finance
 
01:06:47.510 --> 01:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
housing finance authority has been
 
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to look at this do you
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
know whether there's anything because
 
01:06:57.990 --> 01:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
that on
 
01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire given the climate in the
 
01:07:03.990 --> 01:07:04.000 align:start position:0%
west for instance
 
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
is apparently one of the targets for
 
01:07:08.950 --> 01:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
very rich people trying to move
 
01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:09.970 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
01:07:09.970 --> 01:07:12.829 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
[Music]

01:07:12.829 --> 01:07:12.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
and has been for some time for some of
 
01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
them just for tax purposes
 
01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:18.950 align:start position:0%
them just for tax purposes
and

01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:07:21.510 --> 01:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
have you
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
kept up with
 
01:07:25.990 --> 01:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
what they're doing on trying to figure
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
this out i have not um
 
01:07:32.069 --> 01:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
i imagine that
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
that is probably different for the
 
01:07:36.630 --> 01:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
various regions across the state
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
um obviously there are some locations
 
01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:40.549 align:start position:0%
um obviously there are some locations
either

01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
either
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know closer to massachusetts it's
 
01:07:44.069 --> 01:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
easier for someone to massachusetts to
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
move across the border you also have
 
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
vacation areas of the state like the
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
lakes region which might be more
 
01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
conducive or more
 
01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:53.440 align:start position:0%
likely to have someone move from out of
 
01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:56.000 align:start position:0%
state but that might not be the same for
 
01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
the north country for instance it might
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
be less likely in representative
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
tucker's district for someone to move
 
01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:04.079 align:start position:0%
from out of state so i think it may vary
 
01:08:04.079 --> 01:08:05.029 align:start position:0%
from out of state so i think it may vary
um

01:08:05.029 --> 01:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:06.789 --> 01:08:06.799 align:start position:0%
you know we're just tracking kind of
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
what's been happening with the
 
01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:10.160 align:start position:0%
purchasing of the homes and the tax
 
01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
associated with it and haven't
 
01:08:13.910 --> 01:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily looked into as much as who's
 
01:08:15.510 --> 01:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
buying them or why they're buying them
 
01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.030 align:start position:0%
buying them or why they're buying them
necessarily

01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
um the median sales price was up 20 and
 
01:08:23.349 --> 01:08:23.359 align:start position:0%
a half percent to 440 000 for a single
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
family home
 
01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
and up 30.9 to 350 and a half thousand
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
for condos in march of 22. so
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
the median home price and condo price is
 
01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
quite high
 
01:08:38.789 --> 01:08:38.799 align:start position:0%
for new hampshire based on our history
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
um another factor to consider is that
 
01:08:44.070 --> 01:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
morgan mortgage rates are rising
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
they were five and a half percent for a
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
30-year fixed on may 4th
 
01:08:50.309 --> 01:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
and that was above the 52 week low of
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
2.8 percent so with interest rates
 
01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
they're rising quite quickly
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
at some of the highest mortgage rates
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
we've seen in quite a while
 
01:09:01.349 --> 01:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
um so we'll have to wait and see i think
 
01:09:03.669 --> 01:09:03.679 align:start position:0%
on the impact of what the mortgage rates
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
have on the housing market um presumably
 
01:09:08.789 --> 01:09:08.799 align:start position:0%
there will be one um but i think we're
 
01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
gonna have to wait a little bit to see
 
01:09:13.349 --> 01:09:13.359 align:start position:0%
how that pans out
 
01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
so for fiscal year 22 we are assuming
 
01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359 align:start position:0%
that we our performance versus prior
 
01:09:21.430 --> 01:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
year through april will continue for may
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
and june as i mentioned we had kind of
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
back loaded a decrease in the plan so i
 
01:09:28.789 --> 01:09:28.799 align:start position:0%
didn't want to use our comparison to
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
plan numbers because those might have
 
01:09:33.030 --> 01:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
been artificially inflated due to how we
 
01:09:35.189 --> 01:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
set the monthly revenue plan so instead
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
we're just looking at how we're
 
01:09:39.430 --> 01:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
performing versus prior year for 22
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
and then for 23 we assumed a negative
 
01:09:43.669 --> 01:09:43.679 align:start position:0%
three percent growth
 
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
that was the original
 
01:09:47.590 --> 01:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
impact that we thought we were going to
 
01:09:49.030 --> 01:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
see this year
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
since we didn't see that this year we
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
just bumped it out a year maybe we'll
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
see it next year we got to see it one of
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
these days so just bumped it out of here
 
01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.270 align:start position:0%
these days so just bumped it out of here
um

01:09:59.270 --> 01:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
but fiscal year 23 plan had assumed an 8
 
01:10:06.149 --> 01:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
decrease over fiscal 22.
 
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
so that's why and that chart at the top
 
01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
when you look at the revised 23 estimate
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
of 228 million that looks like 25.3
 
01:10:17.510 --> 01:10:17.520 align:start position:0%
percent ahead of plan
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
that's because that plan is a negative
 
01:10:21.830 --> 01:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
three percent with a negative eight
 
01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
percent on top of it we never even saw
 
01:10:26.709 --> 01:10:26.719 align:start position:0%
the negative three percent never mind
 
01:10:28.470 --> 01:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
the negative eight so that's why that's
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
looking like plan is very or our
 
01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
estimate is very high compared to plan
 
01:10:33.199 --> 01:10:34.149 align:start position:0%
estimate is very high compared to plan
so

01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
my best thought at this point is just
 
01:10:38.390 --> 01:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
move that three percent to the next year
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
and then we might be the eight percent
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
the year after um because we're just in
 
01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:43.760 align:start position:0%
record territory for the real estate
 
01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
transfer tax representative tucker well
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
certainly in the north country and i
 
01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:50.480 align:start position:0%
think in the rest of the state
 
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
we've had a tremendous uh
 
01:10:54.870 --> 01:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
a number of people who are able to work
 
01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:56.070 align:start position:0%
a number of people who are able to work
remotely

01:10:56.070 --> 01:10:56.080 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
01:10:58.950 --> 01:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
so there's a relationship i believe
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
between broadband and its expansion
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
which is being heavily promoted
 
01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.590 align:start position:0%
which is being heavily promoted
and

01:11:05.590 --> 01:11:05.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
and where people can live
 
01:11:09.750 --> 01:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
and it's made an enormous difference in
 
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:11.840 align:start position:0%
the north country we have some areas
 
01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
that have very good connection others
 
01:11:16.709 --> 01:11:16.719 align:start position:0%
that don't but where people can work
 
01:11:16.719 --> 01:11:17.830 align:start position:0%
that don't but where people can work
remotely

01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
remotely
 
01:11:20.470 --> 01:11:20.480 align:start position:0%
many are and it has really affected the
 
01:11:23.110 --> 01:11:23.120 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax that's a great
 
01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
very connected yes agreed agreed and i
 
01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
you know it sounds like remote work is
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
here to stay um
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
at least at some level
 
01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:33.590 align:start position:0%
at least at some level
um

01:11:33.590 --> 01:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
so i think that is something to continue
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
to watch as more and more people are
 
01:11:41.030 --> 01:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
able to work remotely that might be a
 
01:11:42.870 --> 01:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
driver for people from other states to
 
01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:44.550 align:start position:0%
driver for people from other states to
come

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
the last thing i will mention on
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
the real estate transfer tax is the land
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
and community heritage investment
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
program or l-chip
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
so l-chip is a 25 fee that's charged for
 
01:12:02.390 --> 01:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
the recording of each deed mortgage
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
mortgage discharge or plan that are
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
recorded at the registry
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
l-chip funds are paid to the counties
 
01:12:10.149 --> 01:12:10.159 align:start position:0%
along with the ret each month and then
 
01:12:12.310 --> 01:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
transfer to the l-chip program
 
01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
so it is
 
01:12:15.430 --> 01:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
unlike the other transfers that we
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
talked about
 
01:12:16.719 --> 01:12:17.669 align:start position:0%
talked about
um

01:12:17.669 --> 01:12:17.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:20.390 --> 01:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
we don't include l-chip apply the growth
 
01:12:22.550 --> 01:12:22.560 align:start position:0%
rate and then remove l-chip because it's
 
01:12:24.149 --> 01:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
we're just really the pass-through for
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
that money the counties are already
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
sending us money so they just include
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
l-chip with it and we pass it on
 
01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.149 align:start position:0%
l-chip with it and we pass it on
um

01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
so it functions a little bit differently
 
01:12:33.990 --> 01:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
in our estimating of
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
the other how we handle the other
 
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.270 align:start position:0%
the other how we handle the other
transfers

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
transfers
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
because it just goes to altitude it just
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
goes it doesn't stop at the general fund
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
anywhere it keeps on going right thank
 
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.830 align:start position:0%
anywhere it keeps on going right thank
you

01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
and if l-chip didn't exist this wouldn't
 
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.110 align:start position:0%
and if l-chip didn't exist this wouldn't
exist

01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
exist
 
01:12:48.310 --> 01:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
or if it didn't get transferred to
 
01:12:50.229 --> 01:12:50.239 align:start position:0%
l-chip the general fund wouldn't keep it
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
right so in the other instances like the
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
municipal fund if that didn't exist the
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
general fund would just keep that money
 
01:12:59.030 --> 01:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
so that's why we add it back in okay
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
thank you represent bursting yeah thank
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
you lindsey
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
so 25 fees are charged
 
01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.070 align:start position:0%
so 25 fees are charged
um

01:13:06.070 --> 01:13:06.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:07.990 --> 01:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'm the bottom line is i'm getting to
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
refinancing mortgages which i think is
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
going to drop dramatically but when
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
someone refinances a mortgage that's
 
01:13:17.590 --> 01:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars to l chip because they
 
01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:20.239 align:start position:0%
retire the old mortgage which is a 25
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
fee and then a new mortgage so 50
 
01:13:24.790 --> 01:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
dollars every time
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
and with rates going up
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
refines are going to
 
01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
drop decrease yep so chip can expect so
 
01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
that's something that l-chip will need
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
to factor into their future revenue
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
estimates all right just make sure you
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
any other questions on
 
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:43.430 align:start position:0%
any other questions on
red

01:13:43.430 --> 01:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
red
 
01:13:46.229 --> 01:13:46.239 align:start position:0%
no okay okay we're on to one
 
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:48.800 align:start position:0%
utility property tax
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
you'll see in the chart at the top of
 
01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:53.120 align:start position:0%
the page on page 17 um it really comes
 
01:13:55.189 --> 01:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
in a few times a year in the form of
 
01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
estimates um we have returns due in
 
01:13:59.350 --> 01:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
january so that can be a little bit of a
 
01:14:00.790 --> 01:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
higher month
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
but basically non-estimate months are
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
either early or late payments
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
um year-to-date where 2.3 million or 7.4
 
01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
percent i had a plan or 2.7 million or
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
8.8 percent ahead of prior year the
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
increase is primarily due to increased
 
01:14:18.709 --> 01:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
valuations in fiscal year 22 and
 
01:14:21.030 --> 01:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers using up some ccos in prior
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
years so we've seen an increase in
 
01:14:26.070 --> 01:14:26.080 align:start position:0%
utility property valuations
 
01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.750 align:start position:0%
utility property valuations
recently

01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
recently
 
01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
some property values may decline though
 
01:14:33.910 --> 01:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
given various economic conditions new
 
01:14:36.149 --> 01:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
taxable property on the top of page 18
 
01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
can always be constructed so it's a
 
01:14:39.990 --> 01:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of a volatile tax that we
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
keep our eye on
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
it is roughly around 40 to 45 million
 
01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
dollars a year and it is uh solely
 
01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated to the education trust fund
 
01:14:52.310 --> 01:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
so we suspect that um our sustaining
 
01:14:55.110 --> 01:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
performance versus prior year will be
 
01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:57.280 align:start position:0%
will continue through may and june which
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
was an 8.8 increase over prior year
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
again primarily due to the increase in
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
valuations that we saw recently
 
01:15:05.910 --> 01:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:06.790 align:start position:0%
and then
um

01:15:06.790 --> 01:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:09.199 align:start position:0%
i'm anticipating a flat growth from 22
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
to 23 just given some of the
 
01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:13.510 align:start position:0%
to 23 just given some of the
uncertainties

01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
uncertainties
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
in in the market especially with fuel
 
01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.830 align:start position:0%
in in the market especially with fuel
prices

01:15:17.830 --> 01:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
prices
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
it will be interesting to see kind of
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
what happens with with the various
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
properties so
 
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
just to be conservative i've left it
 
01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg
 
01:15:33.189 --> 01:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:15:33.199 --> 01:15:35.990 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
commissioner

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
this utility property tax
 
01:15:41.430 --> 01:15:41.440 align:start position:0%
i've heard that eversource is going to
 
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
make bids on buying all utility poles
 
01:15:48.229 --> 01:15:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh in new hampshire
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
would that affect this
 
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
tax if it goes private
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
so these are going to
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
the utilities that are taxed here are
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:06.149 --> 01:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
the the impact i think that you're
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
referring to may have something to do
 
01:16:10.390 --> 01:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
with the trimming of the trees
 
01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
okay and um and the cost to do so
 
01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960 align:start position:0%
um that is more likely to impact i think
 
01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:20.719 align:start position:0%
the um i mean at the municipal level um
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.430 align:start position:0%
with the
transmission

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:23.440 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
at the municipal level i don't i don't
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
know necessarily actually the impact for
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
statewide or at the municipal level
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
until there's greater detail but
 
01:16:36.470 --> 01:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that who owning it
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily would impact the value
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:16:42.630 --> 01:16:42.640 align:start position:0%
am somewhat familiar with what you're
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
so those are our estimates at this point
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
in time subject to change potentially
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
tomorrow um
 
01:16:57.669 --> 01:16:57.679 align:start position:0%
we're in you know an interesting time i
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
think just in terms of how strong
 
01:17:02.630 --> 01:17:02.640 align:start position:0%
revenues have been performing
 
01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:04.149 align:start position:0%
revenues have been performing
um

01:17:04.149 --> 01:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:07.189 --> 01:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
and i think that we just need to to
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
watch the various factors
 
01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:10.229 align:start position:0%
watch the various factors
um

01:17:10.229 --> 01:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:12.550 --> 01:17:12.560 align:start position:0%
and then also it'll be important as we
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
get into revenue estimating like i said
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
fall to think about the timing of the
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
various taxes right
 
01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:21.199 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax we get that on
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis m r we get that on a
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
monthly basis it's very quick to see the
 
01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
impacts of things that may be happening
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
in the economy there's a delayed impact
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
with ind and business taxes and so
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
that'll be something that we need to
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
watch and we may potentially need to
 
01:17:37.189 --> 01:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
factor in something that we think is
 
01:17:38.470 --> 01:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
going to happen that we might not be
 
01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:42.080 align:start position:0%
seeing in the revenues to date so
 
01:17:44.550 --> 01:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
fun times ahead
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
now um
 
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
lindsay we have uh
 
01:17:51.430 --> 01:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
chris we have this other dot handout and
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
and it talks there's a few areas that
 
01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.270 align:start position:0%
and it talks there's a few areas that
are

01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:17:57.350 --> 01:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh dra and then the others are liquor
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
just what was on the top of the
 
01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:09.110 align:start position:0%
just what was on the top of the
spread

01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
crochet lba so reps on bromine that is
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
correct there's a document titled
 
01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:15.360 align:start position:0%
revenue sources with restricted revenue
 
01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
transfers and associated statutes it's
 
01:18:18.790 --> 01:18:18.800 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
dull cover page
 
01:18:23.669 --> 01:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
there's several that are dra collected
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
then there's the liquor transfers and
 
01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
then one that i didn't identify but it's
 
01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:30.560 align:start position:0%
in the rsa is the transfer that occurs
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:42.229 --> 01:18:42.239 align:start position:0%
the second to last page
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.990 --> 01:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:59.189 --> 01:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
uh roman 1d
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
so that it was written into the statute
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
that any of the insurance premium tax
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's collected that's associated with
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
basically medicaid expansion would go
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
into the granite advantage fund i failed
 
01:19:11.270 --> 01:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
to highlight that on on this document
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
but insurance will present that as part
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
of their discussion today you'll see it
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
as one of the back outs that they
 
01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:19.270 align:start position:0%
as one of the back outs that they
provide

01:19:19.270 --> 01:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
so represent major had asked about these
 
01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
a few weeks ago and he asked that i
 
01:19:24.229 --> 01:19:24.239 align:start position:0%
provide you with these
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
documents today just so you'd have it
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
and then i asked the uh the various
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
agencies coming before you to discuss
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
those transfers as they as they came
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
through right i think some of the
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
confusion sometimes happens when you get
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
the various reports from agencies
 
01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the month the daily revenues
 
01:19:40.149 --> 01:19:40.159 align:start position:0%
from our office
 
01:19:42.630 --> 01:19:42.640 align:start position:0%
daily revenues from dra and then daily
 
01:19:45.510 --> 01:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
revenues from administrative services
 
01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:47.760 align:start position:0%
those are much on a cash basis and it's
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
not until the end of the month that
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
those are typically um
 
01:19:54.630 --> 01:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
uh account for the transfers
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
and then you get your revenue focus and
 
01:19:58.310 --> 01:19:58.320 align:start position:0%
the revenue focus if if you don't mind
 
01:19:59.669 --> 01:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
i'll just take a second because i'm not
 
01:20:01.270 --> 01:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
sure how many people are with the
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
revenue focus
 
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
but it's a very
 
01:20:06.390 --> 01:20:06.400 align:start position:0%
good document for quick information
 
01:20:08.390 --> 01:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
related to your general fund education
 
01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.400 align:start position:0%
trust fund revenues your fish and game
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
revenues and your highway fund revenues
 
01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:16.400 align:start position:0%
so on the front page would give you a
 
01:20:19.030 --> 01:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
table that has your current month plan
 
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:20.800 align:start position:0%
and your actuals
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
on the on the
 
01:20:23.750 --> 01:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
right hand side actually in the
 
01:20:24.629 --> 01:20:24.639 align:start position:0%
left-hand side and then on the
 
01:20:26.470 --> 01:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
right-hand side would be brief snippets
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
of what happened that month with that
 
01:20:30.550 --> 01:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
revenue source and the various agencies
 
01:20:32.709 --> 01:20:32.719 align:start position:0%
responsible for collecting that revenue
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
work with administrative services to
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
provide those brief narratives as to
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
what occurred in that month
 
01:20:40.470 --> 01:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
and then as you flip the page you're
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
going to find all sorts of
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
tables charts
 
01:20:45.590 --> 01:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
and information
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
um earlier there was a question around
 
01:20:49.030 --> 01:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
the business tax refunds from
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
01:20:52.629 --> 01:20:52.639 align:start position:0%
on page two in the middle of the page is
 
01:20:55.030 --> 01:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
a chart there that shows you for the
 
01:20:56.629 --> 01:20:56.639 align:start position:0%
last three years what the business tax
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
refunds have looked like so it gives you
 
01:21:01.270 --> 01:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
a quick review of what's going on what
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
happened in the last month that you've
 
01:21:05.189 --> 01:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
just completed
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
um above that you have the m r analysis
 
01:21:09.510 --> 01:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
that shows you your gross collection
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
shows you the two transfers out of that
 
01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:12.790 align:start position:0%
shows you the two transfers out of that
fund

01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
and it shows it on the month basis and
 
01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
then on a year-to-date basis
 
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:18.400 align:start position:0%
so throughout this document there's a
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
lot of good information and as you get
 
01:21:22.790 --> 01:21:22.800 align:start position:0%
to the second to last page you have a
 
01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
table of the general education funds
 
01:21:28.550 --> 01:21:28.560 align:start position:0%
and it's the year to date
 
01:21:30.709 --> 01:21:30.719 align:start position:0%
so it gives you what the plan amount is
 
01:21:32.149 --> 01:21:32.159 align:start position:0%
year to date and then what the actual
 
01:21:34.790 --> 01:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
collections are year to date
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
and so just gives you a good reference
 
01:21:37.350 --> 01:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
point at the end of each month as to
 
01:21:38.870 --> 01:21:38.880 align:start position:0%
where you are with your various um
 
01:21:41.189 --> 01:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
revenues let's use that as an example
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
though for the general discussion here
 
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
is that but these are
 
01:21:47.270 --> 01:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
this is from administrative services
 
01:21:49.270 --> 01:21:49.280 align:start position:0%
their report that is correct this is
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
administrative services net of
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
all of these some statutes yes right
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
that the money comes off the top before
 
01:21:58.709 --> 01:21:58.719 align:start position:0%
it gets reported here exactly
 
01:22:01.270 --> 01:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
my my question's always been is
 
01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
maybe i'm okay with that in terms of
 
01:22:04.629 --> 01:22:04.639 align:start position:0%
well you may want to explain the way you
 
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:06.639 align:start position:0%
explained it to me the other day
 
01:22:06.639 --> 01:22:07.430 align:start position:0%
explained it to me the other day
but

01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:08.229 align:start position:0%
but
it's

01:22:08.229 --> 01:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure when i look at
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
actual plan that i'm looking apples to
 
01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.030 align:start position:0%
actual plan that i'm looking apples to
apples

01:22:13.030 --> 01:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
apples
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
you know you know that
 
01:22:16.709 --> 01:22:16.719 align:start position:0%
that the plan was based on money coming
 
01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
out as well that's correct so can you
 
01:22:21.510 --> 01:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
just spend a second on that so i mean uh
 
01:22:23.350 --> 01:22:23.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner steph had mentioned you
 
01:22:25.350 --> 01:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
know in terms of some of their um
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
estimates they put back in the transfers
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:22:31.350 --> 01:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
figure out what their growth would be
 
01:22:33.430 --> 01:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
and then they back that out after and in
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
some instances there's things that are
 
01:22:37.270 --> 01:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
done as part of the surplus statement so
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
we account for
 
01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
all the transfers or reductions or
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
additions that might occur to revenue
 
01:22:45.669 --> 01:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
during the budget building process
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
so as you may recall when you're doing
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
your revenue estimates
 
01:22:51.430 --> 01:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
for the unrestricted revenue it's on
 
01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
current law and there may be bills going
 
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
through that are going to change
 
01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
a tax or or add a tax or
 
01:22:59.910 --> 01:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
a fee somewhere and so we account for
 
01:23:01.830 --> 01:23:01.840 align:start position:0%
that as part of the surplus statement
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
and then at the end of the
 
01:23:05.590 --> 01:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
budget process when everything's signed
 
01:23:07.669 --> 01:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
off administrative services will work
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
with the agencies to come up with a
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
monthly revenue plan
 
01:23:12.070 --> 01:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
and that's what they track through their
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
revenue focus
 
01:23:14.159 --> 01:23:14.950 align:start position:0%
revenue focus
so

01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
so you do get an apples-to-apples
 
01:23:17.910 --> 01:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
comparison i think where you get an
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
apples-to-oranges comparison is when
 
01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the daily revenues
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
each month because not everything is
 
01:23:26.950 --> 01:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
backed out it's on a cash basis so when
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
you get a report from me
 
01:23:30.950 --> 01:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
unless i've noted to you for instance
 
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
with the m r that i back that out of the
 
01:23:35.910 --> 01:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
number we haven't backed out the real
 
01:23:38.709 --> 01:23:38.719 align:start position:0%
estate transfer to l-chip we haven't
 
01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
backed out
 
01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.790 align:start position:0%
backed out
the

01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
liquor you know if there's a transfer
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
related to going to the granite
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
advantage or the alcohol commission fund
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen to the end of the
 
01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:53.990 align:start position:0%
that doesn't happen to the end of the
month

01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.990 --> 01:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
every day the revenues are changing on a
 
01:23:57.830 --> 01:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
daily basis
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
and for that reason we don't try to be
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
precise until the close of the month
 
01:24:05.270 --> 01:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
otherwise it's a a lot of potential for
 
01:24:07.669 --> 01:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
misinformation going back and forth
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
so we just stay to the cash basis during
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
the daily revenues and it's true also
 
01:24:14.550 --> 01:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
with administrative services
 
01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.350 align:start position:0%
with administrative services
and

01:24:15.350 --> 01:24:15.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:24:17.110 --> 01:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
dra you know they give you what they've
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
collected on a cash basis
 
01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.709 align:start position:0%
collected on a cash basis
um

01:24:20.709 --> 01:24:20.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
and if you get the administrative
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
services daily report it's essentially
 
01:24:29.110 --> 01:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
this table the year-to-date table
 
01:24:31.270 --> 01:24:31.280 align:start position:0%
and then a month to date table and if
 
01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
you ever look at that you'll notice that
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
the education um trust fund account
 
01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
during the month
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
is it looks like there's a lot of
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
negatives there there's not money that
 
01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:42.639 align:start position:0%
hasn't been attributed to it yet it's
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
because the splits haven't occurred yet
 
01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
those occur from you know the business
 
01:24:49.510 --> 01:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
taxes the meals and rooms tax the real
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
estate transfer tax that all occurs at
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
the end of the month when the month is
 
01:24:55.430 --> 01:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
closed because there could be a refund
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
for instance of dra on the you know the
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
29th of the month that would change a
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
split if they had done it early
 
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
so hopefully that helps but it
 
01:25:05.910 --> 01:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
really i just wanted to say the revenue
 
01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
focus is is your best
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
if you want to get a sense of where your
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
revenues are that's the best place to
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
look at that
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:19.350 --> 01:25:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you i do think that
 
01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.310 align:start position:0%
thank you i do think that
uh

01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:25:22.390 --> 01:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
other than this committee and possibly
 
01:25:24.470 --> 01:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
the one in the senate
 
01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
i don't think anybody pays attention to
 
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:29.760 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:31.110 align:start position:0%
the fact that
revenues

01:25:31.110 --> 01:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:25:33.990 --> 01:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
may actually be going up but are being
 
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.510 align:start position:0%
may actually be going up but are being
spent

01:25:35.510 --> 01:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
spent
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
by the budget
 
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
on before any place else in the budget
 
01:25:43.669 --> 01:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
gets it with these these
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
restricted transfers
 
01:25:48.550 --> 01:25:48.560 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me that there ought to
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
at least be an asterisk
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
that the das does on the taxes that
 
01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.590 align:start position:0%
that the das does on the taxes that
that

01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:02.719 align:start position:0%
whose revenues are reduced by specific
 
01:26:02.719 --> 01:26:03.910 align:start position:0%
whose revenues are reduced by specific
on

01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:03.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
budgeted requirements over the years
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
so that people don't think oh we're
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
we're getting less from meals and rooms
 
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:19.110 --> 01:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
i think that would be discussion with
 
01:26:20.709 --> 01:26:20.719 align:start position:0%
administrative services on how they
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
would notate their um report because it
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
is their report yeah
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
we may want to invite them in at some
 
01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:32.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:34.229 --> 01:26:34.239 align:start position:0%
because this to us this is our bible
 
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
here and we want to and then when you go
 
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:38.560 align:start position:0%
back 10 years you know you want to try
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
to track how the revenues really did and
 
01:26:42.390 --> 01:26:42.400 align:start position:0%
then if there's all of a sudden you
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
can't you can't right
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
even they're having trouble doing it
 
01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
right right
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
okay um we got a few minutes um
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
do you have any comments on in the
 
01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
handout there's there's a couple of
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
departments that are yours but i know
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
you touched on it already
 
01:26:59.830 --> 01:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
do you have anything else you want to
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
add to that
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
no i think we covered it um i did double
 
01:27:07.189 --> 01:27:07.199 align:start position:0%
check chris's numbers ties to what i had
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the report okay that's good
 
01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:10.870 align:start position:0%
in the report okay that's good
so

01:27:10.870 --> 01:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:12.310 --> 01:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
so but this is a i would keep this
 
01:27:16.790 --> 01:27:16.800 align:start position:0%
document it's a handy guide we
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
actually shows every statute where this
 
01:27:22.470 --> 01:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
this is occurring and i think this is
 
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
valuable to have
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:27:27.910 --> 01:27:27.920 align:start position:0%
all right no other questions uh thank
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
you chris thank you lindsay very much
 
01:27:32.950 --> 01:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
and we have uh next we have the
 
01:27:34.390 --> 01:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
department of justice
 
01:27:37.270 --> 01:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
and we have uh warren cormack and i
 
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
guess he has someone else with him but
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
and uh as as you probably know we have
 
01:27:48.239 --> 01:27:50.070 align:start position:0%
and uh as as you probably know we have
one

01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
simple question
 
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
you know we used to around 40 million
 
01:27:57.510 --> 01:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
ish and all of a sudden it hit 50 uh on
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:28:01.189 --> 01:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
tobacco settlement money so we're just
 
01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
kind of curious what happened there
 
01:28:04.709 --> 01:28:04.719 align:start position:0%
so if you want to both introduce
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
my name is warren cormack i'm an
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
attorney at the department of justice in
 
01:28:16.790 --> 01:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
the consumer protection bureau i'm
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
tasked with tobacco enforcement
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh with me it's brandon grodd
 
01:28:22.709 --> 01:28:22.719 align:start position:0%
senior assistant attorney general
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
brandon groud i'm the chief of the
 
01:28:25.669 --> 01:28:25.679 align:start position:0%
consumer protection anti-trust bureau at
 
01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:31.430 --> 01:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
thanks for giving me the opportunity to
 
01:28:32.470 --> 01:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
speak today
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:36.709 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
so

01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:36.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
i am tasked with diligent enforcement of
 
01:28:40.830 --> 01:28:40.840 align:start position:0%
the tobacco statutes
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is you're asking me
 
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh why the payment was different from
 
01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
the original estimates significantly
 
01:28:49.990 --> 01:28:50.000 align:start position:0%
different significant if it was a
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
million either way we would not you know
 
01:28:54.950 --> 01:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
we're just curious so every year
 
01:28:57.669 --> 01:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
we receive estimates for
 
01:28:59.110 --> 01:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
the eventual payments that will be made
 
01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
under the msa
 
01:29:02.470 --> 01:29:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's the master settlement agreement
 
01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:03.430 align:start position:0%
that's the master settlement agreement
this

01:29:03.430 --> 01:29:03.440 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
is based on a calculation that relies on
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
several variables it relies on the
 
01:29:10.149 --> 01:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
volume of cigarettes sold it relies on
 
01:29:10.159 --> 01:29:11.270 align:start position:0%
volume of cigarettes sold it relies on
inflation

01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
inflation
 
01:29:13.110 --> 01:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
it relies on the percentage market share
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
of certain types of tobacco companies
 
01:29:15.520 --> 01:29:16.870 align:start position:0%
of certain types of tobacco companies
and

01:29:16.870 --> 01:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:17.990 --> 01:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of those variables are really
 
01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
difficult to predict
 
01:29:24.070 --> 01:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
so we provide an estimate based on the
 
01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:26.310 align:start position:0%
so we provide an estimate based on the
anticipated

01:29:26.310 --> 01:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
anticipated
 
01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.669 align:start position:0%
anticipated
percentage

01:29:27.669 --> 01:29:27.679 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
01:29:29.750 --> 01:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
share based on the volume
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
based on the profits that tobacco
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
companies will make
 
01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:33.910 align:start position:0%
companies will make
and

01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:37.030 --> 01:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
and ultimately when we do report those
 
01:29:39.110 --> 01:29:39.120 align:start position:0%
estimates we report them as rough
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
estimates because it's very difficult to
 
01:29:42.950 --> 01:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
predict a lot of these variables
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
this year
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
several of the variables were much
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
different more different than
 
01:29:49.590 --> 01:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
anticipated for example
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
inflation regularly is set to a three
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
percent floor in the calculation
 
01:29:56.709 --> 01:29:56.719 align:start position:0%
but this past year it was over seven
 
01:29:58.709 --> 01:29:58.719 align:start position:0%
percent that's never happened before
 
01:29:59.830 --> 01:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
since the signing of the master
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
settlement agreement because of that the
 
01:30:03.990 --> 01:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
the payment was raised by a significant
 
01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:05.030 align:start position:0%
the payment was raised by a significant
degree

01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
degree
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
also the profits that tobacco companies
 
01:30:09.030 --> 01:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
are making
 
01:30:12.070 --> 01:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
have increased also a significant amount
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
and that correction regularly
 
01:30:16.790 --> 01:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
will be we'll add zero dollars but this
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
year it added
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of money to the payment so those
 
01:30:21.830 --> 01:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
are two major factors
 
01:30:24.310 --> 01:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
a third factor is what's called the npm
 
01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:25.830 align:start position:0%
a third factor is what's called the npm
adjustment

01:30:25.830 --> 01:30:25.840 align:start position:0%
adjustment
 
01:30:27.830 --> 01:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
and so what happens in this adjustment
 
01:30:29.510 --> 01:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:30.229 align:start position:0%
is that
the

01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
tobacco companies can withhold certain
 
01:30:34.709 --> 01:30:34.719 align:start position:0%
amounts from payment
 
01:30:36.310 --> 01:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
if they contest
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
charges uh that they owe the states
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
and this year we anticipated that they
 
01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
might with help hold some money from the
 
01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.030 align:start position:0%
might with help hold some money from the
states

01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:45.040 align:start position:0%
states
 
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
and they ended up not doing so and we
 
01:30:48.470 --> 01:30:48.480 align:start position:0%
received the entirety
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
of the payment that would be due under
 
01:30:52.229 --> 01:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
the npm adjustment
 
01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:55.040 align:start position:0%
and those disputes are related to
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
shifts in market share
 
01:30:59.990 --> 01:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
across the tobacco industry
 
01:31:01.189 --> 01:31:01.199 align:start position:0%
so those are the three major
 
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
contributors to why the payout was so
 
01:31:04.629 --> 01:31:04.639 align:start position:0%
different than
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
was originally anticipated what was the
 
01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:08.560 align:start position:0%
middle one again sorry it's inflation
 
01:31:10.629 --> 01:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
and the next one was what the next one
 
01:31:11.910 --> 01:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
is it's it's called the profit
 
01:31:13.510 --> 01:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
adjustment and actually
 
01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
it's an upward adjustment of a downward
 
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
adjustment so it ends up increasing
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
the payment but functionally it's
 
01:31:23.750 --> 01:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
decreasing the payment less
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
because there's a volume adjustment that
 
01:31:29.590 --> 01:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
decreases the payment every year for
 
01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:30.550 align:start position:0%
decreases the payment every year for
the

01:31:30.550 --> 01:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
volume of cigarettes which decrease
 
01:31:33.990 --> 01:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
every year and then the profit
 
01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
adjustment bumps it back up if the
 
01:31:37.350 --> 01:31:37.360 align:start position:0%
tobacco companies are selling less
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
cigarettes but making more profit
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
we're not complaining actually
 
01:31:43.030 --> 01:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
i've given it so
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
maybe a little bit different if we was a
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
10 million the other way
 
01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
but um you know because i've been here
 
01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
12 years and
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
this is the first time it's been that's
 
01:31:53.590 --> 01:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
much of a variance but it sounds like
 
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
the perfect storm of these three things
 
01:31:58.229 --> 01:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
occurring at the same time that's what
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
what causing this that's exactly right
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
and a lot of it is attributable to covet
 
01:32:05.669 --> 01:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
01:32:09.990 --> 01:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
as i recall the mppm adjustment it was
 
01:32:13.430 --> 01:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
mostly centered around contesting lack
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
of enforcement by the states
 
01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.430 align:start position:0%
of enforcement by the states
and

01:32:17.430 --> 01:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:32:19.350 --> 01:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
your predecessor spent
 
01:32:21.430 --> 01:32:21.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of time on
 
01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.390 align:start position:0%
a lot of time on
for

01:32:22.390 --> 01:32:22.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:23.830 align:start position:0%
for
years

01:32:23.830 --> 01:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
on going through the process of
 
01:32:27.280 --> 01:32:28.149 align:start position:0%
on going through the process of
of

01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
tell getting them to understand that we
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
were enforcing properly and everybody
 
01:32:34.709 --> 01:32:34.719 align:start position:0%
else had to
 
01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:37.520 align:start position:0%
produce data that they were enforcing
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
properly is this lack of contest mostly
 
01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:42.709 align:start position:0%
properly is this lack of contest mostly
that

01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:46.310 --> 01:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
that they finally finished that process
 
01:32:48.790 --> 01:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's an ongoing process and uh
 
01:32:48.800 --> 01:32:49.910 align:start position:0%
it's an ongoing process and uh
ultimately

01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately
 
01:32:52.229 --> 01:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
it just means that we were dispersed uh
 
01:32:53.669 --> 01:32:53.679 align:start position:0%
the funds that
 
01:32:55.430 --> 01:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
might otherwise have been sent to a
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
disputed payments account so
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
every year we need to diligently enforce
 
01:33:01.910 --> 01:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
the statutes that level the playing
 
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
field between the signatories to the
 
01:33:05.270 --> 01:33:05.280 align:start position:0%
master settlement agreement and the
 
01:33:06.870 --> 01:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
non-signatories to the master settlement
 
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
agreement and
 
01:33:11.189 --> 01:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
what a dispute is is it's a tobacco
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
company saying
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
claiming that they don't owe certain
 
01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:15.910 align:start position:0%
claiming that they don't owe certain
funds

01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
under that
 
01:33:19.990 --> 01:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
diligent enforcement standard
 
01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:20.790 align:start position:0%
diligent enforcement standard
and

01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:20.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
this year they didn't make disputes that
 
01:33:25.830 --> 01:33:25.840 align:start position:0%
we thought they might make
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
so it's not so much of a reflection
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
on diligent enforcement as it is on the
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
tobacco company's
 
01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:34.390 align:start position:0%
tobacco company's
uh

01:33:34.390 --> 01:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:33:36.470 --> 01:33:36.480 align:start position:0%
willingness to dispute
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
certain uh
 
01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
aspects of diligent enforcement so they
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
can withhold that money and they they
 
01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
did not so they might start that up
 
01:33:45.990 --> 01:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
again next year yes yeah and that can
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
happen any year and
 
01:33:49.830 --> 01:33:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to predict what they
 
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:55.510 align:start position:0%
 
but

01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.270 --> 01:33:57.280 align:start position:0%
would you say that the projections when
 
01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
you come here next january or
 
01:34:03.510 --> 01:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
as we do our revenue projections
 
01:34:05.030 --> 01:34:05.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to probably settle back that
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
you're probably going to come in
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
settling back down to the 40 million ish
 
01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:09.360 align:start position:0%
or more
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
or less
 
01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
so the current projections for the
 
01:34:16.070 --> 01:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
upcoming year is at 40 million i
 
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
submitted a memo and i believe that was
 
01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
the number in that memo
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
again whenever we give an estimate
 
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
i'd like to emphasize that it is a rough
 
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
estimate because it's so difficult to
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
predict all these variables
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
let me just one other thought so it's
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
part you you said something about colvin
 
01:34:34.800 --> 01:34:35.990 align:start position:0%
part you you said something about colvin
so

01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
are you saying that
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
we theorized that did more people smoke
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
during that period
 
01:34:42.870 --> 01:34:42.880 align:start position:0%
that's exactly right
 
01:34:45.109 --> 01:34:45.119 align:start position:0%
more people smoke
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
and uh more people
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
might shift to more premium cigarettes
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
when they do smoke
 
01:34:52.629 --> 01:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
any of those factors would raise it the
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
inflation also has raised it and whether
 
01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
that's attributable to covert or not i
 
01:34:59.430 --> 01:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
can't speak to but
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
that's also a factor in the aftermath
 
01:35:03.990 --> 01:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
that has raised the payment
 
01:35:05.830 --> 01:35:05.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
any other questions oh representative
 
01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:11.910 align:start position:0%
any other questions oh representative
tucker

01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:14.629 --> 01:35:14.639 align:start position:0%
representative carmelo and i had a bill
 
01:35:17.430 --> 01:35:17.440 align:start position:0%
that got sort of shifted aside because
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic
 
01:35:20.950 --> 01:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
and it disappeared
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
in the process as happened to so many of
 
01:35:23.199 --> 01:35:23.830 align:start position:0%
in the process as happened to so many of
us

01:35:23.830 --> 01:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:35:25.030 --> 01:35:25.040 align:start position:0%
with bills
 
01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:25.910 align:start position:0%
with bills
that

01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:27.350 align:start position:0%
that
spring

01:35:27.350 --> 01:35:27.360 align:start position:0%
spring
 
01:35:30.149 --> 01:35:30.159 align:start position:0%
but it had to do with finding out
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
whether we're really spending the money
 
01:35:32.239 --> 01:35:33.669 align:start position:0%
whether we're really spending the money
effectively

01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
01:35:35.350 --> 01:35:35.360 align:start position:0%
for prevention
 
01:35:38.550 --> 01:35:38.560 align:start position:0%
of starting smoking so it would be
 
01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
rather than on the end
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
of getting people who were
 
01:35:44.629 --> 01:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
smokers getting them to quit
 
01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
it would be focused to see whether we're
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
properly focusing on those who have not
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
yet started smoking which as we know
 
01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.070 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:58.080 --> 01:35:59.109 align:start position:0%
and
that

01:35:59.109 --> 01:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:59.119 --> 01:36:00.310 align:start position:0%
that
disappeared

01:36:00.310 --> 01:36:00.320 align:start position:0%
disappeared
 
01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:02.560 align:start position:0%
but is there a chance to look at this
 
01:36:05.669 --> 01:36:05.679 align:start position:0%
extra revenue and see whether we could
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
divert some of it into its original
 
01:36:11.109 --> 01:36:11.119 align:start position:0%
intent which was having less smoking in
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:14.149 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
and

01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
focusing on
 
01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
young people
 
01:36:17.119 --> 01:36:17.990 align:start position:0%
young people
and

01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:21.109 --> 01:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
finding what are the effective programs
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
that keep people from smoking i know
 
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:25.360 align:start position:0%
there are those who think this that and
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
the other drug
 
01:36:28.470 --> 01:36:28.480 align:start position:0%
leads people to
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh addictive drugs but smoking really is
 
01:36:33.910 --> 01:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
the first gateway
 
01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:34.790 align:start position:0%
the first gateway
to

01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:35.669 align:start position:0%
to
other

01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:36:37.189 --> 01:36:37.199 align:start position:0%
substance use
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
and it bothers me terribly in the north
 
01:36:42.070 --> 01:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
country to
 
01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
drive around into
 
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
populated villages towns cities and see
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
young people smoking as a former smoker
 
01:36:52.390 --> 01:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
i know how hard it is
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
to give it up
 
01:36:56.629 --> 01:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
and how much damage it does so
 
01:36:58.390 --> 01:36:58.400 align:start position:0%
do you have anything to do with how the
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
money is spent
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
or can encourage
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
some people who do
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
to really understand that we have extra
 
01:37:08.310 --> 01:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
revenue this year that could be directed
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
to this very important place
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question i don't have
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
any ability to
 
01:37:17.350 --> 01:37:17.360 align:start position:0%
send that money anywhere i provide
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
estimates when it's provided i can't
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
speak to uh you know policy questions
 
01:37:23.350 --> 01:37:23.360 align:start position:0%
about what should happen with that money
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
and you remember that bill and it just
 
01:37:28.229 --> 01:37:28.239 align:start position:0%
it was many part of many things so
 
01:37:30.950 --> 01:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
obviously it's a legislative um
 
01:37:32.629 --> 01:37:32.639 align:start position:0%
requirement not not the justice
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
department's requirement but yeah that
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
that was the year where
 
01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
so many bills went up uh not being even
 
01:37:41.590 --> 01:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
having a hearing in the senate and they
 
01:37:43.350 --> 01:37:43.360 align:start position:0%
just disappeared
 
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:45.360 align:start position:0%
i had a few of them at the time i
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
thought it would probably be the most
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
important thing i did as a legislator
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
right i've had bills that disappeared
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
too we're talking about the life
 
01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:54.880 align:start position:0%
expectancy of young people here in new
 
01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
hampshire oh that's fine so maybe you
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
could follow up on that
 
01:37:59.679 --> 01:38:05.189 align:start position:0%
could follow up on that
oh

01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:05.199 --> 01:38:07.109 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:38:07.109 --> 01:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:38:07.119 --> 01:38:07.910 align:start position:0%
yeah
chris

01:38:07.910 --> 01:38:07.920 align:start position:0%
chris
 
01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:09.109 align:start position:0%
chris
yeah

01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to comment that in statute
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
the first 40 million of the settlement
 
01:38:15.590 --> 01:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
is deposited in the education trust fund
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
so the legislature has already
 
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
determined what's to happen with the
 
01:38:19.830 --> 01:38:19.840 align:start position:0%
first 40 million
 
01:38:21.669 --> 01:38:21.679 align:start position:0%
any balance above 40 million will be
 
01:38:24.310 --> 01:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
deposited into the general fund and then
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
it's up to the legislature to determine
 
01:38:27.910 --> 01:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
how to spend that money and that's done
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
through the operating budget and through
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
legislative specials and i think you've
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
probably seen a number of legislative
 
01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
specials this session that have
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
appropriated funds
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
for certain purposes
 
01:38:41.189 --> 01:38:41.199 align:start position:0%
hang on representative do you have a
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
question of chris
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
well i guess for you and just for maybe
 
01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
them i think one of the factors you said
 
01:38:49.189 --> 01:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
that changed the amount of the trust
 
01:38:50.149 --> 01:38:50.159 align:start position:0%
fund is
 
01:38:50.159 --> 01:38:51.189 align:start position:0%
fund is
is

01:38:51.189 --> 01:38:51.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:38:53.430 --> 01:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
the lack of a proportionality of usage
 
01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
across states that are part of the ms
 
01:38:57.109 --> 01:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
part of the master settlement agreement
 
01:38:59.430 --> 01:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
so with the change in the mass law and
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
the flavor tax that
 
01:39:03.109 --> 01:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
and banning all those flavor driving
 
01:39:04.550 --> 01:39:04.560 align:start position:0%
everybody new hampshire drive up what
 
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
our numbers would look like even though
 
01:39:08.310 --> 01:39:08.320 align:start position:0%
they're not necessarily new hampshire
 
01:39:10.229 --> 01:39:10.239 align:start position:0%
residents that would would that change
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
the percentage and give us more money in
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
massachusetts isn't that formula set
 
01:39:16.950 --> 01:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
isn't that why don't you cover that
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
historically it's been set it doesn't
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
matter where the smoking occurs now it's
 
01:39:24.629 --> 01:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding this is a good
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
question and um it's actually it is set
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
so every state has a set allocation and
 
01:39:32.470 --> 01:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
this money we don't actually receive
 
01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
straight from
 
01:39:35.830 --> 01:39:35.840 align:start position:0%
the tobacco companies they all deposit
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
it into an account and then that account
 
01:39:40.229 --> 01:39:40.239 align:start position:0%
gets distributed and disbursed to the
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
states based on those set allocated
 
01:39:42.159 --> 01:39:43.669 align:start position:0%
states based on those set allocated
percentages

01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%
percentages
 
01:39:45.430 --> 01:39:45.440 align:start position:0%
right so we
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents can stop smoking
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
massachusetts people can stop buying
 
01:39:52.070 --> 01:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
cigarettes here we're still going to get
 
01:39:56.070 --> 01:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:59.109 --> 01:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
we would get the allocation that is
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
allocated to us based on percentage if
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
it changes
 
01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
if certain laws were to change the total
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
consumption of cigarettes across the
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
united states then that could change the
 
01:40:11.510 --> 01:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
amount that we receive
 
01:40:13.990 --> 01:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative had a
 
01:40:15.270 --> 01:40:15.280 align:start position:0%
question too
 
01:40:17.910 --> 01:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
well just a comment about the previous
 
01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
one i believe that the state of new
 
01:40:23.990 --> 01:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire gives absolutely nothing to
 
01:40:25.830 --> 01:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
tobacco prevention
 
01:40:28.229 --> 01:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
it's possible that there's a very very
 
01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
small amount in hhs money
 
01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:32.629 align:start position:0%
small amount in hhs money
on

01:40:32.629 --> 01:40:32.639 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:40:35.590 --> 01:40:35.600 align:start position:0%
but this is coming in this year so it
 
01:40:39.030 --> 01:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
will be part of the surplus next year
 
01:40:41.350 --> 01:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
when the budget is decided
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
so someone would have to bring in a bill
 
01:40:57.189 --> 01:40:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.590 --> 01:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
directed towards prevention
 
01:41:02.950 --> 01:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
and a lot of effort is spent on
 
01:41:04.629 --> 01:41:04.639 align:start position:0%
getting people to give up
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
smoking and there are products that
 
01:41:09.510 --> 01:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
people buy and so there's
 
01:41:12.790 --> 01:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
there are groups that are incentivized
 
01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
to get people to stop smoking because
 
01:41:16.709 --> 01:41:16.719 align:start position:0%
they produce those
 
01:41:19.350 --> 01:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
medications or
 
01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:20.709 align:start position:0%
medications or
processes

01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:20.719 align:start position:0%
processes
 
01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
but the
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
the young people part is much more
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
difficult and it would take a
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
relationship between the department of
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
education and health and human services
 
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
because these are mostly people of
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
course who are still in
 
01:41:37.590 --> 01:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
have not graduated from high school
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
representative tucker as you know
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
they they have nothing to do with yeah
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
did that no that was for the committee
 
01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:45.030 align:start position:0%
did that no that was for the committee
then

01:41:45.030 --> 01:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:41:48.070 --> 01:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you yeah okay that's what
 
01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:51.199 align:start position:0%
i think it's easy different you know
 
01:41:53.590 --> 01:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
we focus on whether
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
having certain kinds of charitable
 
01:41:57.830 --> 01:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
gaming and so forth
 
01:41:59.830 --> 01:41:59.840 align:start position:0%
results in addiction but this is a
 
01:42:02.550 --> 01:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
problem that's been on for many years
 
01:42:05.030 --> 01:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
and we still have it and we do have
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
income that
 
01:42:08.470 --> 01:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
can be directed
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
to solving it so it it seems to me that
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
we're missing an opportunity and maybe
 
01:42:17.430 --> 01:42:17.440 align:start position:0%
it's because we hear about the funds in
 
01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:18.870 align:start position:0%
it's because we hear about the funds in
may

01:42:18.870 --> 01:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:42:20.470 --> 01:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
rather than at the beginning of the
 
01:42:22.870 --> 01:42:22.880 align:start position:0%
legislative season where we're coming up
 
01:42:24.709 --> 01:42:24.719 align:start position:0%
with bills i don't know
 
01:42:27.590 --> 01:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
but i hold myself partly accountable for
 
01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:28.880 align:start position:0%
letting you're not wrong i mean the
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
original you could say that the original
 
01:42:33.270 --> 01:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
intent of all this was for the money was
 
01:42:35.109 --> 01:42:35.119 align:start position:0%
supposed to be used for prevention and
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
all of that
 
01:42:38.149 --> 01:42:38.159 align:start position:0%
and treatment and treatment for people
 
01:42:40.310 --> 01:42:40.320 align:start position:0%
who got illnesses because of smoking and
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
this predates
 
01:42:44.229 --> 01:42:44.239 align:start position:0%
you and i being in the legislature maybe
 
01:42:46.709 --> 01:42:46.719 align:start position:0%
i'm not true representative
 
01:42:46.719 --> 01:42:47.910 align:start position:0%
i'm not true representative
right

01:42:47.910 --> 01:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:42:50.709 --> 01:42:50.719 align:start position:0%
when three million was put in by a
 
01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
senator and the next year the senator
 
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
wasn't there and they took it out
 
01:42:57.590 --> 01:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
so i think i just wanted to sort of
 
01:42:59.189 --> 01:42:59.199 align:start position:0%
encourage the whole committee to be
 
01:43:01.990 --> 01:43:02.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about this because
 
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
there aren't very many problems in the
 
01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:05.109 align:start position:0%
there aren't very many problems in the
state

01:43:05.109 --> 01:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
that can be solved by money that is
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
readily available
 
01:43:12.390 --> 01:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
directed it you know that's hard to do
 
01:43:14.149 --> 01:43:14.159 align:start position:0%
so we have affordable housing as a
 
01:43:16.709 --> 01:43:16.719 align:start position:0%
problem where do we get money
 
01:43:18.629 --> 01:43:18.639 align:start position:0%
representative murphy no thank you mr
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
chairman i would just offer a a
 
01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:22.550 align:start position:0%
chairman i would just offer a a
a

01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:23.669 align:start position:0%
a
potential

01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
potential
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
amendment to your bill coming forward
 
01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
that you expand the scope of that unused
 
01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.109 align:start position:0%
that you expand the scope of that unused
money

01:43:29.109 --> 01:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
if you look at the social determinants
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
of health nearly 70 of every healthcare
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
dollar is spent on
 
01:43:37.270 --> 01:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
personal choices that
 
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
end up in medical treatment so it's not
 
01:43:41.590 --> 01:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
just smoking it's alcohol use it is
 
01:43:44.470 --> 01:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
obesity it is drugs it is speeding so
 
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
you could actually potentially expand
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
your bill to include other areas beyond
 
01:43:51.030 --> 01:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
just um
 
01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
the um uh the cigarette smoking so
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's a huge nut when you think about
 
01:43:58.790 --> 01:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
health care in 70 of our health care
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
dollar is spent on preventative
 
01:44:02.629 --> 01:44:02.639 align:start position:0%
illnesses in diseases that we
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know based on our um personal
 
01:44:06.629 --> 01:44:06.639 align:start position:0%
choices so just enough you know a
 
01:44:06.639 --> 01:44:07.990 align:start position:0%
choices so just enough you know a
thought

01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:08.000 align:start position:0%
thought
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative murphy i i actually agree
 
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
with you 100 it is it is those
 
01:44:15.270 --> 01:44:15.280 align:start position:0%
personal habits that create a
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
good amount of our health care costs
 
01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
big number representative bursting thank
 
01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
you mr chair thank you gentlemen for
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
testifying shortly before
 
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
you all came into the room we were
 
01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
discussing the fda and the
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
potential ban on methylated cigarettes
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
and flavored cigars
 
01:44:38.790 --> 01:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
um i'd love to hear your your comments
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
if that goes into effect would we see
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
the msa estimate increase as people
 
01:44:47.669 --> 01:44:47.679 align:start position:0%
hoard swisher sweets and newports prior
 
01:44:49.990 --> 01:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
to the band i'd just love to hear your
 
01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:52.550 align:start position:0%
to the band i'd just love to hear your
thoughts

01:44:52.550 --> 01:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:53.830 --> 01:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
that's also
 
01:44:55.750 --> 01:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
a good question
 
01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:57.030 align:start position:0%
a good question
i

01:44:57.030 --> 01:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:45:00.070 --> 01:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
could submit a memo to update on the
 
01:45:02.550 --> 01:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
predicted effect of that it could affect
 
01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:03.270 align:start position:0%
predicted effect of that it could affect
the

01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
eventual payment in several different
 
01:45:07.109 --> 01:45:07.119 align:start position:0%
ways if people shift to smoking
 
01:45:07.119 --> 01:45:08.229 align:start position:0%
ways if people shift to smoking
cigarettes

01:45:08.229 --> 01:45:08.239 align:start position:0%
cigarettes
 
01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:10.639 align:start position:0%
then it would obviously increase
 
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
due to the volume increase
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
if people
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
stop smoking so many cigarettes then it
 
01:45:18.790 --> 01:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
would decrease it
 
01:45:20.229 --> 01:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
with something like that it's difficult
 
01:45:21.590 --> 01:45:21.600 align:start position:0%
to predict what
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
people might how people might uh
 
01:45:27.270 --> 01:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
smoke you know because with kovid people
 
01:45:28.629 --> 01:45:28.639 align:start position:0%
could have smoked more they could have
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
smoked less and
 
01:45:33.030 --> 01:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
fear of not going out and purchasing
 
01:45:34.709 --> 01:45:34.719 align:start position:0%
cigarettes so
 
01:45:36.149 --> 01:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
it's difficult to predict how any
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
specific policy change might affect
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
smoking but the underlying question is
 
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
how many cigarettes are being sold
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
how much profit is being made what's
 
01:45:47.430 --> 01:45:47.440 align:start position:0%
inflation doing
 
01:45:49.510 --> 01:45:49.520 align:start position:0%
yes sir let me ask you
 
01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:50.629 align:start position:0%
yes sir let me ask you
okay

01:45:50.629 --> 01:45:50.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:45:52.550 --> 01:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
how about vaping product nicotine vaping
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
products was that wrapped into the
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
settlement is that considered part of
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
the or is just strictly cigarettes do
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
you know off-topic
 
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
vaping products
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
do not contribute to the ms contribution
 
01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:05.669 align:start position:0%
do not contribute to the ms contribution
okay

01:46:05.669 --> 01:46:05.679 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:07.360 align:start position:0%
but they are
 
01:46:08.870 --> 01:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
regulated so
 
01:46:10.229 --> 01:46:10.239 align:start position:0%
one of the things that our office does
 
01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
is we
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
collect wholesaler reports
 
01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:14.629 align:start position:0%
collect wholesaler reports
to

01:46:14.629 --> 01:46:14.639 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:46:16.390 --> 01:46:16.400 align:start position:0%
determine how many cigarettes are being
 
01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:17.270 align:start position:0%
determine how many cigarettes are being
sold

01:46:17.270 --> 01:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
sold
 
01:46:18.950 --> 01:46:18.960 align:start position:0%
and so vaping companies which are
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
required to
 
01:46:22.709 --> 01:46:22.719 align:start position:0%
register with the department of revenue
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
are required to submit
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
wholesaler reports if they're registered
 
01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
as a wholesaler with the department of
 
01:46:29.669 --> 01:46:29.679 align:start position:0%
revenue to us awesome okay
 
01:46:30.870 --> 01:46:30.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
what was it on me
 
01:46:38.470 --> 01:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
yeah are those reports confidential or
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.910 --> 01:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
i do know that the
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh msa sales numbers are confidential
 
01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:51.669 align:start position:0%
uh msa sales numbers are confidential
i

01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:46:53.189 --> 01:46:53.199 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about the reports i would
 
01:46:54.629 --> 01:46:54.639 align:start position:0%
have to look that up i i mean
 
01:46:58.229 --> 01:46:58.239 align:start position:0%
particularly the vaping reports because
 
01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
we have no way of knowing what's going
 
01:47:03.109 --> 01:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
on with that market at this point
 
01:47:05.350 --> 01:47:05.360 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that the only thing that
 
01:47:07.669 --> 01:47:07.679 align:start position:0%
vaping companies are required to report
 
01:47:09.350 --> 01:47:09.360 align:start position:0%
on those reports or how many cigarettes
 
01:47:11.910 --> 01:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
they sell so cigarettes
 
01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:12.629 align:start position:0%
they sell so cigarettes
so

01:47:12.629 --> 01:47:12.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
when we receive the reports i i'm not
 
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:16.960 align:start position:0%
sure that they would be particularly
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
informative as to what's happening to
 
01:47:21.990 --> 01:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
the vaping market
 
01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:23.350 align:start position:0%
the vaping market
okay

01:47:23.350 --> 01:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
okay i think we're all set
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
thank you both very much for being here
 
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
good seeing you again
 
01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%

01:47:34.470 --> 01:47:34.480 align:start position:0%
he was he won the marijuana commission
 
01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:35.600 align:start position:0%
with me
 
01:47:36.870 --> 01:47:36.880 align:start position:0%

01:47:40.709 --> 01:47:40.719 align:start position:0%

what i want to do now with the committee
 
01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:57.750 align:start position:0%
what i want to do now with the committee
is

01:47:57.750 --> 01:47:57.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
probably may take
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
10 minutes it may take 15 minutes so
 
01:48:03.189 --> 01:48:03.199 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind we want to we want to
 
01:48:05.109 --> 01:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
talk about we have two
 
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
two senate messages that we uh need to
 
01:48:09.109 --> 01:48:09.119 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
um i'm just gonna go down the ones
 
01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
things that we've or um i've dealt with
 
01:48:13.679 --> 01:48:15.030 align:start position:0%
things that we've or um i've dealt with
um

01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:17.109 --> 01:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
but by the way an update on army the one
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
it was it was attached to a labor bill
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
which was a mistake the the
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
the speaker
 
01:48:30.830 --> 01:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
then senator guida has attached it to a
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
uh um
 
01:48:39.590 --> 01:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
a senate bill over there
 
01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:41.430 align:start position:0%
a senate bill over there
that

01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:42.310 align:start position:0%
that
and

01:48:42.310 --> 01:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:43.270 align:start position:0%
and
it's

01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's i think it passed
 
01:48:47.189 --> 01:48:47.199 align:start position:0%
and it no i guess it was a house bill
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
because it was a house bill over there
 
01:48:51.430 --> 01:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
and and it's and it's a
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
veterans affairs bill
 
01:48:54.629 --> 01:48:54.639 align:start position:0%
it's a non-german but doesn't matter
 
01:48:56.629 --> 01:48:56.639 align:start position:0%
over there if it's germaine or not
 
01:48:56.639 --> 01:48:57.510 align:start position:0%
over there if it's germaine or not
so

01:48:57.510 --> 01:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:48:59.430 --> 01:48:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh i've already i talked to our
 
01:49:01.030 --> 01:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative about baldusero gave a
 
01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
heads up that you know we want this to
 
01:49:06.470 --> 01:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
pass so so that's the update on that one
 
01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:08.470 align:start position:0%
pass so so that's the update on that one
um

01:49:08.470 --> 01:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:10.790 --> 01:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
and there'll probably be a
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
committee a conference on that
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%

01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
the one
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
one other note i want to make before i
 
01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.320 align:start position:0%

01:49:30.709 --> 01:49:30.719 align:start position:0%
we've
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%

01:49:42.870 --> 01:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
whenever we meet
 
01:49:45.270 --> 01:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
because we're going to bring experts in
 
01:49:47.109 --> 01:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
um we're still waiting for the other
 
01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
appointments that we we haven't had in
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
that bill that we would
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
have certain experts in on the panel
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
with us
 
01:49:56.070 --> 01:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
when we call these meetings we'll make
 
01:49:57.669 --> 01:49:57.679 align:start position:0%
sure the whole committee knows
 
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh if you can make it uh you can we we
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
viewed it as education for the whole
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
committee what we did in the commission
 
01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:06.320 align:start position:0%
format so be just keep
 
01:50:08.709 --> 01:50:08.719 align:start position:0%

01:50:11.030 --> 01:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
your emails over the summer period
 
01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%

chair of that committee i talked to him
 
01:51:41.350 --> 01:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
again there was nothing in that bill
 
01:51:43.030 --> 01:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
that impacted us in terms of what the
 
01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
senate did so i said whatever you guys
 
01:51:46.149 --> 01:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
want to do
 
01:51:48.390 --> 01:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
and so they're going to concur i'm just
 
01:51:50.470 --> 01:51:50.480 align:start position:0%
this is just informational at this point
 
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 1584 the county fair bill
 
01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
which is very recent we all remember
 
01:51:59.669 --> 01:51:59.679 align:start position:0%
uh the senate changed that to
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
250 000 for the one year
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
and that that they'd have to come back
 
01:52:07.030 --> 01:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
and ask every year for the two hundred
 
01:52:08.709 --> 01:52:08.719 align:start position:0%
and fifty now
 
01:52:10.950 --> 01:52:10.960 align:start position:0%
what happens when we're second we were
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
second committee on that
 
01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
normally the
 
01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:14.709 align:start position:0%
normally the
uh

01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:14.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:17.669 --> 01:52:17.679 align:start position:0%
paul smith the clerk will notify the
 
01:52:20.070 --> 01:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
chair of the second committee to make
 
01:52:21.669 --> 01:52:21.679 align:start position:0%
sure you talk to the first he didn't do
 
01:52:23.830 --> 01:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
that i saw him yesterday i said you know
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
this one actually had the money part
 
01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:27.679 align:start position:0%
and but i it turns out i was going to
 
01:52:27.679 --> 01:52:29.189 align:start position:0%
and but i it turns out i was going to
call

01:52:29.189 --> 01:52:29.199 align:start position:0%
call
 
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
representative pearl anyway
 
01:52:34.149 --> 01:52:34.159 align:start position:0%
just the bottom line on that is that um
 
01:52:35.510 --> 01:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
he had reached out to lead
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
representative led who was the prime
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
sponsor and uh
 
01:52:41.189 --> 01:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner jasper
 
01:52:43.270 --> 01:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
and they're both okay with it so they're
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
going to concur with that but that's
 
01:52:46.470 --> 01:52:46.480 align:start position:0%
just as an update for the committee as
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
to what's happened to some of our bills
 
01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:49.970 align:start position:0%
to what's happened to some of our bills
um

01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:49.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:49.980 --> 01:52:51.109 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:52:51.109 --> 01:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
then there's two others and
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
say again it'll be in the budget or not
 
01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:02.719 align:start position:0%
the 250 is going to be 50 it won't be
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
every year no just be it one time
 
01:53:07.830 --> 01:53:07.840 align:start position:0%
they have to ask every budget exactly
 
01:53:10.149 --> 01:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
exactly the fund stays i mean the part
 
01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
of the bill that came to us because of
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
the fund establish the fund
 
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
with the fund is there they're gonna
 
01:53:18.070 --> 01:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
they're gonna seat it with 250. it's not
 
01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
going to be 250 a year until we hit the
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
million remember that part of it
 
01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:23.830 align:start position:0%
million remember that part of it
so

01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:25.030 align:start position:0%
so
now

01:53:25.030 --> 01:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:53:26.870 --> 01:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
i think you give me a heads up on this
 
01:53:31.189 --> 01:53:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh ribs around me and uh that
 
01:53:31.199 --> 01:53:33.189 align:start position:0%
uh ribs around me and uh that
tomorrow

01:53:33.189 --> 01:53:33.199 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
01:53:35.750 --> 01:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's some senate bill senate bill 313
 
01:53:37.990 --> 01:53:38.000 align:start position:0%
and senate bill 316.
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh one was well the first 13 was the
 
01:53:42.870 --> 01:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
professor these are all recent
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
professional office fees bill that
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
representative amy put a basically an
 
01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:48.229 align:start position:0%
representative amy put a basically an
administrative

01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
01:53:49.830 --> 01:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
cleaning on it
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
low probability that
 
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
that they could ask for a committee on
 
01:53:55.750 --> 01:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
conference because we amended their bill
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
they could but we'll have to act on the
 
01:53:57.840 --> 01:53:58.790 align:start position:0%
they could but we'll have to act on the
floor

01:53:58.790 --> 01:53:58.800 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
we'll uh in terms of appointing if they
 
01:54:02.070 --> 01:54:02.080 align:start position:0%
ask for a committee
 
01:54:04.070 --> 01:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
on the floor tomorrow i will or thursday
 
01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:05.030 align:start position:0%
on the floor tomorrow i will or thursday
i'll

01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'll
 
01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
i'll pick up
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
you'll probably be on that one right
 
01:54:09.750 --> 01:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
because we're 17 nothing
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
yeah it was executive departments
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
and exactly
 
01:54:17.109 --> 01:54:17.119 align:start position:0%
it's basically there oh it is theirs
 
01:54:18.790 --> 01:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
right it is there so we wouldn't we
 
01:54:20.470 --> 01:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be involved in that although i
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
would i would talk to uh the
 
01:54:23.830 --> 01:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
representative the chair of that
 
01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:25.030 align:start position:0%
representative the chair of that
committee

01:54:25.030 --> 01:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:54:27.830 --> 01:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
but and then 316 the lucky seven bill
 
01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
where i i put that full our amendment on
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
i don't i can't foresee them uh asking
 
01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
for a committee on that but they they
 
01:54:35.589 --> 01:54:35.599 align:start position:0%
could so i'm just
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
throwing that out
 
01:54:37.679 --> 01:54:38.629 align:start position:0%
throwing that out
um

01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:40.550 --> 01:54:40.560 align:start position:0%
okay so the two that we have to really
 
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
talk about are house bill 1221
 
01:54:46.870 --> 01:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
which was the rates of
 
01:54:46.880 --> 01:54:47.910 align:start position:0%
which was the rates of
of

01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
business profit tax and that was the
 
01:54:53.189 --> 01:54:53.199 align:start position:0%
bill it was a bit of a partisan bill
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
partisan bill um
 
01:54:57.350 --> 01:54:57.360 align:start position:0%
okay 7.6
 
01:54:59.830 --> 01:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
to 7.5 i was trying to be nice about it
 
01:54:59.840 --> 01:55:00.950 align:start position:0%
to 7.5 i was trying to be nice about it
so

01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:02.790 --> 01:55:02.800 align:start position:0%
um you have
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:09.669 --> 01:55:09.679 align:start position:0%
is they have the uh side by side here
 
01:55:14.310 --> 01:55:14.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:16.950 --> 01:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
what they did is if you just read the
 
01:55:18.709 --> 01:55:18.719 align:start position:0%
the bowl didn't show out in the in the
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh but in that first section on the
 
01:55:22.310 --> 01:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
senate version
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
this bill also provides for a one-time
 
01:55:27.669 --> 01:55:27.679 align:start position:0%
payment by the state of an amount equal
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
to 7.5 percent of required political
 
01:55:33.510 --> 01:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
subdivision employer contributions made
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
to the state retirement system for group
 
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
one teachers
 
01:55:40.229 --> 01:55:40.239 align:start position:0%
and all group two members
 
01:55:40.239 --> 01:55:42.709 align:start position:0%
and all group two members
so

01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that
 
01:55:47.830 --> 01:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
the the 7.5
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
passed the house
 
01:55:53.030 --> 01:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
and and it made it over to
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
01:55:56.470 --> 01:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
and the in the ways
 
01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:57.760 align:start position:0%
whatever committee i'm assuming ways of
 
01:56:00.550 --> 01:56:00.560 align:start position:0%
means killed it but then there was a
 
01:56:04.550 --> 01:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
floor amendment to add to 7.5 one time
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
next year
 
01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:07.109 align:start position:0%
next year
okay

01:56:07.109 --> 01:56:07.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:09.350 --> 01:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
and i think par someone told me it was
 
01:56:12.950 --> 01:56:12.960 align:start position:0%
in honor of renny yes it was his bill it
 
01:56:15.350 --> 01:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
was his bill so that they decided to do
 
01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:17.360 align:start position:0%
that which was fine
 
01:56:19.990 --> 01:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
so i i said well and then the only
 
01:56:21.910 --> 01:56:21.920 align:start position:0%
question i had was
 
01:56:23.669 --> 01:56:23.679 align:start position:0%
how much money are we talking about here
 
01:56:26.470 --> 01:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
and it turns out it's around 28 million
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
i've been in conversation with
 
01:56:29.430 --> 01:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:30.390 align:start position:0%
representative um
almi

01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.400 align:start position:0%
almi
 
01:56:31.510 --> 01:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
and then and then she said well is that
 
01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:34.390 align:start position:0%
and then and then she said well is that
an

01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
is that an
 
01:56:37.990 --> 01:56:38.000 align:start position:0%
actuarial number
 
01:56:40.149 --> 01:56:40.159 align:start position:0%
and it turns out we've changed the way
 
01:56:42.629 --> 01:56:42.639 align:start position:0%
we do this it used to be
 
01:56:44.470 --> 01:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
um and you can weigh in my friend in the
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
back there chris we used to
 
01:56:50.149 --> 01:56:50.159 align:start position:0%
we used to
 
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
we would ask the actuaries a lot of
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
times you know can you do this at bill's
 
01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
gonna what was the impact and they
 
01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't charge us and then at one point
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
they said wait a minute
 
01:57:01.510 --> 01:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
wait a minute this is a lot of work
 
01:57:02.709 --> 01:57:02.719 align:start position:0%
we're going to charge you we're going to
 
01:57:03.990 --> 01:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
charge the state
 
01:57:05.750 --> 01:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
every time we did one of these before
 
01:57:07.669 --> 01:57:07.679 align:start position:0%
the bill actually became
 
01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
you know passed
 
01:57:09.599 --> 01:57:10.629 align:start position:0%
you know passed
so

01:57:10.629 --> 01:57:10.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:57:10.639 --> 01:57:12.149 align:start position:0%
so
uh

01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
so they did not do
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
an actuarial number on this just fyi i
 
01:57:19.030 --> 01:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
mean it's going to be in the ballpark i
 
01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
mean it wasn't like they didn't pull the
 
01:57:21.669 --> 01:57:21.679 align:start position:0%
number out of the air the people who
 
01:57:21.679 --> 01:57:22.550 align:start position:0%
number out of the air the people who
know

01:57:22.550 --> 01:57:22.560 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
kind of estimated probably be a couple
 
01:57:25.830 --> 01:57:25.840 align:start position:0%
million either way which in the grand
 
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
scheme of things is nothing
 
01:57:30.709 --> 01:57:30.719 align:start position:0%
so i have no problem with this but i
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
said to myself you know 28 million maybe
 
01:57:35.189 --> 01:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
i should talk to the speaker
 
01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
so i talked to the speaker um i actually
 
01:57:39.910 --> 01:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
brought chris up with me at one point
 
01:57:41.990 --> 01:57:42.000 align:start position:0%
because he was confused between this one
 
01:57:43.750 --> 01:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
and another there was another pension
 
01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
one that was like 42 million
 
01:57:49.030 --> 01:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
we he's all straightened out now and i
 
01:57:51.109 --> 01:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
said okay chief men call him chief but
 
01:57:53.030 --> 01:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know how uh you know
 
01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:54.310 align:start position:0%
you know how uh you know
what

01:57:54.310 --> 01:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:57:55.830 --> 01:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
you know what you're with your guys
 
01:57:58.470 --> 01:57:58.480 align:start position:0%
because i i said i'm willing to concur
 
01:58:00.470 --> 01:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
depending on the committee but
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh on this
 
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
and he said well i'll let you know
 
01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
tomorrow meaning today so
 
01:58:07.350 --> 01:58:07.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know but
 
01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:08.550 align:start position:0%
i don't know but
so

01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
i just want the it's a one-time thing
 
01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:13.109 align:start position:0%
i just want the it's a one-time thing
obviously

01:58:13.109 --> 01:58:13.119 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
we we'd like to see the bill saved
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
because we want to see that's 7.6 go to
 
01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:20.629 align:start position:0%
because we want to see that's 7.6 go to
7.5

01:58:20.629 --> 01:58:20.639 align:start position:0%
7.5
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
at the very least
 
01:58:24.550 --> 01:58:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh what i'll say to the speaker if he
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
says no i'm going to pull the
 
01:58:28.629 --> 01:58:28.639 align:start position:0%
here's the
 
01:58:30.629 --> 01:58:30.639 align:start position:0%
if if if the speaker says no problem
 
01:58:32.830 --> 01:58:32.840 align:start position:0%
with the 40 or the 28
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
million because let me tell you he
 
01:58:37.430 --> 01:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
pulled out a spreadsheet just understand
 
01:58:38.709 --> 01:58:38.719 align:start position:0%
and the reason i purposely asked him
 
01:58:40.550 --> 01:58:40.560 align:start position:0%
because i know there's a lot of ass
 
01:58:43.109 --> 01:58:43.119 align:start position:0%
right now a lot of ass and he had a
 
01:58:45.270 --> 01:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet as to there's only so much
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
that can be spent
 
01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
and so i was just making sure that that
 
01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
was on his list
 
01:58:54.390 --> 01:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
but you know this 28 without us saying
 
01:58:56.550 --> 01:58:56.560 align:start position:0%
you know let's do this so
 
01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:57.510 align:start position:0%
you know let's do this so
so

01:58:57.510 --> 01:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:57.520 --> 01:58:59.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:58:59.510 --> 01:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:00.310 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:00.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:01.430 align:start position:0%
so
i

01:59:01.430 --> 01:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:59:02.790 --> 01:59:02.800 align:start position:0%
i just want to get the sense i mean is
 
01:59:07.350 --> 01:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
everybody okay with with the 28 million
 
01:59:09.270 --> 01:59:09.280 align:start position:0%
being added
 
01:59:11.510 --> 01:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
depends on things you know patrick i
 
01:59:13.350 --> 01:59:13.360 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem with the 28 million
 
01:59:14.870 --> 01:59:14.880 align:start position:0%
being that i have a problem with it just
 
01:59:16.709 --> 01:59:16.719 align:start position:0%
being a one-year
 
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
one-year retirement contribution
 
01:59:20.950 --> 01:59:20.960 align:start position:0%
how can how can
 
01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:23.750 align:start position:0%
how can how can
towns

01:59:23.750 --> 01:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:25.990 --> 01:59:26.000 align:start position:0%
go next year when they set their budgets
 
01:59:27.109 --> 01:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
if they don't know if they're going to
 
01:59:27.119 --> 01:59:27.990 align:start position:0%
if they don't know if they're going to
get

01:59:27.990 --> 01:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
get
 
01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.270 align:start position:0%
get
another

01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:59:33.270 --> 01:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
i i understand where you're coming from
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
i i i just this is an irish
 
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
i understand a totally non-germane
 
01:59:44.229 --> 01:59:44.239 align:start position:0%
amendment attached to our bill here so i
 
01:59:48.149 --> 01:59:48.159 align:start position:0%
don't know you know i uh representative
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
tucker you had your hand up no i was
 
01:59:54.149 --> 01:59:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:54.159 --> 01:59:56.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:59:56.310 --> 01:59:56.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:59:57.830 --> 01:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
yeah because we could talk all day about
 
01:59:59.430 --> 01:59:59.440 align:start position:0%
this uh you know we're gonna have all
 
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
day representative pillsbury
 
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um yeah i mean i
 
02:00:07.910 --> 02:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
only saw this on sunday evening um but
 
02:00:10.149 --> 02:00:10.159 align:start position:0%
just reading the preferatory language
 
02:00:12.229 --> 02:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of legislative
 
02:00:12.239 --> 02:00:14.149 align:start position:0%
there's a whole bunch of legislative
findings

02:00:14.149 --> 02:00:14.159 align:start position:0%
findings
 
02:00:15.669 --> 02:00:15.679 align:start position:0%
i take it as
 
02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
an intent that it would represent a
 
02:00:17.920 --> 02:00:18.950 align:start position:0%
an intent that it would represent a
one-time

02:00:18.950 --> 02:00:18.960 align:start position:0%
one-time
 
02:00:21.510 --> 02:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
curtailment of the real property tax so
 
02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:23.679 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't affect the calculations
 
02:00:25.350 --> 02:00:25.360 align:start position:0%
that go into the spending side of the
 
02:00:27.910 --> 02:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
munici budget and having been on a town
 
02:00:29.510 --> 02:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee that's the way i would
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
so some of the hands online
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so
 
02:00:38.950 --> 02:00:38.960 align:start position:0%
i had a conversation said on the guide
 
02:00:40.870 --> 02:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
over and weighs the means in the senate
 
02:00:43.109 --> 02:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
and a lot of this was around the concern
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
of ongoing expenses in an unknown
 
02:00:45.599 --> 02:00:46.790 align:start position:0%
of ongoing expenses in an unknown
economy

02:00:46.790 --> 02:00:46.800 align:start position:0%
economy
 
02:00:48.709 --> 02:00:48.719 align:start position:0%
um and the fact that we don't know we're
 
02:00:50.070 --> 02:00:50.080 align:start position:0%
gonna have 28 million dollars with
 
02:00:51.270 --> 02:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
everything else that's going on right
 
02:00:53.109 --> 02:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
now down the road but we do know we have
 
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
it right now and so let's do what we can
 
02:00:57.030 --> 02:00:57.040 align:start position:0%
for the best purposes of the towns and
 
02:00:59.430 --> 02:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
cities which give give them the 7.5
 
02:01:01.510 --> 02:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
reevaluate and then decide whether we
 
02:01:03.510 --> 02:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
can continue this on and i i think again
 
02:01:05.589 --> 02:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
it's one time money is this
 
02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
appropriation this was a swap from the
 
02:01:09.750 --> 02:01:09.760 align:start position:0%
28 million dollars that we already
 
02:01:12.390 --> 02:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
associated the bill that we sent over
 
02:01:14.390 --> 02:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
so it was already earmarked
 
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
but the one we sent over was year marked
 
02:01:17.430 --> 02:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
year after year after year after year
 
02:01:20.149 --> 02:01:20.159 align:start position:0%
this one is just we know we have uh
 
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:21.920 align:start position:0%
funds now let's give it to the towns
 
02:01:23.910 --> 02:01:23.920 align:start position:0%
help them out and we'll see what's going
 
02:01:25.910 --> 02:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
on you know we heard we're talking about
 
02:01:28.709 --> 02:01:28.719 align:start position:0%
recessions earlier today with dra so
 
02:01:30.870 --> 02:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
nobody knows what's going on and putting
 
02:01:32.950 --> 02:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
an uncertainty of a guarantee year over
 
02:01:34.629 --> 02:01:34.639 align:start position:0%
year versus let's give them what we know
 
02:01:36.629 --> 02:01:36.639 align:start position:0%
we can guarantee right now and then
 
02:01:37.990 --> 02:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
figure out where to move on from there
 
02:01:42.149 --> 02:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay any other hands of yeah oh okay
 
02:01:47.990 --> 02:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
thank you the language says seven and a
 
02:01:52.629 --> 02:01:52.639 align:start position:0%
half percent of both the normal and
 
02:01:55.589 --> 02:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
accrued liability contributions
 
02:01:57.430 --> 02:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
the normal i'm comfortable with the
 
02:01:59.990 --> 02:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
accrued liability contributions can you
 
02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
explain that to me a little bit i i wish
 
02:02:05.750 --> 02:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
i knew again this is not our thing i
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
mean i i don't know chris do you have
 
02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i have a lot to offer but i
 
02:02:26.229 --> 02:02:26.239 align:start position:0%
think the intent is to
 
02:02:29.030 --> 02:02:29.040 align:start position:0%
just make it clear that it's the entire
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
employer contribution amount
 
02:02:33.750 --> 02:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
that includes group two and group one
 
02:02:35.990 --> 02:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
teachers that would be seven point five
 
02:02:39.189 --> 02:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
percent of that as i'm
 
02:02:41.030 --> 02:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
as many people are aware the the
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
employer contribution is broken into the
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
current year amount that you pay plus
 
02:02:48.390 --> 02:02:48.400 align:start position:0%
the unfunded liability aspect or the
 
02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
under the accrued liability aspect
 
02:02:53.430 --> 02:02:53.440 align:start position:0%
and that's where you get your percent
 
02:02:54.950 --> 02:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
that they have to pay is a portion of
 
02:02:56.950 --> 02:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
retirement so i think that the language
 
02:02:59.189 --> 02:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
just is to be clear that it's the whole
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
number not just the current year amount
 
02:03:05.589 --> 02:03:05.599 align:start position:0%
which is a lesser number so like
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
i'm just going to use a an example
 
02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know if your employer contribution
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
is 30
 
02:03:13.589 --> 02:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
of that amount
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
maybe 25 is taking care of the unfunded
 
02:03:19.990 --> 02:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
liability aspect and 5 is what's your
 
02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
current liability so they're just saying
 
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
let's make sure we take care of
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
or include the full amount when we do
 
02:03:28.229 --> 02:03:28.239 align:start position:0%
this calculation let's say let's do
 
02:03:30.310 --> 02:03:30.320 align:start position:0%
seven and a half percent
 
02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:31.830 align:start position:0%
seven and a half percent
but

02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
i would be happily be corrected by
 
02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
somebody with more knowledge in myself
 
02:03:39.030 --> 02:03:39.040 align:start position:0%
it just as
 
02:03:41.589 --> 02:03:41.599 align:start position:0%
i fear that it could be
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
read as seven and a half percent of the
 
02:03:46.629 --> 02:03:46.639 align:start position:0%
accrued liability meaning not just the
 
02:03:49.750 --> 02:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
current portion of that liability but
 
02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
the whole enchilada which would be
 
02:03:53.510 --> 02:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
ridiculous i don't think they make that
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
kind of mistake
 
02:03:55.280 --> 02:03:58.790 align:start position:0%
kind of mistake
if

02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:00.870 --> 02:04:00.880 align:start position:0%
right so if you recall the um bill that
 
02:04:04.310 --> 02:04:04.320 align:start position:0%
the house passed um that started in 24
 
02:04:05.589 --> 02:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
so it was a seven and a half it's the
 
02:04:07.669 --> 02:04:07.679 align:start position:0%
same basically essentially the same idea
 
02:04:09.589 --> 02:04:09.599 align:start position:0%
what you have in front of you now
 
02:04:11.589 --> 02:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
the cost of that in terms of the fiscal
 
02:04:13.990 --> 02:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
note was just around 28 million dollars
 
02:04:15.669 --> 02:04:15.679 align:start position:0%
the same language was there around the
 
02:04:18.310 --> 02:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
accrued liability and and um
 
02:04:18.320 --> 02:04:19.350 align:start position:0%
accrued liability and and um
current

02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:19.360 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:21.760 align:start position:0%
so i again i believe the intent is to
 
02:04:23.270 --> 02:04:23.280 align:start position:0%
make it clear to the retirement system
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
that when they set their rates it's
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
based on this accrued liability as well
 
02:04:29.669 --> 02:04:29.679 align:start position:0%
as your current liability that that's
 
02:04:31.589 --> 02:04:31.599 align:start position:0%
the number they percent they want to be
 
02:04:34.069 --> 02:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
using when they calculate this 7.5
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
percent towards the community's
 
02:04:38.870 --> 02:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
revenue sharing or contribution
 
02:04:41.350 --> 02:04:41.360 align:start position:0%
but i don't believe it would be
 
02:04:42.550 --> 02:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
to your concern i don't think they're
 
02:04:43.830 --> 02:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
going to take the
 
02:04:45.510 --> 02:04:45.520 align:start position:0%
five billion dollars of unfunded
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
liability and say
 
02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to use that as the base
 
02:04:49.510 --> 02:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
number and figure out what we need in
 
02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
one year to give out to the communities
 
02:04:53.510 --> 02:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's smoothed out over a period of
 
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
time i didn't mean to be pedantic i just
 
02:04:58.229 --> 02:04:58.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to be cautious
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
this is the house position
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
this is the house position because it
 
02:05:11.030 --> 02:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
passed the house as a multi-year
 
02:05:13.910 --> 02:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
commitment a permanent commitment
 
02:05:15.750 --> 02:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:05:18.550 --> 02:05:18.560 align:start position:0%
the senate took i believe exactly the
 
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
same language i think they did i heard
 
02:05:20.800 --> 02:05:21.830 align:start position:0%
same language i think they did i heard
and

02:05:21.830 --> 02:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:23.189 --> 02:05:23.199 align:start position:0%
and took
 
02:05:26.310 --> 02:05:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh took it down to a single year
 
02:05:29.430 --> 02:05:29.440 align:start position:0%
on it's supposed to be paid out in the
 
02:05:32.790 --> 02:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
22 23 budget
 
02:05:36.550 --> 02:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
as of the first it becomes effective
 
02:05:39.830 --> 02:05:39.840 align:start position:0%
july 1 of this year
 
02:05:43.030 --> 02:05:43.040 align:start position:0%
but that at least gives the towns
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
i think all the towns will have done
 
02:05:45.119 --> 02:05:45.910 align:start position:0%
i think all the towns will have done
their

02:05:45.910 --> 02:05:45.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:47.669 align:start position:0%
their
budget

02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
budget
 
02:05:47.679 --> 02:05:51.830 align:start position:0%
budget
for

02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:54.470 --> 02:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
4 22
 
02:05:57.669 --> 02:05:57.679 align:start position:0%
22 no 23
 
02:05:57.679 --> 02:05:58.790 align:start position:0%
22 no 23
huh

02:05:58.790 --> 02:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
huh
 
02:06:01.910 --> 02:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
and we do them in march and some places
 
02:06:06.709 --> 02:06:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
or i guess i guess some of the cities do
 
02:06:11.189 --> 02:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
them in november
 
02:06:11.199 --> 02:06:12.310 align:start position:0%
them in november
yeah

02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:20.229 --> 02:06:20.239 align:start position:0%
yeah calendar year right
 
02:06:20.239 --> 02:06:22.950 align:start position:0%
yeah calendar year right
um

02:06:22.950 --> 02:06:22.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:25.189 --> 02:06:25.199 align:start position:0%
i guess ours has gone through a year too
 
02:06:26.629 --> 02:06:26.639 align:start position:0%
i can't remember
 
02:06:28.790 --> 02:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
but at least that means that they've got
 
02:06:31.030 --> 02:06:31.040 align:start position:0%
six months to
 
02:06:32.950 --> 02:06:32.960 align:start position:0%
know that they have that money for one
 
02:06:34.629 --> 02:06:34.639 align:start position:0%
year and what are they going to do with
 
02:06:34.639 --> 02:06:36.470 align:start position:0%
year and what are they going to do with
it

02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:37.589 align:start position:0%
it
but

02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:06:39.669 --> 02:06:39.679 align:start position:0%
well you know
 
02:06:42.390 --> 02:06:42.400 align:start position:0%
i do really plan on a big debate on this
 
02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:44.390 align:start position:0%
i do really plan on a big debate on this
because

02:06:44.390 --> 02:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:06:46.790 --> 02:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's going to happen or it's not
 
02:06:46.800 --> 02:06:50.870 align:start position:0%
it's going to happen or it's not
what

02:06:50.870 --> 02:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:50.880 --> 02:06:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:06:53.990 --> 02:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:56.069 --> 02:06:56.079 align:start position:0%
oh right right that's the but one of the
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
things they could come up with was not
 
02:07:07.830 --> 02:07:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:09.430 --> 02:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
so all right
 
02:07:10.950 --> 02:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
02:07:10.960 --> 02:07:14.550 align:start position:0%
okay um
so

02:07:14.550 --> 02:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:16.310 --> 02:07:16.320 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
02:07:16.320 --> 02:07:20.390 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
okay

02:07:20.390 --> 02:07:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:21.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:07:21.510 --> 02:07:21.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:27.910 align:start position:0%
okay
right

02:07:27.910 --> 02:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:27.920 --> 02:07:29.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
except for when it comes up that the
 
02:07:34.790 --> 02:07:34.800 align:start position:0%
next year you have to add that back in
 
02:07:37.350 --> 02:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
and people see their taxes going up when
 
02:07:39.109 --> 02:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have
 
02:07:40.470 --> 02:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
and they actually call out the property
 
02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
tax relief act of 2022.
 
02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:45.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so what happens at the
 
02:07:46.870 --> 02:07:46.880 align:start position:0%
at the uh
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
the house position that we voted on just
 
02:07:52.870 --> 02:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
this past week where we reinforce
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
the idea that will be
 
02:07:54.480 --> 02:07:55.669 align:start position:0%
the idea that will be
multi-year

02:07:55.669 --> 02:07:55.679 align:start position:0%
multi-year
 
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
we didn't vote on that last week did we
 
02:07:59.910 --> 02:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
i thought it was there didn't
 
02:07:59.920 --> 02:08:00.790 align:start position:0%
i thought it was there didn't
yeah

02:08:00.790 --> 02:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:08:01.910 --> 02:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
it was
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
before that it was it went to the senate
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
and the senate considered it they
 
02:08:08.709 --> 02:08:08.719 align:start position:0%
considered it they killed it in the
 
02:08:11.030 --> 02:08:11.040 align:start position:0%
committee yeah it was on the floor that
 
02:08:12.709 --> 02:08:12.719 align:start position:0%
senator bradley
 
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere behind back room somewhere
 
02:08:18.990 --> 02:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
there was discussion and they decided to
 
02:08:21.270 --> 02:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
re-resurrect it
 
02:08:23.669 --> 02:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
using the same language but for one year
 
02:08:25.430 --> 02:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and it was on the floor of the
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
senate that this was
 
02:08:29.669 --> 02:08:29.679 align:start position:0%
was passed and i think that they
 
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
they either
 
02:08:40.390 --> 02:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's what i thought
 
02:08:43.510 --> 02:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien was up last week
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
and made a
 
02:08:47.589 --> 02:08:47.599 align:start position:0%
a presentation on this that we voted on
 
02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
i i that we put it onto a senate bill ah
 
02:08:53.750 --> 02:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
grips of a bromine may yeah interject
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
yes um so the house bill that went over
 
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
to the senate um they they essentially
 
02:09:02.470 --> 02:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
it killed that either take table their
 
02:09:04.470 --> 02:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
itled it and then their
 
02:09:06.310 --> 02:09:06.320 align:start position:0%
proposal back to the house is what
 
02:09:07.990 --> 02:09:08.000 align:start position:0%
you're debating right now
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
last week the house
 
02:09:11.669 --> 02:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
reaffirmed its position
 
02:09:13.430 --> 02:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
and attached a floor amendment to house
 
02:09:15.910 --> 02:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
assuming senate bill 333
 
02:09:18.470 --> 02:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
which basically um would
 
02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
provide the 7.5 starting in uh 2024 it
 
02:09:24.069 --> 02:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
would happen every year thereafter
 
02:09:25.589 --> 02:09:25.599 align:start position:0%
basically the house position that was in
 
02:09:27.589 --> 02:09:27.599 align:start position:0%
your house bill that went over
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
um so so
 
02:09:30.069 --> 02:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
there is a
 
02:09:32.229 --> 02:09:32.239 align:start position:0%
senate bill that has the that position
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
on it
 
02:09:35.430 --> 02:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
um i don't know what the status of that
 
02:09:38.550 --> 02:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
might be at this time but but for them
 
02:09:40.229 --> 02:09:40.239 align:start position:0%
for them to take
 
02:09:41.669 --> 02:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
this though and add it to this attach it
 
02:09:43.189 --> 02:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
to one of our bills
 
02:09:44.390 --> 02:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
because it was convenient they just
 
02:09:45.990 --> 02:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
found a bill to attach it to doesn't
 
02:09:48.069 --> 02:09:48.079 align:start position:0%
matter if it's jermaine or not so that's
 
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
what they did
 
02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:50.550 align:start position:0%
what they did
right

02:09:50.550 --> 02:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
so do you remember which committee is in
 
02:09:56.229 --> 02:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
charge of 333 if it comes back from the
 
02:09:56.239 --> 02:09:58.149 align:start position:0%
charge of 333 if it comes back from the
senate

02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
senate
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
yeah e-dna correct
 
02:10:01.119 --> 02:10:01.990 align:start position:0%
yeah e-dna correct
um

02:10:01.990 --> 02:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
but again we we haven't i don't believe
 
02:10:05.669 --> 02:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
anybody's heard what the the senate
 
02:10:07.510 --> 02:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
intends on doing if they're gonna
 
02:10:09.990 --> 02:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
concur non-concurrent and non-concurrent
 
02:10:12.229 --> 02:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
or request a recovery conference right
 
02:10:13.830 --> 02:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
um they essentially could say that we've
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
provided you our position
 
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
in um house bill 1221
 
02:10:20.390 --> 02:10:20.400 align:start position:0%
um and that we don't
 
02:10:22.229 --> 02:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
want to do anything with this bill but
 
02:10:23.350 --> 02:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
if they
 
02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:24.350 align:start position:0%
if they
like

02:10:24.350 --> 02:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:10:27.430 --> 02:10:27.440 align:start position:0%
333 the way they had it
 
02:10:27.440 --> 02:10:29.030 align:start position:0%
333 the way they had it
on

02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:10:31.030 --> 02:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
and decide to ask for a committee of
 
02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:32.310 align:start position:0%
and decide to ask for a committee of
conference

02:10:32.310 --> 02:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
conference
 
02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:33.189 align:start position:0%
conference
then

02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:10:34.550 --> 02:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
that sent the bill is the one that has
 
02:10:38.950 --> 02:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
to respond
 
02:10:40.830 --> 02:10:40.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day
 
02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:43.679 align:start position:0%
tomorrow when the senate sends over
 
02:10:52.069 --> 02:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
this could be one of the ones that comes
 
02:10:55.350 --> 02:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
back to us
 
02:10:57.270 --> 02:10:57.280 align:start position:0%
we don't know we don't know that yet
 
02:10:59.910 --> 02:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
we don't know question yes
 
02:11:02.790 --> 02:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
is the uh
 
02:11:05.830 --> 02:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
senate bill 333
 
02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:07.510 align:start position:0%
senate bill 333
attachment

02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
attachment
 
02:11:10.870 --> 02:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh for the same
 
02:11:13.910 --> 02:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
you said fiscal year 24
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
02:11:17.510 --> 02:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
there's this bill fiscal year 23 that
 
02:11:19.350 --> 02:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
we're talking about right now
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
so so what you have before you is the
 
02:11:23.109 --> 02:11:23.119 align:start position:0%
senate's position
 
02:11:26.709 --> 02:11:26.719 align:start position:0%
on providing a municipal contribution
 
02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
for one year they didn't agree with
 
02:11:31.030 --> 02:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
providing it um year after year is
 
02:11:33.990 --> 02:11:34.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23. and and there um the
 
02:11:35.510 --> 02:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
senate's position was to provide that in
 
02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
23 so that it could be used to that so
 
02:11:41.109 --> 02:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
so then the other bill is for a period
 
02:11:43.750 --> 02:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
of time it starts in fiscal year 24.
 
02:11:45.589 --> 02:11:45.599 align:start position:0%
that's correct so they're really not in
 
02:11:48.790 --> 02:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
conflict with other this this bill
 
02:11:54.870 --> 02:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:57.669 --> 02:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
yeah i think i think we've okay
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
we all concur
 
02:12:01.510 --> 02:12:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh but stay tuned i will we'll see what
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
happens with the speaker in terms of and
 
02:12:05.030 --> 02:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
i'll let everybody know
 
02:12:06.470 --> 02:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
all right let's let's move on to the
 
02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
next let's move on to the next bill real
 
02:12:11.669 --> 02:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
quick uh we had an uh preliminary
 
02:12:11.679 --> 02:12:13.350 align:start position:0%
quick uh we had an uh preliminary
conversation

02:12:13.350 --> 02:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:12:17.350 --> 02:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
about uh house bill 1097
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
and that was relative to the taxation of
 
02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
income of new hampshire residents when
 
02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
working remotely
 
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
for an out-of-state employee or employer
 
02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:28.069 align:start position:0%
for an out-of-state employee or employer
and

02:12:28.069 --> 02:12:28.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
the senate modified the language and
 
02:12:32.870 --> 02:12:32.880 align:start position:0%
there's a side-by-side on that
 
02:12:32.880 --> 02:12:34.709 align:start position:0%
there's a side-by-side on that
um

02:12:34.709 --> 02:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:34.719 --> 02:12:35.990 align:start position:0%
um
it's

02:12:35.990 --> 02:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
this one
 
02:12:38.790 --> 02:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
and the key thing is the language in
 
02:12:41.350 --> 02:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
that first block there and uh i think
 
02:12:43.750 --> 02:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
representative spillsbury you you you
 
02:12:45.109 --> 02:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
addressed that
 
02:12:47.350 --> 02:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
the last time we met
 
02:12:49.030 --> 02:12:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh representative ames i think he said
 
02:12:51.189 --> 02:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
he needed more time to think about it
 
02:12:53.189 --> 02:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
um but they also
 
02:12:54.550 --> 02:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
they took out the
 
02:12:55.910 --> 02:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
let me ask representative supposedly
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
they took out
 
02:12:57.119 --> 02:12:58.870 align:start position:0%
they took out
uh

02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:13:02.310 --> 02:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh i can give you a very quick
 
02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
they took those out the changes are
 
02:13:06.790 --> 02:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
a caption 78 f1
 
02:13:12.550 --> 02:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
where we had purpose they've added
 
02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:14.790 align:start position:0%
where we had purpose they've added
declaration

02:13:14.790 --> 02:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
declaration
 
02:13:16.709 --> 02:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
and that goes to comments that uh
 
02:13:19.270 --> 02:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative almi had made i believe
 
02:13:20.550 --> 02:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
whether purpose was sufficient enough to
 
02:13:24.149 --> 02:13:24.159 align:start position:0%
state that we're actually changing our
 
02:13:24.159 --> 02:13:25.589 align:start position:0%
state that we're actually changing our
position

02:13:25.589 --> 02:13:25.599 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
anyway um
 
02:13:33.030 --> 02:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:34.229 align:start position:0%
 
income

02:13:34.229 --> 02:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
in the fourth line from employer
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
employee relationships such as wage
 
02:13:41.109 --> 02:13:41.119 align:start position:0%
income salary income or other employee
 
02:13:41.119 --> 02:13:43.669 align:start position:0%
income salary income or other employee
compensation

02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
and they changed
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
earned and received to earned or
 
02:13:49.040 --> 02:13:51.350 align:start position:0%
earned and received to earned or
received

02:13:51.350 --> 02:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
received
 
02:13:53.510 --> 02:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
and they changed in the second to last
 
02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:54.550 align:start position:0%
and they changed in the second to last
line

02:13:54.550 --> 02:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:13:56.550 --> 02:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
may to shout
 
02:13:58.790 --> 02:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
and i think they were very responsive to
 
02:14:00.950 --> 02:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
the suggestions that were made to them i
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
i'm pleased with the uh language i think
 
02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
it very much improves what we have done
 
02:14:08.069 --> 02:14:08.079 align:start position:0%
and so i recommend it right
 
02:14:09.270 --> 02:14:09.280 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
02:14:11.510 --> 02:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
did the gray highlighting when we make
 
02:14:14.470 --> 02:14:14.480 align:start position:0%
copies goes away that's a problem
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
um like we have to use some something
 
02:14:18.629 --> 02:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
else to do when we make
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
xerox because it's gray highlight also
 
02:14:22.550 --> 02:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
indicates and
 
02:14:24.149 --> 02:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
and the original i don't know what i did
 
02:14:26.229 --> 02:14:26.239 align:start position:0%
with the original but the original was i
 
02:14:26.239 --> 02:14:27.270 align:start position:0%
with the original but the original was i
could

02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:14:29.830 --> 02:14:29.840 align:start position:0%
clearly see the uh
 
02:14:31.589 --> 02:14:31.599 align:start position:0%
the gray lines but
 
02:14:34.229 --> 02:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
but how about uh 78 f
 
02:14:35.350 --> 02:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
2 and
 
02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:36.390 align:start position:0%
2 and
3

02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
3
 
02:14:37.990 --> 02:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
is that you okay with that being
 
02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.510 align:start position:0%
is that you okay with that being
eliminated

02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:40.470 align:start position:0%
eliminated
okay

02:14:40.470 --> 02:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:41.910 align:start position:0%
okay
so

02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:42.870 align:start position:0%
so
yes

02:14:42.870 --> 02:14:42.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:14:44.550 --> 02:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
they're deleted
 
02:14:48.390 --> 02:14:48.400 align:start position:0%
because they simply are surplusage
 
02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:49.910 align:start position:0%
because they simply are surplusage
by

02:14:49.910 --> 02:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:14:51.990 --> 02:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
making uh
 
02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
the description of what tax we are
 
02:14:56.950 --> 02:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
talking about more clear in lines
 
02:14:58.709 --> 02:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh four and five
 
02:15:00.870 --> 02:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
then it becomes completely unnecessary
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
to distinguish this tax from the
 
02:15:05.030 --> 02:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
business tax okay good
 
02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:06.069 align:start position:0%
business tax okay good
um

02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:07.910 --> 02:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
janaegan has handed first representative
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
negan and i mean then i forget to
 
02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:10.390 align:start position:0%
negan and i mean then i forget to
dictate

02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
dictate
 
02:15:12.550 --> 02:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
the same question
 
02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
so i know when we
 
02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
brought this
 
02:15:18.310 --> 02:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
fourth in the house we um
 
02:15:20.069 --> 02:15:20.079 align:start position:0%
got buy-in from the attorney general and
 
02:15:20.079 --> 02:15:22.390 align:start position:0%
got buy-in from the attorney general and
dra

02:15:22.390 --> 02:15:22.400 align:start position:0%
dra
 
02:15:24.069 --> 02:15:24.079 align:start position:0%
representative spielsberg do we know if
 
02:15:26.550 --> 02:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
dra and the attorney general have bought
 
02:15:28.629 --> 02:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
into this new language
 
02:15:31.910 --> 02:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
and the answer is yes um
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
keane was here earlier i was going to
 
02:15:35.910 --> 02:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
point to him now but
 
02:15:38.310 --> 02:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
he's the one who specifically
 
02:15:40.550 --> 02:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
fashioned these words in response to the
 
02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
request from the senate committee
 
02:15:45.109 --> 02:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
and he ran them by me before taking them
 
02:15:47.189 --> 02:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
back to the senate and i think they're
 
02:15:47.199 --> 02:15:48.830 align:start position:0%
back to the senate and i think they're
excellent

02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
excellent
 
02:15:51.830 --> 02:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
okay with some army then i guess just to
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
make sure this he also agreed with
 
02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
taking out the second and third sections
 
02:16:01.990 --> 02:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:02.000 --> 02:16:05.830 align:start position:0%
 
representative

02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:07.750 --> 02:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i think it's fine what's been
 
02:16:10.310 --> 02:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
proposed on the senate side um
 
02:16:14.069 --> 02:16:14.079 align:start position:0%
and i think the uh business private tax
 
02:16:16.069 --> 02:16:16.079 align:start position:0%
sections that they took out
 
02:16:18.870 --> 02:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
are appropriately taken out uh they
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
created confusion in my mind anyway and
 
02:16:23.990 --> 02:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
set us up for a uh sort of
 
02:16:26.229 --> 02:16:26.239 align:start position:0%
counter-attack if you will by
 
02:16:27.830 --> 02:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
states that might be subject to this
 
02:16:30.310 --> 02:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
that we were being uh
 
02:16:33.030 --> 02:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
two-sided about this that uh
 
02:16:35.589 --> 02:16:35.599 align:start position:0%
we had one standard for ourselves and
 
02:16:38.629 --> 02:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
another standard for the other guys um
 
02:16:40.629 --> 02:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
so that that wasn't a good posture i
 
02:16:42.389 --> 02:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
think it's it's uh
 
02:16:44.870 --> 02:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
more more carefully tailored now it's a
 
02:16:48.070 --> 02:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
simple statement of uh
 
02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
of the seven interests of the state of
 
02:16:51.990 --> 02:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire that relates to personal
 
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
income taxation and employer employee
 
02:16:55.200 --> 02:16:56.549 align:start position:0%
income taxation and employer employee
relationship

02:16:56.549 --> 02:16:56.559 align:start position:0%
relationship
 
02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
i think that's uh that's fine i don't
 
02:17:01.270 --> 02:17:01.280 align:start position:0%
know whether it's gonna going to
 
02:17:03.270 --> 02:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
in the end prove helpful for anything
 
02:17:03.280 --> 02:17:04.150 align:start position:0%
in the end prove helpful for anything
but

02:17:04.150 --> 02:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
i see no harm and
 
02:17:07.669 --> 02:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
potential benefits
 
02:17:07.679 --> 02:17:09.429 align:start position:0%
potential benefits
okay

02:17:09.429 --> 02:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:17:09.439 --> 02:17:10.709 align:start position:0%
okay
so

02:17:10.709 --> 02:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:17:12.950 --> 02:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
without objection i i'm gonna recommend
 
02:17:17.190 --> 02:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
concur okay okay we'll do that
 
02:17:20.309 --> 02:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
can i ask
 
02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
the committee wants to concur with 1221
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
if the speaker comes back to you today
 
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
and says
 
02:17:30.469 --> 02:17:30.479 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't
 
02:17:35.190 --> 02:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:36.469 --> 02:17:36.479 align:start position:0%
that's why i said we didn't really
 
02:17:38.549 --> 02:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
definitively i didn't do what i just did
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
then i said this
 
02:17:43.830 --> 02:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
i will uh certainly relate to him that
 
02:17:45.669 --> 02:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
we're concur
 
02:17:48.230 --> 02:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
again it's it's 28 million
 
02:17:50.309 --> 02:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
he had the master
 
02:17:52.070 --> 02:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
he had the big picture
 
02:17:53.910 --> 02:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have the big picture of of all
 
02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
the money that wants to be spent uh what
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
if he says i doubt it's a little
 
02:18:02.389 --> 02:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
probability he's gonna say
 
02:18:04.469 --> 02:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
no okay so
 
02:18:06.549 --> 02:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
we'll just have to deal with it now i'll
 
02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
obviously get a note out to everybody
 
02:18:09.509 --> 02:18:09.519 align:start position:0%
who is
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
i'm going to go actually at lunchtime
 
02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
here now i'm going to run over and i'll
 
02:18:14.950 --> 02:18:14.960 align:start position:0%
probably have more news
 
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
let's continue discussion this afternoon
 
02:18:26.790 --> 02:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
i will do what i can do
 
02:18:31.110 --> 02:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to go over now catch him
 
02:18:32.389 --> 02:18:32.399 align:start position:0%
there's a chair vice chairman that
 
02:18:33.669 --> 02:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
starts at one i know i could catch him
 
02:18:35.270 --> 02:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
in the hallway before
 
02:18:37.429 --> 02:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to go over there now and
 
02:18:38.709 --> 02:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
and talk to him
 
02:18:40.549 --> 02:18:40.559 align:start position:0%
okay mr chair i just had a follow-up
 
02:18:43.190 --> 02:18:43.200 align:start position:0%
question about the hb 1097
 
02:18:45.429 --> 02:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
yes the
 
02:18:46.950 --> 02:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh statement that representative
 
02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%
spillsbury just made was that the dra
 
02:18:52.709 --> 02:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
has okayed the language changes and that
 
02:18:54.070 --> 02:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
sounds great but i was just wondering if
 
02:18:56.389 --> 02:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
the ag's office actually weighed in
 
02:18:59.990 --> 02:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:01.910 --> 02:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding from my
 
02:19:03.990 --> 02:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
conversation with king wong
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
that he did specifically run this by the
 
02:19:08.309 --> 02:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
a.g but i don't have first-hand
 
02:19:09.990 --> 02:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge of that i believe that's
 
02:19:13.429 --> 02:19:13.439 align:start position:0%
correct he went like when he was here
 
02:19:14.950 --> 02:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
we again this second time we're talking
 
02:19:16.389 --> 02:19:16.399 align:start position:0%
about this
 
02:19:16.399 --> 02:19:17.669 align:start position:0%
about this
change

02:19:17.669 --> 02:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
change
 
02:19:19.190 --> 02:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
keane was here for that first and i
 
02:19:20.870 --> 02:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
think he did say that
 
02:19:22.790 --> 02:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
that he passed it by the ag my
 
02:19:22.800 --> 02:19:25.589 align:start position:0%
that he passed it by the ag my
recollection

02:19:25.589 --> 02:19:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
i mean i think if the intent was that
 
02:19:36.150 --> 02:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
you know this is the ag's recommendation
 
02:19:38.150 --> 02:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
to put us in the strongest position to
 
02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
potentially litigate this issue in the
 
02:19:39.679 --> 02:19:42.070 align:start position:0%
potentially litigate this issue in the
future

02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
and now we're changing the language from
 
02:19:45.429 --> 02:19:45.439 align:start position:0%
what they had previously okay that we
 
02:19:50.469 --> 02:19:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:52.790 --> 02:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i i can't specifically rebut your
 
02:19:54.550 --> 02:19:54.560 align:start position:0%
comment um
 
02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
but i would suggest that the ag
 
02:20:01.510 --> 02:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
liked what we did in the first instance
 
02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
the ag
 
02:20:05.510 --> 02:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
did not take part in requesting the
 
02:20:07.510 --> 02:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
addition of the two
 
02:20:09.110 --> 02:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
additional provisions relating to
 
02:20:11.670 --> 02:20:11.680 align:start position:0%
business profits tax and business
 
02:20:13.190 --> 02:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
enterprise tax
 
02:20:14.790 --> 02:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
so this
 
02:20:16.870 --> 02:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
if anything strengthens what they had
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
already agreed to
 
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
i am i i can't imagine that if we ask
 
02:20:22.550 --> 02:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
them that they wouldn't
 
02:20:25.590 --> 02:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
um approve of it so that's just
 
02:20:28.070 --> 02:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
speculation but i think pretty confident
 
02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:31.750 align:start position:0%
speculation but i think pretty confident
speculation

02:20:31.750 --> 02:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:33.590 --> 02:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
well we'll see if we can track them down
 
02:20:35.349 --> 02:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
today but
 
02:20:37.349 --> 02:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
you know it's hit and miss if the the
 
02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
right people are there
 
02:20:39.359 --> 02:20:40.710 align:start position:0%
right people are there
um

02:20:40.710 --> 02:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:42.309 --> 02:20:42.319 align:start position:0%
but i think we hit because
 
02:20:44.309 --> 02:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
we're a depression out of to
 
02:20:46.469 --> 02:20:46.479 align:start position:0%
today they want they want to know the
 
02:20:49.030 --> 02:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
clerk paul smith wants to know
 
02:20:52.870 --> 02:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
what um what our positions are on these
 
02:20:56.389 --> 02:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:56.399 --> 02:20:57.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:20:57.349 --> 02:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:21:01.429 --> 02:21:01.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's creating i hope it's finance
 
02:21:07.750 --> 02:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's creating the the list that the
 
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
speaker is looking at of what we can
 
02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:12.070 align:start position:0%
speaker is looking at of what we can
afford

02:21:12.070 --> 02:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
afford
 
02:21:13.910 --> 02:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
here's this big master list because it
 
02:21:15.910 --> 02:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
isn't us it says
 
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
opera money has
 
02:21:18.160 --> 02:21:19.349 align:start position:0%
opera money has
uh

02:21:19.349 --> 02:21:19.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:19.359 --> 02:21:21.110 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

02:21:21.110 --> 02:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:21:23.349 --> 02:21:23.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure money federal and then he
 
02:21:26.630 --> 02:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
has state surplus money three
 
02:21:28.950 --> 02:21:28.960 align:start position:0%
it's a big spreadsheet that he's got
 
02:21:30.550 --> 02:21:30.560 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
02:21:31.990 --> 02:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
that's what he's working off of and i'm
 
02:21:34.389 --> 02:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
sure he's in in in conversation with
 
02:21:36.309 --> 02:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
representative grumberger
 
02:21:38.309 --> 02:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
about that
 
02:21:44.950 --> 02:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:21:48.469 --> 02:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
all right well we gotta we we're we're
 
02:21:50.790 --> 02:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
gonna have uh about you know 38 minutes

and i think the commissioner
 
03:04:21.910 --> 03:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chris nicolopoulos the
 
03:04:23.590 --> 03:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
commissioner of insurance right thank
 
03:04:26.710 --> 03:04:26.720 align:start position:0%
you and amy i'm amy ducam thanks for
 
03:04:28.950 --> 03:04:28.960 align:start position:0%
having me today so this is just like a
 
03:04:31.590 --> 03:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
mid-course just update on what you're
 
03:04:32.950 --> 03:04:32.960 align:start position:0%
seeing and
 
03:04:34.389 --> 03:04:34.399 align:start position:0%
understanding there was a handout that
 
03:04:36.150 --> 03:04:36.160 align:start position:0%
they provided that was in the packet
 
03:04:38.550 --> 03:04:38.560 align:start position:0%
that we had earlier
 
03:04:38.560 --> 03:04:39.349 align:start position:0%
that we had earlier
so

03:04:39.349 --> 03:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:04:41.990 --> 03:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
floor is yours
 
03:04:43.670 --> 03:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
03:04:45.429 --> 03:04:45.439 align:start position:0%
y'all got your hand out i'll go through
 
03:04:46.550 --> 03:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
it with you
 
03:04:49.590 --> 03:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
and today's um purpose we're going to
 
03:04:53.030 --> 03:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
touch on and review our revenue sources
 
03:04:55.110 --> 03:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
and why they're coming in at
 
03:04:58.550 --> 03:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
approximately 26 million over the plan
 
03:04:59.990 --> 03:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
well we won't complain about that too
 
03:05:02.309 --> 03:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
much no no complaints here
 
03:05:02.319 --> 03:05:04.070 align:start position:0%
much no no complaints here
so

03:05:04.070 --> 03:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:05:05.990 --> 03:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
the majority of our revenue is from our
 
03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
licensed companies
 
03:05:09.510 --> 03:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
and our risk retention groups what we
 
03:05:11.510 --> 03:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
call the admitted market
 
03:05:13.750 --> 03:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
and the property and casualty lines of
 
03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
business are taxed at 1.25 percent
 
03:05:18.469 --> 03:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
whereas the accident health lines are
 
03:05:21.269 --> 03:05:21.279 align:start position:0%
taxed at two percent
 
03:05:23.510 --> 03:05:23.520 align:start position:0%
so we collect tax returns from
 
03:05:26.790 --> 03:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
approximately 1200 insurance companies
 
03:05:29.670 --> 03:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
that are due on or before march 15th of
 
03:05:31.429 --> 03:05:31.439 align:start position:0%
each year
 
03:05:33.670 --> 03:05:33.680 align:start position:0%
in accordance with our statutes the
 
03:05:35.670 --> 03:05:35.680 align:start position:0%
companies will pay the premium taxes
 
03:05:39.190 --> 03:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
that are due for the calendar year 2021
 
03:05:41.349 --> 03:05:41.359 align:start position:0%
and then we subtract out the estimated
 
03:05:43.349 --> 03:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
payment that they paid on their prior
 
03:05:45.190 --> 03:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
year's tax return
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
and then we collect an extra estimated
 
03:05:49.830 --> 03:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
prepayment tax for the calendar year
 
03:05:49.840 --> 03:05:52.309 align:start position:0%
prepayment tax for the calendar year
2022.

03:05:52.309 --> 03:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
03:05:54.870 --> 03:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
so if we look at the next page you'll
 
03:05:57.110 --> 03:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
see here that i've laid out
 
03:05:59.750 --> 03:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
what we've submitted for projections
 
03:06:02.070 --> 03:06:02.080 align:start position:0%
based on our tax base our tax credits
 
03:06:03.590 --> 03:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
and fee data
 
03:06:06.070 --> 03:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
so for fiscal year 22
 
03:06:09.990 --> 03:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
we have 130 million and fiscal year 2023
 
03:06:12.550 --> 03:06:12.560 align:start position:0%
we projected 135
 
03:06:14.630 --> 03:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
million excuse me
 
03:06:16.630 --> 03:06:16.640 align:start position:0%
so on the next page we're gonna dive a
 
03:06:18.790 --> 03:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
little deeper and go into
 
03:06:21.830 --> 03:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
what those numbers actually mean
 
03:06:23.990 --> 03:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
so on the left hand column you'll see
 
03:06:26.230 --> 03:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
the 130 million
 
03:06:29.269 --> 03:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
that we had projected and next to that
 
03:06:31.910 --> 03:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
is what we expect fiscal year end to
 
03:06:34.790 --> 03:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
look like as of june 30th
 
03:06:37.870 --> 03:06:37.880 align:start position:0%
we are expecting a bottom line of
 
03:06:40.469 --> 03:06:40.479 align:start position:0%
156.8 million
 
03:06:42.870 --> 03:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
so if we start with our our top line
 
03:06:45.590 --> 03:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
here we'll go through our calculation
 
03:06:48.230 --> 03:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
which is our premium tax liability for
 
03:06:50.950 --> 03:06:50.960 align:start position:0%
the calendar year 2021
 
03:06:54.429 --> 03:06:54.439 align:start position:0%
we will have expected to collect
 
03:06:56.950 --> 03:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
126.2 million
 
03:06:59.190 --> 03:06:59.200 align:start position:0%
and then we take away the prepayment
 
03:07:00.870 --> 03:07:00.880 align:start position:0%
that is applied from their previous
 
03:07:00.880 --> 03:07:01.830 align:start position:0%
that is applied from their previous
year's

03:07:01.830 --> 03:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
year's
 
03:07:05.630 --> 03:07:05.640 align:start position:0%
tax return which was 117 mil
 
03:07:07.910 --> 03:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
117.5 million
 
03:07:09.349 --> 03:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
and then on the third line you'll see
 
03:07:11.590 --> 03:07:11.600 align:start position:0%
the prepayment for the following year so
 
03:07:14.550 --> 03:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
this is their estimated tax that they're
 
03:07:18.870 --> 03:07:18.880 align:start position:0%
paying upfront for calendar year 2022
 
03:07:20.710 --> 03:07:20.720 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that line is always going
 
03:07:23.269 --> 03:07:23.279 align:start position:0%
to be the same as the top line because
 
03:07:25.429 --> 03:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
they're paying 100 percent of their
 
03:07:29.910 --> 03:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:33.670 --> 03:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
then we are expecting to collect 5.9
 
03:07:35.830 --> 03:07:35.840 align:start position:0%
million premium tax from the
 
03:07:38.469 --> 03:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
non-admitted market
 
03:07:41.110 --> 03:07:41.120 align:start position:0%
which brings our total projected fiscal
 
03:07:42.990 --> 03:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
year in revenue to
 
03:07:46.309 --> 03:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
140.8 million dollars
 
03:07:50.309 --> 03:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
our licenses fees and penalties we
 
03:07:54.070 --> 03:07:54.080 align:start position:0%
expect to be about 26.2 million
 
03:07:55.910 --> 03:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
these are
 
03:07:58.230 --> 03:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
you know rather high
 
03:08:01.670 --> 03:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
compared to what we've seen in the past
 
03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
we feel with the pandemic and more
 
03:08:06.790 --> 03:08:06.800 align:start position:0%
people working remotely
 
03:08:09.110 --> 03:08:09.120 align:start position:0%
that they were more apt to get licensed
 
03:08:11.510 --> 03:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
across different states on the other
 
03:08:13.910 --> 03:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
hand a lot of them may have let their
 
03:08:17.590 --> 03:08:17.600 align:start position:0%
licenses lap so when they went to renew
 
03:08:19.830 --> 03:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
they were paying at twice the cost
 
03:08:22.550 --> 03:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
because their license had lapsed
 
03:08:25.030 --> 03:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
and these all these producers producers
 
03:08:27.830 --> 03:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
and adjusters are paying on a two-year
 
03:08:30.389 --> 03:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
term so we wouldn't expect to see
 
03:08:33.510 --> 03:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
quite as high numbers next year
 
03:08:35.910 --> 03:08:35.920 align:start position:0%
we also had a one-time unprecedented
 
03:08:37.990 --> 03:08:38.000 align:start position:0%
collection of administrative fees where
 
03:08:39.830 --> 03:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
we collected an additional
 
03:08:41.830 --> 03:08:41.840 align:start position:0%
500 000 from the appointment of
 
03:08:41.840 --> 03:08:43.030 align:start position:0%
500 000 from the appointment of
producers

03:08:43.030 --> 03:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
producers
 
03:08:45.670 --> 03:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
and then we collected penalties by our
 
03:08:47.670 --> 03:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
enforcement division and these vary
 
03:08:50.790 --> 03:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
greatly every year very hard to predict
 
03:08:53.510 --> 03:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh 2021 we collected almost a half a
 
03:08:54.870 --> 03:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:08:58.790 --> 03:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
whereas in 2020 we only collected 85 000
 
03:09:00.790 --> 03:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
so due to the nature of the enforcement
 
03:09:02.710 --> 03:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
division it's hard to predict what type
 
03:09:07.190 --> 03:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:09.349 --> 03:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
on the next page it's
 
03:09:09.359 --> 03:09:10.790 align:start position:0%
on the next page it's
informational

03:09:10.790 --> 03:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
informational
 
03:09:13.910 --> 03:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
purposes of our premium tax base which
 
03:09:17.910 --> 03:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
is based on premium written
 
03:09:20.550 --> 03:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
the companies wrote over seven billion
 
03:09:22.950 --> 03:09:22.960 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of in premium in new
 
03:09:25.110 --> 03:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire and you'll see from the pie
 
03:09:27.750 --> 03:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
chart that that's split fairly equally
 
03:09:29.750 --> 03:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
between the property and casualty lines
 
03:09:31.429 --> 03:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
and the health lines at about forty
 
03:09:31.439 --> 03:09:32.790 align:start position:0%
and the health lines at about forty
percent

03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:09:35.590 --> 03:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh however you know more of the tax is
 
03:09:37.269 --> 03:09:37.279 align:start position:0%
collected on the health side like i
 
03:09:39.510 --> 03:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned they are taxed at a higher
 
03:09:43.190 --> 03:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:46.309 --> 03:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
so on the next page currently we have
 
03:09:49.750 --> 03:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
any idea how many how many uh
 
03:09:49.760 --> 03:09:50.870 align:start position:0%
any idea how many how many uh
products

03:09:50.870 --> 03:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
products
 
03:09:53.830 --> 03:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
or companies or products that are being
 
03:09:55.590 --> 03:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
taxed i mean is it
 
03:10:00.150 --> 03:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:02.469 --> 03:10:02.479 align:start position:0%
yeah 1200 companies okay that are
 
03:10:03.990 --> 03:10:04.000 align:start position:0%
submitting that's amazing okay that's
 
03:10:05.190 --> 03:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's what i'm getting at okay thank
 
03:10:07.269 --> 03:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you yeah
 
03:10:11.429 --> 03:10:11.439 align:start position:0%
so as of april 30th our favorable
 
03:10:15.750 --> 03:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
variance was 26.2 million
 
03:10:18.950 --> 03:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
18 million of that in premium tax and
 
03:10:22.710 --> 03:10:22.720 align:start position:0%
8.2 million of that in fee revenue
 
03:10:25.990 --> 03:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
and uh like men like i mentioned you
 
03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
know the
 
03:10:29.349 --> 03:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
increase is primarily due to a
 
03:10:31.750 --> 03:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
significant increase in the tax base
 
03:10:34.150 --> 03:10:34.160 align:start position:0%
which is those premiums written
 
03:10:34.160 --> 03:10:35.269 align:start position:0%
which is those premiums written
um

03:10:35.269 --> 03:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:37.750 --> 03:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
which increased eight percent from prior
 
03:10:41.030 --> 03:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
year calendar year 2020.
 
03:10:43.030 --> 03:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
other factors we have impacting the
 
03:10:45.429 --> 03:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
growth in premiums are primarily the
 
03:10:48.150 --> 03:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
pandemic and how it's lasted longer than
 
03:10:49.670 --> 03:10:49.680 align:start position:0%
we expected
 
03:10:52.309 --> 03:10:52.319 align:start position:0%
and the impacts the economic impacts
 
03:10:53.990 --> 03:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
that it's made for both the labor and
 
03:10:56.950 --> 03:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
the housing market which eventually
 
03:11:00.070 --> 03:11:00.080 align:start position:0%
affect the insurance market
 
03:11:02.309 --> 03:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
03:11:03.590 --> 03:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
yeah on
 
03:11:06.950 --> 03:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
how much of that taxable premiums was
 
03:11:09.990 --> 03:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
due to more premiums versus premiums
 
03:11:12.309 --> 03:11:12.319 align:start position:0%
being more expensive
 
03:11:15.670 --> 03:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
all the the rates versus
 
03:11:18.630 --> 03:11:18.640 align:start position:0%
the rate increases um i don't have an
 
03:11:20.550 --> 03:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
exact figure for that
 
03:11:22.550 --> 03:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think we have an ability to to
 
03:11:25.429 --> 03:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
discern what is increasing premium uh
 
03:11:27.830 --> 03:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
premiums on existing business and on new
 
03:11:27.840 --> 03:11:28.870 align:start position:0%
premiums on existing business and on new
business

03:11:28.870 --> 03:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:11:31.830 --> 03:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
i think we we can anecdotally we know
 
03:11:31.840 --> 03:11:32.710 align:start position:0%
i think we we can anecdotally we know
that

03:11:32.710 --> 03:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:11:32.720 --> 03:11:34.150 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:11:34.150 --> 03:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:35.750 --> 03:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
more life insurance policies have been
 
03:11:35.760 --> 03:11:36.550 align:start position:0%
more life insurance policies have been
written

03:11:36.550 --> 03:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
written
 
03:11:38.469 --> 03:11:38.479 align:start position:0%
uh the the increase we've seen isn't
 
03:11:40.309 --> 03:11:40.319 align:start position:0%
premium increase it's people who during
 
03:11:42.309 --> 03:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
the pandemic thought maybe i should get
 
03:11:43.510 --> 03:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
life insurance
 
03:11:45.990 --> 03:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
um i think likewise we've seen an
 
03:11:49.190 --> 03:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
increase in health uh health premium
 
03:11:50.710 --> 03:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
that is not consistent with rate
 
03:11:54.309 --> 03:11:54.319 align:start position:0%
increase is consistent with uh
 
03:11:56.550 --> 03:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
more uh more covered lives
 
03:11:59.349 --> 03:11:59.359 align:start position:0%
um and i think also that is that is
 
03:12:00.870 --> 03:12:00.880 align:start position:0%
partly driven because of the economy
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
strength of the economy and partly
 
03:12:04.710 --> 03:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
driven because during a pandemic people
 
03:12:09.990 --> 03:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:10.000 --> 03:12:11.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:12:11.990 --> 03:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:12:12.000 --> 03:12:13.349 align:start position:0%
okay
so

03:12:13.349 --> 03:12:13.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:12:15.110 --> 03:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
as we've mentioned the favorable
 
03:12:18.070 --> 03:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
variance in fees is attributable to the
 
03:12:21.190 --> 03:12:21.200 align:start position:0%
producer and adjuster licensing fees
 
03:12:23.190 --> 03:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
which we don't feel will stay at the
 
03:12:25.269 --> 03:12:25.279 align:start position:0%
same levels
 
03:12:27.190 --> 03:12:27.200 align:start position:0%
what we'll see for the months of may and
 
03:12:29.990 --> 03:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
june the revenue growth will slow down
 
03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:30.870 align:start position:0%
june the revenue growth will slow down
as

03:12:30.870 --> 03:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:12:34.150 --> 03:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
at this time we are processing refunds
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
for overpayments on the tax returns
 
03:12:40.309 --> 03:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
and um when we take a look at what
 
03:12:42.710 --> 03:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
fiscal year end will look like
 
03:12:45.830 --> 03:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
we are projecting like i said the 26.8
 
03:12:48.790 --> 03:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
million and that's on a cash basis
 
03:12:51.110 --> 03:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
so the final results that will be
 
03:12:53.030 --> 03:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
reported in the annual comprehensive
 
03:12:55.269 --> 03:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
financial report are on a modified
 
03:12:57.510 --> 03:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
accrual basis so those we expect to see
 
03:13:03.910 --> 03:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:04.950 --> 03:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
the next
 
03:13:06.469 --> 03:13:06.479 align:start position:0%
page is
 
03:13:09.110 --> 03:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
simply five-year historic
 
03:13:11.910 --> 03:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
information of our actual results
 
03:13:13.990 --> 03:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
reported in the annual comprehensive
 
03:13:15.830 --> 03:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
financial report
 
03:13:17.670 --> 03:13:17.680 align:start position:0%
versus what we had planned and you'll
 
03:13:20.550 --> 03:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
see those do fluctuate year after year
 
03:13:22.389 --> 03:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
where some years they're up some years
 
03:13:34.309 --> 03:13:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:36.469 --> 03:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
it's not really a question it's just for
 
03:13:38.309 --> 03:13:38.319 align:start position:0%
the ones who weren't here through all of
 
03:13:39.910 --> 03:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
this in the past
 
03:13:39.920 --> 03:13:41.190 align:start position:0%
this in the past
on

03:13:41.190 --> 03:13:41.200 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:13:44.710 --> 03:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
the change in the revenues
 
03:13:46.389 --> 03:13:46.399 align:start position:0%
is doubled
 
03:13:48.950 --> 03:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
in years where the revenues go up and
 
03:13:48.960 --> 03:13:50.150 align:start position:0%
in years where the revenues go up and
half

03:13:50.150 --> 03:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
half
 
03:13:51.670 --> 03:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
when they go down
 
03:13:53.429 --> 03:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
so on
 
03:13:55.190 --> 03:13:55.200 align:start position:0%
when when they go up one year they
 
03:13:59.110 --> 03:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:59.120 --> 03:14:00.309 align:start position:0%
 
because

03:14:00.309 --> 03:14:00.319 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:14:04.309 --> 03:14:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:06.630 --> 03:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
this year's
 
03:14:06.640 --> 03:14:08.950 align:start position:0%
this year's
tax

03:14:08.950 --> 03:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
tax
 
03:14:11.429 --> 03:14:11.439 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of next
 
03:14:14.229 --> 03:14:14.239 align:start position:0%
next year that is the next day
 
03:14:14.239 --> 03:14:15.110 align:start position:0%
next year that is the next day
uh

03:14:15.110 --> 03:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:14:17.510 --> 03:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
and then next year
 
03:14:20.229 --> 03:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
if their revenues are lower
 
03:14:21.429 --> 03:14:21.439 align:start position:0%
they are
 
03:14:23.030 --> 03:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
getting back
 
03:14:23.040 --> 03:14:24.389 align:start position:0%
getting back
tax

03:14:24.389 --> 03:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
tax
 
03:14:26.710 --> 03:14:26.720 align:start position:0%
that they'd overpaid
 
03:14:28.389 --> 03:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
which is what you're going to be dealing
 
03:14:30.070 --> 03:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
with soon
 
03:14:30.080 --> 03:14:31.670 align:start position:0%
with soon
correct

03:14:31.670 --> 03:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
correct
 
03:14:34.389 --> 03:14:34.399 align:start position:0%
so it's it's very disconcerting
 
03:14:36.469 --> 03:14:36.479 align:start position:0%
and it happened because the senate
 
03:14:38.870 --> 03:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
wanted to cut
 
03:14:42.710 --> 03:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
the casualty in property taxes
 
03:14:45.269 --> 03:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
and they didn't want to have to pay for
 
03:14:49.349 --> 03:14:49.359 align:start position:0%
the tail and so they required that we
 
03:14:51.110 --> 03:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
pay only once a year instead of four
 
03:14:53.590 --> 03:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
times a year so we have no information
 
03:14:55.590 --> 03:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
until april
 
03:15:00.630 --> 03:15:00.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:02.630 --> 03:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
on the next slide
 
03:15:04.790 --> 03:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
i want to take a look at the april april
 
03:15:07.429 --> 03:15:07.439 align:start position:0%
results as they have
 
03:15:10.229 --> 03:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
they are four million dollars below plan
 
03:15:13.030 --> 03:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
and that's due to our transfer
 
03:15:14.790 --> 03:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
that we made to the grant advantage
 
03:15:17.190 --> 03:15:17.200 align:start position:0%
health care trust fund
 
03:15:19.429 --> 03:15:19.439 align:start position:0%
having a negative is
 
03:15:19.439 --> 03:15:20.469 align:start position:0%
having a negative is
typical

03:15:20.469 --> 03:15:20.479 align:start position:0%
typical
 
03:15:22.630 --> 03:15:22.640 align:start position:0%
for april because of this transfer that
 
03:15:24.070 --> 03:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
we make every year
 
03:15:26.389 --> 03:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
so we are collecting premium tax from
 
03:15:28.469 --> 03:15:28.479 align:start position:0%
the three managed care organizations
 
03:15:31.590 --> 03:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
that have contracted with the hhs to
 
03:15:33.510 --> 03:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
place business in the granite advantage
 
03:15:35.030 --> 03:15:35.040 align:start position:0%
health care fund
 
03:15:37.110 --> 03:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
and then we need to transfer that
 
03:15:40.710 --> 03:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
revenue to dhhs by april 15th so you'll
 
03:15:44.229 --> 03:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
see a decrease every april
 
03:15:46.870 --> 03:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
it's important to note that if more
 
03:15:49.510 --> 03:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
taxes collected for the program
 
03:15:51.269 --> 03:15:51.279 align:start position:0%
then more taxes transferred for the
 
03:15:52.630 --> 03:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
program so
 
03:15:55.349 --> 03:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
um therefore it has a net zero impact on
 
03:15:57.910 --> 03:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
our projections
 
03:16:00.469 --> 03:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
um we did projects
 
03:16:03.110 --> 03:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
again yeah this one is is a question do
 
03:16:05.830 --> 03:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
you remember when this expires because
 
03:16:08.070 --> 03:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
it was time limited
 
03:16:10.870 --> 03:16:10.880 align:start position:0%
this deal that was made by the senate
 
03:16:10.880 --> 03:16:11.910 align:start position:0%
this deal that was made by the senate
again

03:16:11.910 --> 03:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:16:13.429 --> 03:16:13.439 align:start position:0%
i think there's one more year on the
 
03:16:18.150 --> 03:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:21.190 --> 03:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
um so we had anticipated the transfer to
 
03:16:23.510 --> 03:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
be 8.6 million
 
03:16:25.510 --> 03:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
premiums came in higher than we were
 
03:16:27.910 --> 03:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
expecting so we did end up transferring
 
03:16:31.190 --> 03:16:31.200 align:start position:0%
10.2 million which resulted in a 1.6
 
03:16:32.630 --> 03:16:32.640 align:start position:0%
million variance
 
03:16:34.870 --> 03:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
and then the remaining variance there is
 
03:16:37.110 --> 03:16:37.120 align:start position:0%
comprised of the refunds on the
 
03:16:39.670 --> 03:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
overpayments that we've started and
 
03:16:41.910 --> 03:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
timing of collections of taxes from the
 
03:16:41.920 --> 03:16:43.510 align:start position:0%
timing of collections of taxes from the
non-market

03:16:43.510 --> 03:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
non-market
 
03:16:45.990 --> 03:16:46.000 align:start position:0%
and the fees and that's
 
03:16:51.030 --> 03:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:54.070 --> 03:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
do you have more questions
 
03:16:56.389 --> 03:16:56.399 align:start position:0%
well it's
 
03:16:58.550 --> 03:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
positive outlook represent me do you
 
03:17:02.870 --> 03:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:04.229 --> 03:17:04.239 align:start position:0%
that's a tough one we spent a lot of
 
03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
time with our team
 
03:17:08.150 --> 03:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh i think some things happened in last
 
03:17:10.229 --> 03:17:10.239 align:start position:0%
year that we didn't anticipate we didn't
 
03:17:12.150 --> 03:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
anticipate that life premiums would go
 
03:17:13.429 --> 03:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
up ten percent
 
03:17:15.110 --> 03:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
that the health premiums would go up as
 
03:17:17.429 --> 03:17:17.439 align:start position:0%
much as they did six percent
 
03:17:19.590 --> 03:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
um i think that's going to moderate some
 
03:17:21.510 --> 03:17:21.520 align:start position:0%
we think that's going to moderate some
 
03:17:23.429 --> 03:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
and as representative almighty pointed
 
03:17:26.950 --> 03:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
out when you when a line moderates we
 
03:17:30.150 --> 03:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
experienced a double reduction
 
03:17:32.550 --> 03:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
so not only
 
03:17:34.790 --> 03:17:34.800 align:start position:0%
would we anticipate half of the increase
 
03:17:36.950 --> 03:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
in premium new premium that we saw this
 
03:17:39.110 --> 03:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
year going away if everything stayed the
 
03:17:41.590 --> 03:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
same any reduction gets experienced
 
03:17:43.269 --> 03:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
double down
 
03:17:46.710 --> 03:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
um and so because of that i think
 
03:17:50.150 --> 03:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
the 135 million uh that we've we have
 
03:17:52.870 --> 03:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
planned is is appropriate for a safe
 
03:17:55.269 --> 03:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
estimate um
 
03:17:57.910 --> 03:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
could it be 140 million yeah i think
 
03:18:00.950 --> 03:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
that but i think those numbers
 
03:18:03.750 --> 03:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh are as good as we can guess
 
03:18:05.670 --> 03:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
because we don't know
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
if people are going to stay with those
 
03:18:08.790 --> 03:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
life products that they purchased while
 
03:18:11.750 --> 03:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
they were worried in the pandemic
 
03:18:13.269 --> 03:18:13.279 align:start position:0%
we're seeing unemployment numbers that
 
03:18:15.090 --> 03:18:15.100 align:start position:0%
are shockingly low
 
03:18:15.100 --> 03:18:16.309 align:start position:0%
are shockingly low
[Music]

03:18:16.309 --> 03:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:18:17.590 --> 03:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
each year
 
03:18:20.229 --> 03:18:20.239 align:start position:0%
we see premium for our workers comp
 
03:18:22.309 --> 03:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
stagnate it's about 200 million a year
 
03:18:24.710 --> 03:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
year after year even as
 
03:18:26.150 --> 03:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
even as uh
 
03:18:27.830 --> 03:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
pay average pay in new hampshire goes up
 
03:18:29.510 --> 03:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
even as unemployment goes down and
 
03:18:32.070 --> 03:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
that's big it's offset because we have a
 
03:18:34.030 --> 03:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
very safe workforce here in new
 
03:18:37.429 --> 03:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
hampshire um i think there'll be some
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
increase in
 
03:18:42.070 --> 03:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
in pnc lines because of inflation
 
03:18:44.309 --> 03:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
but that may be offset by actual
 
03:18:46.309 --> 03:18:46.319 align:start position:0%
projections of
 
03:18:47.910 --> 03:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
of investment income which will be
 
03:18:49.269 --> 03:18:49.279 align:start position:0%
shocking for insurance companies to
 
03:18:50.630 --> 03:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
start planning for investment income
 
03:18:50.640 --> 03:18:52.469 align:start position:0%
start planning for investment income
again

03:18:52.469 --> 03:18:52.479 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:18:54.389 --> 03:18:54.399 align:start position:0%
i know that's a lot of words to not say
 
03:18:56.389 --> 03:18:56.399 align:start position:0%
a whole lot but
 
03:18:58.309 --> 03:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
i feel confident in the 135 that we've
 
03:19:02.229 --> 03:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:04.469 --> 03:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
any other question so
 
03:19:05.670 --> 03:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:19:07.990 --> 03:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
the granite advantage healthcare fund
 
03:19:09.190 --> 03:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
03:19:10.710 --> 03:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
is the last thing in that handout we've
 
03:19:13.590 --> 03:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
got so in terms of where the statute
 
03:19:16.830 --> 03:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:18.790 --> 03:19:18.800 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:19:21.510 --> 03:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:19:23.510 --> 03:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going saying none
 
03:19:25.030 --> 03:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
well thank you before you leave uh
 
03:19:27.030 --> 03:19:27.040 align:start position:0%

we have a gap
 
03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
03:20:42.150 --> 03:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
oh a long gap
 
03:20:44.550 --> 03:20:44.560 align:start position:0%
okay oh yeah i'm uh you know well it's
 
03:20:46.870 --> 03:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
not going to take 40 minutes
 
03:20:48.309 --> 03:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
i can probably
 
03:20:50.150 --> 03:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
thank you guys
 
03:20:52.710 --> 03:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
so i did speak to the speaker
 
03:20:54.070 --> 03:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
he was having a meeting with he's going
 
03:20:55.349 --> 03:20:55.359 align:start position:0%
to go and have a meeting with bradley it
 
03:20:57.269 --> 03:20:57.279 align:start position:0%
was already scheduled
 
03:20:58.950 --> 03:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
and he's going to talk to bradley about
 
03:21:00.630 --> 03:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
it as to where it ended
 
03:21:04.389 --> 03:21:04.399 align:start position:0%
so i know he's upstairs in 301 right now
 
03:21:06.150 --> 03:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative lange he's since he's
 
03:21:08.070 --> 03:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
chair of whatever he's chair of
 
03:21:09.830 --> 03:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
agriculture or whatever
 
03:21:11.670 --> 03:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
fishing game
 
03:21:11.680 --> 03:21:12.950 align:start position:0%
fishing game
um

03:21:12.950 --> 03:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:14.950 --> 03:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
that i told them to tap on the shoulder
 
03:21:16.070 --> 03:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
on the way and
 
03:21:18.229 --> 03:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
to get it but we have
 
03:21:19.429 --> 03:21:19.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is there any way we can
 
03:21:24.250 --> 03:21:24.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:24.260 --> 03:21:28.150 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:21:28.150 --> 03:21:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:28.160 --> 03:21:30.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:21:30.790 --> 03:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:32.790 --> 03:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know why this is an issue
 
03:21:32.800 --> 03:21:33.910 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know why this is an issue
but

03:21:33.910 --> 03:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:21:35.429 --> 03:21:35.439 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be i think we're still okay
 
03:21:40.630 --> 03:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
but i'll leave it down but um
 
03:21:42.309 --> 03:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
and i have a message in the king on the
 
03:21:42.319 --> 03:21:43.429 align:start position:0%
and i have a message in the king on the
other

03:21:43.429 --> 03:21:43.439 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:21:43.439 --> 03:21:44.389 align:start position:0%
other
thing

03:21:44.389 --> 03:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:21:44.399 --> 03:21:48.469 align:start position:0%
thing
so

03:21:48.469 --> 03:21:48.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:50.950 --> 03:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
oh no no don't ask the update
 
03:21:54.790 --> 03:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:57.190 --> 03:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
you know i want to why don't we recess
 
03:21:57.200 --> 03:21:58.389 align:start position:0%
you know i want to why don't we recess
for

03:21:58.389 --> 03:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:22:00.309 --> 03:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
maybe come back at 10-2
 
03:22:02.630 --> 03:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
usually they show up a little early
 
03:22:05.190 --> 03:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
we could probably start a little early
 
03:22:07.429 --> 03:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
i guess the finance leaders are probably
 
03:22:09.670 --> 03:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
in that meeting too so yeah
 
03:22:11.429 --> 03:22:11.439 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm going to go up there now yeah
 
03:22:19.190 --> 03:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:19.200 --> 03:22:21.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:22:21.670 --> 03:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:22:21.680 --> 03:22:27.670 align:start position:0%
okay
okay

03:22:27.670 --> 03:22:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:47.269 --> 03:22:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:47.279 --> 03:22:48.389 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:22:48.389 --> 03:22:48.399 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:22:51.670 --> 03:22:51.680 align:start position:0%
so the senate passed
 
03:22:53.269 --> 03:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
let me give a quick norm update uh i
 
03:22:55.429 --> 03:22:55.439 align:start position:0%
talked to him i tried to i didn't call
 
03:22:57.269 --> 03:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
him this weekend you did yeah i talked
 
03:22:59.030 --> 03:22:59.040 align:start position:0%
to him on the way home last night his
 
03:23:01.190 --> 03:23:01.200 align:start position:0%
biggest problem now is his ankle
 
03:23:03.190 --> 03:23:03.200 align:start position:0%
he can't put any weight on his ankle now
 
03:23:05.110 --> 03:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
and now i think he tore some ligaments
 
03:23:06.630 --> 03:23:06.640 align:start position:0%
when he fell
 
03:23:08.389 --> 03:23:08.399 align:start position:0%
way back you know in easter well that
 
03:23:11.750 --> 03:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
and some infection in his lungs yeah but
 
03:23:13.349 --> 03:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
uh he had it yeah i know it was a
 
03:23:15.349 --> 03:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
pulmonary doctor came in that right
 
03:23:16.790 --> 03:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
before i talked to him he said the
 
03:23:18.070 --> 03:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
doctor came in and said it's that's
 
03:23:20.229 --> 03:23:20.239 align:start position:0%
clearing up a little bit yeah so that
 
03:23:21.750 --> 03:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
was good news
 
03:23:23.750 --> 03:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
so but you probably won't see him for a
 
03:23:24.710 --> 03:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
few weeks
 
03:23:24.720 --> 03:23:42.630 align:start position:0%
few weeks
probably

03:23:42.630 --> 03:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:44.710 --> 03:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
yeah he's alternating between a
 
03:23:47.830 --> 03:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:49.269 --> 03:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
but he's still he's still at the
 
03:23:51.590 --> 03:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
whittier rehab
 
03:23:53.510 --> 03:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
um he'll probably be discharged he said
 
03:23:56.150 --> 03:23:56.160 align:start position:0%
he had an appointment with a surgeon
 
03:23:58.870 --> 03:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh next week now
 
03:24:00.469 --> 03:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
it's torn ligaments the surgeons did
 
03:24:02.309 --> 03:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
they reattach things what
 
03:24:05.030 --> 03:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
usually not just let it heal right
 
03:24:07.429 --> 03:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
right right yeah i'm not quite sure why
 
03:24:08.950 --> 03:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
he's going to see a surgeon that night
 
03:24:11.910 --> 03:24:11.920 align:start position:0%
but maybe just a referral from later i
 
03:24:12.950 --> 03:24:12.960 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
03:24:14.550 --> 03:24:14.560 align:start position:0%
well the day before he thought it was
 
03:24:17.670 --> 03:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
just healed so it was
 
03:24:19.269 --> 03:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
i thought he said ankle
 
03:24:19.279 --> 03:24:21.349 align:start position:0%
i thought he said ankle
but

03:24:21.349 --> 03:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:24:21.359 --> 03:24:22.790 align:start position:0%
but
whatever

03:24:22.790 --> 03:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
03:24:23.990 --> 03:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
it's down there
 
03:24:27.349 --> 03:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
yeah all right so well he shouldn't go
 
03:24:29.429 --> 03:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
home until he can
 
03:24:31.670 --> 03:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
well i'm sure they take some care of
 
03:24:33.510 --> 03:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
himself because
 
03:24:37.429 --> 03:24:37.439 align:start position:0%
brenda i don't know if she can cope with
 
03:24:39.990 --> 03:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
well the pt's been uh you know they've
 
03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
been up and down steps they've been
 
03:24:44.550 --> 03:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
getting them in and out of a mock-up car
 
03:24:46.870 --> 03:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
in the treatment area getting in and out
 
03:24:48.630 --> 03:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
of a car
 
03:24:48.640 --> 03:24:49.750 align:start position:0%
of a car
so

03:24:49.750 --> 03:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:24:52.229 --> 03:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
you know they're working on
 
03:24:52.239 --> 03:24:53.510 align:start position:0%
you know they're working on
but

03:24:53.510 --> 03:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:24:55.670 --> 03:24:55.680 align:start position:0%
well let me run upstairs and i will
 
03:24:57.349 --> 03:24:57.359 align:start position:0%
hopefully have a report let's get we
 
03:24:59.349 --> 03:24:59.359 align:start position:0%
convene a 10-2 co looking maybe here a
 
03:25:01.269 --> 03:25:01.279 align:start position:0%
little early sometimes they do show up
 
03:25:03.910 --> 03:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
early we can start early
 
03:25:08.229 --> 03:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:08.239 --> 04:01:34.309 align:start position:0%
 
ugh

04:01:34.309 --> 04:01:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:36.229 --> 04:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
in early june
 
04:01:36.239 --> 04:01:37.429 align:start position:0%
in early june
so

04:01:37.429 --> 04:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:01:39.510 --> 04:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
three new stores three new exciting
 
04:01:42.389 --> 04:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
opportunities to make additional funds
 
04:01:45.110 --> 04:01:45.120 align:start position:0%
so uh obviously tina's here she works
 
04:01:47.189 --> 04:01:47.199 align:start position:0%
with the numbers every day and she'll
 
04:01:48.630 --> 04:01:48.640 align:start position:0%
bring you through
 
04:01:50.710 --> 04:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
the numbers that were sent over
 
04:01:52.950 --> 04:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:01:54.790 --> 04:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chair members of
 
04:01:56.550 --> 04:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is tina
 
04:01:58.790 --> 04:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
demers cfo of the liquor commission
 
04:02:00.630 --> 04:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
before i walk you through the report
 
04:02:02.550 --> 04:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
that we provided i first wanted to
 
04:02:05.189 --> 04:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
explain where we are year to date
 
04:02:07.349 --> 04:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh the revenue numbers on the revenue
 
04:02:08.870 --> 04:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
focus show that we're actually under
 
04:02:13.110 --> 04:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
planned by 4.1 million or 3.7 percent
 
04:02:15.189 --> 04:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
which is not the case because
 
04:02:17.750 --> 04:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
the 108 million and the year-to-date
 
04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
transfer includes the transfers to hhs
 
04:02:23.189 --> 04:02:23.199 align:start position:0%
to date
 
04:02:25.990 --> 04:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
our plan number only includes the 10.4
 
04:02:29.750 --> 04:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
million per the section 176 16 which is
 
04:02:32.229 --> 04:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
the five percent of the previous fiscal
 
04:02:33.830 --> 04:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
year's gross profit
 
04:02:35.990 --> 04:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
the plan does not include the additional
 
04:02:38.550 --> 04:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
8.7 million that's been transferred
 
04:02:42.550 --> 04:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
pursuant to rsa 126 a aaa3
 
04:02:44.389 --> 04:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
because that's calculated quarterly
 
04:02:46.070 --> 04:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
during the fiscal year based on the
 
04:02:48.630 --> 04:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
granted advantage healthcare trust fund
 
04:02:50.189 --> 04:02:50.199 align:start position:0%
needs for
 
04:02:52.389 --> 04:02:52.399 align:start position:0%
non-federal funding
 
04:02:54.070 --> 04:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
so therefore the revenue compared to
 
04:02:56.550 --> 04:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
plan is actually 116
 
04:02:59.910 --> 04:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
million an increase of 4.6 million or
 
04:03:02.710 --> 04:03:02.720 align:start position:0%
4.1 percent um
 
04:03:05.429 --> 04:03:05.439 align:start position:0%
then you deduct the 8.7 million and that
 
04:03:07.670 --> 04:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
leaves the 108 million that's
 
04:03:10.550 --> 04:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
transferred to the general fund
 
04:03:12.710 --> 04:03:12.720 align:start position:0%
so we've actually laid out our
 
04:03:15.110 --> 04:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
presentation in the same manner
 
04:03:18.469 --> 04:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
so if you look at fy22
 
04:03:21.269 --> 04:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
line one which is the net revenue
 
04:03:24.630 --> 04:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
the original plan we had at 148
 
04:03:26.750 --> 04:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
we're now projecting
 
04:03:30.469 --> 04:03:30.479 align:start position:0%
153.7 million and if you deduct the 10.4
 
04:03:33.670 --> 04:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
million which is the 5 of our profits to
 
04:03:39.429 --> 04:03:39.439 align:start position:0%
hhs that has a revised plan of 143.3
 
04:03:42.070 --> 04:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
compared to uh the current plan which is
 
04:03:42.080 --> 04:03:44.790 align:start position:0%
compared to uh the current plan which is
137.6

04:03:44.790 --> 04:03:44.800 align:start position:0%
137.6
 
04:03:48.630 --> 04:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
so we have um a increase of or over plan
 
04:03:53.189 --> 04:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
of 5.7 million and if you look at fy23
 
04:03:55.670 --> 04:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
we have the same comparable increase of
 
04:03:59.750 --> 04:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
about 5.4 million we're projecting
 
04:03:59.760 --> 04:04:00.710 align:start position:0%
about 5.4 million we're projecting
so

04:04:00.710 --> 04:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:04:02.710 --> 04:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
on line six
 
04:04:04.710 --> 04:04:04.720 align:start position:0%
is that additional funds that are being
 
04:04:06.229 --> 04:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
transferred or that have been
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
transferred to hhs the 8.7 million and
 
04:04:11.189 --> 04:04:11.199 align:start position:0%
that would have the transfer to the
 
04:04:12.830 --> 04:04:12.840 align:start position:0%
general fund at
 
04:04:15.750 --> 04:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
134.6 million
 
04:04:18.870 --> 04:04:18.880 align:start position:0%
and then we have beer tax which is stays
 
04:04:21.269 --> 04:04:21.279 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent at about 13.2 million
 
04:04:24.030 --> 04:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
for a total general fund transfer of
 
04:04:26.910 --> 04:04:26.920 align:start position:0%
147.8 million and then
 
04:04:32.710 --> 04:04:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:34.550 --> 04:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
and then at the bottom we did provide
 
04:04:38.870 --> 04:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:41.670 --> 04:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
and i'd be happy to take any question
 
04:04:44.309 --> 04:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of the transfers uh
 
04:04:46.870 --> 04:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
chris provided us a sheet
 
04:04:50.070 --> 04:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
that showed that in july there was from
 
04:04:51.830 --> 04:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
doing this right it was a
 
04:04:53.590 --> 04:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
transfer 10 million and nothing in
 
04:04:55.990 --> 04:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
august september october then 3.1 in
 
04:04:58.389 --> 04:04:58.399 align:start position:0%
november 3.4 in december nothing in
 
04:04:58.399 --> 04:04:59.510 align:start position:0%
november 3.4 in december nothing in
january

04:04:59.510 --> 04:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
january
 
04:05:01.590 --> 04:05:01.600 align:start position:0%
then 2.5
 
04:05:03.990 --> 04:05:04.000 align:start position:0%
is it how come it's not kind of spread
 
04:05:05.429 --> 04:05:05.439 align:start position:0%
evenly or
 
04:05:09.269 --> 04:05:09.279 align:start position:0%
so the 10 million is the the initial 5
 
04:05:12.229 --> 04:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
of the prior year's profit that is
 
04:05:13.990 --> 04:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
transferred and then the rest of it is
 
04:05:17.590 --> 04:05:17.600 align:start position:0%
based on hhs's need for the artist right
 
04:05:19.990 --> 04:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so they do a quarterly assessment
 
04:05:21.910 --> 04:05:21.920 align:start position:0%
for the next six months
 
04:05:24.469 --> 04:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
and then address or request the
 
04:05:25.990 --> 04:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
additional funds and the timing that
 
04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
they'll need it to make sure that they
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:37.349 --> 04:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
yes this is need to pay for medicaid
 
04:05:37.359 --> 04:05:39.189 align:start position:0%
yes this is need to pay for medicaid
right

04:05:39.189 --> 04:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:05:39.199 --> 04:05:40.229 align:start position:0%
right
medicaid

04:05:40.229 --> 04:05:40.239 align:start position:0%

04:06:18.790 --> 04:06:18.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:06:20.550 --> 04:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
new stores
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
as you build them
 
04:06:25.349 --> 04:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
we we don't bond the new stores that
 
04:06:27.429 --> 04:06:27.439 align:start position:0%
were open uh we do it as a partnership
 
04:06:29.670 --> 04:06:29.680 align:start position:0%
with our landlords and we lease those
 
04:06:29.680 --> 04:06:31.189 align:start position:0%
with our landlords and we lease those
locations

04:06:31.189 --> 04:06:31.199 align:start position:0%
locations
 
04:06:31.199 --> 04:06:32.630 align:start position:0%
locations
okay

04:06:32.630 --> 04:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:06:33.910 --> 04:06:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's all done through additional
 
04:06:35.990 --> 04:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
square footage in the first 10 years of
 
04:06:37.990 --> 04:06:38.000 align:start position:0%
the lease and then it drops off at the
 
04:06:42.469 --> 04:06:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:42.479 --> 04:06:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:06:43.750 --> 04:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
you attribute the the fact that we're
 
04:06:49.110 --> 04:06:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:51.750 --> 04:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
because we're opening new stores but any
 
04:06:51.760 --> 04:06:52.630 align:start position:0%
because we're opening new stores but any
other

04:06:52.630 --> 04:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:06:54.070 --> 04:06:54.080 align:start position:0%
i mean maybe you said i was still
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
thinking about the other thing when you
 
04:06:56.790 --> 04:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
first talked
 
04:06:56.800 --> 04:06:57.670 align:start position:0%
first talked
so

04:06:57.670 --> 04:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:06:59.030 --> 04:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
what other factors do you think are
 
04:07:01.590 --> 04:07:01.600 align:start position:0%
there um
 
04:07:01.600 --> 04:07:02.710 align:start position:0%
there um
is

04:07:02.710 --> 04:07:02.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
i mean kovitz kind of i know during the
 
04:07:07.429 --> 04:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
covert period we did a trade-off between
 
04:07:09.510 --> 04:07:09.520 align:start position:0%
what was sold in restaurants versus what
 
04:07:09.520 --> 04:07:10.469 align:start position:0%
what was sold in restaurants versus what
was

04:07:10.469 --> 04:07:10.479 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:07:12.309 --> 04:07:12.319 align:start position:0%
people buying at home
 
04:07:14.309 --> 04:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
buying in your stores
 
04:07:16.150 --> 04:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
is that is that leveled up i've seen the
 
04:07:18.229 --> 04:07:18.239 align:start position:0%
switch well actually restaurants are up
 
04:07:20.469 --> 04:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
just under 40 percent at this point
 
04:07:22.550 --> 04:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
about 38.4
 
04:07:25.189 --> 04:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
so we've seen a nice increase for those
 
04:07:27.670 --> 04:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
business partners people are clearly uh
 
04:07:29.590 --> 04:07:29.600 align:start position:0%
going out and spending their money and
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh you know the only area of the
 
04:07:33.990 --> 04:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
business that seems to be uh
 
04:07:35.750 --> 04:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
that seems to be lagging a little bit as
 
04:07:38.229 --> 04:07:38.239 align:start position:0%
our off-premise sale so the grocery the
 
04:07:39.990 --> 04:07:40.000 align:start position:0%
grocery sales are down about three
 
04:07:42.070 --> 04:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
percent three and a half percent
 
04:07:43.830 --> 04:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
at this point so
 
04:07:46.630 --> 04:07:46.640 align:start position:0%
people aren't uh necessarily buying
 
04:07:48.389 --> 04:07:48.399 align:start position:0%
their spirits at the grocery stores
 
04:07:50.229 --> 04:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
where they did during covet for that
 
04:07:53.429 --> 04:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
convenience they were up 13 14 where the
 
04:07:55.349 --> 04:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
restaurants were down
 
04:07:57.910 --> 04:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
at some point at one point 60 percent
 
04:08:00.790 --> 04:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
but with the restaurants coming back 40
 
04:08:02.630 --> 04:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
which is great for them and our stores
 
04:08:04.710 --> 04:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
are strong as you can see we're above
 
04:08:07.269 --> 04:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
plan above what we projected i'm just
 
04:08:08.710 --> 04:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
thinking out loud here and it's
 
04:08:10.790 --> 04:08:10.800 align:start position:0%
dangerous uh that
 
04:08:12.790 --> 04:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
you know could it be that when the price
 
04:08:14.710 --> 04:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
of a hamburger goes up
 
04:08:16.070 --> 04:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
fifty percent
 
04:08:17.429 --> 04:08:17.439 align:start position:0%
then when it comes to the they get to
 
04:08:19.110 --> 04:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
the wine aisle they go
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
i don't think so
 
04:08:22.469 --> 04:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
well i think there could be a little bit
 
04:08:24.149 --> 04:08:24.159 align:start position:0%
of that going on i think there could be
 
04:08:26.469 --> 04:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
i think the costs of everything have uh
 
04:08:28.550 --> 04:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
have caused people to adjust their
 
04:08:30.550 --> 04:08:30.560 align:start position:0%
buying patterns how about how about the
 
04:08:32.790 --> 04:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
cost of your products your spirits and
 
04:08:34.389 --> 04:08:34.399 align:start position:0%
your wines
 
04:08:34.399 --> 04:08:35.110 align:start position:0%
your wines
the

04:08:35.110 --> 04:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:08:36.870 --> 04:08:36.880 align:start position:0%
the wholesalers
 
04:08:38.950 --> 04:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
looking for you know is it costing you
 
04:08:41.670 --> 04:08:41.680 align:start position:0%
water procure and then this or therefore
 
04:08:43.510 --> 04:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
passing it along to customers those are
 
04:08:45.510 --> 04:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
done quarterly the price increases are
 
04:08:47.269 --> 04:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
done quarterly in this past quarter
 
04:08:49.750 --> 04:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
there was some large increases
 
04:08:51.590 --> 04:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know what we're seeing is what
 
04:08:53.670 --> 04:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
they're saying is the transportation
 
04:08:56.790 --> 04:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
costs have risen exponentially products
 
04:08:58.790 --> 04:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
are sitting in the ports in other
 
04:09:00.710 --> 04:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
countries on ships they're sitting when
 
04:09:03.189 --> 04:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
they get here and time is money with
 
04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
with those products i mean
 
04:09:06.630 --> 04:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
you know everything's got a vintage on
 
04:09:08.630 --> 04:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
it there's another vintage behind it
 
04:09:10.469 --> 04:09:10.479 align:start position:0%
there's one in front of it at the store
 
04:09:13.429 --> 04:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
so when those when those kind of pileups
 
04:09:15.429 --> 04:09:15.439 align:start position:0%
happen you can uh
 
04:09:16.550 --> 04:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:09:18.950 --> 04:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
the cost of doing business just becomes
 
04:09:18.960 --> 04:09:20.950 align:start position:0%
the cost of doing business just becomes
exorbitant

04:09:20.950 --> 04:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
exorbitant
 
04:09:23.110 --> 04:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
glass is a is a big piece of it as well
 
04:09:25.830 --> 04:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
but transportation again glass glass the
 
04:09:28.469 --> 04:09:28.479 align:start position:0%
cost of glass and for for
 
04:09:30.630 --> 04:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
a while during covet especially toward
 
04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
the end we were seeing a lot of our
 
04:09:34.070 --> 04:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
business partners
 
04:09:36.710 --> 04:09:36.720 align:start position:0%
bottle in plastic especially
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
larger companies jim beam bacardi
 
04:09:41.590 --> 04:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
smirnoff they were bottling in plastic
 
04:09:43.269 --> 04:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
because they just couldn't get the glass
 
04:09:44.950 --> 04:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's the first i heard about that
 
04:09:46.950 --> 04:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
class seeing a problem
 
04:09:49.750 --> 04:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
maybe formally yes but
 
04:09:51.429 --> 04:09:51.439 align:start position:0%
now now we're getting down to the now
 
04:09:54.309 --> 04:09:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:54.319 --> 04:09:55.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:09:55.349 --> 04:09:55.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:09:57.429 --> 04:09:57.439 align:start position:0%
okay representative murphy then
 
04:09:59.429 --> 04:09:59.439 align:start position:0%
well thank you just a relatively simple
 
04:10:00.950 --> 04:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
question i guess is
 
04:10:02.950 --> 04:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
i was listening to talk about you know
 
04:10:05.030 --> 04:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
the stores being down to grocery stores
 
04:10:07.590 --> 04:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
but then the restaurants are up
 
04:10:09.750 --> 04:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
per bottle of alcohol whatever it might
 
04:10:09.760 --> 04:10:10.389 align:start position:0%
per bottle of alcohol whatever it might
be

04:10:10.389 --> 04:10:10.399 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:10:11.910 --> 04:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
is the revenue to the state the same
 
04:10:14.870 --> 04:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
whether it's sold in a grocery store
 
04:10:17.590 --> 04:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
uh one of your stores restaurants you
 
04:10:19.590 --> 04:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
know that they purchase is it the same
 
04:10:20.790 --> 04:10:20.800 align:start position:0%
revenue that comes into the state
 
04:10:23.429 --> 04:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
regardless of where it's sold uh no
 
04:10:26.870 --> 04:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
because there are our costs to those uh
 
04:10:28.710 --> 04:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
the people who purchase it varies
 
04:10:31.830 --> 04:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
depending on uh we do a lot we do a
 
04:10:33.269 --> 04:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
whole separate
 
04:10:35.990 --> 04:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh quota of deals for grocery stores
 
04:10:38.389 --> 04:10:38.399 align:start position:0%
that aren't necessarily passed along to
 
04:10:40.550 --> 04:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
restaurants and then we do
 
04:10:43.189 --> 04:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
restaurants get a discount depending on
 
04:10:45.030 --> 04:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
how they buy and where they if they buy
 
04:10:46.710 --> 04:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
from the warehouse they get a 10
 
04:10:49.510 --> 04:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
discount and a lot of restaurants
 
04:10:50.950 --> 04:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
you know especially the smaller
 
04:10:53.990 --> 04:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
independents take advantage of the sales
 
04:10:56.309 --> 04:10:56.319 align:start position:0%
in our stores so uh they're they're
 
04:10:57.990 --> 04:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
allowed to be able to come in and buy at
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
those prices so
 
04:11:01.510 --> 04:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
and just to follow up they're very i'm
 
04:11:04.070 --> 04:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
not trying to be facetious at all but
 
04:11:06.309 --> 04:11:06.319 align:start position:0%
do you see a huge increase in the number
 
04:11:09.030 --> 04:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
of spin top bottles being sold versus
 
04:11:10.309 --> 04:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
cork bottles
 
04:11:12.149 --> 04:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
and the reason i ask that some people
 
04:11:13.750 --> 04:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
have complained to me and say not
 
04:11:15.510 --> 04:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
because of where i'm sitting now but
 
04:11:17.030 --> 04:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
they say i can't get this open anymore
 
04:11:18.309 --> 04:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
the cork in the bottle or something like
 
04:11:20.070 --> 04:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
that have you seen an increase in those
 
04:11:22.469 --> 04:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
sales the stealth enclosure is is the
 
04:11:25.349 --> 04:11:25.359 align:start position:0%
twist off bottle and that's clearly
 
04:11:25.359 --> 04:11:26.550 align:start position:0%
twist off bottle and that's clearly
increased

04:11:26.550 --> 04:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
increased
 
04:11:29.189 --> 04:11:29.199 align:start position:0%
and uh consumers like them and a lot of
 
04:11:31.510 --> 04:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
the wines are going to them the finer
 
04:11:33.030 --> 04:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
wines tend not to
 
04:11:35.590 --> 04:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
to go that way but they're a bit snobby
 
04:11:37.990 --> 04:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
yeah well
 
04:11:39.180 --> 04:11:39.190 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
04:11:39.190 --> 04:11:41.670 align:start position:0%
a lot of
[Laughter]

04:11:41.670 --> 04:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:11:43.750 --> 04:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
but a lot of companies are moving over
 
04:11:45.189 --> 04:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
to that thank you
 
04:11:53.910 --> 04:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:53.920 --> 04:12:02.309 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:12:02.309 --> 04:12:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:04.389 --> 04:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
well total wine is open another store in
 
04:12:06.870 --> 04:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
massachusetts uh i think this is this
 
04:12:10.630 --> 04:12:10.640 align:start position:0%
will be their their seventh and uh but
 
04:12:13.590 --> 04:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
what they have clearly done is they've
 
04:12:16.550 --> 04:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
risen they've driven their prices up in
 
04:12:18.229 --> 04:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
massachusetts which
 
04:12:20.149 --> 04:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
allowed everybody else to go along with
 
04:12:21.990 --> 04:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
it so we have
 
04:12:23.750 --> 04:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
we have seen
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
their prices increase
 
04:12:28.469 --> 04:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
between 12 and 14 percent over the last
 
04:12:31.670 --> 04:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
24 months i think they took advantage of
 
04:12:31.680 --> 04:12:32.790 align:start position:0%
24 months i think they took advantage of
uh

04:12:32.790 --> 04:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:12:35.189 --> 04:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
of the the covet situation knowing that
 
04:12:37.189 --> 04:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
people were at home and they're kind of
 
04:12:39.670 --> 04:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
the big retailer there we've we've had
 
04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
some price increases but we've tried to
 
04:12:43.750 --> 04:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
to keep our advantage
 
04:12:45.830 --> 04:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
and we advertise in the in the globe
 
04:12:47.990 --> 04:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
usually once a month or twice a month to
 
04:12:50.309 --> 04:12:50.319 align:start position:0%
show those advantages we're still
 
04:12:53.189 --> 04:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
between two and twelve dollars on
 
04:12:56.229 --> 04:12:56.239 align:start position:0%
average and on some higher priced items
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
we can be 30 or 40 dollars cheaper than
 
04:12:58.800 --> 04:12:59.750 align:start position:0%
we can be 30 or 40 dollars cheaper than
total

04:12:59.750 --> 04:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
total
 
04:12:59.760 --> 04:13:01.429 align:start position:0%
total
so

04:13:01.429 --> 04:13:01.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:13:03.910 --> 04:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
it is it's it's interesting to see what
 
04:13:05.830 --> 04:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
they've done massachusetts has taken
 
04:13:09.110 --> 04:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
several price increases which uh which
 
04:13:11.590 --> 04:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
has clearly helped our business and i
 
04:13:13.269 --> 04:13:13.279 align:start position:0%
think we'll help it into the future as
 
04:13:13.279 --> 04:13:14.469 align:start position:0%
think we'll help it into the future as
well

04:13:14.469 --> 04:13:14.479 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:13:16.149 --> 04:13:16.159 align:start position:0%
and these new stores
 
04:13:17.590 --> 04:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
04:13:19.910 --> 04:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
the model works people are buying and
 
04:13:21.670 --> 04:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
you know the new store and range that's
 
04:13:24.070 --> 04:13:24.080 align:start position:0%
all business from mass and we're trying
 
04:13:25.990 --> 04:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
to stay as close to the borders and the
 
04:13:27.830 --> 04:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
highways as we can
 
04:13:30.469 --> 04:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
we recognize that that's where
 
04:13:32.630 --> 04:13:32.640 align:start position:0%
a lot of our business comes from can you
 
04:13:33.670 --> 04:13:33.680 align:start position:0%
tell from
 
04:13:35.910 --> 04:13:35.920 align:start position:0%
the credit cards or how do you tell that
 
04:13:38.070 --> 04:13:38.080 align:start position:0%
this mess was it someone periodically
 
04:13:39.269 --> 04:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
look in the parking lot and see all the
 
04:13:41.510 --> 04:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
mess plates uh we do surveys in the
 
04:13:43.830 --> 04:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
store we usually do exit surveys in the
 
04:13:45.189 --> 04:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
store to see
 
04:13:47.670 --> 04:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
where where people are coming from our
 
04:13:49.910 --> 04:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
advertising company our marketing and pr
 
04:13:52.070 --> 04:13:52.080 align:start position:0%
company does that
 
04:13:52.080 --> 04:13:52.790 align:start position:0%
company does that
now

04:13:52.790 --> 04:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:13:53.910 --> 04:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
i think representative romney had her
 
04:13:55.750 --> 04:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
hand up first and represented murphy
 
04:13:58.469 --> 04:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd just say that they usually ask
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
for the zip code
 
04:14:04.149 --> 04:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
they did it the last time
 
04:14:04.159 --> 04:14:05.189 align:start position:0%
they did it the last time
uh

04:14:05.189 --> 04:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:14:07.990 --> 04:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
but i'm wondering
 
04:14:10.550 --> 04:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
a large part of the lower part of the
 
04:14:14.469 --> 04:14:14.479 align:start position:0%
market especially has been domestic
 
04:14:16.550 --> 04:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
in the wine sectors
 
04:14:16.560 --> 04:14:18.309 align:start position:0%
in the wine sectors
and

04:14:18.309 --> 04:14:18.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:14:21.110 --> 04:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
on most of that is coming from places
 
04:14:23.750 --> 04:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
that are ravaged by drought and fire and
 
04:14:27.750 --> 04:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
i'm do you have any idea how the
 
04:14:30.070 --> 04:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
how the california
 
04:14:30.080 --> 04:14:31.429 align:start position:0%
how the california
oregon

04:14:31.429 --> 04:14:31.439 align:start position:0%
oregon
 
04:14:31.439 --> 04:14:32.790 align:start position:0%
oregon
market

04:14:32.790 --> 04:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
market
 
04:14:32.800 --> 04:14:33.750 align:start position:0%
market
on

04:14:33.750 --> 04:14:33.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:14:37.269 --> 04:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
production is going are they disappear
 
04:14:39.830 --> 04:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
going to disappear on us or
 
04:14:43.510 --> 04:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
no i think a lot of the smaller wineries
 
04:14:45.269 --> 04:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
that have been family owned for a number
 
04:14:48.830 --> 04:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
of years have sold to larger
 
04:14:52.389 --> 04:14:52.399 align:start position:0%
conglomerates uh the smoke tank is is
 
04:14:54.229 --> 04:14:54.239 align:start position:0%
is what you're speaking about especially
 
04:14:56.469 --> 04:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
last year a lot of wines
 
04:14:58.149 --> 04:14:58.159 align:start position:0%
didn't bottle last year a lot of
 
04:14:59.910 --> 04:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
companies didn't bottle so you won't see
 
04:15:03.830 --> 04:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
vintages on finer wines from from those
 
04:15:08.229 --> 04:15:08.239 align:start position:0%
wineries and some wineries bottled and
 
04:15:10.870 --> 04:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
are now having to have those products
 
04:15:13.349 --> 04:15:13.359 align:start position:0%
returned because the the smoke tank is
 
04:15:15.269 --> 04:15:15.279 align:start position:0%
clearly in the wines
 
04:15:17.670 --> 04:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
luckily at this point we haven't had no
 
04:15:19.830 --> 04:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
consumer complaints about that
 
04:15:22.070 --> 04:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
but it's clearly something that that has
 
04:15:22.080 --> 04:15:24.550 align:start position:0%
but it's clearly something that that has
happened

04:15:24.550 --> 04:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:27.750 --> 04:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
richard murphy thank you um i was just
 
04:15:29.990 --> 04:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
reflecting on when i was traveling prior
 
04:15:32.710 --> 04:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
to covid down in the carolinas or in
 
04:15:33.830 --> 04:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
some of the southern states and they
 
04:15:36.070 --> 04:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
have the dr i'm thinking about the
 
04:15:38.950 --> 04:15:38.960 align:start position:0%
covid experience and what may actually
 
04:15:40.710 --> 04:15:40.720 align:start position:0%
help sales is they have the
 
04:15:41.990 --> 04:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
drive-throughs as you're probably well
 
04:15:44.870 --> 04:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
aware of where you call in and you open
 
04:15:46.070 --> 04:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
up the trunk and they just dump it in
 
04:15:47.670 --> 04:15:47.680 align:start position:0%
you keep going and so there's actually
 
04:15:49.590 --> 04:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
no exposure and i was just wondering
 
04:15:50.790 --> 04:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
have we ever thought of that in the
 
04:15:52.149 --> 04:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
state for drive-through is there a
 
04:15:53.429 --> 04:15:53.439 align:start position:0%
reason we couldn't do something like
 
04:15:57.269 --> 04:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
that how we do that we we have 25 of our
 
04:16:00.229 --> 04:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
stores have curbside pickup curbside
 
04:16:02.070 --> 04:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
curbside pickup is what we call it so
 
04:16:03.590 --> 04:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
you can go online
 
04:16:05.670 --> 04:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh order your product
 
04:16:08.070 --> 04:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
it it goes into the store you pick your
 
04:16:10.070 --> 04:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
store that you want
 
04:16:12.229 --> 04:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
to have it done in i believe it's 25 it
 
04:16:14.870 --> 04:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
may be 26 stores where we do it now and
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
all the new stores that we're opening
 
04:16:18.630 --> 04:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
automatically do it so you can just pick
 
04:16:20.070 --> 04:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
up pull up to the curb there's
 
04:16:23.269 --> 04:16:23.279 align:start position:0%
designated spaces one through six
 
04:16:26.630 --> 04:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
depending on the store you you let the
 
04:16:28.389 --> 04:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
you call the store at that point you let
 
04:16:29.750 --> 04:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
them know you're out there they come out
 
04:16:32.149 --> 04:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
and drop your product in the trunk
 
04:16:38.710 --> 04:16:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:40.469 --> 04:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
04:16:41.670 --> 04:16:41.680 align:start position:0%
representative murphy don't get out
 
04:16:46.070 --> 04:16:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:46.080 --> 04:16:47.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:16:47.269 --> 04:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:49.750 --> 04:16:49.760 align:start position:0%
rivers representative genegan
 
04:16:52.630 --> 04:16:52.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um so i think you
 
04:16:54.309 --> 04:16:54.319 align:start position:0%
mentioned that one of the stores is
 
04:16:56.870 --> 04:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
moving in range to another location so
 
04:16:58.550 --> 04:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
does that mean it's a net add of two
 
04:17:01.510 --> 04:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
stores to the total it will be yes
 
04:17:04.710 --> 04:17:04.720 align:start position:0%
okay so the the ring stores uh you know
 
04:17:06.229 --> 04:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to get rid of some of
 
04:17:08.070 --> 04:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
these older uh
 
04:17:10.070 --> 04:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
less convenient locations that don't
 
04:17:12.229 --> 04:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
have enough skus quite frankly it's the
 
04:17:14.389 --> 04:17:14.399 align:start position:0%
main reason why the selection isn't
 
04:17:18.870 --> 04:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
there total wine averages 18 to 26 000
 
04:17:19.990 --> 04:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
square feet
 
04:17:24.790 --> 04:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:26.870 --> 04:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
eight years we've we've
 
04:17:29.429 --> 04:17:29.439 align:start position:0%
closed 12 stores but we've actually
 
04:17:32.710 --> 04:17:32.720 align:start position:0%
added just under 300 000 square feet of
 
04:17:32.720 --> 04:17:33.590 align:start position:0%
added just under 300 000 square feet of
store

04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
store
 
04:17:36.229 --> 04:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
of sales floor so nice you know when we
 
04:17:38.389 --> 04:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
try to try to make the stores a little
 
04:17:40.710 --> 04:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
bit bigger a little bit more welcoming
 
04:17:43.110 --> 04:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
and a little more convenient
 
04:17:47.269 --> 04:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:49.750 --> 04:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
going back to the supply chain
 
04:17:51.670 --> 04:17:51.680 align:start position:0%
i know my daughter works for a company
 
04:17:53.349 --> 04:17:53.359 align:start position:0%
that was having a problem getting those
 
04:17:55.269 --> 04:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
products from china
 
04:17:57.990 --> 04:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
there was a shortage of containers
 
04:17:59.910 --> 04:17:59.920 align:start position:0%
and the price per container rental was
 
04:18:01.510 --> 04:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
like unbelievable
 
04:18:03.670 --> 04:18:03.680 align:start position:0%
i think it's come down now i mean was
 
04:18:05.670 --> 04:18:05.680 align:start position:0%
that did you face some of that with your
 
04:18:07.269 --> 04:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
product coming from overseas our
 
04:18:09.990 --> 04:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
suppliers certainly do yeah the cost of
 
04:18:12.070 --> 04:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
containers is has
 
04:18:14.309 --> 04:18:14.319 align:start position:0%
in some cases doubled
 
04:18:15.510 --> 04:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:18:16.630 --> 04:18:16.640 align:start position:0%
you know there
 
04:18:19.510 --> 04:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
i think the companies that sell uh
 
04:18:22.469 --> 04:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
in general especially wine and spirits
 
04:18:24.790 --> 04:18:24.800 align:start position:0%
are working on thinner margins the
 
04:18:27.110 --> 04:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
suppliers are right because you you
 
04:18:29.030 --> 04:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
can't pass along these
 
04:18:32.149 --> 04:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
exorbitant increases to the consumers
 
04:18:32.159 --> 04:18:33.110 align:start position:0%
exorbitant increases to the consumers
because

04:18:33.110 --> 04:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
04:18:35.429 --> 04:18:35.439 align:start position:0%
your your products will suffer
 
04:18:35.439 --> 04:18:36.469 align:start position:0%
your your products will suffer
people

04:18:36.469 --> 04:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
they have a price range where they'll
 
04:18:40.950 --> 04:18:40.960 align:start position:0%
spend for x
 
04:18:43.670 --> 04:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
and uh suppliers understand that so i
 
04:18:45.750 --> 04:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
think that their their profits have
 
04:18:45.760 --> 04:18:46.870 align:start position:0%
think that their their profits have
suffered

04:18:46.870 --> 04:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
suffered
 
04:18:49.670 --> 04:18:49.680 align:start position:0%
we expect price increases to happen and
 
04:18:51.830 --> 04:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
they do but i really think that the
 
04:18:55.750 --> 04:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
suppliers have restrained themselves in
 
04:18:55.760 --> 04:18:56.630 align:start position:0%
suppliers have restrained themselves in
in

04:18:56.630 --> 04:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:19:02.469 --> 04:19:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:05.670 --> 04:19:05.680 align:start position:0%
so any other questions from anybody
 
04:19:07.750 --> 04:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look that way thank you very
 
04:19:09.510 --> 04:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
much thank you as always thanks for
 
04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
coming in thank you appreciate it good
 
04:19:13.510 --> 04:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
to see you we'll see you in uh hopefully
 
04:19:15.349 --> 04:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
in january thank you
 
04:19:16.870 --> 04:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
we do well
 
04:19:23.830 --> 04:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:23.840 --> 04:19:25.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:19:25.269 --> 04:19:25.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:19:26.950 --> 04:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
next we have
 
04:19:28.830 --> 04:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear from
 
04:19:31.030 --> 04:19:31.040 align:start position:0%
hhs um
 
04:19:33.030 --> 04:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
and henry lippin was we just heard from
 
04:19:33.040 --> 04:19:36.070 align:start position:0%
and henry lippin was we just heard from
and

04:19:36.070 --> 04:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:37.910 --> 04:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
right right thank you
 
04:19:39.510 --> 04:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
is it amy amy
 
04:19:43.110 --> 04:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
and there's a handout
 
04:19:50.070 --> 04:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:53.830 --> 04:19:53.840 align:start position:0%
okay this this this goes to the well you
 
04:19:56.229 --> 04:19:56.239 align:start position:0%
start on the wall sure thank you again
 
04:19:58.149 --> 04:19:58.159 align:start position:0%
for the record henry lipman the medicaid
 
04:20:00.070 --> 04:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
director and athena gagnon medicaid
 
04:20:01.429 --> 04:20:01.439 align:start position:0%
finance director
 
04:20:03.429 --> 04:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
um try to put together some information
 
04:20:04.630 --> 04:20:04.640 align:start position:0%
that we hope is responsive to what
 
04:20:07.189 --> 04:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
you're trying to look at um
 
04:20:09.429 --> 04:20:09.439 align:start position:0%
and uh based on the last presentation
 
04:20:10.950 --> 04:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
one of the things i'd share with you is
 
04:20:13.990 --> 04:20:14.000 align:start position:0%
that you know the original statutory
 
04:20:16.870 --> 04:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
five percent is what we expect we'll be
 
04:20:19.269 --> 04:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
needing to draw in the long term the
 
04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
additional amounts that are occurring
 
04:20:22.469 --> 04:20:22.479 align:start position:0%
now is because of the unusual
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
circumstance that's happened because of
 
04:20:25.510 --> 04:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
the federal
 
04:20:27.910 --> 04:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
public health emergency that requires
 
04:20:30.229 --> 04:20:30.239 align:start position:0%
states because they're getting
 
04:20:31.990 --> 04:20:32.000 align:start position:0%
additional federal matching percentage
 
04:20:34.149 --> 04:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
to have continuous enrollment as long as
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
the public health emergency continues
 
04:20:40.149 --> 04:20:40.159 align:start position:0%
we should find out next week whether
 
04:20:42.950 --> 04:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
they plan to continue it further
 
04:20:43.990 --> 04:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
if they
 
04:20:46.389 --> 04:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
announce next week that it would end it
 
04:20:49.189 --> 04:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
would end july 15th
 
04:20:51.429 --> 04:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
and the disenrollment would start august
 
04:20:51.439 --> 04:20:52.550 align:start position:0%
and the disenrollment would start august
1st

04:20:52.550 --> 04:20:52.560 align:start position:0%
1st
 
04:20:54.950 --> 04:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's speculation that they may extend
 
04:20:57.110 --> 04:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
it again partly because of
 
04:20:59.429 --> 04:20:59.439 align:start position:0%
what they're seeing um uh
 
04:21:01.349 --> 04:21:01.359 align:start position:0%
epidemiologically but i just want to
 
04:21:03.429 --> 04:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
give you some sense of that the
 
04:21:05.269 --> 04:21:05.279 align:start position:0%
the major place where we saw an increase
 
04:21:07.189 --> 04:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
in enrollment is unfortunately in the
 
04:21:09.269 --> 04:21:09.279 align:start position:0%
granite advantage program in one sense
 
04:21:10.550 --> 04:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a good thing compared to
 
04:21:12.870 --> 04:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
other states that
 
04:21:12.880 --> 04:21:13.910 align:start position:0%
other states that
the

04:21:13.910 --> 04:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:21:15.990 --> 04:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
level of poverty comparing where new
 
04:21:18.070 --> 04:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire started for example
 
04:21:20.389 --> 04:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
one in four people in vermont
 
04:21:21.429 --> 04:21:21.439 align:start position:0%
at the start of the public health
 
04:21:21.439 --> 04:21:23.110 align:start position:0%
at the start of the public health
emergency

04:21:23.110 --> 04:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
04:21:24.550 --> 04:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
were in medicaid in new hampshire that
 
04:21:26.070 --> 04:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
was like one in seven
 
04:21:29.110 --> 04:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
in maine it was one and one in every 5.5
 
04:21:31.590 --> 04:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
people so we started with a higher
 
04:21:33.670 --> 04:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
level of people outside of medicaid and
 
04:21:35.269 --> 04:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
that the people that
 
04:21:37.030 --> 04:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
came on particularly at the beginning
 
04:21:39.510 --> 04:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
was associated with the sudden increase
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
in unemployment if you remember at the
 
04:21:43.670 --> 04:21:43.680 align:start position:0%
very early stages we had unemployment
 
04:21:46.870 --> 04:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
rates up at 17 or more
 
04:21:49.030 --> 04:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
but you can see across the state on the
 
04:21:50.630 --> 04:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
second uh
 
04:21:53.590 --> 04:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
page we showed the increase since march
 
04:21:56.149 --> 04:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
20th march excuse me the
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
third week in a march uh of 2020 that
 
04:22:01.670 --> 04:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
you know the increase in
 
04:22:01.680 --> 04:22:02.630 align:start position:0%
you know the increase in
in

04:22:02.630 --> 04:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:22:04.469 --> 04:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
enrollment in the granite advantage
 
04:22:07.349 --> 04:22:07.359 align:start position:0%
program has been you know pretty uh
 
04:22:10.229 --> 04:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
comparable across the whole state um
 
04:22:11.910 --> 04:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
if you look at the the north country a
 
04:22:13.670 --> 04:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
little bit less because of the
 
04:22:16.229 --> 04:22:16.239 align:start position:0%
demographics of that area also because
 
04:22:17.269 --> 04:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
more people
 
04:22:20.070 --> 04:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
were on medicaid in the north country as
 
04:22:24.550 --> 04:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:26.790 --> 04:22:26.800 align:start position:0%
so we today
 
04:22:29.990 --> 04:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
off you go to the third page
 
04:22:33.349 --> 04:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
that 71.9 increase in enrollment since
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
on march 16th of 2020
 
04:22:37.990 --> 04:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
represents about almost 37 000
 
04:22:38.000 --> 04:22:39.910 align:start position:0%
represents about almost 37 000
individuals

04:22:39.910 --> 04:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
04:22:41.590 --> 04:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
today um
 
04:22:43.590 --> 04:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
we understand we're protecting
 
04:22:45.990 --> 04:22:46.000 align:start position:0%
because of the requirement federally
 
04:22:48.550 --> 04:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
almost 40 000 people
 
04:22:50.070 --> 04:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
today that
 
04:22:52.149 --> 04:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
may or may not continue to be eligible
 
04:22:54.389 --> 04:22:54.399 align:start position:0%
once that public health emergency is
 
04:22:57.110 --> 04:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
over we're expecting
 
04:22:59.990 --> 04:23:00.000 align:start position:0%
assuming a public health emergency ends
 
04:23:02.149 --> 04:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
july 15th that we could get back to a
 
04:23:04.710 --> 04:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
more normal enrollment by
 
04:23:07.030 --> 04:23:07.040 align:start position:0%
april of 23 is kind of what we project
 
04:23:08.950 --> 04:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
if it gets pushed out further that's
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
obviously going to push that time frame
 
04:23:10.800 --> 04:23:13.349 align:start position:0%
obviously going to push that time frame
out

04:23:13.349 --> 04:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:13.359 --> 04:23:20.550 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:23:20.550 --> 04:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:22.630 --> 04:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not really
 
04:23:25.030 --> 04:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
quick hearing oral presentation or
 
04:23:26.309 --> 04:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
figures but
 
04:23:28.550 --> 04:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
it sounded like you said that maine and
 
04:23:28.560 --> 04:23:29.990 align:start position:0%
it sounded like you said that maine and
vermont

04:23:29.990 --> 04:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
04:23:30.000 --> 04:23:31.429 align:start position:0%
vermont
had

04:23:31.429 --> 04:23:31.439 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:23:31.439 --> 04:23:32.469 align:start position:0%
had
less

04:23:32.469 --> 04:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
less
 
04:23:34.389 --> 04:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
poverty than new hampshire no the
 
04:23:36.630 --> 04:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
opposite the opposite that they had as a
 
04:23:38.550 --> 04:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
percentage of the population
 
04:23:40.309 --> 04:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
they were like 25
 
04:23:42.870 --> 04:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
in vermont more than 25 percent of the
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
population is on medicaid whereas in new
 
04:23:46.630 --> 04:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire it's under 14
 
04:23:48.229 --> 04:23:48.239 align:start position:0%
at the start of
 
04:23:49.269 --> 04:23:49.279 align:start position:0%
this so
 
04:23:51.349 --> 04:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
you know if you look at also the federal
 
04:23:53.110 --> 04:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
matching percentage that
 
04:23:56.309 --> 04:23:56.319 align:start position:0%
maine gets is like over 62 percent and
 
04:23:58.950 --> 04:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
vermont's over 56 percent new hampshire
 
04:24:00.070 --> 04:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
is at the
 
04:24:02.309 --> 04:24:02.319 align:start position:0%
the federal minimum which is 50 percent
 
04:24:04.309 --> 04:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
similar to massachusetts
 
04:24:04.319 --> 04:24:05.910 align:start position:0%
similar to massachusetts
stronger

04:24:05.910 --> 04:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
stronger
 
04:24:05.920 --> 04:24:07.349 align:start position:0%
stronger
employment

04:24:07.349 --> 04:24:07.359 align:start position:0%
employment
 
04:24:07.359 --> 04:24:09.030 align:start position:0%
employment
socioeconomic

04:24:09.030 --> 04:24:09.040 align:start position:0%
socioeconomic
 
04:24:11.189 --> 04:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
status if you will good well i'm glad i
 
04:24:12.469 --> 04:24:12.479 align:start position:0%
asked the question thank you you're
 
04:24:14.950 --> 04:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you for asking so
 
04:24:17.830 --> 04:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
we started at 14 where where are we now
 
04:24:20.229 --> 04:24:20.239 align:start position:0%
so i think probably today we're close to
 
04:24:20.239 --> 04:24:21.349 align:start position:0%
so i think probably today we're close to
um

04:24:21.349 --> 04:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:23.429 --> 04:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
one in
 
04:24:25.670 --> 04:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
close to six um
 
04:24:28.790 --> 04:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
in terms of the total population um
 
04:24:30.550 --> 04:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
and you know for granted advantage it's
 
04:24:32.229 --> 04:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
been a significant increase i think
 
04:24:33.269 --> 04:24:33.279 align:start position:0%
we're about
 
04:24:35.030 --> 04:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
less than 20 percent when you consider
 
04:24:37.110 --> 04:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
all populations in terms of the the
 
04:24:41.910 --> 04:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:41.920 --> 04:24:42.790 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:24:42.790 --> 04:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:24:44.389 --> 04:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
as i said i think
 
04:24:45.510 --> 04:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
you know as
 
04:24:49.910 --> 04:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
employment has rebounded and as um
 
04:24:52.469 --> 04:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
the economy's picked up and i think that
 
04:24:54.550 --> 04:24:54.560 align:start position:0%
we'll see a significant drop in this
 
04:24:56.550 --> 04:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
population you know as soon as we're
 
04:24:59.590 --> 04:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
able to start to unwind
 
04:25:01.750 --> 04:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative murphy thank you aside
 
04:25:04.070 --> 04:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
from just increased employment and wages
 
04:25:05.269 --> 04:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
going up
 
04:25:07.670 --> 04:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
what's the other criteria or metrics
 
04:25:09.510 --> 04:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
that are going to be
 
04:25:12.550 --> 04:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
effectively changed say july of 22 if
 
04:25:14.710 --> 04:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
the emergency is lifted
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
so the eligibility uh for this program
 
04:25:18.479 --> 04:25:19.189 align:start position:0%
so the eligibility uh for this program
is

04:25:19.189 --> 04:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:25:22.950 --> 04:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
up to a 138 percent of poverty so if
 
04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
someone is above that now because
 
04:25:26.550 --> 04:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
they've gotten wage increases or what
 
04:25:27.830 --> 04:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
have you
 
04:25:29.670 --> 04:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
they'll likely not be able to continue
 
04:25:32.149 --> 04:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
on this program they may qualify
 
04:25:35.349 --> 04:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
to become um on the exchange the for the
 
04:25:37.429 --> 04:25:37.439 align:start position:0%
federal exchange there are also some
 
04:25:38.870 --> 04:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
people that because of the continuous
 
04:25:41.590 --> 04:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
enrollment who were older to begin with
 
04:25:43.269 --> 04:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
since we couldn't drop them from
 
04:25:44.870 --> 04:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
enrollment may qualify for medicare at
 
04:25:46.790 --> 04:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
this point because they may have come on
 
04:25:48.630 --> 04:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
the program in their late 60s as an
 
04:25:56.630 --> 04:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:56.640 --> 04:25:57.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:25:57.750 --> 04:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:00.309 --> 04:26:00.319 align:start position:0%
just from a historical standpoint when
 
04:26:03.750 --> 04:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
in 2018 it was senate bill 313 that
 
04:26:05.990 --> 04:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
implemented the grant advantage program
 
04:26:08.630 --> 04:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
that original um
 
04:26:10.790 --> 04:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
source of five percent of the gross
 
04:26:12.790 --> 04:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
liquor profits uh
 
04:26:16.389 --> 04:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
uh the formula for that is actually on
 
04:26:17.590 --> 04:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
the last page we have a little
 
04:26:19.189 --> 04:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
calculation for you
 
04:26:21.429 --> 04:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
um by the way we agree with the liquid
 
04:26:22.630 --> 04:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
commission's money on the amount of
 
04:26:24.070 --> 04:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
money that's to be
 
04:26:24.080 --> 04:26:25.670 align:start position:0%
money that's to be
transferred

04:26:25.670 --> 04:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
transferred
 
04:26:29.030 --> 04:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
but then in 2019
 
04:26:30.950 --> 04:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
the legislature passed
 
04:26:33.510 --> 04:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
the provision since they capped the
 
04:26:36.710 --> 04:26:36.720 align:start position:0%
other sources of non-federal share that
 
04:26:38.710 --> 04:26:38.720 align:start position:0%
in to the extent there was a need for
 
04:26:41.030 --> 04:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
additional money we could go back to
 
04:26:42.630 --> 04:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
draw additional money from liquor fund
 
04:26:44.870 --> 04:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
as i mentioned i think absent the public
 
04:26:46.790 --> 04:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
health emergency we wouldn't be looking
 
04:26:49.510 --> 04:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
for that second draw if you will
 
04:26:53.349 --> 04:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
and then on page five is taken from the
 
04:26:56.830 --> 04:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
statute the different sources of
 
04:26:57.910 --> 04:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
of um
 
04:27:00.790 --> 04:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
of revenue that comes into the program
 
04:27:02.229 --> 04:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
and then lastly
 
04:27:07.750 --> 04:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:17.990 --> 04:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:19.750 --> 04:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so what page are we on right now so
 
04:27:21.910 --> 04:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
i was covering um did a little they're
 
04:27:24.389 --> 04:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
in the in the yellow is there's a little
 
04:27:26.389 --> 04:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
teeny number in the upper corner page
 
04:27:28.550 --> 04:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
four was talking about the
 
04:27:30.870 --> 04:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
the original funding source which is the
 
04:27:32.229 --> 04:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
five percent of
 
04:27:33.510 --> 04:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
of um
 
04:27:35.670 --> 04:27:35.680 align:start position:0%
gross profits from the
 
04:27:35.680 --> 04:27:37.110 align:start position:0%
gross profits from the
liquor

04:27:37.110 --> 04:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
04:27:38.229 --> 04:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:27:38.239 --> 04:27:39.269 align:start position:0%
and then
the

04:27:39.269 --> 04:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:27:41.510 --> 04:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
sources of other revenue that
 
04:27:43.269 --> 04:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
finance granted advantage is what you
 
04:27:44.469 --> 04:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
see on page
 
04:27:44.479 --> 04:27:46.950 align:start position:0%
see on page
five

04:27:46.950 --> 04:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:49.110 --> 04:27:49.120 align:start position:0%
and then i was jumping to the last page
 
04:27:50.630 --> 04:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me um
 
04:27:53.030 --> 04:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
which is sort of a history of what we've
 
04:27:56.790 --> 04:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
drawn going back to
 
04:28:00.469 --> 04:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
the beginning here from from the program
 
04:28:03.349 --> 04:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
and underneath the chart is the
 
04:28:03.359 --> 04:28:05.670 align:start position:0%
and underneath the chart is the
additional

04:28:05.670 --> 04:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
additional
 
04:28:09.830 --> 04:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
part of statute that was added in 2019
 
04:28:12.550 --> 04:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
that identified if there was a shortfall
 
04:28:15.030 --> 04:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
beyond the other sources of
 
04:28:17.030 --> 04:28:17.040 align:start position:0%
funding that we could go back to the
 
04:28:19.269 --> 04:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
liquor commission for
 
04:28:22.309 --> 04:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
additional funding which is why if you
 
04:28:23.750 --> 04:28:23.760 align:start position:0%
look at
 
04:28:25.750 --> 04:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
line six of
 
04:28:27.429 --> 04:28:27.439 align:start position:0%
what the liquor
 
04:28:29.830 --> 04:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
commission passed out
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
on their second page you'll see that uh
 
04:28:35.990 --> 04:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
the 8.2 and the 8.7
 
04:28:37.670 --> 04:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
million those were the additional quests
 
04:28:40.630 --> 04:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
we needed to to make because the
 
04:28:43.110 --> 04:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
the population increased by you know
 
04:28:47.269 --> 04:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:47.279 --> 04:28:48.229 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:28:48.229 --> 04:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:28:50.870 --> 04:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
we had the insurance department in here
 
04:28:52.630 --> 04:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
this morning
 
04:28:54.550 --> 04:28:54.560 align:start position:0%
and looks like they transfer some money
 
04:28:57.590 --> 04:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
in as well yes uh can you touch on that
 
04:29:00.070 --> 04:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
yes the the
 
04:29:03.349 --> 04:29:03.359 align:start position:0%
again back to uh the financing of the
 
04:29:04.950 --> 04:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
grant advantage program one of the
 
04:29:10.870 --> 04:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:15.840 --> 04:29:17.670 align:start position:0%
 
yep

04:29:17.670 --> 04:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:29:18.790 --> 04:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:29:21.269 --> 04:29:21.279 align:start position:0%
quicker than me
 
04:29:21.279 --> 04:29:22.149 align:start position:0%
quicker than me
the

04:29:22.149 --> 04:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:29:24.469 --> 04:29:24.479 align:start position:0%
there's a two percent tax on the
 
04:29:27.030 --> 04:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
insurance policies because the
 
04:29:29.189 --> 04:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
managed care under medicaid is delivered
 
04:29:34.070 --> 04:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
by uh um commercial insurance plans and
 
04:29:35.910 --> 04:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
so that's subject to the two percent tax
 
04:29:37.269 --> 04:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
and at the time
 
04:29:40.229 --> 04:29:40.239 align:start position:0%
the thinking was let's use that
 
04:29:42.870 --> 04:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
meaning the legislature that let's use
 
04:29:45.110 --> 04:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
that two percent funding towards funding
 
04:29:47.429 --> 04:29:47.439 align:start position:0%
this program as well
 
04:29:49.910 --> 04:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
and so that's that source of money
 
04:29:52.229 --> 04:29:52.239 align:start position:0%
the the third source
 
04:29:52.239 --> 04:29:53.030 align:start position:0%
the the third source
is

04:29:53.030 --> 04:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:29:55.429 --> 04:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire health plan which some
 
04:29:57.189 --> 04:29:57.199 align:start position:0%
people may remember as the high risk
 
04:29:57.199 --> 04:29:58.790 align:start position:0%
people may remember as the high risk
pool

04:29:58.790 --> 04:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
pool
 
04:30:00.790 --> 04:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
they um
 
04:30:02.870 --> 04:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
make a contribution as well
 
04:30:05.189 --> 04:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
that's fixed by statute to be not more
 
04:30:05.199 --> 04:30:05.990 align:start position:0%
that's fixed by statute to be not more
than

04:30:05.990 --> 04:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
than
 
04:30:06.000 --> 04:30:06.870 align:start position:0%
than
um

04:30:06.870 --> 04:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:09.510 --> 04:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
the same amount that both the liquor
 
04:30:11.189 --> 04:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
money contributes
 
04:30:13.349 --> 04:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
the original five percent not the
 
04:30:15.269 --> 04:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
additional the original five percent
 
04:30:18.149 --> 04:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
liquor plus the premium tax so
 
04:30:20.710 --> 04:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
that's the second the third source
 
04:30:22.389 --> 04:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
and it's only when those three sources
 
04:30:23.429 --> 04:30:23.439 align:start position:0%
are not
 
04:30:25.429 --> 04:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
sufficient that we would go back to
 
04:30:25.439 --> 04:30:26.630 align:start position:0%
sufficient that we would go back to
liquor

04:30:26.630 --> 04:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
04:30:28.710 --> 04:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
and again we hope that
 
04:30:30.469 --> 04:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
through the reduction in enrollment we
 
04:30:32.070 --> 04:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
won't be going back in
 
04:30:34.710 --> 04:30:34.720 align:start position:0%
and at least state fiscal year 24.
 
04:30:36.550 --> 04:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
groups around me
 
04:30:40.070 --> 04:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
if i could just add to that a
 
04:30:43.030 --> 04:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
is the liquor fund
 
04:30:45.750 --> 04:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
on it's what we permanently gave to
 
04:30:47.269 --> 04:30:47.279 align:start position:0%
liquor fund
 
04:30:50.229 --> 04:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh 10 years or more ago
 
04:30:50.239 --> 04:30:52.309 align:start position:0%
uh 10 years or more ago
and

04:30:52.309 --> 04:30:52.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:30:54.710 --> 04:30:54.720 align:start position:0%
it's been diverted to this
 
04:30:56.389 --> 04:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
as well
 
04:30:57.830 --> 04:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
because it says the alcohol abuse
 
04:31:00.630 --> 04:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
prevention treatment right when they
 
04:31:01.830 --> 04:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
when they
 
04:31:04.309 --> 04:31:04.319 align:start position:0%
diverted it they left language that
 
04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
would have expired
 
04:31:09.830 --> 04:31:09.840 align:start position:0%
that fund completely and uh last term i
 
04:31:12.229 --> 04:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
got a bill through that
 
04:31:14.550 --> 04:31:14.560 align:start position:0%
that fixed that problem so that people
 
04:31:17.030 --> 04:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
knew that it belonged to the alcohol
 
04:31:18.950 --> 04:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
fund right so that was
 
04:31:21.269 --> 04:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
being they found other money elsewhere i
 
04:31:23.110 --> 04:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
don't think i think the senate is much
 
04:31:24.550 --> 04:31:24.560 align:start position:0%
too creative
 
04:31:27.269 --> 04:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
they found money elsewhere to give to
 
04:31:31.910 --> 04:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:31.920 --> 04:31:32.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:31:36.229 --> 04:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
there's no money from this program is is
 
04:31:37.750 --> 04:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
fun there's no general fund money that
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
comes in here correct there's a
 
04:31:41.269 --> 04:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
prohibition against general fund money
 
04:31:44.389 --> 04:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
okay funding the non-federal share
 
04:31:46.149 --> 04:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
which is probably why they were doing
 
04:31:49.750 --> 04:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:51.590 --> 04:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
but there's this federal money though
 
04:31:54.149 --> 04:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
yes it's 90 percent federal so this is
 
04:31:55.670 --> 04:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
the way we come up with our 10 yeah this
 
04:31:58.469 --> 04:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
is our 10 sure okay
 
04:32:00.149 --> 04:32:00.159 align:start position:0%
well that was one i was going to ask you
 
04:32:02.229 --> 04:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
so with the medicaid advantage we're now
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
at the fully
 
04:32:06.229 --> 04:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
10 that were required now at this point
 
04:32:08.070 --> 04:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
in time right correct and that's where
 
04:32:08.080 --> 04:32:08.870 align:start position:0%
in time right correct and that's where
it's

04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:32:10.710 --> 04:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
expected to stay as long as like
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
statutes in place which i think is no
 
04:32:14.790 --> 04:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
expectation at least federally and what
 
04:32:17.189 --> 04:32:17.199 align:start position:0%
percentage of that 10 million that is
 
04:32:20.229 --> 04:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
listed is the percent is that all of it
 
04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
or is there other monies that come in
 
04:32:23.269 --> 04:32:23.279 align:start position:0%
from the state that
 
04:32:24.950 --> 04:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
from other sources that make up the ten
 
04:32:27.189 --> 04:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
percent that we're responsible for so
 
04:32:28.469 --> 04:32:28.479 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
04:32:31.269 --> 04:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
the original liquor profit money that we
 
04:32:33.269 --> 04:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
just talked about it's the premium tax
 
04:32:36.389 --> 04:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
on the medicaid policies themselves
 
04:32:37.990 --> 04:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
and it's the
 
04:32:40.309 --> 04:32:40.319 align:start position:0%
new hampshire health plan that has an
 
04:32:42.149 --> 04:32:42.159 align:start position:0%
assessment on policies
 
04:32:43.590 --> 04:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
for high risk
 
04:32:46.469 --> 04:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
that covers the the balance of whatever
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
those other previous two uh produce
 
04:32:52.149 --> 04:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
what is the cumulative number for the
 
04:32:53.990 --> 04:32:54.000 align:start position:0%
the dollars from new hampshire to cover
 
04:32:56.070 --> 04:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
the ten percent
 
04:33:00.550 --> 04:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
so um right now it's about uh
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
so the ten 10 is equal to about 60
 
04:33:04.629 --> 04:33:04.639 align:start position:0%
million based on the the
 
04:33:06.629 --> 04:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
60 based on the group that we're
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
covering now but it's typically been
 
04:33:12.230 --> 04:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
closer to 38 to 40 million prior to the
 
04:33:12.240 --> 04:33:14.150 align:start position:0%
closer to 38 to 40 million prior to the
group

04:33:14.150 --> 04:33:14.160 align:start position:0%
group
 
04:33:17.109 --> 04:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
thank you but again you're from this
 
04:33:19.189 --> 04:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
point going forward
 
04:33:20.629 --> 04:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
as you were thinking you were saying is
 
04:33:23.349 --> 04:33:23.359 align:start position:0%
that this summer should be coming down
 
04:33:23.359 --> 04:33:26.070 align:start position:0%
that this summer should be coming down
um

04:33:26.070 --> 04:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:27.269 --> 04:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
but what happens after the state of
 
04:33:28.709 --> 04:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
emergencies left
 
04:33:32.709 --> 04:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
so that states can begin um
 
04:33:35.830 --> 04:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
applying redeterminations on
 
04:33:38.709 --> 04:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
anyone who hasn't had one um and so
 
04:33:40.470 --> 04:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
whether they're eligible or not right so
 
04:33:42.310 --> 04:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
we can redo eligibility right now we
 
04:33:42.320 --> 04:33:43.590 align:start position:0%
we can redo eligibility right now we
can't

04:33:43.590 --> 04:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
can't
 
04:33:44.949 --> 04:33:44.959 align:start position:0%
once you're in you're in until the
 
04:33:46.949 --> 04:33:46.959 align:start position:0%
public health emergency is over right so
 
04:33:49.029 --> 04:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
right they could have gotten a
 
04:33:50.390 --> 04:33:50.400 align:start position:0%
a better job or something that would
 
04:33:52.230 --> 04:33:52.240 align:start position:0%
push them over the threshold and
 
04:33:54.070 --> 04:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
but you couldn't question that
 
04:33:55.830 --> 04:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
that's what you're saying
 
04:33:57.429 --> 04:33:57.439 align:start position:0%
or retired whatever
 
04:34:03.269 --> 04:34:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:05.590 --> 04:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
yeah our purpose for having you here was
 
04:34:09.029 --> 04:34:09.039 align:start position:0%
because we were going through all of the
 
04:34:11.510 --> 04:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
all of the revenue sources where money's
 
04:34:13.510 --> 04:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
going off to special things before it
 
04:34:15.670 --> 04:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't hit the general fund or the
 
04:34:17.910 --> 04:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
and there's a whole series of those and
 
04:34:21.429 --> 04:34:21.439 align:start position:0%
and this is
 
04:34:23.910 --> 04:34:23.920 align:start position:0%
you know this program requires those
 
04:34:25.670 --> 04:34:25.680 align:start position:0%
monies coming out of different different
 
04:34:27.910 --> 04:34:27.920 align:start position:0%
things before we say it
 
04:34:27.920 --> 04:34:29.349 align:start position:0%
things before we say it
okay

04:34:29.349 --> 04:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:31.830 --> 04:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
uh representative hackman phillips thank
 
04:34:33.189 --> 04:34:33.199 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
04:34:36.150 --> 04:34:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you both for being here today so
 
04:34:38.470 --> 04:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
i'm acknowledging
 
04:34:40.230 --> 04:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
and processing the information just
 
04:34:42.230 --> 04:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
provided us that you know the program
 
04:34:43.910 --> 04:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
itself has
 
04:34:46.949 --> 04:34:46.959 align:start position:0%
exponentially expanded in the in the
 
04:34:49.510 --> 04:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
past couple of years due to the pandemic
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
um so if the number of granite staters
 
04:34:57.029 --> 04:34:57.039 align:start position:0%
receiving this has expanded have
 
04:34:58.629 --> 04:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
i'm just wondering about the state's
 
04:35:00.789 --> 04:35:00.799 align:start position:0%
kind of footprint
 
04:35:03.670 --> 04:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
for administering this expanded program
 
04:35:05.269 --> 04:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
and service
 
04:35:07.510 --> 04:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
has has the department itself been able
 
04:35:10.869 --> 04:35:10.879 align:start position:0%
to keep pace with that expansion
 
04:35:13.189 --> 04:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the head count and the
 
04:35:15.670 --> 04:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
medicaid program i think between
 
04:35:18.070 --> 04:35:18.080 align:start position:0%
in my particular section of it we've
 
04:35:20.551 --> 04:35:20.561 align:start position:0%
been running at a 45 vacancy rate and
 
04:35:22.629 --> 04:35:22.639 align:start position:0%
continue to run something pretty close
 
04:35:25.029 --> 04:35:25.039 align:start position:0%
to that so we have really made no
 
04:35:28.070 --> 04:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
additional staffing changes um to do
 
04:35:30.709 --> 04:35:30.719 align:start position:0%
this uh and finance i think is somewhat
 
04:35:35.510 --> 04:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
comparably 25 percent 25 vacancy rates
 
04:35:37.910 --> 04:35:37.920 align:start position:0%
so you know having more people has
 
04:35:40.310 --> 04:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
doesn't there isn't like a a direct
 
04:35:40.320 --> 04:35:41.990 align:start position:0%
doesn't there isn't like a a direct
stepwise

04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
stepwise
 
04:35:45.029 --> 04:35:45.039 align:start position:0%
increase in our work by having um
 
04:35:46.551 --> 04:35:46.561 align:start position:0%
more individuals it does have some
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
impact but it's not
 
04:35:48.000 --> 04:35:50.869 align:start position:0%
impact but it's not
um

04:35:50.869 --> 04:35:50.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:35:52.709 --> 04:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
it's it doesn't work translate directly
 
04:35:54.230 --> 04:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
that way this is sort of a base amount
 
04:35:55.830 --> 04:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
of work that has to be done in
 
04:35:57.349 --> 04:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
interaction with the federal government
 
04:35:58.470 --> 04:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
on it that
 
04:36:00.150 --> 04:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't really change too much based on
 
04:36:06.150 --> 04:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:09.269 --> 04:36:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:11.029 --> 04:36:11.039 align:start position:0%
saying none all right thank you very
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome i know there's a lot
 
04:36:13.750 --> 04:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
to digest we're happy to come back
 
04:36:15.590 --> 04:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
anytime if you no no think of any other
 
04:36:15.600 --> 04:36:22.390 align:start position:0%
anytime if you no no think of any other
questions

04:36:22.390 --> 04:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:23.830 --> 04:36:23.840 align:start position:0%
yes there's
 
04:36:26.230 --> 04:36:26.240 align:start position:0%
i think another
 
04:36:29.830 --> 04:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
piece of these transfers that
 
04:36:32.551 --> 04:36:32.561 align:start position:0%
we forgot to ask the insurance
 
04:36:36.789 --> 04:36:36.799 align:start position:0%
department about that maybe chris knows
 
04:36:39.990 --> 04:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
something about we had one year where
 
04:36:43.429 --> 04:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
workers comp i think it was was really
 
04:36:46.150 --> 04:36:46.160 align:start position:0%
expensive and it came straight out of
 
04:36:49.670 --> 04:36:49.680 align:start position:0%
the insurance premium tax
 
04:36:51.590 --> 04:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
at the last minute and
 
04:36:57.910 --> 04:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:57.920 --> 04:36:59.670 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:36:59.670 --> 04:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:37:01.750 --> 04:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
yeah i can't remember how long ago it
 
04:37:04.551 --> 04:37:04.561 align:start position:0%
was at this point but
 
04:37:08.310 --> 04:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
but the premium tax went down around 50
 
04:37:10.869 --> 04:37:10.879 align:start position:0%
million i think it was because there had
 
04:37:13.269 --> 04:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
been some major
 
04:37:15.990 --> 04:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
i think it was workers comp
 
04:37:16.000 --> 04:37:16.949 align:start position:0%
i think it was workers comp
on

04:37:16.949 --> 04:37:16.959 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:37:16.959 --> 04:37:18.390 align:start position:0%
on
which

04:37:18.390 --> 04:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
which
 
04:37:21.750 --> 04:37:21.760 align:start position:0%
which by law could come out of
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:31.029 --> 04:37:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
so uh i'm not prepared today to talk
 
04:37:36.869 --> 04:37:36.879 align:start position:0%
about interim studies but um
 
04:37:38.551 --> 04:37:38.561 align:start position:0%
i just want to take the temperature of
 
04:37:38.561 --> 04:37:39.429 align:start position:0%
i just want to take the temperature of
the

04:37:39.429 --> 04:37:39.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:41.830 --> 04:37:41.840 align:start position:0%
who's here
 
04:37:43.910 --> 04:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
do we want to attempt to do some
 
04:37:45.750 --> 04:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
in june they usually don't want to see
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
us around in uh
 
04:37:48.480 --> 04:37:50.230 align:start position:0%
us around in uh
july

04:37:50.230 --> 04:37:50.240 align:start position:0%
july
 
04:37:50.240 --> 04:37:51.109 align:start position:0%
july
so

04:37:51.109 --> 04:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:37:53.269 --> 04:37:53.279 align:start position:0%
we could try to tackle a few i get the
 
04:37:55.189 --> 04:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
list to everybody
 
04:37:57.670 --> 04:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
and then um
 
04:37:58.869 --> 04:37:58.879 align:start position:0%
you know the inum studies we could do
 
04:38:01.109 --> 04:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
with subcommittees i think we usually do
 
04:38:02.150 --> 04:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
it that way
 
04:38:04.789 --> 04:38:04.799 align:start position:0%
um i can i can get the list out to
 
04:38:07.189 --> 04:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
everybody and they can kind of indicate
 
04:38:08.629 --> 04:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
which of these they want to be involved
 
04:38:08.639 --> 04:38:10.869 align:start position:0%
which of these they want to be involved
with

04:38:10.869 --> 04:38:10.879 align:start position:0%
with
 
04:38:12.629 --> 04:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
obviously they're open to all of us if
 
04:38:14.629 --> 04:38:14.639 align:start position:0%
you want to want to attend you can
 
04:38:14.639 --> 04:38:15.990 align:start position:0%
you want to want to attend you can
attend

04:38:15.990 --> 04:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
attend
 
04:38:18.551 --> 04:38:18.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:20.310 --> 04:38:20.320 align:start position:0%
we'll try to balance it republican
 
04:38:22.470 --> 04:38:22.480 align:start position:0%
democrat again the outcome of interim
 
04:38:23.830 --> 04:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
study is
 
04:38:25.830 --> 04:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
is this bill worthy of
 
04:38:25.840 --> 04:38:26.590 align:start position:0%
is this bill worthy of
being

04:38:26.590 --> 04:38:26.600 align:start position:0%
being
 
04:38:29.109 --> 04:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
re-filed next term
 
04:38:37.609 --> 04:38:37.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:37.619 --> 04:38:40.709 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

04:38:40.709 --> 04:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:46.150 --> 04:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so we'll handle it that way
 
04:38:46.160 --> 04:38:47.429 align:start position:0%
yeah so we'll handle it that way
um

04:38:47.429 --> 04:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:49.189 --> 04:38:49.199 align:start position:0%
i think we have a bunch of them
 
04:38:49.199 --> 04:38:50.150 align:start position:0%
i think we have a bunch of them
um

04:38:50.150 --> 04:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:52.150 --> 04:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
not overwhelming number i think it's
 
04:38:55.429 --> 04:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
about six yeah yeah
 
04:38:56.869 --> 04:38:56.879 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah i don't think it was more than
 
04:38:58.230 --> 04:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
ten but
 
04:38:58.240 --> 04:38:59.029 align:start position:0%
ten but
so

04:38:59.029 --> 04:38:59.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:39:00.789 --> 04:39:00.799 align:start position:0%
that's something we can do and then we
 
04:39:02.551 --> 04:39:02.561 align:start position:0%
can wrap that up in the uh
 
04:39:04.629 --> 04:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
september october
 
04:39:06.629 --> 04:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
time frame
 
04:39:08.470 --> 04:39:08.480 align:start position:0%
most of these aren't going to
 
04:39:10.629 --> 04:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
take more than a meeting or two so
 
04:39:10.639 --> 04:39:11.590 align:start position:0%
take more than a meeting or two so
um

04:39:11.590 --> 04:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:13.189 --> 04:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
just something that just again keep on
 
04:39:14.949 --> 04:39:14.959 align:start position:0%
looking at your your emails and stuff
 
04:39:19.109 --> 04:39:19.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:22.390 --> 04:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
uh up looks that way i don't i don't
 
04:39:23.590 --> 04:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
think we're not gonna do revenue
 
04:39:23.600 --> 04:39:24.629 align:start position:0%
think we're not gonna do revenue
estimates

04:39:24.629 --> 04:39:24.639 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
04:39:24.639 --> 04:39:27.109 align:start position:0%
estimates
um

04:39:27.109 --> 04:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:27.119 --> 04:39:27.990 align:start position:0%
 
i

04:39:27.990 --> 04:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:39:29.830 --> 04:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know we'll
 
04:39:31.910 --> 04:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
you know i know norm norma's talking
 
04:39:34.551 --> 04:39:34.561 align:start position:0%
about trying to get together
 
04:39:35.990 --> 04:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
as a group
 
04:39:39.190 --> 04:39:39.200 align:start position:0%
we could discuss that now um
 
04:39:39.200 --> 04:39:40.390 align:start position:0%
we could discuss that now um
um

04:39:40.390 --> 04:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:42.150 --> 04:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
i don't think the issue is i don't think
 
04:39:46.150 --> 04:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:49.510 --> 04:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
not at least the next month anyway yeah
 
04:39:50.948 --> 04:39:50.958 align:start position:0%
yeah i was kind of thinking maybe we
 
04:39:52.470 --> 04:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
should try to do something in the fall
 
04:39:54.628 --> 04:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
we were still
 
04:39:57.670 --> 04:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
yeah we would like to have norm there
 
04:39:57.680 --> 04:39:58.788 align:start position:0%
yeah we would like to have norm there
yeah

04:39:58.788 --> 04:39:58.798 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:39:58.798 --> 04:40:10.390 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

04:40:10.390 --> 04:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:12.070 --> 04:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
we could do it sometime in september
 
04:40:13.350 --> 04:40:13.360 align:start position:0%
maybe mid to
 
04:40:17.110 --> 04:40:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
yeah that storm yeah
 
04:40:19.680 --> 04:40:20.788 align:start position:0%
yeah that storm yeah
yeah

04:40:20.788 --> 04:40:20.798 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:40:20.798 --> 04:40:22.628 align:start position:0%
yeah
yeah

04:40:22.628 --> 04:40:22.638 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:40:22.638 --> 04:40:23.510 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

04:40:23.510 --> 04:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:24.708 --> 04:40:24.718 align:start position:0%
so yeah
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
we usually enjoy those little social
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
get-together informal
 
04:40:31.110 --> 04:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
lunch somewhere
 
04:40:34.230 --> 04:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
and we we always invite uh karen and jen
 
04:40:36.070 --> 04:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
to come
 
04:40:40.628 --> 04:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:41.990 --> 04:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes i know
 
04:40:43.110 --> 04:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:40:44.150 --> 04:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
they're still in the world they're still
 
04:40:46.788 --> 04:40:46.798 align:start position:0%
doing the work in the background now
 
04:40:49.510 --> 04:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
jen floor our researcher and
 
04:40:50.708 --> 04:40:50.718 align:start position:0%
oh i got it
 
04:40:53.190 --> 04:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:53.200 --> 04:40:54.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:40:54.230 --> 04:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:40:56.070 --> 04:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and actually i mean karen picked up
 
04:40:58.390 --> 04:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
extra it used to be that they have
 
04:40:59.830 --> 04:40:59.840 align:start position:0%
two committees
 
04:41:00.868 --> 04:41:00.878 align:start position:0%
each one of them and now they have like
 
04:41:02.390 --> 04:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
three or four
 
04:41:02.400 --> 04:41:03.990 align:start position:0%
three or four

they they had
 
04:41:09.270 --> 04:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
ours had five almost euros
 
04:41:11.110 --> 04:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
really yeah wow
 
04:41:13.750 --> 04:41:13.760 align:start position:0%
and then she uh not that the time before
 
04:41:13.760 --> 04:41:14.628 align:start position:0%
and then she uh not that the time before
that

04:41:14.628 --> 04:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:41:18.390 --> 04:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
and then she quit and joined the lbao
 
04:41:20.230 --> 04:41:20.240 align:start position:0%
and now she's retired
 
04:41:20.240 --> 04:41:21.110 align:start position:0%
and now she's retired
no

04:41:21.110 --> 04:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:41:21.120 --> 04:41:22.470 align:start position:0%

and jennifer has been great and i've had
 
04:41:27.910 --> 04:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
i've been able to work with some of the
 
04:41:29.830 --> 04:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
other researchers up there uh because
 
04:41:32.310 --> 04:41:32.320 align:start position:0%
i'm on different commissions and stuff
 
04:41:34.550 --> 04:41:34.560 align:start position:0%

yeah they make good picks
 
04:41:39.350 --> 04:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
one of them i figured her name now one
 
04:41:41.590 --> 04:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
of the researchers up there is um
 
04:41:45.270 --> 04:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
had her masters in um polish po
 
04:41:46.708 --> 04:41:46.718 align:start position:0%
polish language
 
04:41:49.430 --> 04:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
and her thesis was on solidarity
 
04:41:51.190 --> 04:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
she told me she's definitely going to be
 
04:41:52.470 --> 04:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
in the gallery
 
04:41:53.590 --> 04:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
to hear
 
04:41:55.030 --> 04:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
like fuenza
 
04:41:56.868 --> 04:41:56.878 align:start position:0%
that's gonna be great seeing him i mean
 
04:41:58.150 --> 04:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
04:42:00.150 --> 04:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
he's like to me he's like living history
 
04:42:01.350 --> 04:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
he's gonna be
 
04:42:02.708 --> 04:42:02.718 align:start position:0%
the history books could be walking right
 
04:42:11.430 --> 04:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:15.590 --> 04:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:15.600 --> 04:42:16.948 align:start position:0%
 
yep

04:42:16.948 --> 04:42:16.958 align:start position:0%
yep
 
04:42:20.830 --> 04:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
before everybody gears up too far
 
04:42:27.590 --> 04:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:29.110 --> 04:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
we could probably we could try to pick a
 
04:42:30.390 --> 04:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
day that we
 
04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
you know we'll probably pick some place
 
04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
around here somewhere because
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
everybody's used to coming to accenture
 
04:42:36.708 --> 04:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
we've had some good locations over the
 
04:42:36.718 --> 04:42:40.230 align:start position:0%
we've had some good locations over the
years

04:42:40.230 --> 04:42:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:46.470 --> 04:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
right it was henniker
 
04:42:48.070 --> 04:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
we all like that place and i forget the
 
04:42:54.868 --> 04:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:57.750 --> 04:42:57.760 align:start position:0%
no no i'm losing plaistow
 
04:43:00.310 --> 04:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
he's in plaistow yeah
 
04:43:03.030 --> 04:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
i can't remember that was the one
 
04:43:04.150 --> 04:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
i think raped
 
04:43:06.550 --> 04:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
roads probably don't go that way
 
04:43:08.390 --> 04:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
04:43:08.400 --> 04:43:09.430 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
but

04:43:09.430 --> 04:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:43:10.948 --> 04:43:10.958 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:43:12.390 --> 04:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
i think somewhere around here and we
 
04:43:14.628 --> 04:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
could maybe do it so that we could have
 
04:43:16.628 --> 04:43:16.638 align:start position:0%
some of these uh
 
04:43:18.550 --> 04:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
interim study committees meet in the
 
04:43:19.590 --> 04:43:19.600 align:start position:0%
morning and then
 
04:43:21.590 --> 04:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:43:23.750 --> 04:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
and then so we're in the general area we
 
04:43:25.030 --> 04:43:25.040 align:start position:0%

04:43:28.868 --> 04:43:28.878 align:start position:0%

04:47:41.990 --> 04:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
on um 12.1
 
04:47:43.350 --> 04:47:43.360 align:start position:0%
this could be the quickest meeting in
 
04:47:45.670 --> 04:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
18th century because once they figure
 
04:47:48.550 --> 04:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
out the ad 333
 
04:47:51.590 --> 04:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
i mean i i i worked hard to try to get
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
i worked hard to say to you know we
 
04:47:57.030 --> 04:47:57.040 align:start position:0%
were willing to concur
 
04:47:57.040 --> 04:47:58.708 align:start position:0%
were willing to concur
but

04:47:58.708 --> 04:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:48:00.628 --> 04:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
then then
 
04:48:02.310 --> 04:48:02.320 align:start position:0%
it turns up lang brought it up to the
 
04:48:04.230 --> 04:48:04.240 align:start position:0%
full group and i was i walked in there
 
04:48:06.390 --> 04:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
were talking about it
 
04:48:08.070 --> 04:48:08.080 align:start position:0%
then the speaker's head was blowing up
 
04:48:09.670 --> 04:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
so he said let's just talk about it
 
04:48:09.680 --> 04:48:10.708 align:start position:0%
so he said let's just talk about it
offline

04:48:10.708 --> 04:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
offline
 
04:48:13.030 --> 04:48:13.040 align:start position:0%
later on so i that's why i was a little
 
04:48:15.590 --> 04:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
late because i i stood around and waited
 
04:48:17.110 --> 04:48:17.120 align:start position:0%
and the meeting was winding down and
 
04:48:20.070 --> 04:48:20.080 align:start position:0%

04:48:27.750 --> 04:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
and and they were talking about what we
 
04:48:29.270 --> 04:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
were talking about here
 
04:48:31.750 --> 04:48:31.760 align:start position:0%

04:48:33.590 --> 04:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
what you were saying represented on me
 
04:48:33.600 --> 04:48:34.310 align:start position:0%
what you were saying represented on me
that

04:48:34.310 --> 04:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:36.470 --> 04:48:36.480 align:start position:0%

04:48:40.628 --> 04:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:40.638 --> 04:48:41.910 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:48:41.910 --> 04:48:41.920 align:start position:0%

04:48:41.920 --> 04:48:43.590 align:start position:0%
um

04:48:43.590 --> 04:48:43.600 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:48:45.190 --> 04:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
so what we're going to do is we're going
 
04:48:45.200 --> 04:48:46.470 align:start position:0%
so what we're going to do is we're going
to

04:48:46.470 --> 04:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:48:46.480 --> 04:48:48.628 align:start position:0%
to
non

04:48:48.628 --> 04:48:48.638 align:start position:0%

04:48:50.788 --> 04:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
non-concur ask for committee to buy some
 
04:48:50.798 --> 04:48:51.670 align:start position:0%
non-concur ask for committee to buy some
time

04:48:51.670 --> 04:48:51.680 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:48:53.830 --> 04:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
so i want this one to be maybe tuesday
 
04:48:55.590 --> 04:48:55.600 align:start position:0%
or wednesday
 
04:48:55.600 --> 04:48:56.628 align:start position:0%
or wednesday
to

04:48:56.628 --> 04:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:48:56.638 --> 04:48:57.990 align:start position:0%
to
um

04:48:57.990 --> 04:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:00.150 --> 04:49:00.160 align:start position:0%
give us some time and and we'll get the
 
04:49:00.160 --> 04:49:01.590 align:start position:0%
give us some time and and we'll get the
word

04:49:01.590 --> 04:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
word
 
04:49:03.590 --> 04:49:03.600 align:start position:0%
and it'll be if and i'll what i'll try
 
04:49:05.430 --> 04:49:05.440 align:start position:0%
to do i just need so i need four names
 
04:49:17.510 --> 04:49:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:18.628 --> 04:49:18.638 align:start position:0%
i know
 
04:49:18.638 --> 04:49:34.310 align:start position:0%
i know
um

04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:35.590 --> 04:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
but you have to leave though and you
 
04:49:37.430 --> 04:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
have to leave
 
04:49:43.510 --> 04:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:52.550 --> 04:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:54.868 --> 04:49:54.878 align:start position:0%
we're either going to agree or not agree
 
04:49:57.670 --> 04:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
be honest with you on the keynote bill
 
04:49:58.948 --> 04:49:58.958 align:start position:0%
because we're just going to walk off the
 
04:50:00.150 --> 04:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
tip away from the table and it's going
 
04:50:02.550 --> 04:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
to die
 
04:50:03.830 --> 04:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
so that'll probably take a half hour
 
04:50:03.840 --> 04:50:12.708 align:start position:0%
so that'll probably take a half hour
actually

04:50:12.708 --> 04:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:16.070 --> 04:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:17.350 --> 04:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
that's what we'll do i can actually the
 
04:50:19.830 --> 04:50:19.840 align:start position:0%
center will appreciate that too
 
04:50:25.190 --> 04:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:26.948 --> 04:50:26.958 align:start position:0%
i don't think you want you want to shout
 
04:50:29.750 --> 04:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
at this too sure
 
04:50:38.708 --> 04:50:38.718 align:start position:0%
