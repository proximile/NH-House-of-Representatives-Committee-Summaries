and um okay I and others uh really hope
 
00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
that you'll take some time to seriously
 
00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 align:start position:0%
consider Constitutional Amendment
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution number seven uh
 
00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
and the notion of establishing a
 
00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor position for the
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire um currently at
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
least 43 other states already do have
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant govern Governors now I know
 
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
that is not a reason uh for us to
 
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
establish such a position but there is a
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
strong case uh for doing so which I'll
 
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
touch on briefly here uh and for doing
 
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
it the New Hampshire way uh
 
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
constitutionally uh our current line of
 
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
succession calls for the State Senate
 
00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
President to replace the governor if
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
that's necessary and this has happened a
 
00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:26.199 align:start position:0%
number of times uh most recently in 2016
 
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
when Senate President Chuck Morris uh
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
replaced Magie Hassen briefly when the
 
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
latter was sworn in as a US senator uh
 
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.520 align:start position:0%
Senate President Ralph Hoff did
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
similarly replac Jud Greg brief in
 
00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
1992 when the latter was also sworn in
 
00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:46.479 align:start position:0%
as US senator uh but please Ponder what
 
00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
happened in
 
00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:51.639 align:start position:0%
1982 when Senate President Vesta Roy uh
 
00:06:54.029 --> 00:06:54.039 align:start position:0%
was sworn in as acting Governor upon the
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
death of U gallan now these two
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
individuals were of different parties uh
 
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
as were uh Senator Morrison and Governor
 
00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:06.080 align:start position:0%
Hassen uh however uh gallon had just
 
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
been defeated in a re-election bit
 
00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 align:start position:0%
actually having lost the office to John
 
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
cunu uh but assume that gallon had won
 
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
that election and then P before passing
 
00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:19.160 align:start position:0%
away the people would have elected a
 
00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 align:start position:0%
Democrat but then a republican would
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
have taken over and that presents some
 
00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
major problems or potential issues that
 
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
really need uh some discussion and and I
 
00:07:32.749 --> 00:07:32.759 align:start position:0%
think in Amendment um to have a state
 
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
senate or or a Senate President of one
 
00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:36.639 align:start position:0%
party replace a governor of another
 
00:07:38.790 --> 00:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
party creates many issues as I just said
 
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
does the new governor continue to serve
 
00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
as Senate President uh you get into
 
00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
separation of powers how could he or she
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
simultaneously or serve simultaneously
 
00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
in both the legislative and executive
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
branches uh again separation of powers
 
00:07:57.670 --> 00:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
issue that needs some discussion now
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
Senators moris Hoff and and Roy did not
 
00:08:03.189 --> 00:08:03.199 align:start position:0%
resign their Senate seats when they were
 
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:05.720 align:start position:0%
sworn in as acting Governors but their
 
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:08.280 align:start position:0%
ten years of office as chief executive
 
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:10.280 align:start position:0%
were all very limited and they didn't it
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
created no long-term issues but what if
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
a Senate President needs to serve
 
00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:18.199 align:start position:0%
several months as chief executive uh you
 
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
very conceivably could have someone who
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
sponsored a bill in the legislative
 
00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
branch and then later uh signing the
 
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.400 align:start position:0%
same bill that they sponsored as chief
 
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:31.960 align:start position:0%
executive that conceivable or perhaps
 
00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:35.719 align:start position:0%
vetoing a bill that they voted on as a
 
00:08:38.709 --> 00:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
as a senator uh it utterly goes against
 
00:08:41.149 --> 00:08:41.159 align:start position:0%
Civics 101 and and the separation of
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
powers and and New Hampshire is about
 
00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:46.160 align:start position:0%
the only state that's in this unique
 
00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:48.839 align:start position:0%
situation uh I ask you to ponder what
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
would have happened had God forbid uh
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
Republican Governor sinunu had been
 
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:56.200 align:start position:0%
struck by lightning in
 
00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
2019 uh Democratic senator Don ASI would
 
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
have become governor to finish out his
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
term by
 
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:05.720 align:start position:0%
current current
 
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:07.720 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh now which she have
 
00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
maintained sununu's existing staff or
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
replaced its members there's all kinds
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
of uh questions like that that uh
 
00:09:18.949 --> 00:09:18.959 align:start position:0%
fortunately we've never really had to
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
yet uh deal with but we need to to think
 
00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:24.079 align:start position:0%
about what would have happen with regard
 
00:09:27.710 --> 00:09:27.720 align:start position:0%
to running the Senate um good question
 
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:30.440 align:start position:0%
could she again ser simultaneously in
 
00:09:33.269 --> 00:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
the legislative and executive branches
 
00:09:36.269 --> 00:09:36.279 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think so uh she would have
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
been sworn in as acting governor and and
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
so does she resign her seat is in the
 
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
Senate uh you know that would
 
00:09:46.069 --> 00:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
disenfranchise about five% of New
 
00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens um and again but
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
Senators Roy Hoff and mois just to site
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
three recent examples uh stayed in the
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
Senate and were sworn in as acting
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
Governors that's a problem um now New
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is one of uh only two states
 
00:10:05.150 --> 00:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
in the country that have Governors who
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
serve two-year terms so that mitigates
 
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
the the situation somewhat but action is
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
still needed uh perhaps if a state
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
Senate President was elevated to
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
Governor they would resign uh their seat
 
00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:20.920 align:start position:0%
but what if they don't want to resign
 
00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
their seat um I things to really think
 
00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
about so Madam chairman this is
 
00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:30.720 align:start position:0%
potentially uh a serious situation it's
 
00:10:33.509 --> 00:10:33.519 align:start position:0%
not just an issue it's not just an issue
 
00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
in other states but it is here potential
 
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
serious problem so I many of us think
 
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:42.880 align:start position:0%
there's a need for Action here and that
 
00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
action involves uh amending our
 
00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
constitution to create a lieutenant
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
governor position but we should do it
 
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:54.360 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire way we should have in
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
our view a citizen lieutenant governor
 
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
the way we have citizen legislators like
 
00:11:04.190 --> 00:11:04.200 align:start position:0%
us uh cacr 7 calls for the lieutenant
 
00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:06.440 align:start position:0%
governor to receive the same salary as
 
00:11:09.949 --> 00:11:09.959 align:start position:0%
that Senate President which is $125 a
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
year so this could be a wonderful
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
example of improving government in the
 
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
best way think about it essentially
 
00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
doubling our gubernatorial Manpower and
 
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
virtually no cost our governor as you
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
know gets countless
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
invitations more than he or she could
 
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:34.040 align:start position:0%
ever begin to accept uh is a whole
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
scheduler in the governor's office um
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
building dedications ribbon cuttings uh
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
testimonials funerals School visits on
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
and on uh a lieutenant governor could
 
00:11:47.550 --> 00:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
double the
 
00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
productivity in the capacity of the
 
00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
governor's office to be a presence and
 
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
support so many things around the state
 
00:11:59.949 --> 00:11:59.959 align:start position:0%
that would be U wonderful
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
and again at basically no cost according
 
00:12:07.509 --> 00:12:07.519 align:start position:0%
to our proposed CA CR7 or 125 bucks so
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
the line of succession would be cleaner
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire voters would now vote for
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
a ticket and be assured that the state
 
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:18.880 align:start position:0%
would avoid chaos that would occur head
 
00:12:21.629 --> 00:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
if AE a governor gets struck by
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
lightning which we hope would never
 
00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
happen but we need to think about it um
 
00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
especially if the Senate President is of
 
00:12:29.870 --> 00:12:29.880 align:start position:0%
a different party which has happened a
 
00:12:32.750 --> 00:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
couple times I pointed out already uh
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
the succession issue addressed by ccr7
 
00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:36.949 align:start position:0%
the succession issue addressed by ccr7
is

00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan is there is no way to know
 
00:12:42.069 --> 00:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
which parties will control which offices
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
in the future now now some will argue
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
we've never done that
 
00:12:50.509 --> 00:12:50.519 align:start position:0%
before or I mean I know can I can hear
 
00:12:52.389 --> 00:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
it now I've already heard it or we've
 
00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:54.240 align:start position:0%
gotten along fine without a lieutenant
 
00:12:55.910 --> 00:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
governor for Jordan 40 years so don't
 
00:12:58.870 --> 00:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
need to start now or just because every
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
other State as a lieutenant governor
 
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we need to have one but
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
those I think are all flawed arguments
 
00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
and hopefully when this measure goes to
 
00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:10.120 align:start position:0%
Executive session uh can be
 
00:13:13.069 --> 00:13:13.079 align:start position:0%
appropriately discussed and and and
 
00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:15.639 align:start position:0%
refuted uh by the way there's growing
 
00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
interest in this uh there's going to be
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
a CED monitor piece on it later this
 
00:13:22.389 --> 00:13:22.399 align:start position:0%
week so it's something that is getting
 
00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:25.399 align:start position:0%
more and more attention just FYI so
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
anyway uh I I think we think this is a
 
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
really great proposal that improves the
 
00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
line of succession improves the
 
00:13:33.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
productivity and capacity of the
 
00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
governor's office it precludes the
 
00:13:37.509 --> 00:13:37.519 align:start position:0%
potential chaos that would result if the
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
governor needed to be replaced Midway
 
00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
through a term and all for $125 a year
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
so I think we can do this and I think we
 
00:13:49.430 --> 00:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
should do this so thanks for your time
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any any questions
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:59.949 --> 00:13:59.959 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chairman welcome
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
Colonel Moffett uh nice to see you uh
 
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:07.000 align:start position:0%
other than on the mound pitching
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
softball at us Democrats um um and uh so
 
00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
I see you've done a lot of thinking
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
about this and uh hypothesize but I'm
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
wondering is it realistic to uh to
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
expect someone to
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
assume position where
 
00:14:29.150 --> 00:14:29.160 align:start position:0%
they you haven't given much example of
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
what they would have to do um and uh you
 
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
don't set that out it would be quite
 
00:14:37.829 --> 00:14:37.839 align:start position:0%
different from uh New Ham New
 
00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:40.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's current situation where uh
 
00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:42.160 align:start position:0%
the Senate President is already
 
00:14:44.749 --> 00:14:44.759 align:start position:0%
appointed there is no nothing analogous
 
00:14:48.350 --> 00:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
to uh the United States Vice President
 
00:14:52.829 --> 00:14:52.839 align:start position:0%
who uh who uh presides over the Senate
 
00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
um and has that responsibility and there
 
00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:57.920 align:start position:0%
is no Senate President except Senate
 
00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:01.639 align:start position:0%
President Pro Tim so is it reasonable to
 
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
expect that a person serving in this
 
00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
role would would do so in any meaningful
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
way for uh $125 a year that's my
 
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
question first question sure absolutely
 
00:15:16.749 --> 00:15:16.759 align:start position:0%
and a in a great question uh the answer
 
00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
is yes I mean look at all of you look at
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
all of us uh would would this position
 
00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
would it be hard to fill this position
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely not I think uh there's a a
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
great Universe of people uh who uh could
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh balance a ticket so to speak uh look
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
at us uh uh by as I say the New
 
00:15:39.629 --> 00:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way we we we are citizen
 
00:15:41.670 --> 00:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
legislators and and I think whoever a
 
00:15:45.430 --> 00:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
governor might pick as a running man
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
Governor uh I think they is as I said a
 
00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:52.519 align:start position:0%
wide universe of possibilities and uh
 
00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
and and to what what would they do we've
 
00:15:57.949 --> 00:15:57.959 align:start position:0%
heard all these quotes about the vice
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
president vice presidency but I think
 
00:16:03.389 --> 00:16:03.399 align:start position:0%
it's very exciting to uh I mean picture
 
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
the next Governor whoever he or she may
 
00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
be from whichever party and think about
 
00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know who they might want to have
 
00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
as a running mate to augment to balance
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
to complement uh the skills or whatever
 
00:16:18.629 --> 00:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
the current governor has so to answer
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
your question yes uh I think there's uh
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
all kinds of people who would be
 
00:16:25.389 --> 00:16:25.399 align:start position:0%
wonderful candidates to attended
 
00:16:27.629 --> 00:16:27.639 align:start position:0%
Governor would want to do it and then it
 
00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:30.040 align:start position:0%
would be up to the governor really to
 
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
decide uh if they want to make the
 
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor energy Zar or
 
00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
whatever but uh lots of
 
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:43.240 align:start position:0%
possibilities followup
 
00:16:46.749 --> 00:16:46.759 align:start position:0%
briefly thank you Madame chair uh so
 
00:16:48.509 --> 00:16:48.519 align:start position:0%
have you costed out what it would what
 
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:51.800 align:start position:0%
it would actually cost for uh a
 
00:16:54.790 --> 00:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor position because uh
 
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:57.560 align:start position:0%
the person would be essentially uh very
 
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
handicapped if not useless if uh if they
 
00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
were all there by themselves to the
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
degree they have to have the staff uh
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
now you're talking about uh you know
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
additional space and also cost the staff
 
00:17:15.390 --> 00:17:15.400 align:start position:0%
is not going to work for $125 a year
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
another good question I think that uh
 
00:17:18.429 --> 00:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor if there was one or
 
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
hopefully will be one I I think they
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
basically all they would need would be a
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
desk really in in the phone uh the the
 
00:17:28.029 --> 00:17:28.039 align:start position:0%
current executive chief executive staff
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
the government staff would would stay
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
the same and this would just be uh an
 
00:17:34.549 --> 00:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
addition to the staff who would be first
 
00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
line of succession and would understand
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
and know what going on in that office
 
00:17:43.549 --> 00:17:43.559 align:start position:0%
and uh so I see no uh other than $125 in
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
in a desk and maybe a phone line if that
 
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
uh I see no uh necessary major expenses
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
to implement this thank you you
 
00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.950 align:start position:0%
to implement this thank you you
representative

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:56.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:00.549 --> 00:18:00.559 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
good morning representative M
 
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
morning I am not sure if I missed it but
 
00:18:12.029 --> 00:18:12.039 align:start position:0%
I didn't see any um thing in the
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
um amendment to upgrade this person's
 
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
salary should they become governor uh
 
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:22.720 align:start position:0%
and have to take that job for a long
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
term what would be your intention
 
00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
for at that point I doubt
 
00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
sure sure uh I'll tell you when Senator
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
mois became acting governor for however
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
many days she uh he immediately this is
 
00:18:40.029 --> 00:18:40.039 align:start position:0%
already a practice he immediately
 
00:18:42.669 --> 00:18:42.679 align:start position:0%
received uh thousands of dollars in
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
salary for the the time that he served
 
00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
as acting chief executive so so that's
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
already in place representative uh
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor is elevated as his
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
past practice they would be paid uh the
 
00:18:58.750 --> 00:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
full salary of the governor follow
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up thank you um okay so
 
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying that that's uh been
 
00:19:08.350 --> 00:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
practic however do you not feel that it
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
should be incorporated in the
 
00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
law uh I don't know that it's necessary
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
because of past practice uh but uh if if
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
this this is the committee's bill now
 
00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:24.280 align:start position:0%
and if if there was a desire to uh
 
00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
codify that or to confirm that uh that
 
00:19:29.590 --> 00:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
certainly uh would be easily done if you
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
wanted to do
 
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
00:19:35.190 --> 00:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair um
 
00:19:41.149 --> 00:19:41.159 align:start position:0%
representative M um I was a little bit
 
00:19:44.029 --> 00:19:44.039 align:start position:0%
late getting on today so I apologize if
 
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
you've already address this but on the
 
00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:51.000 align:start position:0%
first page on line five I see that um
 
00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
whose title shall be his Excellency I
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
was wondering if maybe we could address
 
00:19:59.590 --> 00:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
that at the same time
 
00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
sure uh great Point uh working with oess
 
00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:05.799 align:start position:0%
in in the the current uh uh
 
00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional article that covers
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
succession uh his Excellency I think uh
 
00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:15.120 align:start position:0%
is is an outload of term that's an
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
excellent point I think uh it should say
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
his or her Excellency uh I I agree great
 
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.350 align:start position:0%
his or her Excellency uh I I agree great
great

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:22.360 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:25.280 align:start position:0%
Point representative
 
00:20:28.029 --> 00:20:28.039 align:start position:0%
Schulz thank you madam chair I'd like
 
00:20:31.029 --> 00:20:31.039 align:start position:0%
this um UNC concept
 
00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
um so for what it's worth I worked for
 
00:20:36.870 --> 00:20:36.880 align:start position:0%
the lieutenant governor of Kentucky
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
before um don't you think they would
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
need at least a scheduling staff person
 
00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
I know you mentioned that the
 
00:20:48.789 --> 00:20:48.799 align:start position:0%
governor uh that person's staff could do
 
00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
what would be needed for the lieutenant
 
00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:53.240 align:start position:0%
governor but have you looked at what
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
sort of Staff uh Lieutenant Governors
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
typically have and my second question is
 
00:21:02.909 --> 00:21:02.919 align:start position:0%
uh do you know how many Lieutenant
 
00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:04.760 align:start position:0%
Governors are elected separately in
 
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
other states because that's an
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
interesting concept
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
too sure good good questions uh I know
 
00:21:14.269 --> 00:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
there are at least 43 other uh
 
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
lieutenent Governors and there's a
 
00:21:18.029 --> 00:21:18.039 align:start position:0%
breakdown some run as a ticket which we
 
00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:21.080 align:start position:0%
propose here and some are uh elected
 
00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:23.480 align:start position:0%
separately uh if you go back in history
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
you might recall that our country it
 
00:21:27.190 --> 00:21:27.200 align:start position:0%
used to be the vice president was the
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
one who get the second most and that
 
00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
didn't work out so that was fixed uh in
 
00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
terms of Staff uh we or the sponsors uh
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
really don't Envision or want really
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
given I say the New Hampshire way uh to
 
00:21:45.710 --> 00:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
give the uh liutenant Governor's staff
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
like uh the lieutenant governor
 
00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has I me right now we have
 
00:21:52.190 --> 00:21:52.200 align:start position:0%
no lieutenant governor and I think the
 
00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:54.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire way would be as I said to
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
pay him
 
00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
$125 and just have he or she aug
 
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
the current staff so I as I said I think
 
00:22:04.909 --> 00:22:04.919 align:start position:0%
uh the current scheduler could C
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
certainly easily uh you know plug in the
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor for uh a bridge
 
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:11.919 align:start position:0%
dedication up in
 
00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
coldbrook which I it would be wonderful
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
because uh so so many invites come to
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
the governor's office and most of them
 
00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
answered I think it would be good Civics
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
it would be good service uh and I don't
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
see any need for staff I know I'm
 
00:22:28.230 --> 00:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
somebody who worries about growing
 
00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:30.440 align:start position:0%
believe Me growing bureaucracy and
 
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
growing government and I know some folks
 
00:22:34.590 --> 00:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
from my side initially looked at me and
 
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
said what are you doing and again I hope
 
00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:39.080 align:start position:0%
you look at the New Hampshire way that
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
we we propos here uh which would involve
 
00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:45.440 align:start position:0%
no new staff just a desk and uh using
 
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.350 align:start position:0%
no new staff just a desk and uh using
existing

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
existing
 
00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:50.120 align:start position:0%

mer the the qualifications would be the
 
00:23:41.230 --> 00:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
same as uh for governor um uh and beyond
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
that uh again I think it's exciting uh
 
00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
Bey they'd have to obviously satisfy the
 
00:23:49.549 --> 00:23:49.559 align:start position:0%
same age residency requirements as the
 
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
government beyond that uh they could be
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
any anyone it could be any of you uh if
 
00:23:56.789 --> 00:23:56.799 align:start position:0%
the next Governor wanted you to get that
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
$25 raise and become lieutenant governor
 
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh so in terms of qualification same as
 
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
what's in place now and uh in the duties
 
00:24:11.549 --> 00:24:11.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.310 --> 00:24:14.320 align:start position:0%
governor mer mer
 
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.029 align:start position:0%
governor mer mer
Merc

00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:18.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
J representative fellows do you have
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
another question um I'm just since we
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
have a couple of minutes um Madam chair
 
00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering if I can get a
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
better explan of why there's an
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
assumption that he only needs he or she
 
00:24:35.549 --> 00:24:35.559 align:start position:0%
only needs
 
00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
$125 and won't have any duties assigned
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
and doesn't need fellows representative
 
00:24:46.510 --> 00:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
Moffett covered that the beginning of
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
the hearing and we do have two other
 
00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
people who wish to testify so I would I
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
would rather hear from them first
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative that's fine
 
00:24:58.669 --> 00:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan
 
00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
oh thank you very much Madam chair I am
 
00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:03.080 align:start position:0%
representative Timothy Horan I represent
 
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:05.240 align:start position:0%
cord County's District Six the towns of
 
00:25:08.310 --> 00:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
Durham and Madbury and I've been a to
 
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:11.000 align:start position:0%
H Hampshire for 13 years now we've been
 
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
struggling the whole time to a certain
 
00:25:14.389 --> 00:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional office which is few of
 
00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
any function well struggling is over
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
dramatic where most people are oblivious
 
00:25:20.389 --> 00:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
to the issue of the officer probate but
 
00:25:24.909 --> 00:25:24.919 align:start position:0%
it's it's um and I think you know
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
basically it's the nominal office with
 
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
um only a few more d duties in this one
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
would have if we passed the cacr but I
 
00:25:32.269 --> 00:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
think it's dangerous have an elective
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
office with no power because even a
 
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
nominal office can be abused um actually
 
00:25:37.909 --> 00:25:37.919 align:start position:0%
none of the counties have had much
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
trouble since 2009 reg probate they've
 
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
had trouble with the County Treasurer
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
who paid a few thousand dollar and then
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
also the County Attorney is actually a
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
full-time full-time job with a real
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
salary but still um i' I've I've tried
 
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
various legislative inies that when
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
restoring some of his powers or or that
 
00:25:59.310 --> 00:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
eliminating it so once we create this
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
constitutional office it's going to be
 
00:26:03.389 --> 00:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
very hard to get rid of it um I actually
 
00:26:05.549 --> 00:26:05.559 align:start position:0%
didn't pick up in the Texas C ever that
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative M it and the sponsors
 
00:26:09.990 --> 00:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
intended to pay the lieutenant governor
 
00:26:13.789 --> 00:26:13.799 align:start position:0%
just $125 a year I think um even though
 
00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:16.640 align:start position:0%
I've been um getting 100 working for
 
00:26:19.789 --> 00:26:19.799 align:start position:0%
$100 a year for 13 years now I I frankly
 
00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's a good idea I think
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
that's a issue out a little bit outside
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
the perview of the CHR but I think
 
00:26:27.149 --> 00:26:27.159 align:start position:0%
actually we need to move towards paying
 
00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:30.200 align:start position:0%
ourselves an actual salary So like um
 
00:26:31.149 --> 00:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
you know if you don't want to take the
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
salary you can donate a charity I
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%
actually don't I did they pay the Senate
 
00:26:39.549 --> 00:26:39.559 align:start position:0%
President $125 a year or the lieutenant
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
governor but and actually
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh think my testimony further on I'll
 
00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:45.559 align:start position:0%
deal with that issue but anyway it's
 
00:26:46.950 --> 00:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's a new constitutional office the
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
office of lieutenant governor the office
 
00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:51.080 align:start position:0%
has no specific duties at all aside from
 
00:26:51.909 --> 00:26:51.919 align:start position:0%
waiting around for the governor to
 
00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
become incapacitated die or resign
 
00:26:58.029 --> 00:26:58.039 align:start position:0%
and but Most states do have a lieutenant
 
00:26:59.510 --> 00:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
govern governor and that liutenant
 
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
Governor serves as the uh president of
 
00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
the Senate as well just much like the
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
vice president United States so they
 
00:27:07.430 --> 00:27:07.440 align:start position:0%
usually don't vote except when there's a
 
00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
uh when there's a tie so um throughh we
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
do it differently we have we elect our
 
00:27:14.669 --> 00:27:14.679 align:start position:0%
own the Senate elects it own president
 
00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
who's first in line the action Governor
 
00:27:18.630 --> 00:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
first we heard several times um it
 
00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:20.279 align:start position:0%
hasn't happened times I really don't
 
00:27:21.669 --> 00:27:21.679 align:start position:0%
think it's been problematic I don't
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
think it would have been a big deal even
 
00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:27.039 align:start position:0%
if uh Senator Susi had for some reason
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
become the acting governor in place of s
 
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
I actually don't think that would have
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
been a problem maybe partially I'm bias
 
00:27:36.669 --> 00:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
because I like I I like Senator Susi I
 
00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
think she's a great Senator and also in
 
00:27:40.389 --> 00:27:40.399 align:start position:0%
terms of changing the parties most most
 
00:27:42.470 --> 00:27:42.480 align:start position:0%
of the voters who will Vote for This
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
liutenant Governor are are the largest
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
blocker Undeclared you like aren't a
 
00:27:48.669 --> 00:27:48.679 align:start position:0%
member of either party so I don't think
 
00:27:50.149 --> 00:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
they'd necessarily be troubled by that
 
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
we might actually uh might actually have
 
00:27:56.110 --> 00:27:56.120 align:start position:0%
people voting for a Democrat on for the
 
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
governor and then a republican on the
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor balance things out
 
00:28:00.509 --> 00:28:00.519 align:start position:0%
we're g a lot of Voters are going to do
 
00:28:02.149 --> 00:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
that but I don't know about running's a
 
00:28:05.269 --> 00:28:05.279 align:start position:0%
ticket we've never elected people we've
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
never done that except for the president
 
00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
of the United States which is a
 
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
different case I I really don't know how
 
00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:13.320 align:start position:0%
that works I'm not sure if that's even a
 
00:28:15.549 --> 00:28:15.559 align:start position:0%
good idea I think actually uh most of
 
00:28:17.669 --> 00:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
Voters would prefer to uh you know have
 
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
an allart approach to most most them
 
00:28:22.149 --> 00:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
would at least have the option to choose
 
00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:23.720 align:start position:0%
one part's Governor the other part's
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor um so if so I
 
00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
certainly think we if we probably should
 
00:28:30.669 --> 00:28:30.679 align:start position:0%
should consider if you want to go
 
00:28:31.990 --> 00:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
through this at all giving the
 
00:28:33.549 --> 00:28:33.559 align:start position:0%
lieutenant govern some constitutional
 
00:28:35.190 --> 00:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
function such as presiding over the
 
00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
senate or chairing the executive Council
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
or even this is sort of a slightly uh
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
choking comment taking over the few
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
duties to the 10 Cy current registers
 
00:28:47.549 --> 00:28:47.559 align:start position:0%
probate um but we do that we need a
 
00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
different Amendment we need much longer
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
Amendment um and this uh version of the
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
amendment makes no provision for an
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
acting lieutenant governor as a vacancy
 
00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:57.679 align:start position:0%
in that offer it's merely Rising Senate
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
President followed by several officers
 
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:01.760 align:start position:0%
would be next in line to serve as acting
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
Governor but we you know there's no
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
provision here of an acting lieutenant
 
00:29:08.750 --> 00:29:08.760 align:start position:0%
governor there's also um probably we
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
probably have to amend several other
 
00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120 align:start position:0%
articles of the Constitution to
 
00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
accommodate this new office and of
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
course also we'd have to pass a lot of
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
Statute law too but although if the
 
00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559 align:start position:0%
amendment passes it would take effect um
 
00:29:24.070 --> 00:29:24.080 align:start position:0%
guess on a convening day in January 2022
 
00:29:26.710 --> 00:29:26.720 align:start position:0%
and then the new then the next general
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
election is until 2024 because that does
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
give us a couple years to sort that out
 
00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
but that's still um anyway so I'm going
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
to say finally this is Advocate D
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
General Court would as I just said have
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
to make some changes to statute law
 
00:29:40.750 --> 00:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
doing some changes would would cost
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
money I know in Hamp ways to do things
 
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
without spending any money without
 
00:29:46.110 --> 00:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
giving people any resources without
 
00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799 align:start position:0%
hiring enough staff for institutions to
 
00:29:50.990 --> 00:29:51.000 align:start position:0%
run I know that's a New Hampshire way um
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
seemen by but I don't think that's
 
00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
workable for liutenant governor I don't
 
00:29:56.269 --> 00:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
think we'll have a hard time I just
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
don't think that's going to work uh so
 
00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:00.120 align:start position:0%
you need to be paid a salary I
 
00:30:02.350 --> 00:30:02.360 align:start position:0%
definitely don't think $125 president
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
Senate a realistic salary even for the
 
00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
Senate President for GR new office
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
receipt if I think they probably would
 
00:30:12.350 --> 00:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
certainly should probably be end up
 
00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
being paid at Great ll in the salary
 
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.320 align:start position:0%
schedule in RSA 94 col one A and B and
 
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
of course you all know that by heart
 
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
probably probably don't know it by but
 
00:30:24.950 --> 00:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
the Commissioners other officials paid
 
00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279 align:start position:0%
at those grades which just like the
 
00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
Attorney General the commissioner of
 
00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:29.640 align:start position:0%
Education etc etc they currently make a
 
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
little more less than $140,000 a year
 
00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:35.840 align:start position:0%
plus benefits I believe I'm on I agre I
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
agree with representative Schmidt R red
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
mouth that this liutenant Governor is
 
00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:40.519 align:start position:0%
going to need a staff G need a chief of
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
staff at a minimum even um even
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
president Morris has a uh has
 
00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:48.440 align:start position:0%
a as a staff who are all of whom are
 
00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
actually paid real salaries he's the
 
00:30:51.710 --> 00:30:51.720 align:start position:0%
only person uh in the Senate president's
 
00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
office who does the job for $125 a year
 
00:30:57.389 --> 00:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
so he needed Chief of Staff probably
 
00:30:59.230 --> 00:30:59.240 align:start position:0%
chief so the chief of staff will
 
00:31:01.509 --> 00:31:01.519 align:start position:0%
probably need staff You Know Chief of
 
00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
Staff is probably need a staff and even
 
00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:05.240 align:start position:0%
if we do it all just the governor's
 
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
staff I'm that's more work for the
 
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:09.440 align:start position:0%
Governor's staff so I'm I'm thinking at
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
a bare
 
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
minimum if we pass this taxpayers be on
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
the hook for at least a quarter million
 
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:17.320 align:start position:0%
dollars a year probably a lot more
 
00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
especially if we're paying this person
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
mileage to go around around to C Brook
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
open Bridges and stuff so that's uh
 
00:31:26.950 --> 00:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's definitely into the six figures
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
and Poss the seven figures to create
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
this job which is and I'm not
 
00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
necessarily against creating jobs even
 
00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:33.880 align:start position:0%
government job I'm not necessarily
 
00:31:36.629 --> 00:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
against paying uh the lieutenant
 
00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:38.760 align:start position:0%
governor staffers real salary or even
 
00:31:40.149 --> 00:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
paying the lieutenant governor real
 
00:31:41.789 --> 00:31:41.799 align:start position:0%
salary I don't think that's a bad thing
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
but um it's still a lot of money to pay
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
for an office with has nothing in
 
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
particular to do I mean even though
 
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
obviously Lieutenant government will
 
00:31:50.509 --> 00:31:50.519 align:start position:0%
find things to do the governor give them
 
00:31:52.029 --> 00:31:52.039 align:start position:0%
projects and stuff I you know I think
 
00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:53.159 align:start position:0%
that's still a lot of money to pay from
 
00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
office which has no set Duty so I I I
 
00:31:59.549 --> 00:31:59.559 align:start position:0%
definitely my recommendation is just
 
00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:02.799 align:start position:0%
find this inexpedient to legislate um I
 
00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
mean you thank you representative Horgan
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
will you take a question oh absolutely
 
00:32:11.990 --> 00:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.470 align:start position:0%
 
broa

00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
muted I saw her asked a question but I
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't hear it because he's muted so
 
00:32:23.149 --> 00:32:23.159 align:start position:0%
he's muted yes please unmute yourself
 
00:32:31.509 --> 00:32:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:32.909 --> 00:32:32.919 align:start position:0%
representative broa do you no longer
 
00:32:35.509 --> 00:32:35.519 align:start position:0%
have a question I do I have a I I was
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
muted I didn't realize it um
 
00:32:39.389 --> 00:32:39.399 align:start position:0%
representative muet you say in your
 
00:32:43.990 --> 00:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that you uh think that having
 
00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
um a lieutenant govern having the
 
00:32:49.149 --> 00:32:49.159 align:start position:0%
governor being replaced by a a person
 
00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:51.880 align:start position:0%
outside of that their party is a problem
 
00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
why is that why do you see that as a
 
00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
problem well that's how things are now
 
00:32:59.549 --> 00:32:59.559 align:start position:0%
and we I cited two examples of that has
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
happened uh Republican replacing a
 
00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
Democrat and a Democrat replacing
 
00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:05.880 align:start position:0%
Republican for the short term uh the
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
reason I think it's an issue long term I
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
mentioned this already in terms of Staff
 
00:33:14.669 --> 00:33:14.679 align:start position:0%
uh if for example if Senator Susi had
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
had to replace governor cuno in 2020 or
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
2019 um you know a staff is is personal
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
to the chief executive so the qu the
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
concern is that uh would the new
 
00:33:32.149 --> 00:33:32.159 align:start position:0%
governor mesh with the staff uh maybe
 
00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
not uh would the new governor uh replace
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
all the staff so that's the concern
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
about uh if a member of the if the state
 
00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
Senate President was of one party and
 
00:33:46.110 --> 00:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
the governor was of another having a
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
ticket removes that um that
 
00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
problem thank
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
you other
 
00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none excuse me
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
I if if it's a concern that the parties
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
change before you established this
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
office couldn't you just work the
 
00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:13.200 align:start position:0%
succession such that it skips over
 
00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:16.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
parties well the statute is in place now
 
00:34:21.990 --> 00:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
I don't know I mean if something
 
00:34:25.389 --> 00:34:25.399 align:start position:0%
happened right now to Governor shunu God
 
00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:29.159 align:start position:0%
forbid uh by the con institution uh
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
Senate President Morris has to become uh
 
00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:34.839 align:start position:0%
he is first in line in succession so I I
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
don't know how we could skip over uh
 
00:34:41.589 --> 00:34:41.599 align:start position:0%
anyone if they were of of a contrasting
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
Party part answer that this is actually
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
my question time but um parties aren't
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned really in the Constitution at
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
all that's something that's evolved over
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
the years and um also it's not even
 
00:34:56.669 --> 00:34:56.679 align:start position:0%
necessarily the case that a Senate
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
President of the same party might
 
00:34:59.829 --> 00:34:59.839 align:start position:0%
necessarily take the same approach as
 
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:02.760 align:start position:0%
the uh exg Governor that that's not
 
00:35:08.109 --> 00:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
umly like say Chuck Morris became the
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
action Governor he he has a different
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
approach to things in cuno for example
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
alth that would probably not be you know
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't create much probably
 
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
tested that
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
one other questions for representative
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh Madam chairman and the
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh I'd like to
 
00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
say I'm I'm Alvin C I live in lden and
 
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:46.720 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of this bill uh my uh
 
00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
biggest concern uh that I think this
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
addresses is if there is a
 
00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:55.400 align:start position:0%
longterm replacement of the governor
 
00:35:59.550 --> 00:35:59.560 align:start position:0%
that um if the Senate President is
 
00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
filling in for an extended period of
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
time that there's a conflict where the
 
00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution really wanted the
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
legislative branch to be separate from
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
the executive branch and that this
 
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
muddies the water there um also um as
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
far as a technical thing within the bill
 
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:25.240 align:start position:0%
itself on page one lines 20 to 22 where
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
it lists the
 
00:36:28.710 --> 00:36:28.720 align:start position:0%
qualifications for the governor it
 
00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:30.839 align:start position:0%
probably should also say the governor
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
and lieutenant governor um that would be
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
on line 22 after the word Governor Ed
 
00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:39.760 align:start position:0%
and lieutenant
 
00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:42.760 align:start position:0%
governor um the other concern I have
 
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
about this bill is the text that has to
 
00:36:49.390 --> 00:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
be printed on the ballot there's two and
 
00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
a half pages it's 82 lines in in the
 
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
bill that has to be printed on each and
 
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:57.880 align:start position:0%
every ballot throughout the state um and
 
00:36:59.470 --> 00:36:59.480 align:start position:0%
that's a lot of reading for somebody who
 
00:37:03.109 --> 00:37:03.119 align:start position:0%
hasn't planned ahead for U for this I
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
don't know whether that um instruction
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
to the B uh for on the ballot can be
 
00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
summarized and and made a little more
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
brief or
 
00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
not uh and the the last thing I wanted
 
00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
to mention in several cases on
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
U uh lines
 
00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
uh all 19 and 22 it talks about uses the
 
00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.710 align:start position:0%
uh all 19 and 22 it talks about uses the
word

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
word
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
plurality in the 1912 constitutional
 
00:37:36.430 --> 00:37:36.440 align:start position:0%
convention uh the Constitution
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
originally had the word majority in that
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
place now it has
 
00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.069 align:start position:0%
place now it has
plurality

00:37:43.069 --> 00:37:43.079 align:start position:0%
plurality
 
00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
and in the case of line
 
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
22 having the word
 
00:37:51.510 --> 00:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
plurality um kind of makes the rest of
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
the sentence uh redundant or ineffective
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
because the plurality
 
00:37:59.670 --> 00:37:59.680 align:start position:0%
uh you can get a plurality if if at
 
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:02.920 align:start position:0%
least one ballot is cast for an office
 
00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:04.960 align:start position:0%
because plurality is
 
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
simply the most whoever gets the most
 
00:38:11.069 --> 00:38:11.079 align:start position:0%
votes uh rather than a majority which
 
00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:15.400 align:start position:0%
required um over 50% of the of the votes
 
00:38:16.950 --> 00:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
and there was provision in there and
 
00:38:19.390 --> 00:38:19.400 align:start position:0%
that's what all the rest of that was was
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
how the U legislature would
 
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
select the governor if there wasn't a
 
00:38:28.390 --> 00:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
majority um while that
 
00:38:30.710 --> 00:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
not necessarily a problem for
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
this uh particular amendment I just
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
thought I'd bring that up since you're
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
having to uh make changes in that
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
sentence that's a little bit poorly
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
structured now anyway and that's all I
 
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.200 align:start position:0%
have I'd be glad to answer any
 
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Shu
 
00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.910 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Shu
has

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:38:54.550 --> 00:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
one thank you Madame chair um Mr C I I
 
00:38:57.510 --> 00:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
just want to be sure you're listed in
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
the sign as supporting the bill however
 
00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:04.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of the language inconsistencies
 
00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:07.839 align:start position:0%
that point out almost indicate that you
 
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
are opposed to it in the current form uh
 
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:13.760 align:start position:0%
can you clarify for sure your position I
 
00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
am in favor of having a lieutenant
 
00:39:18.710 --> 00:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
governor there is some wording issues in
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment that may make it
 
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
a little bit awkward for the voters or
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
for uh eventual uh
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
implementation and U I leave that to the
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
committee's wisdom to uh resolve thank
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
you is there anyone else who wishes to

ago 1971's when the United States went
off

00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
off
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
gold we went off a gold in 71 is that
 
00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:43.800 align:start position:0%
what you said
 
00:44:46.349 --> 00:44:46.359 align:start position:0%
Matt the sound is really good it sounds
 
00:44:48.750 --> 00:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
like yep uh they stopped it because uh
 
00:44:51.150 --> 00:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
France is importing so much of our gold
 
00:44:52.630 --> 00:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
they want they didn't want us to uh lose
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
it all because uh anyway yeah 71 Nixon

00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
Ryan did you have
 
00:45:02.069 --> 00:45:02.079 align:start position:0%
something yeah the sound is coming
 
00:45:03.069 --> 00:45:03.079 align:start position:0%
really good it sounds like
 
00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:05.559 align:start position:0%
representative PE it sounds like your
 
00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:09.680 align:start position:0%
mic gain is too high my mic gain yeah I
 
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:11.440 align:start position:0%
just how about now if I just pull the
 
00:45:13.790 --> 00:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
mic away from my
 
00:45:16.549 --> 00:45:16.559 align:start position:0%
face the problem is coming from yours I
 
00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
believe yeah I just I I don't understand
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
how I'm having the problems with the
 
00:45:25.150 --> 00:45:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
headset your you can um you can turn
 
00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:30.559 align:start position:0%
down your mic
 
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:38.079 align:start position:0%
Bo got it all right I'll see if I can do
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
that that down like 10 well there's no
 
00:45:41.839 --> 00:45:49.470 align:start position:0%
that that down like 10 well there's no
real

00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.870 --> 00:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
number thank you should switch back to
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
your other headset this is poorer sound
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
quality from you than we've had in the
 
00:46:00.270 --> 00:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
past and the sound quality is relatively
 
00:46:03.549 --> 00:46:03.559 align:start position:0%
crappy from virtually everybody today so
 
00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's a bug in the
 
00:46:07.750 --> 00:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
network so Peter you're saying this is
 
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
worse than what I was just on my laptop
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
microphone I think this is not as good
 
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
yeah you sound like a helicopter pilot
 
00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:33.480 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
news with the headset just so you
 
00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
clearly I could hear him very clearly
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.870 --> 00:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
setup it's just has a weird like I don't
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
know what the word is for a tin TI i n
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
teny kind of
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:14.549 --> 00:47:14.559 align:start position:0%
news we should be
 
00:47:17.390 --> 00:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
good thank you sir one other quickie can
 
00:47:19.910 --> 00:47:19.920 align:start position:0%

it along with many other will we are
 
00:50:30.150 --> 00:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
still in need of having an experienced
 
00:50:32.510 --> 00:50:32.520 align:start position:0%
drone or unmanned aircraft system
 
00:50:34.789 --> 00:50:34.799 align:start position:0%
operator on the aviation users Advisory
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
Board this year the mercus center
 
00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:39.760 align:start position:0%
released a report titled which states
 
00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
have prepared for the Drone industry a
 
00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
50 state report C release 2.0 the report
 
00:50:48.069 --> 00:50:48.079 align:start position:0%
details the Drone services are being
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
tested and permitted progress in the
 
00:50:52.990 --> 00:50:53.000 align:start position:0%
United States has been slow in part
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
because of a lack of clarity about the
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
federal and state roles of drone and
 
00:51:00.270 --> 00:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
airspace management they rate New
 
00:51:01.630 --> 00:51:01.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is number
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
26 the aviation users Advisory Board is
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
a valuable agency when it comes to
 
00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
recommending Aviation policy or
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
legislation with the new developments
 
00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
coming to us we rely on this agency to
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
work on policy for our state in order
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
for the board to be fully informed they
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
need a permitted drone operator on the
 
00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
board because of frequent changes to the
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
federal air regulations dealing with the
 
00:51:27.069 --> 00:51:27.079 align:start position:0%
permitting of the Drone operators the
 
00:51:28.829 --> 00:51:28.839 align:start position:0%
amendment that has been offered I hope
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
it has come to the committee changes the
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
reference to 14 CFR section
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
10753 at seek to 107 at seek where at
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
seek is Latin
 
00:51:48.109 --> 00:51:48.119 align:start position:0%
etq for at se quentes which is a legal
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
term for and the
 
00:51:53.349 --> 00:51:53.359 align:start position:0%
following thus if the CFR makes minor
 
00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:55.720 align:start position:0%
minor changes to the section and
 
00:51:58.270 --> 00:51:58.280 align:start position:0%
renumbers or add something we will not
 
00:52:00.990 --> 00:52:01.000 align:start position:0%
have to change our state law if we make
 
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:03.440 align:start position:0%
this amendment to
 
00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:05.309 align:start position:0%
this amendment to
107.5

00:52:05.309 --> 00:52:05.319 align:start position:0%
107.5
 
00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
10753 at se thank
 
00:52:12.430 --> 00:52:12.440 align:start position:0%
you oh I mean 107 at se I think that's
 
00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
the language I get it there are some
 
00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:18.359 align:start position:0%
questions do you will you be answering
 
00:52:18.359 --> 00:52:19.910 align:start position:0%
questions do you will you be answering

00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um
 
00:52:29.270 --> 00:52:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative Wier you say uh this bill
 
00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
is almost the same as last year's uh is
 
00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:35.480 align:start position:0%
that proposed amendment that you spoke
 
00:52:39.150 --> 00:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
of is that the only change from last
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
year that's my belief yes I think that's
 
00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:45.240 align:start position:0%
the only change thank
 
00:52:50.589 --> 00:52:50.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%

00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative wer um uh we have in
 
00:52:59.430 --> 00:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
straford County one of the outstanding
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
drone operators in the state I believe
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
um skip christenberry you may know him
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
uh I would certainly uh wonder whether
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
um we are holding back our industry in a
 
00:53:15.069 --> 00:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
significant way uh and preventing it
 
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
from taking uh uh a bigger part of our
 
00:53:24.789 --> 00:53:24.799 align:start position:0%
economy if is it your opinion that um
 
00:53:28.069 --> 00:53:28.079 align:start position:0%
that uh there are any states where
 
00:53:30.510 --> 00:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
the they have gotten farther out ahead
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
of us and where you see the kind of
 
00:53:36.710 --> 00:53:36.720 align:start position:0%
development that's possible uh with a an
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate um you know participation
 
00:53:41.829 --> 00:53:41.839 align:start position:0%
such as your bill
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%

report and I would be happy to try to
 
00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:49.760 align:start position:0%
link it to the committee and and send it
 
00:53:52.789 --> 00:53:52.799 align:start position:0%

00:53:55.589 --> 00:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
chance to read it as reference this bill
 
00:53:57.390 --> 00:53:57.400 align:start position:0%

suggestions that are that are uh have
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
been done in the other states that
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
Aviation issues as they happen um
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
currently we do not have anybody on the
 
00:55:41.549 --> 00:55:41.559 align:start position:0%
board that has this type of experience
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
so we are in very much support of that
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
um position to be part of this Aviation
 
00:55:50.390 --> 00:55:50.400 align:start position:0%
users Advisory Group um
 
00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:52.839 align:start position:0%
board um it was mentioned earlier that
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
the aviation users Advisory Board is
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
advisory in nature they are ALS O A
 
00:55:59.029 --> 00:55:59.039 align:start position:0%
hearings board so if you were to have
 
00:56:01.589 --> 00:56:01.599 align:start position:0%
some type of a situation regarding a
 
00:56:04.390 --> 00:56:04.400 align:start position:0%
drone that would require a hearing um
 
00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:06.039 align:start position:0%
this would be the board that would
 
00:56:08.029 --> 00:56:08.039 align:start position:0%
eventually hear it after it proceeded
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
through the process so they also um are
 
00:56:15.270 --> 00:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
part of that role as well um I know
 
00:56:17.190 --> 00:56:17.200 align:start position:0%
there's um I believe other members that
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
like to speak but I'm thank you very

Advisory Board I am the vice chair um
 
00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:00.760 align:start position:0%

which is a fractional ownership program
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
operating out of Portsmith so I'm a
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
member as a corporate Aviation um
 
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
constituency and it's important for
 
00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:14.760 align:start position:0%
folks to understand that this board does
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
have two roles does have an advisory
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
role and it does have um a hearing role
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
and appeals hearing role and we're
 
00:57:26.589 --> 00:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
finding ourselves you know grappling
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
with uas related issues for which the
 
00:57:33.549 --> 00:57:33.559 align:start position:0%
current membership doesn't have a lot of
 
00:57:36.150 --> 00:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh expertise and experience in order to
 
00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:39.000 align:start position:0%
be able to uh perform its advisory role
 
00:57:42.390 --> 00:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
certainly to um the Bureau of
 
00:57:45.230 --> 00:57:45.240 align:start position:0%
Aeronautics and we are also similarly
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
concerned that U as we go down the road
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
with an ever expanding and and complex
 
00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:55.400 align:start position:0%
new area of Aviation that we're going to
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
find ourselves
 
00:57:59.270 --> 00:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
um in the position of having to uh
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
adjudicate if you will um on an appeals
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on a topic for which we don't
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
have a lot of um exposure and experience
 
00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
so I can't uh
 
00:58:11.069 --> 00:58:11.079 align:start position:0%
overstate our concern and our belief
 
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be very important for
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
us and for the state to have an
 
00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:18.359 align:start position:0%
additional member to this board to deal
 
00:58:21.670 --> 00:58:21.680 align:start position:0%
directly with uas and give uh good input
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
and exposure um for the board to that
 
00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.789 align:start position:0%
and exposure um for the board to that
industry

00:58:26.789 --> 00:58:26.799 align:start position:0%
industry
 
00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
um I think that's all I need to say uh
 
00:58:32.349 --> 00:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
again thank you for your uh for this
 
00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:33.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity for me to
 
00:58:36.789 --> 00:58:36.799 align:start position:0%
testify thank you will you answer a
 
00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you madam chair Miss Bato
 
00:58:49.510 --> 00:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh given the fact of your testimony that
 
00:58:52.109 --> 00:58:52.119 align:start position:0%
you're uh you don't have much expertise
 
00:58:54.549 --> 00:58:54.559 align:start position:0%
and this is an area where expertise is
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
very significant um how do you help
 
00:59:01.430 --> 00:59:01.440 align:start position:0%
yourselves i i i preface my question
 
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
with stating that again that straford
 
00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
county has an outstanding drone operator
 
00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.079 align:start position:0%
uh and I've learned a tremendous amount
 
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
from conversing with him uh are you
 
00:59:15.589 --> 00:59:15.599 align:start position:0%
seeking advice from skilled individuals
 
00:59:19.029 --> 00:59:19.039 align:start position:0%
such as uh Mr christenberry with regard
 
00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
to issues that come before you involving
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
um drone
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
operations I I think that most of us are
 
00:59:28.829 --> 00:59:28.839 align:start position:0%
familiar with someone in the industry we
 
00:59:31.829 --> 00:59:31.839 align:start position:0%
certainly do um talk to folks in the
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
industry about issues and I think one of
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
our members actually has gotten his um
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
operator's license um but it's not quite
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
the same as having somebody on the board
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
with you to hear the issues particularly
 
00:59:50.510 --> 00:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
at the meetings uh real time and have
 
00:59:53.470 --> 00:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to uh weigh in on those
 
00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:55.029 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to uh weigh in on those
real

00:59:55.029 --> 00:59:55.039 align:start position:0%

01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't prepared for that but let's see
 
01:01:03.950 --> 01:01:03.960 align:start position:0%
what I can do just just say you're
 
01:01:05.309 --> 01:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
introducing it and you won't take
 
01:01:06.870 --> 01:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
questions all right I'm introducing
 
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
House Bill 302 it's a relative to
 
01:01:11.630 --> 01:01:11.640 align:start position:0%
creation and use of electronic records
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
by government
 
01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:15.160 align:start position:0%
agencies uh there probably better people
 
01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:17.119 align:start position:0%
to answer questions than
 
01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:21.319 align:start position:0%

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
representative obber other there
 
01:01:30.390 --> 01:01:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to
 
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
ask Margaret birds from the um Municipal
 
01:01:41.150 --> 01:01:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
next good morning Madame chair and
 
01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:45.799 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh my name is
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
Margaret Burns I'm the executive
 
01:01:50.109 --> 01:01:50.119 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire Municipal
 
01:01:53.150 --> 01:01:53.160 align:start position:0%
Association and we are here in support
 
01:01:54.829 --> 01:01:54.839 align:start position:0%
of House Bill
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
302 by way of a little background of how
 
01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:00.680 align:start position:0%
this bill came to be over the past
 
01:02:03.109 --> 01:02:03.119 align:start position:0%
several years many municipalities have
 
01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:05.799 align:start position:0%
been transitioning from paper to
 
01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:07.720 align:start position:0%
electronic documents as well as
 
01:02:09.950 --> 01:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
signatures as a way of becoming more
 
01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
efficient and saving money then due to
 
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:14.960 align:start position:0%
the pandemic the need for operating
 
01:02:17.589 --> 01:02:17.599 align:start position:0%
virtually and electronically became even
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
more apparent and even more widespread
 
01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
among political
 
01:02:23.789 --> 01:02:23.799 align:start position:0%
subdivisions however in reading the
 
01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:27.799 align:start position:0%
applicable law which is RSA 294
 
01:02:30.510 --> 01:02:30.520 align:start position:0%
D it would appear that political
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
subdivisions have authority to use
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
electronic records and signatures only
 
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
if standards have been already adopted
 
01:02:41.230 --> 01:02:41.240 align:start position:0%
by the Secretary of State's office and
 
01:02:44.029 --> 01:02:44.039 align:start position:0%
the department of Information Technology
 
01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:47.839 align:start position:0%
I think at best the language in 294 e is
 
01:02:50.789 --> 01:02:50.799 align:start position:0%
ambiguous standards have been adopted
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
for the state many years ago but there
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
are currently no standards in place for
 
01:02:58.510 --> 01:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
for cities towns and other political
 
01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:01.079 align:start position:0%
subdivisions as a result shortly after
 
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
the state of emergency was declared um
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
Governor sonunu included in emergency
 
01:03:10.430 --> 01:03:10.440 align:start position:0%
order 23 Authority for municipalities to
 
01:03:12.750 --> 01:03:12.760 align:start position:0%
use electronic records and signatures
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
despite um the ambiguity currently in
 
01:03:19.390 --> 01:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
294 D after that nhma and our board
 
01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:21.640 align:start position:0%
chair at the time Shawn Mulholland who
 
01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
was also in the hearing this morning
 
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
contacted commissioner gouet of the um
 
01:03:29.630 --> 01:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Information Technology we
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
talked about the issue and we worked on
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
the language that is now House Bill 302
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
to rectify the problem House Bill 302
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
would clarify that municipalities may
 
01:03:43.269 --> 01:03:43.279 align:start position:0%
use electronic records and signatures
 
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
even once the state of emergency has
 
01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
ended and even without specific
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
standards being created for
 
01:03:52.510 --> 01:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities by the state um in a
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
nutshell what the bill does is it
 
01:03:57.069 --> 01:03:57.079 align:start position:0%
continues to allow doit to adopt
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
standards but it also makes clear that
 
01:04:02.190 --> 01:04:02.200 align:start position:0%
even in the absence of those standards
 
01:04:04.029 --> 01:04:04.039 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions cities towns
 
01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:07.160 align:start position:0%
Village districts Etc can use electronic
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
records and signatures so that they may
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
continue to engage in that practice um
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
even after this state of emergency is
 
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
over so we think this is a very
 
01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.950 align:start position:0%
over so we think this is a very
important

01:04:17.950 --> 01:04:17.960 align:start position:0%
important
 
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
clarification in the law and of course
 
01:04:22.630 --> 01:04:22.640 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any
 
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:25.480 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there any
 
01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.390 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there any
questions

01:04:26.390 --> 01:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.990 align:start position:0%
questions
questions

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
leus um in uh part two section B there's
 
01:04:35.470 --> 01:04:35.480 align:start position:0%
a couple of places where must is
 
01:04:37.230 --> 01:04:37.240 align:start position:0%
replaced by should I'm wondering what
 
01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
the uh purpose of that is I mean because
 
01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
if standards are created it sounds like
 
01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:44.599 align:start position:0%
uh you they wouldn't need to be followed
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
in that case I think uh the the
 
01:04:50.430 --> 01:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind changing some of the
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
words the must to should as well as the
 
01:04:56.190 --> 01:04:56.200 align:start position:0%
shall determine being changed to May
 
01:04:58.910 --> 01:04:58.920 align:start position:0%
develop standards is to make clear that
 
01:05:00.190 --> 01:05:00.200 align:start position:0%
um the department of Information
 
01:05:02.029 --> 01:05:02.039 align:start position:0%
Technology can still adopt those
 
01:05:04.710 --> 01:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
standards but even in the absence of
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
those standards municipalities can use
 
01:05:09.910 --> 01:05:09.920 align:start position:0%
electronic records and signatures so
 
01:05:12.349 --> 01:05:12.359 align:start position:0%
they're not waiting on the development
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
of those standards um in order to have
 
01:05:16.910 --> 01:05:16.920 align:start position:0%
the authority to use electronic records
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
and signatur so that was the reasoning
 
01:05:22.029 --> 01:05:22.039 align:start position:0%
behind changing some of those must and
 
01:05:28.430 --> 01:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:32.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:35.309 --> 01:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much thank you
 
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.069 --> 01:05:41.079 align:start position:0%
mhand I'll just uh add to what uh
 
01:05:42.589 --> 01:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
Margaret is already stated I'm not going
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
to repeat all of those things uh
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
basically the opportunity to develop
 
01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:47.680 align:start position:0%
standards has been in place since
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
September 11th of 2001 quite some time
 
01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
ago and those agencies have not had the
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do that probably because
 
01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
they don't have the resources be able to
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
do that they have developed standards
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
for state agencies but not for counties
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
and municipalities this uh these changes
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
again will allow us to continue to work
 
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
together with doit Secretary of State's
 
01:06:09.430 --> 01:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
office and admin Services um should they
 
01:06:10.870 --> 01:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
get into a position where they can
 
01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:12.200 align:start position:0%
create standards and we hope that they
 
01:06:14.029 --> 01:06:14.039 align:start position:0%
do we want to work with them we are
 
01:06:15.870 --> 01:06:15.880 align:start position:0%
partners with them and we help make
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
these changes in partnership with doit
 
01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:20.119 align:start position:0%
so I think this is just an opportunity
 
01:06:22.029 --> 01:06:22.039 align:start position:0%
for us to continue to work to work
 
01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:23.720 align:start position:0%
together but again those agencies
 
01:06:25.269 --> 01:06:25.279 align:start position:0%
apparently are not in a position at this
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
point to be able to develop those
 
01:06:29.789 --> 01:06:29.799 align:start position:0%
standards and this allows us to use
 
01:06:31.269 --> 01:06:31.279 align:start position:0%
electronic records and electronic
 
01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:33.039 align:start position:0%
signatures which of course we have been
 
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:35.240 align:start position:0%
doing as municipalities and counties for
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
a very long time anyway and this just
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
language thank you Mr mahalan are there
 
01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
committee I don't see any so thank you
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
for your
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
testimony is there anyone else who
 
01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.150 --> 01:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:18.789 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
so uh we have a few minutes before our
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
next hearing begins at 11: so does
 
01:07:44.670 --> 01:07:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:53.789 --> 01:07:53.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:56.309 --> 01:07:56.319 align:start position:0%
Roy 24
 
01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:03.880 align:start position:0%
2 is there is there a
 
01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
second we couldn't hear him Madam chair
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't hear it I'm sorry could you
 
01:08:10.390 --> 01:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
repeat what was the motion the motion
 
01:08:14.430 --> 01:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
was House Bill 274 inexpedient to
 
01:08:17.070 --> 01:08:17.080 align:start position:0%
legislate by representative Roy I'll
 
01:08:20.309 --> 01:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
second seconded by representative leus
 
01:08:23.229 --> 01:08:23.239 align:start position:0%
do you wish to speak to your motion
 
01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:28.600 align:start position:0%
yes this is the that um St
 
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.829 --> 01:08:40.839 align:start position:0%
all is that better oh yeah definitely
 
01:08:43.349 --> 01:08:43.359 align:start position:0%
this is the bill um having the state
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
pick up a portion of the retirement
 
01:08:47.550 --> 01:08:47.560 align:start position:0%
funding for the municipalities I'm
 
01:08:48.990 --> 01:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
moving this bill in expedient to
 
01:08:51.309 --> 01:08:51.319 align:start position:0%
legislate because I believe at this
 
01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
particular point in time um the state
 
01:08:57.669 --> 01:08:57.679 align:start position:0%
has no no additional funds to even uh
 
01:09:00.789 --> 01:09:00.799 align:start position:0%
entertain this and the only way the
 
01:09:02.349 --> 01:09:02.359 align:start position:0%
state would be able to raise funds would
 
01:09:05.110 --> 01:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
be to increase business taxes which
 
01:09:07.149 --> 01:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
would crush our small businesses at this
 
01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
time so while the concept behind it may
 
01:09:11.309 --> 01:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
at some point in the future have Merit
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
cently it's uh not feasible at all thank
 
01:09:20.749 --> 01:09:20.759 align:start position:0%
you person black to speak to your second
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who would like to
 
01:09:34.149 --> 01:09:34.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:38.470 --> 01:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
motion Madam chair yes representative uh
 
01:09:41.789 --> 01:09:41.799 align:start position:0%
if I may speak representative O'Brien
 
01:09:41.799 --> 01:09:43.229 align:start position:0%
if I may speak representative O'Brien
please

01:09:43.229 --> 01:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
do thank you madam chair uh with the
 
01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:48.880 align:start position:0%
deepest respect to my fellow Comm uh
 
01:09:50.149 --> 01:09:50.159 align:start position:0%
committee members are making the
 
01:09:53.229 --> 01:09:53.239 align:start position:0%
recommendation of I but the statement
 
01:09:55.870 --> 01:09:55.880 align:start position:0%
goes that the state
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
cannot afford it in general
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
terms well here's the problem
 
01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.709 align:start position:0%
terms well here's the problem
municipalities

01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:04.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:10:08.669 --> 01:10:08.679 align:start position:0%
can't uh support it in the situation of
 
01:10:12.030 --> 01:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
my constituents a city of approximately
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
100,000 people the city of
 
01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
nassor is paying just in pension costs
 
01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.630 align:start position:0%
nassor is paying just in pension costs
4.4

01:10:20.630 --> 01:10:20.640 align:start position:0%
4.4
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
million I don't know about you I lost
 
01:10:26.590 --> 01:10:26.600 align:start position:0%
$100 on the Super Bowl last night but
 
01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
$4.4 million is very hard for the
 
01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayers to uh feel now this all let's
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
step back retro back a bit the state
 
01:10:41.790 --> 01:10:41.800 align:start position:0%
used to pay 35% towards a pension cost
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
this is not asking to go back to the 35%
 
01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:49.960 align:start position:0%
years this is just asking to assist uh
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers of your communities
 
01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400 align:start position:0%
because if you have one police officer
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
that's in the New Hampshire retirement
 
01:11:01.149 --> 01:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
system one teacher that is in the New
 
01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system or one fir
 
01:11:05.630 --> 01:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
fighter in the New Hampshire retirement
 
01:11:09.430 --> 01:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
system or perhaps some of your uh
 
01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:11.719 align:start position:0%
employees you are feeling this
 
01:11:14.110 --> 01:11:14.120 align:start position:0%
particular pinch
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
locally and let's keep in mind in
 
01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
1967 at the formation of the New
 
01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system to combine
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
all four uh different entities into the
 
01:11:30.590 --> 01:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
one system the promise was made by the
 
01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
state of New
 
01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:35.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to uh come into uh that we
 
01:11:36.629 --> 01:11:36.639 align:start position:0%
will pay
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
35% so this to me is a very wellth
 
01:11:41.430 --> 01:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
thought out
 
01:11:45.510 --> 01:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
bill it doesn't ask for the 35% but asks
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
a practical amount of 5% to alleviate
 
01:11:51.149 --> 01:11:51.159 align:start position:0%
the helps to your cities and
 
01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
towns I think if you went back and I
 
01:11:55.870 --> 01:11:55.880 align:start position:0%
hope you
 
01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:58.679 align:start position:0%
did I but if you went back and talked to
 
01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
your town leaders I think they would
 
01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:06.719 align:start position:0%
agree to me with me that this is an
 
01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunate pinch that has affected now
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
what gets done that might not be some
 
01:12:16.189 --> 01:12:16.199 align:start position:0%
sand on the roads or other things when
 
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
the municipality such as nashor is
 
01:12:22.270 --> 01:12:22.280 align:start position:0%
paying $4 million .4
 
01:12:26.350 --> 01:12:26.360 align:start position:0%
million that wasn't expected 10 years
 
01:12:29.070 --> 01:12:29.080 align:start position:0%
ago other things have fallen off the
 
01:12:32.590 --> 01:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
radar to improve the municipality so
 
01:12:35.030 --> 01:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
this has great impact it has great
 
01:12:37.229 --> 01:12:37.239 align:start position:0%
impact to your constituents and has
 
01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
great impact for the cities and towns
 
01:12:43.270 --> 01:12:43.280 align:start position:0%
that you live in so I cannot support the
 
01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:46.120 align:start position:0%
itl I think this is kicking would be
 
01:12:48.550 --> 01:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road and not
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
doing the proper responsibility that we
 
01:12:54.629 --> 01:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
as legislators should do to look to our
 
01:12:57.070 --> 01:12:57.080 align:start position:0%
cities towns in the system in this
 
01:13:00.189 --> 01:13:00.199 align:start position:0%
endeavor thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:13:04.470 --> 01:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
goie thank you madam chair and I will uh
 
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
be voting in opposition to the itl
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
motion um while 5% is a small amount and
 
01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh not nearly close to the 35% that the
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
state had uh in years prior uh I think
 
01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:24.719 align:start position:0%
it's a step in the right direction I
 
01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:26.560 align:start position:0%
don't believe believe it's up to this
 
01:13:29.310 --> 01:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
committee to deal with whether it's
 
01:13:31.229 --> 01:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
affordable or not in the
 
01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
budget this
 
01:13:35.229 --> 01:13:35.239 align:start position:0%
committee's dealing with this is whether
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
or not we feel it's the right thing to
 
01:13:39.270 --> 01:13:39.280 align:start position:0%
do and if we pass this it will go to
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
finance and they will determine whether
 
01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
there is money available or not so for
 
01:13:45.550 --> 01:13:45.560 align:start position:0%
that reason I think we are going in the
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
right direction I think it's uh time to
 
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
give uh back to our local communities
 
01:13:53.510 --> 01:13:53.520 align:start position:0%
and I will be voting against the itl
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
motion thank you
 
01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:57.070 align:start position:0%
motion thank you
representative

01:13:57.070 --> 01:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
Schulz thank you madam chair um I'm
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
going to try to not repeat things others
 
01:14:05.990 --> 01:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
have said I will say this is uh I will
 
01:14:09.470 --> 01:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
be opposing the itl motion because this
 
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
is the issue I hear most about from my
 
01:14:15.189 --> 01:14:15.199 align:start position:0%
constituents is how high the property
 
01:14:19.070 --> 01:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
taxes are and this was a promise made to
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
cities and towns and to have eliminated
 
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:25.600 align:start position:0%
it in the first place I think was
 
01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:26.390 align:start position:0%
it in the first place I think was
uh

01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:14:29.629 --> 01:14:29.639 align:start position:0%
abhorent and for all the rhetoric around
 
01:14:32.149 --> 01:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
taxes we really have let the people of
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
the Granite State down and the property
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
tax is too high of a burden for most
 
01:14:41.430 --> 01:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
people across the state and we need to
 
01:14:43.709 --> 01:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
5% is really not
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
enough that's it thank you
 
01:14:49.510 --> 01:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative font
 
01:14:53.229 --> 01:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
now yes thank you uh Madam chair um I
 
01:14:56.030 --> 01:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
too must oppose the itl
 
01:14:59.390 --> 01:14:59.400 align:start position:0%
uh motion uh and based on the um
 
01:15:02.629 --> 01:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
consequences on property taxes one of
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
the most uh one of the biggest issues
 
01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:08.120 align:start position:0%
that I hear from my constituents is uh
 
01:15:10.790 --> 01:15:10.800 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and in New Hampshire
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
it is actually considered to be at a
 
01:15:15.669 --> 01:15:15.679 align:start position:0%
crisis level uh affordable housing we
 
01:15:18.510 --> 01:15:18.520 align:start position:0%
have an extreme lack of it we have a a
 
01:15:20.510 --> 01:15:20.520 align:start position:0%
large homeless population that is
 
01:15:23.990 --> 01:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
struggling and a lot lot of that goes
 
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
back to property taxes uh affordable
 
01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
housing cannot exist with uh the rate of
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
property tax uh that that we are
 
01:15:37.590 --> 01:15:37.600 align:start position:0%
leveling so I I have to oppose uh any
 
01:15:40.629 --> 01:15:40.639 align:start position:0%
legislation that will be passing uh
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
higher rates back to uh my constituent's
 
01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
uh property tax rates and I think the
 
01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:47.070 align:start position:0%
uh property tax rates and I think the
the

01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:47.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:50.800 align:start position:0%
5% uh asking the state to to come back
 
01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh and and put in 5% as a minimal uh
 
01:15:56.830 --> 01:15:56.840 align:start position:0%
minimal amount but it it it at least is
 
01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:00.159 align:start position:0%
something to uh to help the property tax
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
payers thank you thank you
 
01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:06.950 align:start position:0%
payers thank you thank you
representative

01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chair I too Echo
 
01:16:13.709 --> 01:16:13.719 align:start position:0%
the sentiments of the uh previous
 
01:16:17.310 --> 01:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
speakers um we are a policy committee
 
01:16:19.189 --> 01:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
and and and this committee has an
 
01:16:22.229 --> 01:16:22.239 align:start position:0%
obligation to stand up for the promise
 
01:16:25.149 --> 01:16:25.159 align:start position:0%
the commitment that the state made uh
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
all those years ago which had kept up
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
until uh the time of the Bill O'Brien
 
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
legislature uh when one Party U chose to
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh to zero out the commitment that that
 
01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:41.800 align:start position:0%
and and the contribution that the state
 
01:16:44.310 --> 01:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
was making under its obligation under
 
01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.270 align:start position:0%
was making under its obligation under
the

01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
law and has slapped the face of the
 
01:16:51.149 --> 01:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in every community in this
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
state and we have an obligation as a
 
01:16:57.790 --> 01:16:57.800 align:start position:0%
policy committee to step up to state
 
01:16:59.430 --> 01:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
that we wish to
 
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:02.920 align:start position:0%
reinstate uh to the degree possible uh
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
the uh the contribution that the state
 
01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:07.880 align:start position:0%
committed to make um if the finance
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
committee says we can't afford it well
 
01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:13.560 align:start position:0%
that may be a reality uh but the policy
 
01:17:16.470 --> 01:17:16.480 align:start position:0%
is Our obligation and it was a shameful
 
01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
step that the that the legislative
 
01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
majority back in those days made I know
 
01:17:25.149 --> 01:17:25.159 align:start position:0%
I voted against it and all my Democrat
 
01:17:27.390 --> 01:17:27.400 align:start position:0%
colleagues voted against it so it's time
 
01:17:29.629 --> 01:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
to get off that track and get back on
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
the right
 
01:17:36.270 --> 01:17:36.280 align:start position:0%
track I'd like to to make two points one
 
01:17:38.709 --> 01:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
is that was actually Governor Lynch who
 
01:17:41.709 --> 01:17:41.719 align:start position:0%
proposed reducing this state
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
contribution the legislature merely
 
01:17:45.950 --> 01:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
agreed with him and went even further
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
than he had
 
01:17:50.669 --> 01:17:50.679 align:start position:0%
suggested and secondly I'm opposed to it
 
01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
on the principle that if the state is
 
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
paying for part of your
 
01:18:00.390 --> 01:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
retirement right now the state has no
 
01:18:02.830 --> 01:18:02.840 align:start position:0%
ability to affect the number of your
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
employees or how much you pay them
 
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
that's your business or your Town's
 
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
business if the state is paying a
 
01:18:11.070 --> 01:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
contribution toward the retirement
 
01:18:13.950 --> 01:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
system they could very well say you
 
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:17.040 align:start position:0%
can't pay a teacher more than x you
 
01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
can't pay a police chief more than why
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
and I know that those numbers vary
 
01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
throughout the state State uh my town
 
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
which chooses to pay its policemen not
 
01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
very much continually loses newly
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
trained policemen to go to other even
 
01:18:38.870 --> 01:18:38.880 align:start position:0%
other towns that choose to pay more so
 
01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
if I'm if I'm contributing to the
 
01:18:46.110 --> 01:18:46.120 align:start position:0%
pension benefits of your employees who
 
01:18:49.229 --> 01:18:49.239 align:start position:0%
you choose how many you have and what
 
01:18:51.790 --> 01:18:51.800 align:start position:0%
you're paying them and you are choosing
 
01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.310 align:start position:0%
you're paying them and you are choosing
to

01:18:53.310 --> 01:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
pay twice three times what our town is
 
01:18:59.629 --> 01:18:59.639 align:start position:0%
choosing to pay then I should get a say
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
in how many people you're hiring and
 
01:19:04.310 --> 01:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
what you're paying them and I think that
 
01:19:07.950 --> 01:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
that is something that the smaller towns
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
are more concerned with than the idea
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
that the state will help to pay for
 
01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:15.790 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:17.149 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
employees well Madam chair if I may
 
01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
respond uh that is an interesting
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
argument which is it has an absolute
 
01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
element of fact in it but I think many
 
01:19:31.590 --> 01:19:31.600 align:start position:0%
of the cities and towns experience the
 
01:19:34.709 --> 01:19:34.719 align:start position:0%
pirating if you will of uh employees or
 
01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
at the very least the luring away of
 
01:19:40.350 --> 01:19:40.360 align:start position:0%
employees by higher salaries than than
 
01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
uh than might be the norm but the bottom
 
01:19:44.790 --> 01:19:44.800 align:start position:0%
line is that the that the state made
 
01:19:48.149 --> 01:19:48.159 align:start position:0%
that commission commitment uh and it
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%

01:20:02.669 --> 01:20:02.679 align:start position:0%
Roy um thank you madam chair and I'm I'm
 
01:20:04.470 --> 01:20:04.480 align:start position:0%
pleased to see um that we're all in
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
agreement on this bill um having said
 
01:20:11.149 --> 01:20:11.159 align:start position:0%
that I I actually um I I I am
 
01:20:13.629 --> 01:20:13.639 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to to the um to the plight
 
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
of the cities and towns however I would
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
echo echo what the chairman said
 
01:20:19.750 --> 01:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
chairwoman said um with regard to the
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
state having no control over um what is
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
going to be done and it's basically
 
01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
right having a blank check um having
 
01:20:30.430 --> 01:20:30.440 align:start position:0%
said that if there were some some um
 
01:20:32.550 --> 01:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
controls in place I might support this
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
at a future time but of all the times to
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
be calling in this chit that the the
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
state uh committed to many many decades
 
01:20:43.229 --> 01:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
ago uh in the middle of a pandemic is is
 
01:20:45.189 --> 01:20:45.199 align:start position:0%
not the time to be be calling that in
 
01:20:46.750 --> 01:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
and to put that extra stress on our
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
businesses when they're going under um
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
it is not the right time to do it in in
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
regard to the tax argument um the tax
 
01:20:56.870 --> 01:20:56.880 align:start position:0%
rates are set by the towns they decide
 
01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
who to hire what raises and contracts to
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
agree to not the state and I would
 
01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
suggest that the um citizens of the
 
01:21:06.790 --> 01:21:06.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities look to their towns um to
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
keep their taxes in check thank
 
01:21:12.390 --> 01:21:12.400 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
Vera thank you madam chair we can all be
 
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:19.040 align:start position:0%
sympathetic to either side of the issue
 
01:21:22.189 --> 01:21:22.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately but my thought is that
 
01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
it's all one community whether it's
 
01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
industry that's hurting or whether or
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
not it's citizens that are hurting it's
 
01:21:34.149 --> 01:21:34.159 align:start position:0%
we're all the same and two I think it's
 
01:21:34.159 --> 01:21:35.669 align:start position:0%
we're all the same and two I think it's
it's

01:21:35.669 --> 01:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:21:39.229 --> 01:21:39.239 align:start position:0%
uh irrelevant to me whether or not
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
you're a business that's hurting or
 
01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not you're a citizen that's
 
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
hurting because
 
01:21:47.229 --> 01:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
because everyone's looking
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
for relief of some
 
01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.709 --> 01:21:59.719 align:start position:0%
contribution thank
 
01:22:03.390 --> 01:22:03.400 align:start position:0%
you I'll be voting in favor of the Bill
 
01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:05.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:05.159 --> 01:22:07.030 align:start position:0%
thank you

01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
scitec I'd like to make a couple points
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:16.390 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:21.320 align:start position:0%
him can you hear me now i' like to make
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
one of the microphones in the room
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to use your computer
 
01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:32.040 align:start position:0%
microphone representative scitec would
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:57.189 --> 01:22:57.199 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to make a couple
 
01:22:58.990 --> 01:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
points which are less cogent than what
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
the chairman has said first we are not
 
01:23:06.270 --> 01:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
the policy committee on this uh I think
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
the entire tax structure of New
 
01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs to be studied by a
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
policy committee I'm not satisfied
 
01:23:15.030 --> 01:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
either with high property taxes but the
 
01:23:16.990 --> 01:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
Alternatives aren't
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
attractive uh the so I do not like even
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
if even if we were the policy committee
 
01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
I don't like a patchwork approach that
 
01:23:30.229 --> 01:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
we pulled five 5% out of the air maybe
 
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
6% is better 3 and a half% better this
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
just does not that sort of approach does
 
01:23:38.189 --> 01:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
not appeal to me I'd really like our tax
 
01:23:41.070 --> 01:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
structure study the second point is this
 
01:23:44.470 --> 01:23:44.480 align:start position:0%
the promise was made 50 years ago that's
 
01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:45.270 align:start position:0%
the promise was made 50 years ago that's
come

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
come
 
01:23:48.270 --> 01:23:48.280 align:start position:0%
on that's convenient to say but the
 
01:23:51.790 --> 01:23:51.800 align:start position:0%
Inconvenient Truth is at this time you
 
01:23:54.430 --> 01:23:54.440 align:start position:0%
communities would pay to get into the
 
01:23:56.830 --> 01:23:56.840 align:start position:0%
retirement system rather than the other
 
01:23:58.950 --> 01:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
way around for the benefits that it
 
01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
affords that it's One-Stop shopping that
 
01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:03.320 align:start position:0%
it handles all the administrative and
 
01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
invest and investment features so uh a
 
01:24:10.110 --> 01:24:10.120 align:start position:0%
50-year-old promise uh I made one to my
 
01:24:12.030 --> 01:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
wife that's the only one I'm intended to
 
01:24:16.229 --> 01:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
Allegro thank you madam chair I'll be
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
voting in favor of this
 
01:24:26.229 --> 01:24:26.239 align:start position:0%
itl and I would like to address um a
 
01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:28.639 align:start position:0%
couple of the arguments that have been
 
01:24:32.629 --> 01:24:32.639 align:start position:0%
Advanced uh against it first of all this
 
01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
is a policy question indeed in its very
 
01:24:39.229 --> 01:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
deepest sense and the question is or the
 
01:24:41.750 --> 01:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
policy issue is whether or not it's the
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the municipalities to
 
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
administer their own budgets and
 
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
maintain something of a balanced account
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
now the fact that the municipalities
 
01:24:56.510 --> 01:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
certain municipalities face problem is
 
01:24:59.510 --> 01:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
an exact example of why they should be
 
01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
attending to their own budgets and not
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
relying on the states uh it therefore
 
01:25:07.070 --> 01:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
should not be the policy of the states
 
01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:08.149 align:start position:0%
should not be the policy of the states
to

01:25:08.149 --> 01:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
uh look in plain English to bail out
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities who are not attending to
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
their budget properly now the other
 
01:25:16.510 --> 01:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
thing I would like to address and I
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
think I heard this properly there was a
 
01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
little uh the audio is not ideal so I'm
 
01:25:25.950 --> 01:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
not sure uh if I heard properly but I
 
01:25:28.510 --> 01:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
think I heard one of our colleagues say
 
01:25:31.350 --> 01:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
that we're all the same uh and therefore
 
01:25:33.950 --> 01:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
we should all be perhaps in one big pool
 
01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
of uh slush fund uh but I would uh beg
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
to disagree that we're all the same some
 
01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities manage their budgets
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
appropriately and some do not um so
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
having addressed those two I would uh
 
01:25:51.590 --> 01:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
just like to repeat briefly I'll be
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
voting in favor of this itl and
 
01:25:55.390 --> 01:25:55.400 align:start position:0%
encourage the min IP alties to attend to
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
their budgets
 
01:25:58.830 --> 01:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
properly representative
 
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you madam chair um I will
 
01:26:07.310 --> 01:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
vote against itl because I know that of
 
01:26:09.950 --> 01:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
all the state all all the New Hampshire
 
01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
dollars that are raised to support state
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
and local government 2third of that is
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
raised from property taxes and no other
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
state puts that high a burden on their
 
01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:30.430 align:start position:0%
state puts that high a burden on their
property

01:26:30.430 --> 01:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:45.149 --> 01:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:47.350 --> 01:26:47.360 align:start position:0%
groda I want to make I want to respond
 
01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
to my fellow representative made a
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
comment about my about my response in
 
01:26:58.430 --> 01:26:58.440 align:start position:0%
that it's not a slush fund this this
 
01:27:01.629 --> 01:27:01.639 align:start position:0%
this retirement benefit is a attached to
 
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:03.800 align:start position:0%
real people who do real work for the
 
01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
state and the
 
01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities and I dare say that many
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
municipalities are very conscious of
 
01:27:15.669 --> 01:27:15.679 align:start position:0%
their budget and I think that unless you
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
have data that shows that there are but
 
01:27:21.270 --> 01:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
there are irresponsible municipalities I
 
01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
think that is an affront to the to the
 
01:27:27.470 --> 01:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
um to the uh towns in New Hampshire who
 
01:27:30.270 --> 01:27:30.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.030 --> 01:27:34.040 align:start position:0%
hard thank you I don't believe anyone
 
01:27:37.149 --> 01:27:37.159 align:start position:0%
would disagree with that representative
 
01:27:41.669 --> 01:27:41.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
um put myself back in the picture um I
 
01:27:49.629 --> 01:27:49.639 align:start position:0%
also will be voting against itl and uh I
 
01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
will take a little of Representative Al
 
01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.390 align:start position:0%
will take a little of Representative Al
agr's

01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
agr's
 
01:27:57.070 --> 01:27:57.080 align:start position:0%
ation that through all towns and
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities in New Hampshire are not
 
01:28:05.350 --> 01:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh exact the same but many by no fault
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
of their own is my neighboring town of
 
01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
Allenstown uh do as well as they can to
 
01:28:16.229 --> 01:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
manage what they have but the fact is
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
that they are property poor towns so the
 
01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
income in town via property taxes just
 
01:28:25.229 --> 01:28:25.239 align:start position:0%
as is not
 
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:34.520 align:start position:0%
forward okay there are two people who
 
01:28:38.189 --> 01:28:38.199 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak in one minute left so I
 
01:28:40.870 --> 01:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
think that we will reset was just a
 
01:28:44.149 --> 01:28:44.159 align:start position:0%
question Madam chair please do I just
 
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to know how many people signed in
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:05.629 --> 01:29:05.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:07.800 align:start position:0%
checking thank you madam chair I didn't
 
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:11.080 align:start position:0%
mean to hold up our proceedings but I
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
helpful what's
 
01:29:25.590 --> 01:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
that representative O'Brien
 
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:28.360 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair I I will try to
 
01:29:30.310 --> 01:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
be very brief I know the time
 
01:29:33.149 --> 01:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
constraints uh but when I went to St
 
01:29:35.350 --> 01:29:35.360 align:start position:0%
peters's grammar school we discussed
 
01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
ratios and the thing is you got to keep
 
01:29:41.830 --> 01:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
in mind the statement was made of what
 
01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
uh municipalities are paying their
 
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
employees when you get your retirement
 
01:29:50.390 --> 01:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
from any nhrs it's figured individually
 
01:29:52.750 --> 01:29:52.760 align:start position:0%
it's not figured by municipality they
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
look at how much money you put into the
 
01:29:58.270 --> 01:29:58.280 align:start position:0%
system and you receive that percentage
 
01:30:01.149 --> 01:30:01.159 align:start position:0%
now a firefighter in one community may
 
01:30:03.629 --> 01:30:03.639 align:start position:0%
receive more because he put more money
 
01:30:06.149 --> 01:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
into the system a firefighter from
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
another Community will get less because
 
01:30:11.590 --> 01:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
he was paid less so to say that it is
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
overburdened is untrue every police
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
officer and firefighter pays over 12%
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
into the pension system and that's what
 
01:30:24.030 --> 01:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
figures it out so therefore it isn't the
 
01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
issue of what a municipality pays second
 
01:30:33.910 --> 01:30:33.920 align:start position:0%
I think the statement was made that oh
 
01:30:35.709 --> 01:30:35.719 align:start position:0%
some of these communities go out and
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
hire a lot of let's say police officers
 
01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:41.360 align:start position:0%
or firefighters well I think in the
 
01:30:43.229 --> 01:30:43.239 align:start position:0%
example of Manchester where they have a
 
01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
lot of three deckas granted at one given
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
moment in time there may be too many
 
01:30:50.870 --> 01:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
firefighters on duty but then when the
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
building catches fire there is not
 
01:30:56.189 --> 01:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
enough I as a deputy chief in nashwa
 
01:31:00.270 --> 01:31:00.280 align:start position:0%
have experienced that and I think by
 
01:31:04.790 --> 01:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
NFPA rules every Community has the right
 
01:31:09.109 --> 01:31:09.119 align:start position:0%
to determine what value they put on Fire
 
01:31:12.189 --> 01:31:12.199 align:start position:0%
Protection in the municipality they so
 
01:31:15.709 --> 01:31:15.719 align:start position:0%
therefore by NPA national standards it's
 
01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
not fair for this legislature to take
 
01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
away that municipality's right to
 
01:31:23.550 --> 01:31:23.560 align:start position:0%
determine the value that they want to
 
01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
put on protection of life and property
 
01:31:28.910 --> 01:31:28.920 align:start position:0%
and their Community I think those
 
01:31:31.470 --> 01:31:31.480 align:start position:0%
statements weren't completely accurate
 
01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:34.360 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate Madam speaker uh uh
 
01:31:36.070 --> 01:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
excuse me Madam chairman for the
 
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh present alternative
 
01:31:40.709 --> 01:31:40.719 align:start position:0%
thoughts on this thank
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
you Madame chair I do have the numbers
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%

01:31:55.430 --> 01:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
were post and one was neutral and that
 
01:31:59.790 --> 01:31:59.800 align:start position:0%

muted that's right it should be muted
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
because it will create feedback so he
 
01:32:47.310 --> 01:32:47.320 align:start position:0%

01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
office they would need to resign prior
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
to the filing period for the election
 
01:37:32.709 --> 01:37:32.719 align:start position:0%
that they wish to run
 
01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:35.320 align:start position:0%
in our current Secretary of State is
 
01:37:37.070 --> 01:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
proud to tell anyone who will listen
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
about his role in our government the
 
01:37:41.550 --> 01:37:41.560 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is a constitutional
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
officer who serves various functions
 
01:37:45.550 --> 01:37:45.560 align:start position:0%
spanning both the executive and
 
01:37:47.310 --> 01:37:47.320 align:start position:0%
legislative branches of
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
government additionally he is the chief
 
01:37:52.830 --> 01:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
elections officer in the state this
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
means that he is ultimately responsible
 
01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
for the execution of our state elections
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
for the preparation of all of the
 
01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
ballots used in those elections for
 
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
receiving and verifying all votes cast
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
and conducting any necessary
 
01:38:11.030 --> 01:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
recounts this bill seeks to avoid any
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
scenario where the secretary of state
 
01:38:15.070 --> 01:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
has the opportunity to put their finger
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
on the scale if they were to appear on
 
01:38:19.990 --> 01:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
the ballot as a candidate
 
01:38:22.229 --> 01:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
themselves consider that the Secretary
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
of State's signature is printed on every
 
01:38:27.750 --> 01:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
ballot below the state seal the
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is the one who
 
01:38:31.470 --> 01:38:31.480 align:start position:0%
decides how many ballots are delivered
 
01:38:34.589 --> 01:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
to each polling place they can dictate
 
01:38:37.470 --> 01:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
the order of party columns on the
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
ballot imagine someone designing their
 
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
own ballots or being in charge of and
 
01:38:45.149 --> 01:38:45.159 align:start position:0%
having the final say in their own
 
01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
recount the opportunities to tilt the
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
scales in their favor are numerous
 
01:38:53.550 --> 01:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
that's what this bill would address
 
01:38:55.189 --> 01:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
while much of the rest of the country
 
01:38:58.109 --> 01:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
has had issues with election security
 
01:39:00.109 --> 01:39:00.119 align:start position:0%
secretary Gardner will tell you that you
 
01:39:01.589 --> 01:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
cannot hack a
 
01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
pencil the Simplicity efficiency and
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
integrity of our elections are the Envy
 
01:39:07.950 --> 01:39:07.960 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:39:10.750 --> 01:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
country the Integrity of an election is
 
01:39:13.709 --> 01:39:13.719 align:start position:0%
its most important aspect to ensure
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
election Integrity we have strict rules
 
01:39:19.589 --> 01:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
about who has physical access to ballots
 
01:39:21.990 --> 01:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
for example in times where volunteers
 
01:39:24.669 --> 01:39:24.679 align:start position:0%
are scarce candidates have stepped up to
 
01:39:28.149 --> 01:39:28.159 align:start position:0%
work the polls or help process absentee
 
01:39:30.830 --> 01:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
ballots in fact at my own polling place
 
01:39:34.030 --> 01:39:34.040 align:start position:0%
in Manchester Ward 5 my wife the other
 
01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative Balden worked the polls
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
all day because covid caused many of our
 
01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:42.320 align:start position:0%
usual pole workers to stay home she was
 
01:39:43.990 --> 01:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
advised that she needed to stay away
 
01:39:47.070 --> 01:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
from ballots entirely especially marked
 
01:39:49.910 --> 01:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
ballots and was only assigned tasks
 
01:39:51.470 --> 01:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
which allowed her to retain a
 
01:39:53.990 --> 01:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
considerable distance from ballots
 
01:39:56.109 --> 01:39:56.119 align:start position:0%
she was also not allowed to participate
 
01:39:58.109 --> 01:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
in any counting activities after the
 
01:39:58.119 --> 01:39:59.149 align:start position:0%
in any counting activities after the
polls

01:39:59.149 --> 01:39:59.159 align:start position:0%
polls
 
01:40:02.030 --> 01:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
closed this bill seeks to extend this
 
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
Common Sense mindset to our top election
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
official the Secretary of
 
01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:09.920 align:start position:0%
State other states have had issues with
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
individuals using the Secretary of State
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
position as a stepping stone to the
 
01:40:17.390 --> 01:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
governorship in Georgia Brian Kemp was
 
01:40:20.830 --> 01:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state from 2010 to 2018
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
and retained the position throughout his
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
candidate receiver governor in the Years
 
01:40:27.830 --> 01:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
leading up to his gubernatorial run
 
01:40:29.910 --> 01:40:29.920 align:start position:0%
secretary Kemp closed hundreds of
 
01:40:32.109 --> 01:40:32.119 align:start position:0%
polling places in disproportionately
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
minority communities and canceled the
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
registrations of 1.4 million voters an
 
01:40:41.310 --> 01:40:41.320 align:start position:0%
act described by the Atlanta Journal
 
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution as the largest mass
 
01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
disenfranchisement in US
 
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
history after winning the 2018 Georgia
 
01:40:53.350 --> 01:40:53.360 align:start position:0%
election for governor by a narrow margin
 
01:40:57.109 --> 01:40:57.119 align:start position:0%
of 55,000 votes a tiny fraction of the
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
number of Voters which he purged in the
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
Years prior Kemp resigned his position
 
01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:04.760 align:start position:0%
as Secretary of State and was sworn in
 
01:41:08.550 --> 01:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
as Governor now can we ever really know
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
whether Kemp's massive voter Purge
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
resulted in his victory of course not
 
01:41:15.629 --> 01:41:15.639 align:start position:0%
but with such a small margin of Victory
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
I'd say it's reasonable to
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
wonder the situation in Georgia in 2018
 
01:41:23.629 --> 01:41:23.639 align:start position:0%
called into question the legitimacy of
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
its elections and those concerns
 
01:41:28.430 --> 01:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
certainly carried over into
 
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
2020 you see a state's election
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
Integrity is like a person's
 
01:41:34.709 --> 01:41:34.719 align:start position:0%
trustworthiness you're either you're
 
01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:36.920 align:start position:0%
either a trustworthy individual or you
 
01:41:39.550 --> 01:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
are not just like it's difficult to
 
01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:42.159 align:start position:0%
establish trust but extremely easy to
 
01:41:44.750 --> 01:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
lose it it's easy for a state's election
 
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:47.360 align:start position:0%
Integrity to become damaged and that
 
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
damage can be permanent secretary
 
01:41:52.149 --> 01:41:52.159 align:start position:0%
Gardner knows this and that's why his
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
Focus has always been on Election
 
01:41:55.950 --> 01:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
Integrity in New
 
01:41:58.350 --> 01:41:58.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire also consider that our first
 
01:42:00.750 --> 01:42:00.760 align:start position:0%
the nation status is under attack every
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
four years if something like what
 
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
happened in Georgia were to happen here
 
01:42:07.950 --> 01:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
well we can kiss our first the nation
 
01:42:10.790 --> 01:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
status goodbye it would provide critics
 
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
of the New Hampshire primary the perfect
 
01:42:15.350 --> 01:42:15.360 align:start position:0%
argument for why we should no longer be
 
01:42:18.070 --> 01:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
first New Hampshire hasn't had issues
 
01:42:20.430 --> 01:42:20.440 align:start position:0%
like these because secretary Gardner who
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
has served as our secretary of state for
 
01:42:23.790 --> 01:42:23.800 align:start position:0%
44 years
 
01:42:25.470 --> 01:42:25.480 align:start position:0%
has never viewed his office as a
 
01:42:27.910 --> 01:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
stepping stone but we have no way to
 
01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:30.280 align:start position:0%
know whether our next secretary of state
 
01:42:33.149 --> 01:42:33.159 align:start position:0%
will be like secretary Garder I also
 
01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
think it's important to point out that
 
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
now is the best time to pass something
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
like this because we have a long serving
 
01:42:42.550 --> 01:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State who as far as I can
 
01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
tell has no interest in running for
 
01:42:47.149 --> 01:42:47.159 align:start position:0%
governor or any other office and if we
 
01:42:49.109 --> 01:42:49.119 align:start position:0%
wait for a new individual to take the
 
01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:51.040 align:start position:0%
office then it would seem like we're
 
01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:53.719 align:start position:0%
targeting that person and the issue
 
01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
becomes a lot more political I think we
 
01:42:58.910 --> 01:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
want to avoid the politicization of the
 
01:43:01.350 --> 01:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office and with
 
01:43:03.030 --> 01:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
that I conclude my testimony and I'm
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
committee thank you representative are

Corrections good morning honorable
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
Helen Hanks I'm the commissioner of the
 
01:46:24.109 --> 01:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
department of Corrections I'm here in
 
01:46:25.870 --> 01:46:25.880 align:start position:0%
conquered New Hampshire in my office by
 
01:46:28.589 --> 01:46:28.599 align:start position:0%
myself for the record I thank the
 
01:46:30.229 --> 01:46:30.239 align:start position:0%
members of the legislature and helping
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
us sponsor this piece that's brought
 
01:46:35.550 --> 01:46:35.560 align:start position:0%
before you today uh one area of our
 
01:46:38.310 --> 01:46:38.320 align:start position:0%
department really less discussed is our
 
01:46:42.350 --> 01:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
Collections Unit that Collections Unit
 
01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
um works with about 13,000 individuals
 
01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:48.080 align:start position:0%
who are in what's called collection only
 
01:46:50.910 --> 01:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
status and by our fine state laws that
 
01:46:53.870 --> 01:46:53.880 align:start position:0%
group has to collect fines fees and
 
01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
restitution owed to victims and
 
01:46:59.709 --> 01:46:59.719 align:start position:0%
survivors of crime so when individuals
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know finish they their supervised
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
sentence they can then be put on
 
01:47:07.550 --> 01:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
collection only uh in testimony that I
 
01:47:11.189 --> 01:47:11.199 align:start position:0%
did email it shows you that we have that
 
01:47:14.350 --> 01:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
13,000 individuals it is one area that
 
01:47:16.430 --> 01:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
in my time as commissioner I found that
 
01:47:19.109 --> 01:47:19.119 align:start position:0%
we do not have a sufficient data set to
 
01:47:21.709 --> 01:47:21.719 align:start position:0%
understand and to do an effective job
 
01:47:23.470 --> 01:47:23.480 align:start position:0%
when people get married change their
 
01:47:25.550 --> 01:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
name and the key part is again these
 
01:47:27.790 --> 01:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
people are not under our supervision so
 
01:47:29.470 --> 01:47:29.480 align:start position:0%
you might intuitively say well don't you
 
01:47:31.510 --> 01:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
know where they live well we knew where
 
01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
they last lived and if they move or get
 
01:47:37.629 --> 01:47:37.639 align:start position:0%
married or for that matter if they die
 
01:47:40.109 --> 01:47:40.119 align:start position:0%
we don't have a consistent data set and
 
01:47:43.189 --> 01:47:43.199 align:start position:0%
so in reviewing our statutes I found uh
 
01:47:46.270 --> 01:47:46.280 align:start position:0%
this section of law that allows uh an
 
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
potential for a memorandum of
 
01:47:49.390 --> 01:47:49.400 align:start position:0%
understanding between the Secretary of
 
01:47:52.030 --> 01:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
State's office we are asking just for a
 
01:47:54.109 --> 01:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
data Limited set for people who are
 
01:47:56.430 --> 01:47:56.440 align:start position:0%
under collection only we want to make
 
01:47:58.270 --> 01:47:58.280 align:start position:0%
that clear we don't need information
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
about anybody else but just to really
 
01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:04.119 align:start position:0%
work to have clean data the opportunity
 
01:48:05.589 --> 01:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
again to collect that ongoing
 
01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:07.719 align:start position:0%
restitution for individuals who are
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
affected by crime in New Hampshire um we
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
collected last year just over $2
 
01:48:16.430 --> 01:48:16.440 align:start position:0%
million at this point we've collected
 
01:48:20.709 --> 01:48:20.719 align:start position:0%
about $1.4 million in state fiscal year
 
01:48:23.629 --> 01:48:23.639 align:start position:0%
2021 um I did include in the testimony
 
01:48:25.030 --> 01:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
that'll be shared with you that section
 
01:48:27.790 --> 01:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
of Statute that requires us to do this
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
and certainly Avail myself for any
 
01:48:35.830 --> 01:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:37.629 --> 01:48:37.639 align:start position:0%
committee thank you are there any
 
01:48:44.189 --> 01:48:44.199 align:start position:0%

of the committee I'm David scanlin
 
01:49:52.430 --> 01:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state um just would
 
01:49:54.350 --> 01:49:54.360 align:start position:0%
like to inform the committee that the
 
01:49:57.550 --> 01:49:57.560 align:start position:0%
division of Vital Records is a division
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh under the Secretary of State uh we're
 
01:50:02.950 --> 01:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
charged with the collection of uh
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
collecting Vital Records um under RSA
 
01:50:11.510 --> 01:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
5-c uh we are uh given the
 
01:50:13.669 --> 01:50:13.679 align:start position:0%
responsibility of making sure that the
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
data that we collect is private and
 
01:50:20.189 --> 01:50:20.199 align:start position:0%
confidential uh we share the entire data
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
set with the Department of Health and
 
01:50:23.830 --> 01:50:23.840 align:start position:0%
Human Services
 
01:50:26.990 --> 01:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh so that they can use it for research
 
01:50:29.430 --> 01:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
um following Health Trends you know
 
01:50:30.870 --> 01:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
certainly the information that's
 
01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
collected uh in Vital Records is
 
01:50:35.550 --> 01:50:35.560 align:start position:0%
important to tracking the the pandemic
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
that we're currently going
 
01:50:41.229 --> 01:50:41.239 align:start position:0%
through um there is also limited use to
 
01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:43.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire retirement system so
 
01:50:48.430 --> 01:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
that they can locate uh Heirs of uh of
 
01:50:50.390 --> 01:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh members of the state retirement
 
01:50:52.750 --> 01:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
system to make sure that uh you know
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
they can uh you know receive proceeds
 
01:50:58.270 --> 01:50:58.280 align:start position:0%
from a retiree if there are any left
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
over in terms of what the Department of
 
01:51:03.550 --> 01:51:03.560 align:start position:0%
Corrections is asking this is probably
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
the first time that there has been a
 
01:51:10.229 --> 01:51:10.239 align:start position:0%
request of data from Vital Records so
 
01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:51:15.870 --> 01:51:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh fees uh and collections can be made
 
01:51:18.870 --> 01:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
of individuals in the state so I will
 
01:51:20.109 --> 01:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
leave it up to the committee to
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
determine whether that's good policy or
 
01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
not but if you choose to do that uh I
 
01:51:27.709 --> 01:51:27.719 align:start position:0%
would suggest that on page one of the
 
01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
bill line
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
11 which is under the the RSA 5c where
 
01:51:36.310 --> 01:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
it says the Department of Corrections
 
01:51:38.589 --> 01:51:38.599 align:start position:0%
shall have access
 
01:51:42.069 --> 01:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
to uh I would recommend adding in a
 
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
limited set of and then continue vital
 
01:51:48.270 --> 01:51:48.280 align:start position:0%
records information in accordance with
 
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
the provisions of RSA 21-h
 
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.270 align:start position:0%
the provisions of RSA 21-h
colon

01:51:54.270 --> 01:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
colon
 
01:51:56.990 --> 01:51:57.000 align:start position:0%
8 common Roman numeral
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
11-c which is the Department of
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
Correction statute um that's just to
 
01:52:04.270 --> 01:52:04.280 align:start position:0%
make it clear in both sets that in in
 
01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
both uh statutes relating to vital
 
01:52:09.229 --> 01:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
records and Corrections that what's
 
01:52:12.589 --> 01:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
being requested is a limited set of
 
01:52:12.599 --> 01:52:14.149 align:start position:0%
being requested is a limited set of
information

01:52:14.149 --> 01:52:14.159 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:52:17.390 --> 01:52:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh limited to the uh information that
 
01:52:20.510 --> 01:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
would be necessary for corrections to
 
01:52:24.629 --> 01:52:24.639 align:start position:0%
fulfill the the function that uh uh
 
01:52:26.390 --> 01:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
corresponds with the policy that you
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
determine uh is beneficial to the state
 
01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
and with that I would be happy to answer
 
01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:33.310 align:start position:0%
and with that I would be happy to answer
any

01:52:33.310 --> 01:52:33.320 align:start position:0%
any

privacy board as you know um and um we
 
01:53:20.470 --> 01:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
are very scrupulous in
 
01:53:24.390 --> 01:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
our in our monitoring of requests for
 
01:53:28.430 --> 01:53:28.440 align:start position:0%
data uh that the state gathers and and
 
01:53:30.069 --> 01:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
maintains um for necessary needs and
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
also uh for providing opportunities to
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
study for statistical purposes um but
 
01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
this is a similar type of situation in a
 
01:53:48.790 --> 01:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
way uh and I'm wondering whether you
 
01:53:53.069 --> 01:53:53.079 align:start position:0%
have any reservations about uh uh the
 
01:53:59.589 --> 01:53:59.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
misuse Mr chair I I don't know if that
 
01:54:04.030 --> 01:54:04.040 align:start position:0%
question was directed at me I had a
 
01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
little it was it was directed at you
 
01:54:09.149 --> 01:54:09.159 align:start position:0%
David okay uh thank you
 
01:54:14.109 --> 01:54:14.119 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt I uh you know I I
 
01:54:16.430 --> 01:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
I know the the operational Corrections
 
01:54:20.189 --> 01:54:20.199 align:start position:0%
is topnotch and and I am not concerned
 
01:54:22.990 --> 01:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
about misuse of information and you know
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
we would certainly tie down the details
 
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
of that in the memorandum of
 
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
understanding uh just as we have done
 
01:54:31.950 --> 01:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Health and Human
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
Services um the the the only issue that
 
01:54:38.069 --> 01:54:38.079 align:start position:0%
I have is you know again a matter of
 
01:54:41.270 --> 01:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
policy and that is should this data be
 
01:54:45.550 --> 01:54:45.560 align:start position:0%
used uh to collect from uh citizens of
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire and you know
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
right now that my understanding is that
 
01:54:53.669 --> 01:54:53.679 align:start position:0%
all of the data that we have is uh in
 
01:54:55.510 --> 01:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
that division is limited to
 
01:54:58.550 --> 01:54:58.560 align:start position:0%
research um whether it's uh you know
 
01:55:01.709 --> 01:55:01.719 align:start position:0%
medical research or Academia um none of
 
01:55:03.589 --> 01:55:03.599 align:start position:0%
the information that I'm aware of in
 
01:55:06.669 --> 01:55:06.679 align:start position:0%
there is used to go after citizens uh to
 
01:55:09.069 --> 01:55:09.079 align:start position:0%
collect payments that may be do the
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire so um as I
 
01:55:14.589 --> 01:55:14.599 align:start position:0%
understand this request that would be a
 
01:55:16.229 --> 01:55:16.239 align:start position:0%
fairly fundamental change in how that
 
01:55:20.229 --> 01:55:20.239 align:start position:0%
data is used followup Madam chair go
 
01:55:20.239 --> 01:55:22.510 align:start position:0%
data is used followup Madam chair go
ahead

01:55:22.510 --> 01:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
01:55:28.950 --> 01:55:28.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman sorry um uh so um is there
 
01:55:31.109 --> 01:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
we I think we all recognize that there
 
01:55:35.870 --> 01:55:35.880 align:start position:0%
is a need uh for uh some state agency to
 
01:55:38.550 --> 01:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
be able to Monitor and
 
01:55:42.430 --> 01:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
administer uh the uh the obtaining of
 
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
data uh for the purpose of uh making
 
01:55:49.830 --> 01:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
restitution as this bill uh clearly uh
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
targets uh is there any other way of
 
01:55:56.350 --> 01:55:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:59.270 --> 01:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge that's
 
01:56:02.910 --> 01:56:02.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable represent I I'm not aware of
 
01:56:08.430 --> 01:56:08.440 align:start position:0%

spell Mr chairman seeing that there's no
 
01:56:32.990 --> 01:56:33.000 align:start position:0%

01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to ask a question I do
 
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%

Hampshire is unique in that in most
 
01:57:12.629 --> 01:57:12.639 align:start position:0%
other states the division of final

assuring him that it had in fact been
 
03:47:07.550 --> 03:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
combined in an Omnibus it was vetoed and
 
03:47:09.990 --> 03:47:10.000 align:start position:0%
the veto was not
 
03:47:12.670 --> 03:47:12.680 align:start position:0%

uh spoke at the house session that we
 
03:47:21.550 --> 03:47:21.560 align:start position:0%

591
 
03:48:14.429 --> 03:48:14.439 align:start position:0%
591 05 no the amendment number is 0116
 
03:48:20.610 --> 03:48:20.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:20.620 --> 03:48:23.710 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:48:23.710 --> 03:48:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:26.870 --> 03:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
H Madame chair representative O'Brien
 
03:48:31.710 --> 03:48:31.720 align:start position:0%
may I question the chair sure uh I was
 
03:48:34.870 --> 03:48:34.880 align:start position:0%
inquiring as to the procedure that the
 
03:48:38.070 --> 03:48:38.080 align:start position:0%
chair wants to follow it seems that we
 
03:48:41.790 --> 03:48:41.800 align:start position:0%
had opened up an executive session on
 
03:48:47.469 --> 03:48:47.479 align:start position:0%
274 uh it was voted and therefore uh
 
03:48:50.349 --> 03:48:50.359 align:start position:0%
another alternative motion is uh
 
03:48:53.030 --> 03:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
eligible to be made and should we not
 
03:48:55.950 --> 03:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
representative representative o'ri I'll
 
03:48:58.990 --> 03:48:59.000 align:start position:0%
yield yes Madam chair I know that know
 
03:49:01.590 --> 03:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
that is true and I am choosing to deal
 
03:49:05.070 --> 03:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
with House Bill 591 first all right
 
03:49:08.990 --> 03:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:11.910 --> 03:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
chair Madam chair what was the amendment
 
03:49:18.790 --> 03:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:24.750 --> 03:49:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:27.670 --> 03:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment which I sent out again after
 
03:49:29.790 --> 03:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
we uh after the
 
03:49:32.710 --> 03:49:32.720 align:start position:0%
hearing yes I I do have it I just wanted
 
03:49:36.469 --> 03:49:36.479 align:start position:0%
to be sure I was uh looking at the right
 
03:49:39.429 --> 03:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
one the the reason I'm proposing the
 
03:49:43.030 --> 03:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
abrami amendment is that it pro it fixes
 
03:49:48.510 --> 03:49:48.520 align:start position:0%
a problem with the bill as written where
 
03:49:52.149 --> 03:49:52.159 align:start position:0%
tobacco um where establishments with
 
03:49:54.750 --> 03:49:54.760 align:start position:0%
both tobacco and alcohol licenses were
 
03:49:56.149 --> 03:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
getting charged
 
03:49:59.070 --> 03:49:59.080 align:start position:0%
double what it what the amendment does
 
03:50:03.550 --> 03:50:03.560 align:start position:0%
it establishes a gradated tobacco only
 
03:50:07.790 --> 03:50:07.800 align:start position:0%
license at the same price as a alcohol
 
03:50:10.110 --> 03:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
license that is so much for one register
 
03:50:12.189 --> 03:50:12.199 align:start position:0%
so much for three four registers that
 
03:50:15.630 --> 03:50:15.640 align:start position:0%
sort of thing uh so that the
 
03:50:18.710 --> 03:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
the fees are parallel to those for
 
03:50:25.349 --> 03:50:25.359 align:start position:0%
alcohol because and that that's um seems
 
03:50:25.359 --> 03:50:28.189 align:start position:0%
alcohol because and that that's um seems
appropriate

03:50:28.189 --> 03:50:28.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
03:50:32.550 --> 03:50:32.560 align:start position:0%
uh it leaves in
 
03:50:32.560 --> 03:50:34.269 align:start position:0%
uh it leaves in
the

03:50:34.269 --> 03:50:34.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:50:39.710 --> 03:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
um investigators check confirm
 
03:50:43.110 --> 03:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
that uh it has examiners rather than
 
03:50:45.590 --> 03:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
investigators which are l less
 
03:50:48.469 --> 03:50:48.479 align:start position:0%
expensive and while I'm not entirely
 
03:50:50.630 --> 03:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
sure they need them I'm willing to pass
 
03:50:52.309 --> 03:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
it over
 
03:50:56.229 --> 03:50:56.239 align:start position:0%
to pass this amendment and let Ways and
 
03:50:59.710 --> 03:50:59.720 align:start position:0%
Means deal with it because we're
 
03:51:03.670 --> 03:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
not I didn't understand why they were
 
03:51:07.189 --> 03:51:07.199 align:start position:0%
they wanted more investigators or
 
03:51:07.199 --> 03:51:10.309 align:start position:0%
they wanted more investigators or
inspectors

03:51:10.309 --> 03:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:12.630 --> 03:51:12.640 align:start position:0%
and so it's
 
03:51:16.910 --> 03:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:18.590 --> 03:51:18.600 align:start position:0%
representative Roy you wish to speak on
 
03:51:21.590 --> 03:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
your second no I would just endorse what
 
03:51:25.950 --> 03:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
you said does anyone else wish to speak
 
03:51:28.269 --> 03:51:28.279 align:start position:0%
there's a hand that that is
 
03:51:31.349 --> 03:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
representative Shu representative
 
03:51:34.990 --> 03:51:35.000 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you yes um I'm in agreement
 
03:51:35.000 --> 03:51:35.990 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you yes um I'm in agreement
with

03:51:35.990 --> 03:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:51:40.229 --> 03:51:40.239 align:start position:0%
the person that deals with fees but I am
 
03:51:42.630 --> 03:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
not in agreement with the portion of the
 
03:51:46.389 --> 03:51:46.399 align:start position:0%
amendment changes those titles from
 
03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
investigators to
 
03:51:51.229 --> 03:51:51.239 align:start position:0%
examiners um we heard from
 
03:51:55.149 --> 03:51:55.159 align:start position:0%
testimony during the hearing that um
 
03:51:59.630 --> 03:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
number one The Examiner position does
 
03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
not have the same Authority if they find
 
03:52:07.309 --> 03:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
uh inequities um problems when they're
 
03:52:08.550 --> 03:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
doing an
 
03:52:11.590 --> 03:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
examination they don't the immediate
 
03:52:13.630 --> 03:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
right to take action that an
 
03:52:16.349 --> 03:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
investigator would would and there was
 
03:52:19.149 --> 03:52:19.159 align:start position:0%
expressed a fear that evidence could be
 
03:52:23.070 --> 03:52:23.080 align:start position:0%
lost between the time of an examination
 
03:52:26.870 --> 03:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
and investigator coming to the scene uh
 
03:52:30.110 --> 03:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
that's a major concern to me I think um
 
03:52:32.710 --> 03:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
obviously if that kind of thing happens
 
03:52:35.670 --> 03:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
we're losing Revenue um that's the
 
03:52:35.680 --> 03:52:36.710 align:start position:0%
we're losing Revenue um that's the
likely

03:52:36.710 --> 03:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
likely
 
03:52:40.870 --> 03:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
outcome um and so if there was a chance
 
03:52:44.149 --> 03:52:44.159 align:start position:0%
that the amendment could be redrafted so
 
03:52:47.309 --> 03:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
that would cover the fees but not change
 
03:52:50.870 --> 03:52:50.880 align:start position:0%
those titles I would be in
 
03:52:53.830 --> 03:52:53.840 align:start position:0%
favor I went with the
 
03:52:58.070 --> 03:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
investigators because I believe
 
03:53:01.469 --> 03:53:01.479 align:start position:0%
that from what I heard at the hearing
 
03:53:05.030 --> 03:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
the exam the investigators are necessary
 
03:53:07.110 --> 03:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
if there is an issue of criminal
 
03:53:07.120 --> 03:53:08.830 align:start position:0%
if there is an issue of criminal
Behavior

03:53:08.830 --> 03:53:08.840 align:start position:0%
Behavior
 
03:53:08.840 --> 03:53:11.950 align:start position:0%
Behavior
the

03:53:11.950 --> 03:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:16.110 --> 03:53:16.120 align:start position:0%
um the examiners are for financial
 
03:53:20.510 --> 03:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
misconduct or or errors or omissions and
 
03:53:24.309 --> 03:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
in my experience uh errors and omissions
 
03:53:26.990 --> 03:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
and financial
 
03:53:29.910 --> 03:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh poor recordkeeping is much more
 
03:53:32.389 --> 03:53:32.399 align:start position:0%
likely than criminal Behavior but you're
 
03:53:34.950 --> 03:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
entitled to your your position on this I
 
03:53:42.469 --> 03:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:46.469 --> 03:53:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:49.670 --> 03:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
yes uh if I may speak representative
 
03:53:54.149 --> 03:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
O'Brian uh I too have some concerns with
 
03:53:56.630 --> 03:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
this I think if we look at what
 
03:54:00.510 --> 03:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
determines a sworn officer uh and
 
03:54:01.990 --> 03:54:02.000 align:start position:0%
basically I think the liquor
 
03:54:04.389 --> 03:54:04.399 align:start position:0%
commissioner offices do have full power
 
03:54:07.469 --> 03:54:07.479 align:start position:0%
and authority as Swan officers within
 
03:54:09.710 --> 03:54:09.720 align:start position:0%
the state in the Hamshire the other
 
03:54:13.070 --> 03:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
thing to consider here is also I think
 
03:54:16.510 --> 03:54:16.520 align:start position:0%
if I have it right which is Linda's law
 
03:54:19.349 --> 03:54:19.359 align:start position:0%
in other words a sworn officer cannot be
 
03:54:22.990 --> 03:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
a false testimony in court to any type
 
03:54:26.110 --> 03:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
of infraction and if that does occur
 
03:54:29.070 --> 03:54:29.080 align:start position:0%
then that officer jeopardizes his career
 
03:54:32.149 --> 03:54:32.159 align:start position:0%
and on top of it jeopardizes his
 
03:54:35.630 --> 03:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
credibility when you have officers such
 
03:54:38.990 --> 03:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
as this who are not completely sworn
 
03:54:42.389 --> 03:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
offices it could cause some I think
 
03:54:45.389 --> 03:54:45.399 align:start position:0%
future problems that the testimony given
 
03:54:48.309 --> 03:54:48.319 align:start position:0%
by these particular people are they held
 
03:54:51.269 --> 03:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
to the same standards as we are as a
 
03:54:53.550 --> 03:54:53.560 align:start position:0%
state are holding the swan officers
 
03:54:57.550 --> 03:54:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:07.670 --> 03:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:10.990 --> 03:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
speak are you saying something no
 
03:55:15.950 --> 03:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
no the uh in that case the motion is to
 
03:55:18.630 --> 03:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
pass the abrami
 
03:55:18.640 --> 03:55:20.950 align:start position:0%

Second Amendment is
 
03:58:15.269 --> 03:58:15.279 align:start position:0%
0180 it's the one that I brought to the
 
03:58:19.030 --> 03:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
hearing okay eliminates the positions
 
03:58:22.269 --> 03:58:22.279 align:start position:0%
entirely okay but um I'm sorry this is
 
03:58:24.389 --> 03:58:24.399 align:start position:0%
the first time I see two
 
03:58:26.710 --> 03:58:26.720 align:start position:0%
amendments and on one
 
03:58:29.710 --> 03:58:29.720 align:start position:0%
bill I don't know if I'm mistaken or
 
03:58:32.750 --> 03:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
what yes it doesn't happen very often
 
03:58:34.870 --> 03:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
but we C but if the amendments are
 
03:58:37.590 --> 03:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
compatible we can apply two of them and
 
03:58:40.830 --> 03:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
they will be combined by OS into the
 
03:58:42.389 --> 03:58:42.399 align:start position:0%
final committee
 
03:58:47.229 --> 03:58:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:49.950 --> 03:58:49.960 align:start position:0%
chair person leus do you wish to speak
 
03:58:51.030 --> 03:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
to your
 
03:58:57.110 --> 03:58:57.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh I do um basically it's it's
 
03:59:00.189 --> 03:59:00.199 align:start position:0%
not clear there's really a need for uh
 
03:59:02.469 --> 03:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
any additional staff for this I mean
 
03:59:05.630 --> 03:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
there already there's already licensing
 
03:59:08.710 --> 03:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
and staff to enforce that for both
 
03:59:10.070 --> 03:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
alcohol and
 
03:59:12.429 --> 03:59:12.439 align:start position:0%
tobacco and at least from what I heard
 
03:59:15.750 --> 03:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
from the uh the hearing it didn't seem
 
03:59:17.950 --> 03:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
like there'd be a great deal more work
 
03:59:23.149 --> 03:59:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:26.030 --> 03:59:26.040 align:start position:0%
bill Madame speak Madam uh chairman can
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
I can I ask a a a clarifying question
 
03:59:32.309 --> 03:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
yes Pam I'm looking at the amendment
 
03:59:37.429 --> 03:59:37.439 align:start position:0%
that you um just adopted and it has a SE
 
03:59:40.469 --> 03:59:40.479 align:start position:0%
two sections that deal with funding um
 
03:59:43.349 --> 03:59:43.359 align:start position:0%
with with the positions sections 11 and
 
03:59:43.359 --> 03:59:45.189 align:start position:0%
with with the positions sections 11 and
12

03:59:45.189 --> 03:59:45.199 align:start position:0%
12
 
03:59:47.590 --> 03:59:47.600 align:start position:0%
and the the amendment that you're
 
03:59:49.750 --> 03:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
discussing right now says that
 
03:59:52.550 --> 03:59:52.560 align:start position:0%
everything after section 11 shall be
 
03:59:56.950 --> 03:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
replaced with just the um effective date
 
03:59:59.429 --> 03:59:59.439 align:start position:0%
right so it repeals the sections 11 and
 
04:00:02.630 --> 04:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
12 it only repeals section
 
04:00:07.710 --> 04:00:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:12.670 --> 04:00:12.680 align:start position:0%
11 you're so right that was foolish of
 
04:00:15.590 --> 04:00:15.600 align:start position:0%
me I think I think the Amendment added
 
04:00:17.670 --> 04:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
some some a new section and changed the
 
04:00:20.750 --> 04:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
numbering and and so I I think it's you
 
04:00:22.950 --> 04:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
know you can fix it but I'm not positive
 
04:00:26.269 --> 04:00:26.279 align:start position:0%
it's clear with this amendment all right
 
04:00:31.189 --> 04:00:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:33.910 --> 04:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
days no the difference is that the
 
04:00:37.269 --> 04:00:37.279 align:start position:0%
amendment says repeal section after
 
04:00:40.670 --> 04:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
section 11 which in the original bill
 
04:00:43.990 --> 04:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
was the positions in the funding for if
 
04:00:47.149 --> 04:00:47.159 align:start position:0%
in the bill as amended it's only the
 
04:00:49.070 --> 04:00:49.080 align:start position:0%
funding I don't have it in front of me
 
04:00:53.110 --> 04:00:53.120 align:start position:0%
but I thought 11 changed also 60
 
04:00:57.309 --> 04:00:57.319 align:start position:0%
days 11 it's this second Amendment only
 
04:01:00.910 --> 04:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
deals with sections after 11 could this
 
04:01:03.269 --> 04:01:03.279 align:start position:0%
be a technical cleanup that that all us
 
04:01:05.469 --> 04:01:05.479 align:start position:0%
would do when combining them is that
 
04:01:08.790 --> 04:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
legitimate or uh I think we're getting
 
04:01:10.590 --> 04:01:10.600 align:start position:0%
to the point where it's it's not
 
04:01:13.110 --> 04:01:13.120 align:start position:0%
legitimate so I I think we're going to
 
04:01:15.189 --> 04:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
have to vote down this
 
04:01:15.199 --> 04:01:17.750 align:start position:0%
have to vote down this
Amendment

04:01:17.750 --> 04:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
04:01:20.189 --> 04:01:20.199 align:start position:0%
sorry madam chair can't the amendment
 
04:01:21.550 --> 04:01:21.560 align:start position:0%
just be
 
04:01:23.590 --> 04:01:23.600 align:start position:0%
withdrawn it could that would save us
 
04:01:23.600 --> 04:01:25.149 align:start position:0%
withdrawn it could that would save us
the

04:01:25.149 --> 04:01:25.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:01:28.149 --> 04:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
bother all right I I'll withdraw my
 
04:01:30.870 --> 04:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
motion fine we will withdraw the
 
04:01:34.750 --> 04:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:45.590 --> 04:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:50.110 --> 04:01:50.120 align:start position:0%
so representative Shu if you wish I I
 
04:01:52.510 --> 04:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
think we should should stop now we're
 
04:01:54.670 --> 04:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
we're feeding ourselves over the head
 
04:01:56.309 --> 04:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
representative shuid if you wish to
 
04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
redraft the amendment to call for the
 
04:02:03.309 --> 04:02:03.319 align:start position:0%
investigators rather than the
 
04:02:06.750 --> 04:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
examiners uh we can discuss that when we
 
04:02:08.550 --> 04:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
get back on this I don't think we can
 
04:02:09.910 --> 04:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
finish this
 
04:02:13.550 --> 04:02:13.560 align:start position:0%
today all right so we we've passed an
 
04:02:16.309 --> 04:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
amendment and it's just hanging there
 
04:02:18.189 --> 04:02:18.199 align:start position:0%
right I think we're I think we're just
 
04:02:19.790 --> 04:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
kind of hanging at this
 
04:02:23.349 --> 04:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
point the status is we're going to
 
04:02:26.550 --> 04:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
recess with the amendment passed correct
 
04:02:29.269 --> 04:02:29.279 align:start position:0%
okay to confirm we're recessing this
 
04:02:32.189 --> 04:02:32.199 align:start position:0%
executive session after passing that the
 
04:02:34.309 --> 04:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
do we have do we have a couple
 
04:02:36.110 --> 04:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
minutes yeah
 
04:02:46.310 --> 04:02:46.320 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:02:50.510 --> 04:02:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:52.790 --> 04:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
the amendment is passed and my
 
04:02:55.070 --> 04:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
discussion should have been at that time
 
04:02:56.269 --> 04:02:56.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it should have been I
 
04:02:58.429 --> 04:02:58.439 align:start position:0%
didn't want to make a discussion but
 
04:03:01.790 --> 04:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
it's disappointing to me because I want
 
04:03:05.469 --> 04:03:05.479 align:start position:0%
very much to work with people on this
 
04:03:07.990 --> 04:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
this is not this does not reflect how
 
04:03:10.269 --> 04:03:10.279 align:start position:0%
the real world works there's not going
 
04:03:12.389 --> 04:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
to be a loss of evidence nobody gets
 
04:03:14.110 --> 04:03:14.120 align:start position:0%
arrested on the spot you know need a
 
04:03:17.670 --> 04:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
sworn officer go to an IRS audit and if
 
04:03:20.189 --> 04:03:20.199 align:start position:0%
they invest find criminal activity the
 
04:03:22.750 --> 04:03:22.760 align:start position:0%
guy doesn't lock you up then that's just
 
04:03:22.760 --> 04:03:23.830 align:start position:0%
guy doesn't lock you up then that's just
not

04:03:23.830 --> 04:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:03:27.030 --> 04:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
realistic uh I don't understand the
 
04:03:30.830 --> 04:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
motivation why it has to be in well I do
 
04:03:33.349 --> 04:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
understand a motivation why it might be
 
04:03:36.510 --> 04:03:36.520 align:start position:0%
investigators rather than examiners and
 
04:03:37.510 --> 04:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm
 
04:03:37.520 --> 04:03:39.790 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm
unhappy

04:03:39.790 --> 04:03:39.800 align:start position:0%
unhappy
 
04:03:43.950 --> 04:03:43.960 align:start position:0%
that that be has become a sticking point
 
04:03:55.469 --> 04:03:55.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:58.630 --> 04:03:58.640 align:start position:0%

yes I I would just want to respond to my
 
04:04:11.349 --> 04:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
honorable friend from Salem that that
 
04:04:13.429 --> 04:04:13.439 align:start position:0%
was part of the testimony we did hear
 
04:04:15.269 --> 04:04:15.279 align:start position:0%
that evidence would be lost I asked
 
04:04:16.990 --> 04:04:17.000 align:start position:0%
specifically on a question and the
 
04:04:20.469 --> 04:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
difference between examiners and ex uh
 
04:04:22.670 --> 04:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
investigators and that was a testimony
 
04:04:24.710 --> 04:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
from from the Department that evidence
 
04:04:26.269 --> 04:04:26.279 align:start position:0%
could be lost so I just want to remind
 
04:04:31.229 --> 04:04:31.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:35.389 --> 04:04:35.399 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you thank

you later wor I think that was indicated
 
04:04:42.670 --> 04:04:42.680 align:start position:0%
as a possible worst case scenario but it
 
04:04:49.950 --> 04:04:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:52.990 --> 04:04:53.000 align:start position:0%

just for planning purposes what's the
 
04:13:58.750 --> 04:13:58.760 align:start position:0%

the committee I'm Carol Maguire
 
04:14:39.229 --> 04:14:39.239 align:start position:0%
representing marac 29 which is
 
04:14:42.109 --> 04:14:42.119 align:start position:0%
Allenstown Epsom and Pittsfield and
 
04:14:45.790 --> 04:14:45.800 align:start position:0%
House Bill one 37 exempts from the
 
04:14:47.710 --> 04:14:47.720 align:start position:0%
normal rulle making
 
04:14:50.389 --> 04:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
process standards and protocols for
 
04:14:53.349 --> 04:14:53.359 align:start position:0%
information technology telephones and
 
04:14:53.359 --> 04:14:55.510 align:start position:0%
information technology telephones and
cyber

04:14:55.510 --> 04:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
cyber
 
04:14:58.269 --> 04:14:58.279 align:start position:0%
security this is not because these
 
04:15:01.030 --> 04:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
things don't need to be approved it's
 
04:15:02.630 --> 04:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
because putting them in the proper
 
04:15:05.030 --> 04:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
format for rulle making would make them
 
04:15:07.830 --> 04:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
totally unintelligible to the regulated
 
04:15:10.590 --> 04:15:10.600 align:start position:0%
Community which is against the the point
 
04:15:14.990 --> 04:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
of Ru making uh these these protocols
 
04:15:17.790 --> 04:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
and standards are
 
04:15:20.229 --> 04:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
um developed by the department of
 
04:15:20.239 --> 04:15:21.349 align:start position:0%
um developed by the department of
Information

04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
Information
 
04:15:24.269 --> 04:15:24.279 align:start position:0%
Technology the state the information
 
04:15:26.309 --> 04:15:26.319 align:start position:0%
technology which consists of most of the
 
04:15:29.070 --> 04:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
other agencies that use
 
04:15:32.630 --> 04:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
technology uh work on them um and
 
04:15:35.910 --> 04:15:35.920 align:start position:0%
approved by them not approved they are
 
04:15:38.830 --> 04:15:38.840 align:start position:0%
consult with them so that these
 
04:15:41.070 --> 04:15:41.080 align:start position:0%
standards are
 
04:15:45.109 --> 04:15:45.119 align:start position:0%
in an understand and appropriate
 
04:15:51.100 --> 04:15:51.110 align:start position:0%

[Music]

04:15:52.790 --> 04:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:15:56.389 --> 04:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
can does anyone have any questions yes I
 
04:15:59.590 --> 04:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
have a question uh proceed thank you so
 
04:16:02.830 --> 04:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
much um representative Maguire can you
 
04:16:05.590 --> 04:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
please give me an example of I think I
 
04:16:07.670 --> 04:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
know what you're trying to say but I'm
 
04:16:11.389 --> 04:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
having a hard time um you know using an
 
04:16:14.109 --> 04:16:14.119 align:start position:0%
example can you give us an example of
 
04:16:14.119 --> 04:16:15.070 align:start position:0%
example can you give us an example of
what

04:16:15.070 --> 04:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:16:18.189 --> 04:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
rule the um would be involved and how it
 
04:16:20.830 --> 04:16:20.840 align:start position:0%
would be difficult to put it in rule
 
04:16:23.550 --> 04:16:23.560 align:start position:0%
making is that is my
 
04:16:27.429 --> 04:16:27.439 align:start position:0%
question sort of I I it's how it would
 
04:16:30.790 --> 04:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
be difficult to understand the correct
 
04:16:32.750 --> 04:16:32.760 align:start position:0%
the thing is that our Ru making format
 
04:16:36.429 --> 04:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
is prescribed by the manual and it's got
 
04:16:39.750 --> 04:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
a very explicit format on how rules are
 
04:16:42.389 --> 04:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
to be laid out and it's developed by
 
04:16:42.399 --> 04:16:43.630 align:start position:0%
to be laid out and it's developed by
lawyers

04:16:43.630 --> 04:16:43.640 align:start position:0%
lawyers
 
04:16:47.990 --> 04:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
the people who use these uh standards
 
04:16:51.990 --> 04:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
and Protocols are primarily engineers
 
04:16:53.830 --> 04:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
and it's very difficult to find somebody
 
04:16:55.830 --> 04:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
who who speaks both
 
04:16:55.840 --> 04:16:58.030 align:start position:0%
who who speaks both
languages

04:16:58.030 --> 04:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
languages
 
04:17:01.910 --> 04:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh also it's not clear that the cyber
 
04:17:06.830 --> 04:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:06.840 --> 04:17:08.389 align:start position:0%
 
be

04:17:08.389 --> 04:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:17:11.429 --> 04:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
openly uh open to the world as they
 
04:17:13.910 --> 04:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
would be if they went through Ru Mak
 
04:17:15.429 --> 04:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
I think that there's some privacy
 
04:17:15.439 --> 04:17:17.950 align:start position:0%
I think that there's some privacy
concerns

04:17:17.950 --> 04:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:17:20.149 --> 04:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
there followup
 
04:17:24.790 --> 04:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
please follow up thank you Mr chair um
 
04:17:27.750 --> 04:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
so you're saying that if they were in
 
04:17:30.070 --> 04:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
rule if the rules were
 
04:17:32.670 --> 04:17:32.680 align:start position:0%
published which in rule making the rules
 
04:17:35.349 --> 04:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
are published and open to the public
 
04:17:37.229 --> 04:17:37.239 align:start position:0%
there would be security issues with the
 
04:17:40.790 --> 04:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
information in the rule make in the
 
04:17:43.750 --> 04:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
rules it's very possible that the
 
04:17:47.550 --> 04:17:47.560 align:start position:0%
security uh rules would have information
 
04:17:50.550 --> 04:17:50.560 align:start position:0%
we don't want to publish that is how we
 
04:17:54.910 --> 04:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
detect uh false um false identifications
 
04:18:01.730 --> 04:18:01.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:01.740 --> 04:18:03.189 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
04:18:06.349 --> 04:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
attacks actually I have a a question if
 
04:18:08.349 --> 04:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
these aren't going to be published then
 
04:18:10.389 --> 04:18:10.399 align:start position:0%
how are the people they might apply to
 
04:18:11.950 --> 04:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
going to be aware of them I'm a little
 
04:18:11.960 --> 04:18:17.229 align:start position:0%
going to be aware of them I'm a little
confused

04:18:17.229 --> 04:18:17.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:19.510 --> 04:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
they can be published to the agencies
 
04:18:21.550 --> 04:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
without necessarily putting them on the
 
04:18:24.070 --> 04:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
State website for anyone interested to
 
04:18:24.080 --> 04:18:28.309 align:start position:0%
State website for anyone interested to
to

04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:32.870 --> 04:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
review I have oh sorry go ahead uh any
 
04:18:35.950 --> 04:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
other questions did you have one I do
 
04:18:37.830 --> 04:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
have another question but I'll yield to
 
04:18:40.229 --> 04:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
someone is someone else has a question
 
04:18:46.070 --> 04:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:50.309 --> 04:18:50.319 align:start position:0%
um I guess the director of it is uh
 
04:18:53.149 --> 04:18:53.159 align:start position:0%
present wants to speak I I have my hand
 
04:18:56.229 --> 04:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
up oh
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
sorry so okay proceed so um
 
04:19:02.790 --> 04:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire um having a
 
04:19:05.990 --> 04:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
little bit of background in it I I
 
04:19:09.510 --> 04:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
believe that um a lot of these standards
 
04:19:12.030 --> 04:19:12.040 align:start position:0%
are probably industry standards do you
 
04:19:14.149 --> 04:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
think that that's proba
 
04:19:14.159 --> 04:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
think that that's proba
true

04:19:17.280 --> 04:19:17.290 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:17.290 --> 04:19:20.189 align:start position:0%

04:19:24.429 --> 04:19:24.439 align:start position:0%
yes what Dennis gay
 
04:19:29.309 --> 04:19:29.319 align:start position:0%
gay um Dennis gay uh is
 
04:19:32.030 --> 04:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you Mr chair and thank
 
04:19:34.389 --> 04:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
you representative Maguire for
 
04:19:37.590 --> 04:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill um my name is
 
04:19:40.349 --> 04:19:40.359 align:start position:0%
Dennis goule I am the uh the
 
04:19:41.550 --> 04:19:41.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner for the Department of
 
04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
Information Technology
 
04:19:47.349 --> 04:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
and um I asked for this um language for
 
04:19:49.429 --> 04:19:49.439 align:start position:0%
a couple reasons
 
04:19:53.469 --> 04:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
um first of all a couple of years ago U
 
04:19:57.349 --> 04:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
LBA audit report um had recognized had a
 
04:19:58.990 --> 04:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
finding where they saw there was a a
 
04:20:02.269 --> 04:20:02.279 align:start position:0%
disconnect between the fact that part of
 
04:20:04.750 --> 04:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
Statute said I should be making rules
 
04:20:07.510 --> 04:20:07.520 align:start position:0%
and another part um I didn't have
 
04:20:09.469 --> 04:20:09.479 align:start position:0%
actually have any rule making Authority
 
04:20:11.750 --> 04:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
so they said we need to fix this this
 
04:20:11.760 --> 04:20:13.269 align:start position:0%
so they said we need to fix this this
inconsistency

04:20:13.269 --> 04:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
inconsistency
 
04:20:16.590 --> 04:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
in in statute so we actually had this uh
 
04:20:18.950 --> 04:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
this bill up last time but it didn't
 
04:20:21.469 --> 04:20:21.479 align:start position:0%
pass I think it got lumped into a larger
 
04:20:24.429 --> 04:20:24.439 align:start position:0%
Bill and that didn't pass so we're we're
 
04:20:27.149 --> 04:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
trying to to do this again to mainly
 
04:20:28.830 --> 04:20:28.840 align:start position:0%
because I want to get you know I want to
 
04:20:31.309 --> 04:20:31.319 align:start position:0%
chip away at all of those uh LBA audit
 
04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
findings and this is one of them um so
 
04:20:38.710 --> 04:20:38.720 align:start position:0%
why does this make sense um in in the
 
04:20:39.670 --> 04:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
case of
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
doit we have a a a a body in statute
 
04:20:46.990 --> 04:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
called the it Council and the IT Council
 
04:20:47.000 --> 04:20:47.750 align:start position:0%
called the it Council and the IT Council
uh

04:20:47.750 --> 04:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:20:50.349 --> 04:20:50.359 align:start position:0%
develops um it
 
04:20:52.950 --> 04:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
policy um including cyber security
 
04:20:55.109 --> 04:20:55.119 align:start position:0%
policy and then that policy has the has
 
04:20:57.910 --> 04:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
the fourth force of law through RSA
 
04:21:02.109 --> 04:21:02.119 align:start position:0%
21r um so the part of this language U
 
04:21:04.630 --> 04:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
removes references to rul making
 
04:21:08.189 --> 04:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
Authority um and the other part of it
 
04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
makes consistent how we govern Telecom
 
04:21:14.349 --> 04:21:14.359 align:start position:0%
um back in
 
04:21:18.790 --> 04:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
2016 the Telecom part of of the state
 
04:21:22.349 --> 04:21:22.359 align:start position:0%
business which is about 8% of my budget
 
04:21:24.429 --> 04:21:24.439 align:start position:0%
right now was moved from Department of
 
04:21:26.389 --> 04:21:26.399 align:start position:0%
Safety over into the department of
 
04:21:27.950 --> 04:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
Information Technology and they were
 
04:21:31.309 --> 04:21:31.319 align:start position:0%
under manual procedures so um so what
 
04:21:32.870 --> 04:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
this does is it cleans up a number of
 
04:21:34.870 --> 04:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
things it takes away the reference to
 
04:21:34.880 --> 04:21:36.309 align:start position:0%
things it takes away the reference to
rulemaking

04:21:36.309 --> 04:21:36.319 align:start position:0%
rulemaking
 
04:21:39.790 --> 04:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
Authority um and it and it puts the
 
04:21:42.750 --> 04:21:42.760 align:start position:0%
Telecom Group which is now part of a DE
 
04:21:46.149 --> 04:21:46.159 align:start position:0%
it under the same governance
 
04:21:48.670 --> 04:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
methodology as the rest of it which is
 
04:21:50.830 --> 04:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
the information Technology
 
04:21:53.149 --> 04:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
Council uh that concludes my formal
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm happy to answer any
 
04:22:02.269 --> 04:22:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:11.510 --> 04:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:14.030 --> 04:22:14.040 align:start position:0%
questions guess I'll ask a qu I guess
 
04:22:17.550 --> 04:22:17.560 align:start position:0%
I'll ask a question Mr chairman if I
 
04:22:21.550 --> 04:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
may commissioner commissioner
 
04:22:25.910 --> 04:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
um there are some situations as you know
 
04:22:29.469 --> 04:22:29.479 align:start position:0%
I I been on the Jael car now for 15
 
04:22:31.950 --> 04:22:31.960 align:start position:0%
years uh and I know that there are some
 
04:22:37.070 --> 04:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
agencies where uh the rules are exempt
 
04:22:37.080 --> 04:22:38.750 align:start position:0%
agencies where uh the rules are exempt
from

04:22:38.750 --> 04:22:38.760 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:22:44.030 --> 04:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
541a um review by the Jael car um such
 
04:22:45.469 --> 04:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
as the uh
 
04:22:49.590 --> 04:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
Dr uh because many of their rules uh
 
04:22:52.429 --> 04:22:52.439 align:start position:0%
have to be adopted in response to
 
04:22:56.269 --> 04:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
Federal rule changes uh which have to be
 
04:22:59.670 --> 04:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
responded to very fast if not
 
04:23:02.870 --> 04:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
immediately um and the Jael car process
 
04:23:06.269 --> 04:23:06.279 align:start position:0%
just can't can't do it that fast so Dr
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
is largely exempt from uh from
 
04:23:14.189 --> 04:23:14.199 align:start position:0%
541a review um but there are some others
 
04:23:17.309 --> 04:23:17.319 align:start position:0%
like the commit the Department of
 
04:23:19.469 --> 04:23:19.479 align:start position:0%
Corrections where they have certain
 
04:23:25.070 --> 04:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
rules uh that they really can't reveal
 
04:23:28.109 --> 04:23:28.119 align:start position:0%
because they their their clientele if
 
04:23:32.149 --> 04:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
you who are locked up uh and to the
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
degree that they that all the rules are
 
04:23:39.670 --> 04:23:39.680 align:start position:0%
public uh it it creates security pro
 
04:23:43.670 --> 04:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
breaches or possibilities of breaches um
 
04:23:46.590 --> 04:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm a little bit wondering whether
 
04:23:50.670 --> 04:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
this is somewhat similar with uh with
 
04:23:54.550 --> 04:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
doit where we also have not not we we
 
04:23:56.910 --> 04:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
have potential criminals for sure the
 
04:24:00.469 --> 04:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
hackers who are constantly bombarding us
 
04:24:02.229 --> 04:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
and I'm Wonder whe wondering whether
 
04:24:04.269 --> 04:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
that's the reason that some of this
 
04:24:07.630 --> 04:24:07.640 align:start position:0%
stuff is uh is not coming up before our
 
04:24:10.990 --> 04:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
our panel for review or whether it's
 
04:24:11.000 --> 04:24:12.550 align:start position:0%
our panel for review or whether it's
just

04:24:12.550 --> 04:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
just
 
04:24:14.469 --> 04:24:14.479 align:start position:0%
a different situation
 
04:24:18.590 --> 04:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
entirely well the the um the
 
04:24:21.670 --> 04:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
inconsistency sir existed um because I
 
04:24:24.830 --> 04:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
uh doy actually never had rule making
 
04:24:27.950 --> 04:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
Authority but there was reference to
 
04:24:32.630 --> 04:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
rule making in 541a which we we are
 
04:24:36.510 --> 04:24:36.520 align:start position:0%
asking to be removed in terms of the the
 
04:24:40.429 --> 04:24:40.439 align:start position:0%
ability to not publish information
 
04:24:43.550 --> 04:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
that of a of a sense sort like cyber
 
04:24:46.429 --> 04:24:46.439 align:start position:0%
security related stuff um there was
 
04:24:49.990 --> 04:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
actually a change to right to know um in
 
04:24:53.550 --> 04:24:53.560 align:start position:0%
it was done in association with the some
 
04:24:56.710 --> 04:24:56.720 align:start position:0%
uh Department of Education um
 
04:25:00.309 --> 04:25:00.319 align:start position:0%
legislation I think two sessions ago um
 
04:25:03.950 --> 04:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
where the the entities were concerned
 
04:25:07.109 --> 04:25:07.119 align:start position:0%
about having to reveal the results of a
 
04:25:11.070 --> 04:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
cyber um risk assessment to the public
 
04:25:12.950 --> 04:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
because of course I the results of a
 
04:25:16.229 --> 04:25:16.239 align:start position:0%
risk assessment will often have findings
 
04:25:19.710 --> 04:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
that point to weaknesses so um we worked
 
04:25:22.269 --> 04:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
with um Department Ed and some other
 
04:25:26.429 --> 04:25:26.439 align:start position:0%
folks and put language in um right to

love to thank you very much um I think
 
04:32:24.790 --> 04:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
the house bill 377 is a wise way of um
 
04:32:27.149 --> 04:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
handling recovery houses in New
 
04:32:30.070 --> 04:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in that it allows some
 
04:32:32.269 --> 04:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
recovery houses exemptions but at least
 
04:32:36.469 --> 04:32:36.479 align:start position:0%
gives everyone a minimum and uh minimum
 
04:32:40.510 --> 04:32:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh level of of required safety for those
 
04:32:42.389 --> 04:32:42.399 align:start position:0%
buildings where
 
04:32:45.630 --> 04:32:45.640 align:start position:0%
people are recovering from various forms
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
of abuse um I think that um this is
 
04:32:55.429 --> 04:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's it that's all I need to
 
04:32:58.269 --> 04:32:58.279 align:start position:0%

second thank you Mr chair and I'll just
 
04:33:05.390 --> 04:33:05.400 align:start position:0%
be brief I think we uh heard during the
 
04:33:07.269 --> 04:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
testimony that this is granting
 
04:33:10.150 --> 04:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
exemptions to the fire code and uh not
 
04:33:12.109 --> 04:33:12.119 align:start position:0%
putting any hardships on folks as the
 
04:33:14.510 --> 04:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
exemptions as such things as
 
04:33:17.910 --> 04:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
sprinklers um and I I seeing what's
 
04:33:20.150 --> 04:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
going on around Manchester and I'm sure
 
04:33:21.670 --> 04:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
it's happening in other communities this
 
04:33:23.910 --> 04:33:23.920 align:start position:0%
is a much needed piece of legislation
 
04:33:27.269 --> 04:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
and uh I will be supporting
 
04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
it thank you would anyone else like to
 
04:33:34.390 --> 04:33:34.400 align:start position:0%

objections to this bill I didn't see
 
04:33:45.910 --> 04:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
that she was affected by it but okay uh
 
04:33:47.629 --> 04:33:47.639 align:start position:0%
the Bill's
 
04:33:51.551 --> 04:33:51.561 align:start position:0%
fine I agree with you represent
 
04:33:54.349 --> 04:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
scitech any further
 
04:33:56.629 --> 04:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
discussion I think it's important that
 
04:33:59.109 --> 04:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
we we're on the record here in a way
 
04:34:02.150 --> 04:34:02.160 align:start position:0%
that we uh have not been
 
04:34:05.390 --> 04:34:05.400 align:start position:0%
previously um and I think it's important
 
04:34:10.070 --> 04:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
to address this issue that Miss Bach uh
 
04:34:14.269 --> 04:34:14.279 align:start position:0%
raised with us uh uh because uh I too
 
04:34:18.629 --> 04:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
struggled to see how uh their concerns
 
04:34:22.750 --> 04:34:22.760 align:start position:0%
uh were being stepped on by uh this bill
 
04:34:26.109 --> 04:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
or the Fire Marshal's uh
 
04:34:29.789 --> 04:34:29.799 align:start position:0%
projected treatment of the of the
 
04:34:33.070 --> 04:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
subject I think it's important for for
 
04:34:37.230 --> 04:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
for me for me to say that um I I I I
 
04:34:40.470 --> 04:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
don't want to step on that agency's uh
 
04:34:43.230 --> 04:34:43.240 align:start position:0%
you know concerns but I I don't see them
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
and and we want to be on the record as
 
04:34:46.429 --> 04:34:46.439 align:start position:0%
saying we don't think that's where the
 
04:34:48.349 --> 04:34:48.359 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshal's
 
04:34:50.990 --> 04:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
going exactly thank you representative
 
04:34:51.000 --> 04:34:54.910 align:start position:0%
going exactly thank you representative
representative

04:34:54.910 --> 04:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:57.670 --> 04:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you Mr chair um I actually
 
04:35:00.949 --> 04:35:00.959 align:start position:0%
sat on the subcommittee for this bill I
 
04:35:03.029 --> 04:35:03.039 align:start position:0%
was I was part of the bill that or the
 
04:35:05.070 --> 04:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
committee that worked on this
 
04:35:07.029 --> 04:35:07.039 align:start position:0%
over uh the
 
04:35:10.070 --> 04:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
summer and I would agree with some of
 
04:35:11.709 --> 04:35:11.719 align:start position:0%
the other statements that were made here
 
04:35:14.230 --> 04:35:14.240 align:start position:0%
in the sense that yeah yeah Kim block
 
04:35:16.629 --> 04:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
did not make a valid argument and and
 
04:35:18.349 --> 04:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
sadly enough during the subcommittee
 
04:35:20.670 --> 04:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
work uh New Hampshire core was a little
 
04:35:22.429 --> 04:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
contradictory because they seemed to
 
04:35:25.709 --> 04:35:25.719 align:start position:0%
want to use the law in certain ways when
 
04:35:28.029 --> 04:35:28.039 align:start position:0%
it benefited them and then would flip to
 
04:35:30.310 --> 04:35:30.320 align:start position:0%
a different part of the law to try to
 
04:35:31.990 --> 04:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
make an argument when it didn't work for
 
04:35:35.789 --> 04:35:35.799 align:start position:0%
them uh we heard testimony from folks
 
04:35:37.230 --> 04:35:37.240 align:start position:0%
that had actually gone through the
 
04:35:39.910 --> 04:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
recovery houses and the concerns that
 
04:35:43.470 --> 04:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
they they had and you know one of one of
 
04:35:45.189 --> 04:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
the things that was brought up that was
 
04:35:48.830 --> 04:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
telling was the idea that you know when
 
04:35:51.230 --> 04:35:51.240 align:start position:0%
you're when you're in this situation you
 
04:35:54.109 --> 04:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
have surrendered yourself in a way I
 
04:35:55.709 --> 04:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
mean if you're you know when you're
 
04:35:57.510 --> 04:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
trying to to deal with your addiction
 
04:35:59.629 --> 04:35:59.639 align:start position:0%
you you've put yourself into a recovery
 
04:36:01.429 --> 04:36:01.439 align:start position:0%
house you have given it you've given it
 
04:36:05.629 --> 04:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
up to to this process and when someone
 
04:36:09.070 --> 04:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
is in a situation where they are truly
 
04:36:11.670 --> 04:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
kind of at their lowest
 
04:36:13.629 --> 04:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
they do truly rely on the people
 
04:36:15.709 --> 04:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
recovering these houses or excuse me
 
04:36:17.910 --> 04:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
that are managing these these recovery
 
04:36:21.869 --> 04:36:21.879 align:start position:0%
houses for their safety and you know the
 
04:36:23.789 --> 04:36:23.799 align:start position:0%
testimony that we heard from from folks
 
04:36:27.109 --> 04:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
during this process really did um shed
 
04:36:31.830 --> 04:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
some concerns that exist and uh I think
 
04:36:34.629 --> 04:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
that that's something that you know let
 
04:36:37.910 --> 04:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
let's not get lost here we you know we
 
04:36:39.709 --> 04:36:39.719 align:start position:0%
really truly want these people to be
 
04:36:42.670 --> 04:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
successful and we want to create an
 
04:36:44.750 --> 04:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
environment to which they will be
 
04:36:47.230 --> 04:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
successful but they have to feel that
 
04:36:48.750 --> 04:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
they're safe
 
04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
and you know the I don't think it's the
 
04:36:54.830 --> 04:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think the legislature needs to
 
04:36:58.590 --> 04:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
surrender that to a a regulatory agency
 
04:37:01.470 --> 04:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
that frankly regulates
 
04:37:05.029 --> 04:37:05.039 align:start position:0%
itself so um you know I'm gonna be
 
04:37:07.189 --> 04:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill certainly uh thank
 
04:37:08.510 --> 04:37:08.520 align:start position:0%

[Music]
 
04:38:58.709 --> 04:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
to comment that it seemed to me that the
 
04:39:00.189 --> 04:39:00.199 align:start position:0%
objections to
 
04:39:03.349 --> 04:39:03.359 align:start position:0%
377 were looking at the requirements for
 
04:39:05.670 --> 04:39:05.680 align:start position:0%
single family homes when they should
 
04:39:07.349 --> 04:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
have been looking at the requirements
 
04:39:11.830 --> 04:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
for boarding houses or such like and so
 
04:39:14.269 --> 04:39:14.279 align:start position:0%
they were comparing apples and oranges
 
04:39:16.629 --> 04:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
when they're saying it's
 
04:39:16.639 --> 04:39:32.109 align:start position:0%
when they're saying it's
discriminatory

04:39:32.109 --> 04:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:36.230 --> 04:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh Madam chair may I ask a question
 
04:39:39.310 --> 04:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
sure uh Madame chair when do you
 
04:39:44.948 --> 04:39:44.958 align:start position:0%
consider uh bringing up two uh
 
04:39:48.868 --> 04:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
274 again uh I would hope that it would
 
04:39:52.948 --> 04:39:52.958 align:start position:0%
be today because uh a very good debate
 
04:39:56.030 --> 04:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
was held everybody did get to speak to
 
04:39:59.190 --> 04:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
the particular point of views and it is
 
04:40:02.590 --> 04:40:02.600 align:start position:0%
fresh right now in everybody's mind so
 
04:40:04.948 --> 04:40:04.958 align:start position:0%
while it is still right on the front
 
04:40:07.750 --> 04:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
burner I would recommend that today
 
04:40:10.708 --> 04:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
would be the proper time to to discuss
 
04:40:21.430 --> 04:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:24.190 --> 04:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
session at this time I'd like to open a
 
04:40:26.110 --> 04:40:26.120 align:start position:0%

background

04:40:54.990 --> 04:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
background
 
04:41:00.270 --> 04:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
um I bring this bill forward today uh as
 
04:41:02.990 --> 04:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
an attempt to take and and put a better
 
04:41:08.150 --> 04:41:08.160 align:start position:0%
handle on our current process for uh
 
04:41:11.350 --> 04:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
ensuring that that
 
04:41:13.510 --> 04:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
rules that we have made through
 
04:41:18.190 --> 04:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
administrative process are um not
 
04:41:20.590 --> 04:41:20.600 align:start position:0%
allowed to expire without being
 
04:41:24.350 --> 04:41:24.360 align:start position:0%
updated and that they are uh updated in
 
04:41:28.990 --> 04:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
a timely fashion I attended a uh
 
04:41:30.868 --> 04:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
political uh
 
04:41:33.110 --> 04:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
convention last term the beginning of
 
04:41:35.750 --> 04:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
last term so it's three years ago now uh
 
04:41:37.230 --> 04:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
but this is the first opportunity I've
 
04:41:39.070 --> 04:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
had to to bring something forward
 
04:41:42.030 --> 04:41:42.040 align:start position:0%
because uh it came came to light during
 
04:41:45.868 --> 04:41:45.878 align:start position:0%
that uh when I got to see some software
 
04:41:47.750 --> 04:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
that was being worked on by a uh a
 
04:41:50.708 --> 04:41:50.718 align:start position:0%
startup group that actually was being
 
04:41:54.150 --> 04:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
sold in multiple states that managed
 
04:41:56.590 --> 04:41:56.600 align:start position:0%
their administrative rules and it would
 
04:41:58.430 --> 04:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
give the Departments a warning that a
 
04:42:00.110 --> 04:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
certain rule that they had put in place
 
04:42:03.550 --> 04:42:03.560 align:start position:0%
was about to expire um it would
 
04:42:06.190 --> 04:42:06.200 align:start position:0%
recommend on rules that hadn't been used
 
04:42:10.470 --> 04:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh or hadn't been updated that they be
 
04:42:12.868 --> 04:42:12.878 align:start position:0%
um allow to expire and removed from the
 
04:42:15.150 --> 04:42:15.160 align:start position:0%
books and it would give everybody a
 
04:42:17.990 --> 04:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
better idea that uh what rules had
 
04:42:19.628 --> 04:42:19.638 align:start position:0%
expired that we shouldn't be trying to
 
04:42:21.590 --> 04:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
enforce because uh that just causes
 
04:42:23.510 --> 04:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
problems for the state when you you try
 
04:42:26.310 --> 04:42:26.320 align:start position:0%
to enforce a rule that has been expired
 
04:42:29.628 --> 04:42:29.638 align:start position:0%
and is is technically not valid anymore
 
04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
and I had a lot of discussions including
 
04:42:33.990 --> 04:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
some discussions with representative
 
04:42:37.670 --> 04:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
Maguire um and um I feel that the study
 
04:42:39.910 --> 04:42:39.920 align:start position:0%
committee would give us the best ability
 
04:42:42.868 --> 04:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
to take a look at the options available
 
04:42:44.470 --> 04:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
I know that the governor's office was
 
04:42:47.270 --> 04:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
looking at this software package and it
 
04:42:49.190 --> 04:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
is something that the state may decide
 
04:42:51.590 --> 04:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
to invest in in order to have a handle
 
04:42:53.470 --> 04:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
Statewide on all of our administrative
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
rules when they expire which ones are
 
04:42:59.470 --> 04:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
being used and such um but it more so
 
04:43:01.270 --> 04:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
the the study committee could just
 
04:43:03.788 --> 04:43:03.798 align:start position:0%
double check to ensure that our process
 
04:43:05.990 --> 04:43:06.000 align:start position:0%
is as streamlined as possible to ensure
 
04:43:08.830 --> 04:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
that we are not um allowing expired
 
04:43:10.868 --> 04:43:10.878 align:start position:0%
rules to stay on the books and that
 
04:43:13.910 --> 04:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
we're not um forgetting to remind
 
04:43:15.990 --> 04:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
departments when they have to update
 
04:43:18.910 --> 04:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
their rule because it is about to expire
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
and that's about it it's just a simple
 
04:43:24.990 --> 04:43:25.000 align:start position:0%
study committee um so uh I'd appreciate
 
04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
the committee looking at this and um I
 
04:43:30.030 --> 04:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
would appreciate an OTP so we could move
 
04:43:31.948 --> 04:43:31.958 align:start position:0%
forward with with trying to get a handle
 
04:43:33.868 --> 04:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
on on what's happening with the
 
04:43:36.470 --> 04:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules across the state um
 
04:43:38.750 --> 04:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire did list among the top for
 
04:43:41.430 --> 04:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
having a sheer volume of administration
 
04:43:43.990 --> 04:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
rules and uh there were quite a lot when
 
04:43:45.830 --> 04:43:45.840 align:start position:0%
they ran a demo for the state that that
 
04:43:49.310 --> 04:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
were already expired um and I had no
 
04:43:51.270 --> 04:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
idea that we had so many expired rules
 
04:43:54.868 --> 04:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
still on the books so um that's all I've
 
04:43:56.590 --> 04:43:56.600 align:start position:0%
got I'll take questions if anybody's got
 
04:44:00.110 --> 04:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
any thank you uh representative Schultz
 
04:44:02.150 --> 04:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question can you
 
04:44:05.550 --> 04:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
hear me okay I can good because my mic
 
04:44:07.670 --> 04:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't working earlier I'm just curious
 
04:44:09.990 --> 04:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
what convention this was if you don't
 
04:44:11.990 --> 04:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
mind my asking
 
04:44:13.628 --> 04:44:13.638 align:start position:0%
uh it was the American legislative
 
04:44:13.638 --> 04:44:16.590 align:start position:0%
uh it was the American legislative
exchange

04:44:16.590 --> 04:44:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:18.830 --> 04:44:18.840 align:start position:0%
Council thank
 
04:44:21.470 --> 04:44:21.480 align:start position:0%
you any more questions for
 
04:44:24.150 --> 04:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
representative Spain uh representative
 
04:44:26.910 --> 04:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
gr thank you I guess I have a question
 
04:44:29.670 --> 04:44:29.680 align:start position:0%
to the chair and to um other members of
 
04:44:29.680 --> 04:44:30.750 align:start position:0%
to the chair and to um other members of
the

04:44:30.750 --> 04:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:44:33.190 --> 04:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
committee regarding a study committee
 
04:44:41.910 --> 04:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:43.750 --> 04:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
no the speaker has said that we will not
 
04:44:46.990 --> 04:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
pass any study committee bills the
 
04:44:49.708 --> 04:44:49.718 align:start position:0%
options are since administrative rules
 
04:44:52.510 --> 04:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
is fully within our scope of action is
 
04:44:54.868 --> 04:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
to study it ourselves without a formal
 
04:44:57.190 --> 04:44:57.200 align:start position:0%
study committee we've done that on a
 
04:44:58.230 --> 04:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
number of
 
04:45:00.470 --> 04:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
issues and to do that we can either
 
04:45:02.550 --> 04:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
retain the bill or kill
 
04:45:06.190 --> 04:45:06.200 align:start position:0%
it and I would like to like to mention
 
04:45:09.310 --> 04:45:09.320 align:start position:0%
that expired administrative rules cannot
 
04:45:11.230 --> 04:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
be enforced
 
04:45:13.948 --> 04:45:13.958 align:start position:0%
that's one of the few clear improvements
 
04:45:15.910 --> 04:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
we've made in our rul making process in
 
04:45:18.390 --> 04:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
the last few
 
04:45:21.948 --> 04:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
years thank you I have no questions for
 
04:45:23.708 --> 04:45:23.718 align:start position:0%
um representative Spain I was just
 
04:45:25.830 --> 04:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
concerned when I saw study committee
 
04:45:25.840 --> 04:45:26.510 align:start position:0%
concerned when I saw study committee
thank

04:45:26.510 --> 04:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:45:29.310 --> 04:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative any uh
 
04:45:36.190 --> 04:45:36.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:39.070 --> 04:45:39.080 align:start position:0%
fellows thank you um I would just like
 
04:45:43.628 --> 04:45:43.638 align:start position:0%
to ask um which agencies you you
 
04:45:46.708 --> 04:45:46.718 align:start position:0%
um cons consulted before you put this
 
04:45:49.230 --> 04:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
bill together to find out what they told
 
04:45:52.150 --> 04:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
you were the reasons that there might be
 
04:45:54.868 --> 04:45:54.878 align:start position:0%
expired um
 
04:45:58.788 --> 04:45:58.798 align:start position:0%
laws that have not been renewed yet uh
 
04:46:01.230 --> 04:46:01.240 align:start position:0%
particularly in this particular year I
 
04:46:05.270 --> 04:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
can see there are reasons why that would
 
04:46:07.550 --> 04:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
happen uh thank you for your question it
 
04:46:10.390 --> 04:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
was actually um over two years ago when
 
04:46:11.470 --> 04:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
I spoke
 
04:46:15.030 --> 04:46:15.040 align:start position:0%
with the governor's office and
 
04:46:17.788 --> 04:46:17.798 align:start position:0%
um one of the executive counselors it
 
04:46:20.990 --> 04:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
Escapes Me Now who it was um but uh they
 
04:46:23.110 --> 04:46:23.120 align:start position:0%
were investigating the same software
 
04:46:24.990 --> 04:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
company so I had a discussion with the
 
04:46:27.470 --> 04:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
governor's office and they said yes they
 
04:46:29.150 --> 04:46:29.160 align:start position:0%
had also been made aware that there
 
04:46:32.150 --> 04:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
there were rules in some of the agencies
 
04:46:35.868 --> 04:46:35.878 align:start position:0%
that had not been renewed within the
 
04:46:37.628 --> 04:46:37.638 align:start position:0%
time frame that they were supposed to be
 
04:46:39.470 --> 04:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
renewed and so technically they were
 
04:46:42.868 --> 04:46:42.878 align:start position:0%
expired and no had tried to enforce them
 
04:46:45.030 --> 04:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
so that they really should be cleaned up
 
04:46:47.590 --> 04:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
and removed um rather than just sitting
 
04:46:50.830 --> 04:46:50.840 align:start position:0%
around as expired rules and and that's
 
04:46:53.230 --> 04:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
my intent on this is to try to just
 
04:46:55.470 --> 04:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
ensure that if we have expired rules
 
04:46:59.070 --> 04:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
hanging around we we remove them and if
 
04:47:01.590 --> 04:47:01.600 align:start position:0%
we have rules that expired inadvertently
 
04:47:03.948 --> 04:47:03.958 align:start position:0%
we remember to renew
 
04:47:09.070 --> 04:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
them follow up yes please um I'm I'm
 
04:47:11.310 --> 04:47:11.320 align:start position:0%
just thinking um what I know about the
 
04:47:14.708 --> 04:47:14.718 align:start position:0%
process that's involved to get rules
 
04:47:17.510 --> 04:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
changed you know it involves public
 
04:47:20.510 --> 04:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
hearings and all that sort of thing um
 
04:47:22.350 --> 04:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
that and I was at I worked at the
 
04:47:24.070 --> 04:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and I did not
 
04:47:26.030 --> 04:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
work specifically with rules but I would
 
04:47:27.548 --> 04:47:27.558 align:start position:0%
hear about you know some of the things
 
04:47:30.708 --> 04:47:30.718 align:start position:0%
that were going on that um it can it can
 
04:47:33.430 --> 04:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
take a considerable amount of time when
 
04:47:36.350 --> 04:47:36.360 align:start position:0%
you hear in in public hearings that
 
04:47:38.910 --> 04:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
people have different ideas of how a
 
04:47:41.070 --> 04:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
rule should be changed and that that
 
04:47:44.270 --> 04:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
could be one of the reasons that um they
 
04:47:47.110 --> 04:47:47.120 align:start position:0%
may may expire are are you familiar with
 
04:47:49.110 --> 04:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
situations like
 
04:47:52.788 --> 04:47:52.798 align:start position:0%
that uh thank you for that question um I
 
04:47:55.788 --> 04:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
I'm not aware that the majority of the
 
04:47:59.150 --> 04:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
rules that went and sat on that sat as
 
04:48:01.190 --> 04:48:01.200 align:start position:0%
expired rules came about because they
 
04:48:03.510 --> 04:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
couldn't determine a way to renew them
 
04:48:05.230 --> 04:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
based on public hearing or public
 
04:48:10.510 --> 04:48:10.520 align:start position:0%
sentiment uh I I was um essentially told
 
04:48:10.520 --> 04:48:11.470 align:start position:0%
sentiment uh I I was um essentially told
by

04:48:11.470 --> 04:48:11.480 align:start position:0%
by
 
04:48:13.230 --> 04:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
those that I talked to that there are
 
04:48:15.910 --> 04:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
instances when the the department
 
04:48:17.948 --> 04:48:17.958 align:start position:0%
forgets that a rule is there we don't
 
04:48:20.510 --> 04:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
have a reminding mechanism that says hey
 
04:48:22.670 --> 04:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
this rule is uh you know 10 years old
 
04:48:28.150 --> 04:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
and it needs to be renewed um and the uh
 
04:48:29.830 --> 04:48:29.840 align:start position:0%
the software that we were looking at did
 
04:48:31.548 --> 04:48:31.558 align:start position:0%
that it would come up and say hey this
 
04:48:33.750 --> 04:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be renewed this year it's it's
 
04:48:35.990 --> 04:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
hit its time frame for your State's
 
04:48:37.830 --> 04:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
guidelines on when rules need to be
 
04:48:40.110 --> 04:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
renewed I am aware that there's a lot of
 
04:48:42.190 --> 04:48:42.200 align:start position:0%
problem with with getting all of the
 
04:48:44.310 --> 04:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
public opinion I think that's one reason
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
why New Hampshire has chosen to have the
 
04:48:47.788 --> 04:48:47.798 align:start position:0%
rules last a longer period of time than
 
04:48:49.628 --> 04:48:49.638 align:start position:0%
some other states uh there are other
 
04:48:51.708 --> 04:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
states where the rules expire every year
 
04:48:54.948 --> 04:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
annually or rules expire every two years
 
04:48:58.070 --> 04:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
um ours tend to last a lot longer uh
 
04:49:00.590 --> 04:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
because we we have such a large number
 
04:49:02.230 --> 04:49:02.240 align:start position:0%
of them and it's hard to get public
 
04:49:04.548 --> 04:49:04.558 align:start position:0%
input and sentiment on all the rules and
 
04:49:06.190 --> 04:49:06.200 align:start position:0%
ensure that they are are going forward
 
04:49:09.868 --> 04:49:09.878 align:start position:0%
in the right way um part of this whole
 
04:49:16.590 --> 04:49:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:18.750 --> 04:49:18.760 align:start position:0%
studied thank you any further questions
 
04:49:22.510 --> 04:49:22.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:26.270 --> 04:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
spy there see I see none so thank you

District
 
04:49:51.390 --> 04:49:51.400 align:start position:0%
29 my concern is that
 
04:49:54.948 --> 04:49:54.958 align:start position:0%
the rules that tend to expire without
 
04:49:57.868 --> 04:49:57.878 align:start position:0%
anyone noticing are frequently from the
 
04:50:00.190 --> 04:50:00.200 align:start position:0%
smaller agencies that don't have very
 
04:50:03.310 --> 04:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
many rules so they don't have to deal
 
04:50:05.590 --> 04:50:05.600 align:start position:0%
with it very often and so they just
 
04:50:08.670 --> 04:50:08.680 align:start position:0%
forget about it until until somebody
 
04:50:10.230 --> 04:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
points out that their rule has been
 
04:50:14.230 --> 04:50:14.240 align:start position:0%
expired for a year HHS for example we
 
04:50:16.708 --> 04:50:16.718 align:start position:0%
were talking about the child care rules
 
04:50:19.350 --> 04:50:19.360 align:start position:0%
those are being held up because they're
 
04:50:21.470 --> 04:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
debating how to solve what the
 
04:50:23.390 --> 04:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
requirement should be we were talking
 
04:50:26.070 --> 04:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
about that on I think it was House Bill
 
04:50:29.470 --> 04:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
230 but um
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
it's I think that some of the issues of
 
04:50:36.788 --> 04:50:36.798 align:start position:0%
rules being overlooked will be helped by
 
04:50:40.270 --> 04:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
the oplc because they've got a central
 
04:50:43.110 --> 04:50:43.120 align:start position:0%
rule writing Authority that the many of
 
04:50:45.470 --> 04:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
the boards didn't really have before
 
04:50:46.750 --> 04:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
they were
 
04:50:49.190 --> 04:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
Consolidated in any event I I
 
04:50:50.990 --> 04:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
co-sponsored this I thought it would be
 
04:50:54.910 --> 04:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
a useful idea but in this year I think
 
04:50:58.310 --> 04:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
that we can't pass it and our choice is
 
04:51:01.628 --> 04:51:01.638 align:start position:0%
to retain it if we want to work on it or
 
04:51:05.790 --> 04:51:05.800 align:start position:0%

want to manage the committee that's the
 
04:52:11.910 --> 04:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
chair's job but uh but I I think that
 
04:52:14.310 --> 04:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
was a bill that seemed to have be
 
04:52:16.430 --> 04:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
unobjectionable and I'd just like to see
 
04:52:19.708 --> 04:52:19.718 align:start position:0%

Pittsfield and House Bill 457 revises
 
04:59:54.788 --> 04:59:54.798 align:start position:0%
the membership of the youth advisory
 
04:59:54.798 --> 05:00:00.270 align:start position:0%
the membership of the youth advisory
Council

05:00:00.270 --> 05:00:00.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:03.670 --> 05:00:03.680 align:start position:0%
and it's looks very straightforward to
 
05:00:07.470 --> 05:00:07.480 align:start position:0%
me I know the youth advisory Council met
 
05:00:10.030 --> 05:00:10.040 align:start position:0%
and discussed it yesterday and they have
 
05:00:13.868 --> 05:00:13.878 align:start position:0%
not had a chance to issue a to agree on
 
05:00:18.070 --> 05:00:18.080 align:start position:0%
a decision so uh after those people who
 
05:00:21.270 --> 05:00:21.280 align:start position:0%
are here have spoken I believe the this
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
hearing will be recessed so that we can
 
05:00:27.030 --> 05:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
await the testimony of the youth
 
05:00:31.470 --> 05:00:31.480 align:start position:0%

testimony it has been my honor and
 
05:01:29.548 --> 05:01:29.558 align:start position:0%
privilege to have served as the
 
05:01:31.948 --> 05:01:31.958 align:start position:0%
legislative co-chair of the New
 
05:01:33.868 --> 05:01:33.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislative youth advisory
 
05:01:37.110 --> 05:01:37.120 align:start position:0%
Council for the last four years having
 
05:01:40.430 --> 05:01:40.440 align:start position:0%
first been appointed by Speaker Jasper
 
05:01:41.948 --> 05:01:41.958 align:start position:0%
and then by Speaker
 
05:01:44.470 --> 05:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
shirtliff prior to that I assisted
 
05:01:46.948 --> 05:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
representative Carolyn gargas for two
 
05:01:50.190 --> 05:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
terms when she served in that position
 
05:01:52.350 --> 05:01:52.360 align:start position:0%
she also was appointed by speakers of
 
05:01:55.628 --> 05:01:55.638 align:start position:0%
both parties which is as it should be
 
05:01:57.788 --> 05:01:57.798 align:start position:0%
because the council is
 
05:02:00.150 --> 05:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan I'm extremely proud of the
 
05:02:02.110 --> 05:02:02.120 align:start position:0%
work the council has done during my
 
05:02:04.868 --> 05:02:04.878 align:start position:0%
tenure the young people are motivated
 
05:02:07.590 --> 05:02:07.600 align:start position:0%
and work hard under some difficult
 
05:02:10.190 --> 05:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions to perform the job they are
 
05:02:13.750 --> 05:02:13.760 align:start position:0%
tasked with to advise the legislature on
 
05:02:16.830 --> 05:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
issues of importance to the Youth of the
 
05:02:19.548 --> 05:02:19.558 align:start position:0%
state attendance at meetings has
 
05:02:21.868 --> 05:02:21.878 align:start position:0%
improved several well-planned and
 
05:02:24.628 --> 05:02:24.638 align:start position:0%
informative public forums have been held
 
05:02:27.070 --> 05:02:27.080 align:start position:0%
more members have testified before
 
05:02:29.270 --> 05:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
committees and more statements of
 
05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
support or opposition to various pieces
 
05:02:34.390 --> 05:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
of legislation have been sent to
 
05:02:38.190 --> 05:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
legislative committees in fact in 2020
 
05:02:40.910 --> 05:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
the council testified or sent written
 
05:02:43.868 --> 05:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
statements on 13 pieces of legislation
 
05:02:46.910 --> 05:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
before us this despite everything coming
 
05:02:49.868 --> 05:02:49.878 align:start position:0%
to a crashing halt for them in March due
 
05:02:51.150 --> 05:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:02:53.990 --> 05:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
pandemic that is why I was so dismayed
 
05:02:56.628 --> 05:02:56.638 align:start position:0%
to learn the sponsors of this bill did
 
05:02:59.990 --> 05:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
not contact me or any council member
 
05:03:03.230 --> 05:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
before filing this bill in fact we only
 
05:03:06.750 --> 05:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
learned about it when a council member
 
05:03:09.230 --> 05:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
doing his work reading over the lists of
 
05:03:09.240 --> 05:03:10.948 align:start position:0%
doing his work reading over the lists of
LSi

05:03:10.948 --> 05:03:10.958 align:start position:0%
LSi
 
05:03:12.628 --> 05:03:12.638 align:start position:0%
brought it to our
 
05:03:15.350 --> 05:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
attention there are changes to the
 
05:03:18.470 --> 05:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
statute that could be made to help lak
 
05:03:21.430 --> 05:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
do its work more effectively in fact I
 
05:03:23.590 --> 05:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
had hoped to do that next year when
 
05:03:26.510 --> 05:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
things are more back to normal
 
05:03:28.590 --> 05:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
unfortunately none of those helpful
 
05:03:30.628 --> 05:03:30.638 align:start position:0%
changes appear in this
 
05:03:33.110 --> 05:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
bill I have provided the committee with
 
05:03:35.868 --> 05:03:35.878 align:start position:0%
lengthy written testimony explaining how
 
05:03:38.548 --> 05:03:38.558 align:start position:0%
things have been done up to now so I
 
05:03:41.230 --> 05:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
won't go into the details here I just
 
05:03:44.390 --> 05:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
want to address several aspects of this
 
05:03:47.070 --> 05:03:47.080 align:start position:0%
bill currently council members are
 
05:03:49.470 --> 05:03:49.480 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor the Secretary
 
05:03:52.310 --> 05:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
of State the president of the Senate and
 
05:03:55.350 --> 05:03:55.360 align:start position:0%
the Speaker of the House only once that
 
05:03:58.628 --> 05:03:58.638 align:start position:0%
I know have has any of these appointer
 
05:04:01.628 --> 05:04:01.638 align:start position:0%
found a candidate on their own that was
 
05:04:03.910 --> 05:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
governor Hassen back in
 
05:04:06.190 --> 05:04:06.200 align:start position:0%
2015 it has been left to the house
 
05:04:08.270 --> 05:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
member who serves as the legislative
 
05:04:11.390 --> 05:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
co-chair to seek out candidates and make
 
05:04:13.750 --> 05:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations for appointments to
 
05:04:15.590 --> 05:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
these respective
 
05:04:19.110 --> 05:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
officers this is time consuming work I
 
05:04:21.788 --> 05:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
have detailed the process we use in my
 
05:04:24.510 --> 05:04:24.520 align:start position:0%
written testimony but being somewhat
 
05:04:26.070 --> 05:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with the amount of work it
 
05:04:28.310 --> 05:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
takes the speaker's office to fill
 
05:04:30.628 --> 05:04:30.638 align:start position:0%
vacancies on the many committees and
 
05:04:33.510 --> 05:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
commissions we create I know they will
 
05:04:36.230 --> 05:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
not be eager to have the responsibility
 
05:04:40.230 --> 05:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
thrust upon them to be brutally honest
 
05:04:43.788 --> 05:04:43.798 align:start position:0%
even though lak was the light of my life
 
05:04:47.150 --> 05:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
for four years it is now low down on the
 
05:04:49.230 --> 05:04:49.240 align:start position:0%
totem pole for the
 
05:04:52.150 --> 05:04:52.160 align:start position:0%
appointer they were always most pleased
 
05:04:57.150 --> 05:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:00.430 --> 05:05:00.440 align:start position:0%
forward another section of the bill we
 
05:05:03.030 --> 05:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
already provide written test statements
 
05:05:03.040 --> 05:05:03.948 align:start position:0%
already provide written test statements
and

05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:05:06.270 --> 05:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
testimony on issues that are important
 
05:05:09.190 --> 05:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
to council members we provide an annual
 
05:05:11.390 --> 05:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
report two and I've have attached the
 
05:05:14.030 --> 05:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
last four to my written testimony for
 
05:05:16.310 --> 05:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
your perusal and I do need to tell you
 
05:05:18.310 --> 05:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
that the report for
 
05:05:21.150 --> 05:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
2018 um I sent twice because I wasn't
 
05:05:23.628 --> 05:05:23.638 align:start position:0%
sure it was getting through and the word
 
05:05:25.788 --> 05:05:25.798 align:start position:0%
version is not a complete version please
 
05:05:27.750 --> 05:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
look at the pdf
 
05:05:30.990 --> 05:05:31.000 align:start position:0%
version organizing and presenting a
 
05:05:33.788 --> 05:05:33.798 align:start position:0%
public forum on the issues they find
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
important is in my opinion one of the
 
05:05:39.270 --> 05:05:39.280 align:start position:0%
most valuable duties the council now
 
05:05:42.350 --> 05:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
perform forms they enjoy the work they
 
05:05:44.910 --> 05:05:44.920 align:start position:0%
are eager to do it and they learn so
 
05:05:48.390 --> 05:05:48.400 align:start position:0%
much by teaching others I am not sure
 
05:05:51.350 --> 05:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
why we would want to eliminate it but
 
05:05:53.830 --> 05:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
most baffling to me is the provision on
 
05:05:58.350 --> 05:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
page two line 13 which reads prepare and
 
05:06:01.070 --> 05:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
execute programming to encourage job
 
05:06:03.270 --> 05:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
growth in New
 
05:06:07.150 --> 05:06:07.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lak is here to advise us on
 
05:06:08.830 --> 05:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
the things that are of importance to the
 
05:06:10.788 --> 05:06:10.798 align:start position:0%
Youth of New Hampshire
 
05:06:13.030 --> 05:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
prior to their first meeting of the year
 
05:06:14.990 --> 05:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
they are asked to talk with their peers
 
05:06:17.030 --> 05:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
about what's important and to bring
 
05:06:21.190 --> 05:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
their list with them they do we may not
 
05:06:24.270 --> 05:06:24.280 align:start position:0%
like the issues that they bring to us or
 
05:06:26.670 --> 05:06:26.680 align:start position:0%
agree with their positions on them but
 
05:06:28.990 --> 05:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
it all comes from them representing
 
05:06:29.000 --> 05:06:29.788 align:start position:0%
it all comes from them representing
their

05:06:29.788 --> 05:06:29.798 align:start position:0%
their
 
05:06:32.708 --> 05:06:32.718 align:start position:0%
peers imposing our own desires and
 
05:06:35.788 --> 05:06:35.798 align:start position:0%
issues on them defeats the very purpose
 
05:06:37.470 --> 05:06:37.480 align:start position:0%
of the council's
 
05:06:40.270 --> 05:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
existence as I mentioned earlier on
 
05:06:42.110 --> 05:06:42.120 align:start position:0%
there are changes that can be made to
 
05:06:44.230 --> 05:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
help the council work more
 
05:06:47.070 --> 05:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
effectively I am asking the committee to
 
05:06:49.628 --> 05:06:49.638 align:start position:0%
recommend retaining this bill so that
 
05:06:51.788 --> 05:06:51.798 align:start position:0%
the youth council members the new
 
05:06:54.350 --> 05:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
legislative co-chair and others who have
 
05:06:57.110 --> 05:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
been involved can be can have input and
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
I know that the council members have a
 
05:07:00.830 --> 05:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
lengthy list of suggestions that they
 
05:07:03.750 --> 05:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
would like to offer to you so with that
 
05:07:05.948 --> 05:07:05.958 align:start position:0%

appreciate you trying to give me a
 
05:08:05.590 --> 05:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
promotion just a second ago um my um my
 
05:08:08.110 --> 05:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
name is Doug Marino um I uh used to
 
05:08:09.430 --> 05:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
serve on the legislative youth of
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
advisory Council uh when I was in high
 
05:08:14.070 --> 05:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
school um and so I just want to uh speak
 
05:08:16.190 --> 05:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
very briefly on this bill um I really
 
05:08:18.750 --> 05:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate um representative um Porter's
 
05:08:21.470 --> 05:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
testimony um during my time on the
 
05:08:24.270 --> 05:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
council which was uh uh well over
 
05:08:26.750 --> 05:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
probably six years ago now um we had a
 
05:08:29.708 --> 05:08:29.718 align:start position:0%
similar Bill uh proposed uh while I was
 
05:08:31.750 --> 05:08:31.760 align:start position:0%
on the council and uh much like this
 
05:08:34.628 --> 05:08:34.638 align:start position:0%
time um the sponsors did not uh consult
 
05:08:38.750 --> 05:08:38.760 align:start position:0%
us beforehand um I I do think that um
 
05:08:40.590 --> 05:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
you know it's worth having a
 
05:08:42.070 --> 05:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
conversation about making certain
 
05:08:44.150 --> 05:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
changes to lak but I think that it is
 
05:08:45.510 --> 05:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
very important to include the council
 
05:08:46.788 --> 05:08:46.798 align:start position:0%
members in that
 
05:08:49.470 --> 05:08:49.480 align:start position:0%
conversation um I I fully support
 
05:08:51.830 --> 05:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative Porter's um position that
 
05:08:53.948 --> 05:08:53.958 align:start position:0%
the bill should be retained um and I
 
05:08:55.948 --> 05:08:55.958 align:start position:0%
also do have significant concerns in
 
05:09:00.150 --> 05:09:00.160 align:start position:0%
particular about the um the idea of
 
05:09:03.788 --> 05:09:03.798 align:start position:0%
eliminating um the um section of the
 
05:09:06.150 --> 05:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
statute uh relative to public
 
05:09:09.030 --> 05:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
forums um I think that that that's uh
 
05:09:11.030 --> 05:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
something that um is very important for
 
05:09:12.310 --> 05:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
the council it's something we took a lot
 
05:09:13.990 --> 05:09:14.000 align:start position:0%
of pride in while I was on the council
 
05:09:17.070 --> 05:09:17.080 align:start position:0%
trying to hold public uh forums to
 
05:09:18.470 --> 05:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
engage with the public on the issues
 
05:09:19.990 --> 05:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
that matter to them and have that inform
 
05:09:22.030 --> 05:09:22.040 align:start position:0%
our priorities as well so I would
 
05:09:23.830 --> 05:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
strongly urge you to to keep that
 
05:09:27.070 --> 05:09:27.080 align:start position:0%
provision in place um and then um other
 
05:09:29.510 --> 05:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
than that I I I hope that um the council
 
05:09:32.670 --> 05:09:32.680 align:start position:0%
gets a chance to weigh in um and I go
 
05:09:34.470 --> 05:09:34.480 align:start position:0%

group did you find that the public
 
05:10:02.910 --> 05:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
forums tended to be other students that
 
05:10:05.708 --> 05:10:05.718 align:start position:0%
were interested enough to bring issues
 
05:10:08.150 --> 05:10:08.160 align:start position:0%

05:14:29.350 --> 05:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
individual and not on behalf of the
 
05:14:31.548 --> 05:14:31.558 align:start position:0%
council given that we were unable to
 
05:14:33.430 --> 05:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
convene and vote on this bill before
 
05:14:35.910 --> 05:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
this hearing we have spent time during
 
05:14:37.830 --> 05:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
our last two meetings deliberating this
 
05:14:40.470 --> 05:14:40.480 align:start position:0%
legislation and and we have had and
 
05:14:43.230 --> 05:14:43.240 align:start position:0%
continue to have questions concerns and
 
05:14:45.788 --> 05:14:45.798 align:start position:0%
opinions surrounding it although we have
 
05:14:48.150 --> 05:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
not yet adopted an official stance the
 
05:14:49.910 --> 05:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
points I will bring forth are derived
 
05:14:51.470 --> 05:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
from the opinions of our members that I
 
05:14:52.990 --> 05:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
have heard so
 
05:14:55.548 --> 05:14:55.558 align:start position:0%
far I would like to preface my remarks
 
05:14:57.708 --> 05:14:57.718 align:start position:0%
by specifying that HB
 
05:15:00.350 --> 05:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
457 was written without the consultation
 
05:15:03.310 --> 05:15:03.320 align:start position:0%
of any current NH lak members we were
 
05:15:05.830 --> 05:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
not involved in drafting it and only
 
05:15:08.350 --> 05:15:08.360 align:start position:0%
discovered it when looking through lsrs
 
05:15:10.230 --> 05:15:10.240 align:start position:0%
I believe that the legislation includes
 
05:15:12.030 --> 05:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
many Provisions that do not benefit the
 
05:15:13.750 --> 05:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
council or detract from the
 
05:15:16.310 --> 05:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
effectiveness of its current operations
 
05:15:18.350 --> 05:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
I also have many suggestions based on my
 
05:15:20.708 --> 05:15:20.718 align:start position:0%
experience as a member and leader of lak
 
05:15:22.350 --> 05:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
that I feel would truly strengthen this
 
05:15:24.230 --> 05:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
legislation and make it more relevant
 
05:15:25.830 --> 05:15:25.840 align:start position:0%
and beneficial to the
 
05:15:28.150 --> 05:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
group I will Begin by giving a bit of
 
05:15:29.948 --> 05:15:29.958 align:start position:0%
context on how our Council currently
 
05:15:32.670 --> 05:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
operates at the beginning of each year
 
05:15:34.510 --> 05:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
liak members are tasked with having
 
05:15:36.150 --> 05:15:36.160 align:start position:0%
conversations with young people across
 
05:15:38.510 --> 05:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
their communities in order to identify
 
05:15:41.270 --> 05:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
the key issues that pertain to youth our
 
05:15:43.070 --> 05:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
first meeting is always dedicated to
 
05:15:45.070 --> 05:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
Bringing forth our findings and
 
05:15:46.628 --> 05:15:46.638 align:start position:0%
compiling a list of issues that we
 
05:15:48.270 --> 05:15:48.280 align:start position:0%
believe impact youth across New
 
05:15:50.670 --> 05:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and oftentimes the issues that
 
05:15:52.590 --> 05:15:52.600 align:start position:0%
I will bring forth as a resident of
 
05:15:54.990 --> 05:15:55.000 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County are echoed over and
 
05:15:57.230 --> 05:15:57.240 align:start position:0%
over by the by the council members
 
05:15:58.390 --> 05:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
across the
 
05:16:00.868 --> 05:16:00.878 align:start position:0%
state upon sharing our community's
 
05:16:03.030 --> 05:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
priorities we determine through a vote
 
05:16:05.030 --> 05:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
which ones are in the majority and will
 
05:16:07.990 --> 05:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
Garner our Focus for the Year this term
 
05:16:09.470 --> 05:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
the issues that over whelming least
 
05:16:12.070 --> 05:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
stood out were Healthcare including
 
05:16:15.430 --> 05:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
mental health education voting rights
 
05:16:17.350 --> 05:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
substance abuse gun control and
 
05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
Environmental Protection they were
 
05:16:21.030 --> 05:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
raised over and over again by youth
 
05:16:22.430 --> 05:16:22.440 align:start position:0%
across the state as the issues that
 
05:16:26.270 --> 05:16:26.280 align:start position:0%
matter most to us um in our age group we
 
05:16:27.708 --> 05:16:27.718 align:start position:0%
have organized into interest groups
 
05:16:29.708 --> 05:16:29.718 align:start position:0%
surrounding these issues and between our
 
05:16:31.708 --> 05:16:31.718 align:start position:0%
monthly meetings each interest group
 
05:16:33.548 --> 05:16:33.558 align:start position:0%
identifies legislation pertaining to
 
05:16:35.948 --> 05:16:35.958 align:start position:0%
their topic and brings it to the council
 
05:16:38.470 --> 05:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
where we debate deliberate and vote we
 
05:16:40.310 --> 05:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
then CFT statements and testimony to
 
05:16:42.350 --> 05:16:42.360 align:start position:0%
convey this youth opinion to the
 
05:16:42.360 --> 05:16:49.190 align:start position:0%
convey this youth opinion to the
legislature

05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:51.990 --> 05:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
so people from across the granite state
 
05:16:54.390 --> 05:16:54.400 align:start position:0%
and engage in legislative advocacy that
 
05:16:56.430 --> 05:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
surrounds these issues that abundantly
 
05:16:57.670 --> 05:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
resonate each
 
05:17:00.230 --> 05:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
year one aspect of this bill that I find
 
05:17:02.030 --> 05:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
in congruous with our council's current
 
05:17:04.510 --> 05:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
operation is the regional subcommittee
 
05:17:07.190 --> 05:17:07.200 align:start position:0%
suggestion as I mentioned before the
 
05:17:09.430 --> 05:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
same issues and policies tend interest
 
05:17:11.510 --> 05:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
youth across the state regardless of
 
05:17:13.948 --> 05:17:13.958 align:start position:0%
their County organizing around these
 
05:17:16.350 --> 05:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
issues that we identify enables
 
05:17:18.230 --> 05:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
individuals to focus their energy on
 
05:17:20.310 --> 05:17:20.320 align:start position:0%
time and researching the areas that they
 
05:17:22.310 --> 05:17:22.320 align:start position:0%
feel most strongly about while
 
05:17:23.708 --> 05:17:23.718 align:start position:0%
collaborating closely with members
 
05:17:25.070 --> 05:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
outside of their
 
05:17:28.708 --> 05:17:28.718 align:start position:0%
regions a provision of HB 457 that I
 
05:17:31.030 --> 05:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
also find unnecessary is the provision
 
05:17:32.830 --> 05:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
that we must prepare and execute
 
05:17:35.030 --> 05:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
programming to encourage job growth in
 
05:17:37.788 --> 05:17:37.798 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I recognize that this is a
 
05:17:39.548 --> 05:17:39.558 align:start position:0%
very vital issue
 
05:17:41.110 --> 05:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
however I believe that mandating that
 
05:17:43.350 --> 05:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
our Council focus on it detracts from
 
05:17:45.190 --> 05:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
our overall purpose of giving youth
 
05:17:46.830 --> 05:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
avenues for actions on the issues that
 
05:17:46.840 --> 05:17:47.590 align:start position:0%
avenues for actions on the issues that
they

05:17:47.590 --> 05:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:17:50.670 --> 05:17:50.680 align:start position:0%
identify as being important the council
 
05:17:52.270 --> 05:17:52.280 align:start position:0%
should be encouraged to take an active
 
05:17:54.150 --> 05:17:54.160 align:start position:0%
role as this bill says to prepare and
 
05:17:56.350 --> 05:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
execute programming but I believe that
 
05:17:58.030 --> 05:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
this should be on the issues that are
 
05:18:00.270 --> 05:18:00.280 align:start position:0%
identified by members as relevant to
 
05:18:02.788 --> 05:18:02.798 align:start position:0%
young people including but not limited
 
05:18:03.990 --> 05:18:04.000 align:start position:0%
to job
 
05:18:06.470 --> 05:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
growth a possible amendment that some of
 
05:18:07.948 --> 05:18:07.958 align:start position:0%
our members have brought up in past
 
05:18:10.030 --> 05:18:10.040 align:start position:0%
discussions and that I wish to suggest
 
05:18:12.590 --> 05:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
as co-chair is adding youth who are not
 
05:18:14.230 --> 05:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
students but rather part of the
 
05:18:16.270 --> 05:18:16.280 align:start position:0%
workforce or taking a gap year as
 
05:18:18.910 --> 05:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
eligible members I find it important
 
05:18:20.470 --> 05:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
that we include those who are already
 
05:18:20.480 --> 05:18:21.948 align:start position:0%
that we include those who are already
working

05:18:21.948 --> 05:18:21.958 align:start position:0%
working
 
05:18:24.230 --> 05:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
full-time I also believe that meeting
 
05:18:25.910 --> 05:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
virtually should be an option that is
 
05:18:28.230 --> 05:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
specified within the legislation this
 
05:18:30.190 --> 05:18:30.200 align:start position:0%
will not only improve the accessibility
 
05:18:31.948 --> 05:18:31.958 align:start position:0%
of our Council to those who have not
 
05:18:34.230 --> 05:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
gained driver's licenses or you know
 
05:18:36.390 --> 05:18:36.400 align:start position:0%
during covid it it provides a safety
 
05:18:38.390 --> 05:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
measure but it will also allow for
 
05:18:40.830 --> 05:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
greater Regional diversity as distance
 
05:18:42.350 --> 05:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
will no longer be prohibitive of
 
05:18:44.628 --> 05:18:44.638 align:start position:0%
participation as it has been in previous
 
05:18:46.948 --> 05:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
years this year we have witnessed a
 
05:18:49.150 --> 05:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
significant increase in attendance given
 
05:18:50.548 --> 05:18:50.558 align:start position:0%
the fact that members can join from
 
05:18:53.110 --> 05:18:53.120 align:start position:0%
their own home homes and I believe that
 
05:18:55.310 --> 05:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
specifying the ability to meet virtually
 
05:18:57.510 --> 05:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
will be beneficial for future
 
05:19:01.350 --> 05:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
years HB 457 also strikes the Clause
 
05:19:03.470 --> 05:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
requiring lak to hold at least one
 
05:19:06.430 --> 05:19:06.440 align:start position:0%
public forum a year I find that public
 
05:19:08.270 --> 05:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
forums are truly essential to our
 
05:19:10.470 --> 05:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
operations as a council given that
 
05:19:12.430 --> 05:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
forums enable us to fulfill our mission
 
05:19:15.110 --> 05:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
of Youth Civic engagement we're happy to
 
05:19:17.430 --> 05:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
organize these and last year we had been
 
05:19:19.868 --> 05:19:19.878 align:start position:0%
actively planning five forums before
 
05:19:21.750 --> 05:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
covid-19 had prevented us from making
 
05:19:24.948 --> 05:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
them happen we Ed these events to hear
 
05:19:26.628 --> 05:19:26.638 align:start position:0%
from subject matter experts on the
 
05:19:28.510 --> 05:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
topics that we identify as resonating
 
05:19:31.350 --> 05:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
with youth across the state and also
 
05:19:33.310 --> 05:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
hosting these forums is a valuable form
 
05:19:35.948 --> 05:19:35.958 align:start position:0%
of Outreach many of us on the council
 
05:19:37.830 --> 05:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
were encouraged to apply because we saw
 
05:19:39.948 --> 05:19:39.958 align:start position:0%
our peers getting involved in politics
 
05:19:41.750 --> 05:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
and we were inspired and motivated to do
 
05:19:44.628 --> 05:19:44.638 align:start position:0%
so as well forums enable us to spread
 
05:19:46.230 --> 05:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
the word about lak in a way that
 
05:19:48.470 --> 05:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
resonates with young people and I
 
05:19:50.270 --> 05:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
believe that striking the Clause around
 
05:19:52.510 --> 05:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
public forums is
 
05:19:54.788 --> 05:19:54.798 align:start position:0%
unnecessary based on the legislation I'm
 
05:19:56.990 --> 05:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
also Unsure how the application process
 
05:19:59.150 --> 05:19:59.160 align:start position:0%
will be conducted according to the
 
05:20:01.190 --> 05:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
current wording of HB
 
05:20:03.628 --> 05:20:03.638 align:start position:0%
457 the president of the Senate and the
 
05:20:05.270 --> 05:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house will be responsible
 
05:20:07.750 --> 05:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
for soliciting applications will the
 
05:20:09.470 --> 05:20:09.480 align:start position:0%
governor and the secet AR of State have
 
05:20:11.390 --> 05:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
any role in this process as they have in
 
05:20:13.830 --> 05:20:13.840 align:start position:0%
past years how will students know who to
 
05:20:16.430 --> 05:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
send their application to I believe that
 
05:20:17.788 --> 05:20:17.798 align:start position:0%
this should be clarified before the
 
05:20:19.470 --> 05:20:19.480 align:start position:0%
legislation moves
 
05:20:21.910 --> 05:20:21.920 align:start position:0%
on another change that the bill creates
 
05:20:23.628 --> 05:20:23.638 align:start position:0%
would be striking our meeting that we
 
05:20:25.590 --> 05:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
have in August at the State House
 
05:20:27.230 --> 05:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we were not able to host
 
05:20:28.910 --> 05:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
it this year but in the past it has been
 
05:20:32.750 --> 05:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
a staple of the NH liac our members
 
05:20:34.708 --> 05:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
always look forward to this opportunity
 
05:20:36.510 --> 05:20:36.520 align:start position:0%
to see the state government up close
 
05:20:39.070 --> 05:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
before we begin our terms if health and
 
05:20:41.430 --> 05:20:41.440 align:start position:0%
safety allows it in future years we
 
05:20:42.830 --> 05:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
would truly appreciate having a
 
05:20:44.430 --> 05:20:44.440 align:start position:0%
designated meeting at the beginning of
 
05:20:46.390 --> 05:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
each term during which we can visit the
 
05:20:47.628 --> 05:20:47.638 align:start position:0%
state house and meet with our
 
05:20:49.830 --> 05:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
Representatives we as we have in the
 
05:20:52.110 --> 05:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
past I believe that incorporating a
 
05:20:53.788 --> 05:20:53.798 align:start position:0%
substitute for the August meeting into
 
05:20:55.948 --> 05:20:55.958 align:start position:0%
this legislation is important so this
 
05:20:57.510 --> 05:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
tradition can be retained in future
 
05:20:59.628 --> 05:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
years and for future council
 
05:21:02.310 --> 05:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
members and lastly I just have a couple
 
05:21:05.390 --> 05:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
other suggestions um one of them being
 
05:21:07.350 --> 05:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
that it would be best if this bill goes
 
05:21:09.230 --> 05:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
into effect at the beginning of the next
 
05:21:11.948 --> 05:21:11.958 align:start position:0%
lak term rather than 60 days after its
 
05:21:14.270 --> 05:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
passage so it does not append Council
 
05:21:17.628 --> 05:21:17.638 align:start position:0%
operations midye furthermore I think it
 
05:21:19.628 --> 05:21:19.638 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial to have an annual
 
05:21:21.350 --> 05:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
allotted budget towards our Council to
 
05:21:23.350 --> 05:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
support a zoom license if this would be
 
05:21:25.948 --> 05:21:25.958 align:start position:0%
possible enabling us to meet online with
 
05:21:29.470 --> 05:21:29.480 align:start position:0%
more ease and lastly I do know that the
 
05:21:32.190 --> 05:21:32.200 align:start position:0%
council truly values diversity in school
 
05:21:35.430 --> 05:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
type socioeconomic background and region
 
05:21:36.708 --> 05:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
as this bill
 
05:21:39.190 --> 05:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
emphasizes however I am many of our
 
05:21:40.708 --> 05:21:40.718 align:start position:0%
members have expressed that we wish to
 
05:21:42.230 --> 05:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
ensure that all applications will be
 
05:21:44.150 --> 05:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
considered on a merit basis as they have
 
05:21:45.150 --> 05:21:45.160 align:start position:0%
been so
 
05:21:48.510 --> 05:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
far so in conclusion I believe that
 
05:21:49.990 --> 05:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
there are many beneficial changes that
 
05:21:52.230 --> 05:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
can be made so legislation surrounding
 
05:21:54.150 --> 05:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
lak is more reflective of the council's
 
05:21:56.510 --> 05:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
needs yet HB
 
05:21:59.470 --> 05:21:59.480 align:start position:0%
457 as it is currently formulated does
 
05:22:01.110 --> 05:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
not necessarily incorporate these
 
05:22:03.230 --> 05:22:03.240 align:start position:0%
changes while adding Provisions that I
 
05:22:05.708 --> 05:22:05.718 align:start position:0%
do not feel are suited to the council
 
05:22:07.430 --> 05:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
namely I believe that the emphasis on
 
05:22:09.548 --> 05:22:09.558 align:start position:0%
job growth the regional subcommittee
 
05:22:11.670 --> 05:22:11.680 align:start position:0%
based restructuring suggestion the
 
05:22:14.110 --> 05:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
advised appointment process and the
 
05:22:15.590 --> 05:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
removal of the August meeting and the
 
05:22:18.310 --> 05:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
public forum requirement are not needed
 
05:22:20.150 --> 05:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
I feel that by removing important
 
05:22:22.590 --> 05:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
avenues for lak to have our voices heard
 
05:22:24.548 --> 05:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
through forums and focusing on the
 
05:22:27.470 --> 05:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
issues that we identify um as being
 
05:22:30.310 --> 05:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
important to Youth by removing these
 
05:22:31.830 --> 05:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
this bill is counterintuitive to the
 
05:22:33.750 --> 05:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of the council which is serving
 
05:22:35.510 --> 05:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
as the link between the youth and the
 
05:22:37.628 --> 05:22:37.638 align:start position:0%
legislature identifying issues that
 
05:22:39.510 --> 05:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
pertain to youth and promoting Civic
 
05:22:42.350 --> 05:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
engagement amongst young people I am
 
05:22:44.510 --> 05:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
requesting that you retain this bill so
 
05:22:46.270 --> 05:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
that it can be reintroduced during the
 
05:22:48.628 --> 05:22:48.638 align:start position:0%
next legislative session incorporating
 
05:22:50.510 --> 05:22:50.520 align:start position:0%
the changes and input and amendments
 
05:22:52.390 --> 05:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
that my fellow council members my
 
05:22:53.910 --> 05:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
legislative co-chair representative
 
05:22:57.190 --> 05:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
Alexander and I bring forth as the ones
 
05:22:59.350 --> 05:22:59.360 align:start position:0%
impacted by this legislation I would
 
05:23:01.030 --> 05:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate it if we could be involved in
 
05:23:02.548 --> 05:23:02.558 align:start position:0%
the drafting process so this bill can
 
05:23:04.670 --> 05:23:04.680 align:start position:0%
make a truly positive impact tailored to
 
05:23:07.310 --> 05:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
lak's needs thank
 
05:23:10.788 --> 05:23:10.798 align:start position:0%

enthusiasm and uh striking as I as I

you guys are involved in that um does
 
05:23:26.788 --> 05:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
anyone have any questions for Mr
 
05:23:30.230 --> 05:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
Rondo I see representative Schulz thank
 
05:23:33.868 --> 05:23:33.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair um thank you Miss Dondo for
 
05:23:37.548 --> 05:23:37.558 align:start position:0%
being with us today um I just have a
 
05:23:39.190 --> 05:23:39.200 align:start position:0%
couple questions if it's it's okay Mr
 
05:23:41.788 --> 05:23:41.798 align:start position:0%
chair um first how long did you say
 
05:23:44.830 --> 05:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
you've been involved with with the
 
05:23:47.830 --> 05:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
council uh yes sure so my first year was
 
05:23:49.270 --> 05:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
last year on the council and I'm
 
05:23:50.628 --> 05:23:50.638 align:start position:0%
currently halfway through the second
 
05:23:53.190 --> 05:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
year of my term great I've been to the
 
05:23:57.910 --> 05:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
council it is amazing so would
 
05:24:01.510 --> 05:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
would you rather a new bill with your
 
05:24:04.190 --> 05:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
suggestions and the rest of the um
 
05:24:07.230 --> 05:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
board's suggestions would that perhaps
 
05:24:09.708 --> 05:24:09.718 align:start position:0%
be better
 
05:24:11.230 --> 05:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
I cannot speak on behalf of the whole
 
05:24:13.190 --> 05:24:13.200 align:start position:0%
Council um I'm only here representing
 
05:24:15.510 --> 05:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
myself but I would say that there are
 
05:24:17.350 --> 05:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
changes that can be made and I believe
 
05:24:18.590 --> 05:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
that that could happen either through
 
05:24:20.670 --> 05:24:20.680 align:start position:0%
amending this bill to be more reflective
 
05:24:23.430 --> 05:24:23.440 align:start position:0%
of our needs or by going through with
 
05:24:25.788 --> 05:24:25.798 align:start position:0%
another bill um I know that
 
05:24:27.150 --> 05:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
representative Porter had been planning
 
05:24:29.070 --> 05:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
on introducing a bill regardless perhaps
 
05:24:31.070 --> 05:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
next year so I do believe that changes
 
05:24:32.628 --> 05:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
can be made and I'm open to different
 
05:24:34.470 --> 05:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
avenues for making them happen I think
 
05:24:36.310 --> 05:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
as long as the youth members are
 
05:24:39.510 --> 05:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
consulted in the process um it will be
 
05:24:42.070 --> 05:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
beneficial what's the saying nothing for
 
05:24:45.430 --> 05:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
us without us right thank you for your
 
05:24:48.868 --> 05:24:48.878 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you representative
 
05:24:53.910 --> 05:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you Mr um I just wanted to uh
 
05:24:55.948 --> 05:24:55.958 align:start position:0%
say similar to what the chair has
 
05:24:59.350 --> 05:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
already mentioned that uh I thought Miss
 
05:25:03.110 --> 05:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
St a very cogent argument and appreciate
 
05:25:05.750 --> 05:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
your attendance
 
05:25:09.948 --> 05:25:09.958 align:start position:0%
here representative fellows
 
05:25:13.430 --> 05:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um Miss Dondo can you
 
05:25:15.670 --> 05:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
tell us how many students are on the
 
05:25:17.830 --> 05:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
council and if you think that's a good
 
05:25:20.990 --> 05:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
number or if there should be more or
 
05:25:23.830 --> 05:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
less thank you um currently there are 22
 
05:25:26.030 --> 05:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
members of the council um several of the
 
05:25:28.750 --> 05:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
members are alternates so they are it's
 
05:25:30.510 --> 05:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
very helpful to have them there in case
 
05:25:32.868 --> 05:25:32.878 align:start position:0%
a member cannot attend and um we need to
 
05:25:35.230 --> 05:25:35.240 align:start position:0%
reach quum by having their vote I
 
05:25:37.750 --> 05:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
believe that um the current number is a
 
05:25:40.390 --> 05:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
good one it's big enough to have
 
05:25:41.948 --> 05:25:41.958 align:start position:0%
geographical representation that's
 
05:25:43.788 --> 05:25:43.798 align:start position:0%
diverse but also small enough so that we
 
05:25:46.990 --> 05:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
can work in small groups um as well
 
05:25:49.750 --> 05:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
through our interest group method um
 
05:25:51.390 --> 05:25:51.400 align:start position:0%
ultimately I think that I would be open
 
05:25:53.350 --> 05:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
to both expanding it and keeping it as
 
05:25:56.390 --> 05:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
it is but I think that um our current
 
05:25:59.230 --> 05:25:59.240 align:start position:0%
structure in terms of members has been
 
05:26:01.510 --> 05:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
beneficial thank
 
05:26:05.830 --> 05:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
you any more questions Mr
 
05:26:08.430 --> 05:26:08.440 align:start position:0%

before us um at this point what we're
 
05:26:14.430 --> 05:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
going to do is we're going to recess

05:28:13.788 --> 05:28:13.798 align:start position:0%
the chair stated uh I think uh iing this
 
05:28:16.628 --> 05:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
current bill is the proper thing to do
 
05:28:19.470 --> 05:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
since we cannot officially make study
 
05:28:23.390 --> 05:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
committees and I trust with the chair's
 
05:28:26.110 --> 05:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
intimate knowledge of administrative
 
05:28:29.150 --> 05:28:29.160 align:start position:0%
rules that she will follow through and
 
05:28:32.830 --> 05:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
allow us to study this issue uh the
 
05:28:34.590 --> 05:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
issues that some of the issues that were
 
05:28:36.830 --> 05:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
brought forward when the time is
 
05:28:36.840 --> 05:28:39.390 align:start position:0%
brought forward when the time is
appropriate

05:28:39.390 --> 05:28:39.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
05:28:42.270 --> 05:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
yes well thank you representative
 
05:28:44.830 --> 05:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
Schultz she said it better than I would
 
05:28:47.990 --> 05:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:50.750 --> 05:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
good does anyone else wish to speak
 
05:28:53.190 --> 05:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
about House Bill
 
05:28:57.470 --> 05:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
357 I have a point of order Madame chair
 
05:29:02.070 --> 05:29:02.080 align:start position:0%
yes represent G if we um it all this
 
05:29:05.470 --> 05:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
bill we can still as a committee work on
 
05:29:09.110 --> 05:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
this as a committee or do we need we can
 
05:29:11.628 --> 05:29:11.638 align:start position:0%
work we we you can assign this to us
 
05:29:15.590 --> 05:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
independently of any legislation or any
 
05:29:17.948 --> 05:29:17.958 align:start position:0%
um any other any bills is that correct I
 
05:29:20.830 --> 05:29:20.840 align:start position:0%
think I I believe it okay thank you we
 
05:29:23.868 --> 05:29:23.878 align:start position:0%
can work on the question because
 
05:29:26.350 --> 05:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
administrative rules is within our scope
 
05:29:28.030 --> 05:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
of of
 
05:29:30.350 --> 05:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
authority we don't need a bill to tell
 
05:29:33.628 --> 05:29:33.638 align:start position:0%
us to look into it okay so I would um
 
05:29:35.150 --> 05:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
just so that you know I will support the
 
05:29:37.030 --> 05:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
itl with the understanding that the
 
05:29:39.628 --> 05:29:39.638 align:start position:0%
committee will look at that
 
05:29:41.750 --> 05:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay representative Shu I trust you'll
 
05:29:43.470 --> 05:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
include that in your
 
05:29:47.430 --> 05:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
blurb yes okay is there anyone else who
 
05:29:51.830 --> 05:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:56.070 --> 05:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
357 yes I'd like to say I that I think
 
05:29:59.070 --> 05:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
uh looking into this will be beneficial
 
05:30:01.430 --> 05:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
to especially the new members of the
 
05:30:04.510 --> 05:30:04.520 align:start position:0%
committee who uh are just becoming
 
05:30:05.990 --> 05:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
familiar with the name of the joint
 
05:30:07.628 --> 05:30:07.638 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
 
05:30:07.638 --> 05:30:08.510 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
rules

05:30:08.510 --> 05:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
rules
 
05:30:13.310 --> 05:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
or Jael car uh and uh there are a lot of
 
05:30:17.350 --> 05:30:17.360 align:start position:0%
misconceptions in the body as a whole uh
 
05:30:21.190 --> 05:30:21.200 align:start position:0%
that uh will be beneficially addressed
 
05:30:24.910 --> 05:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
by Edna looking at as a committee of the
 
05:30:27.990 --> 05:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
whole thank you representative
 
05:30:31.350 --> 05:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
Pearson um thank you madam chair if we
 
05:30:34.868 --> 05:30:34.878 align:start position:0%
were to itl this even though we perhaps
 
05:30:36.510 --> 05:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
would have the desire as a community to
 
05:30:38.830 --> 05:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
do some work on it Would we not then be
 
05:30:41.750 --> 05:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
prevented from reintroducing this next
 
05:30:44.430 --> 05:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
year we would be prevented from
 
05:30:46.910 --> 05:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
introducing another study committee we
 
05:30:48.830 --> 05:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
would not be prevented from bringing in
 
05:30:52.470 --> 05:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
a bill on whatever the our study results
 
05:30:54.590 --> 05:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
in needing that needs fixed yeah yeah
 
05:30:57.070 --> 05:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
okay yeah fair enough gotcha thank
 
05:31:02.390 --> 05:31:02.400 align:start position:0%

05:33:05.910 --> 05:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
hb994 I'm sorry I can't couldn't hear
 
05:33:08.590 --> 05:33:08.600 align:start position:0%

05:33:10.070 --> 05:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
yes Chris
 
05:33:14.230 --> 05:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
94 he just answered my question thank
 
05:33:16.868 --> 05:33:16.878 align:start position:0%
you oh
 
05:33:19.230 --> 05:33:19.240 align:start position:0%
okay okay representative leus would you
 
05:33:21.548 --> 05:33:21.558 align:start position:0%
like to speak to your motion I would uh
 
05:33:25.270 --> 05:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um what this does
 
05:33:28.390 --> 05:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
is well a number of things one is it uh
 
05:33:31.548 --> 05:33:31.558 align:start position:0%
has the licenses expire on the birthday
 
05:33:33.270 --> 05:33:33.280 align:start position:0%
of the person who holds the license
 
05:33:35.990 --> 05:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
rather than having all the licenses at
 
05:33:39.270 --> 05:33:39.280 align:start position:0%
least for a particular occupation uh
 
05:33:41.708 --> 05:33:41.718 align:start position:0%
expire at the same time so that'll
 
05:33:45.030 --> 05:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
spread the workload out over time for uh
 
05:33:47.430 --> 05:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
oplc I me that's basically how driver's
 
05:33:51.190 --> 05:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
license uh you know renewal works and uh
 
05:33:53.350 --> 05:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
you know it'll uh even out the workload
 
05:33:55.990 --> 05:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
for them there's some transition uh
 
05:33:57.830 --> 05:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
things in there to get there which I I
 
05:34:01.548 --> 05:34:01.558 align:start position:0%
think U I don't see a problem with and
 
05:34:04.788 --> 05:34:04.798 align:start position:0%
that's that's the main thing it's just a
 
05:34:10.110 --> 05:34:10.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:12.910 --> 05:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
see and for my second I would say that
 
05:34:15.628 --> 05:34:15.638 align:start position:0%
representative leus explained it
 
05:34:17.868 --> 05:34:17.878 align:start position:0%
beautifully does anyone else wish to
 
05:34:19.670 --> 05:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
speak on House Bill
 
05:34:22.470 --> 05:34:22.480 align:start position:0%
94 Peter
 
05:34:25.910 --> 05:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
Schmidt yes representative Schmidt thank
 
05:34:29.150 --> 05:34:29.160 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um let me put
 
05:34:33.948 --> 05:34:33.958 align:start position:0%
my camera on so you can all see me um uh
 
05:34:36.230 --> 05:34:36.240 align:start position:0%
I think one of the other very
 
05:34:40.070 --> 05:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
beneficial aspect is that licenses which
 
05:34:43.110 --> 05:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
expire in one's birth month and specific
 
05:34:46.830 --> 05:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
on on one's birthday are licenses
 
05:34:49.788 --> 05:34:49.798 align:start position:0%
renewal dates that everybody can
 
05:34:52.830 --> 05:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
remember uh as that we remember with our
 
05:34:55.990 --> 05:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
driver's licenses as opposed to one day
 
05:34:58.708 --> 05:34:58.718 align:start position:0%
a year which is made never made any
 
05:35:02.708 --> 05:35:02.718 align:start position:0%
sense to me in the first place so uh
 
05:35:05.708 --> 05:35:05.718 align:start position:0%
just the we we it's easy to forget lots
 
05:35:08.788 --> 05:35:08.798 align:start position:0%
of things but our birthday is not one of
 
05:35:11.750 --> 05:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
them thank you any is there anyone else
 
05:35:15.910 --> 05:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
who wishes to go representative
 
05:35:18.868 --> 05:35:18.878 align:start position:0%
goalie thank you madam chair I just have
 
05:35:20.990 --> 05:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
um one quick question I'm hoping you can
 
05:35:24.430 --> 05:35:24.440 align:start position:0%
answer uh when we do these renewals
 
05:35:29.430 --> 05:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
through um oplc and uh renewal process
 
05:35:31.868 --> 05:35:31.878 align:start position:0%
taking place are the documents that are
 
05:35:34.310 --> 05:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
necessary for Renewal such as continuing
 
05:35:36.510 --> 05:35:36.520 align:start position:0%
ed and the requirements necessary for
 
05:35:38.310 --> 05:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
Renewal those going back to the board
 
05:35:40.510 --> 05:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
before a license is
 
05:35:44.510 --> 05:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
issued for review the requirements for
 
05:35:46.110 --> 05:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
Renewal are not
 
05:35:46.120 --> 05:35:48.070 align:start position:0%
Renewal are not
changing

05:35:48.070 --> 05:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
changing
 
05:35:50.670 --> 05:35:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not sure what you mean by go back
 
05:35:52.390 --> 05:35:52.400 align:start position:0%
to the
 
05:35:54.628 --> 05:35:54.638 align:start position:0%
board well there a number of boards that
 
05:35:56.590 --> 05:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
have renewals that require continuing ed
 
05:36:01.270 --> 05:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
credits or whatnot for Renewal
 
05:36:04.270 --> 05:36:04.280 align:start position:0%
yeah uh the requirements that will the
 
05:36:06.270 --> 05:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
those documents be sent to the board to
 
05:36:07.708 --> 05:36:07.718 align:start position:0%
make sure they're appropriate before
 
05:36:10.510 --> 05:36:10.520 align:start position:0%
their license is renewed that's part of
 
05:36:13.070 --> 05:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
what goes with the renewal license
 
05:36:15.030 --> 05:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
application that they've completed
 
05:36:15.040 --> 05:36:16.670 align:start position:0%
application that they've completed
continuing

05:36:16.670 --> 05:36:16.680 align:start position:0%
continuing
 
05:36:19.510 --> 05:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
education and uh whatever else is
 
05:36:21.190 --> 05:36:21.200 align:start position:0%
required I think that's the main thing
 
05:36:21.200 --> 05:36:22.350 align:start position:0%
required I think that's the main thing
that

05:36:22.350 --> 05:36:22.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:36:24.788 --> 05:36:24.798 align:start position:0%
you you're that you haven't change you
 
05:36:27.190 --> 05:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
haven't moved your address your you've
 
05:36:29.230 --> 05:36:29.240 align:start position:0%
completed the continuing education and
 
05:36:31.270 --> 05:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
you pay the fee of
 
05:36:34.470 --> 05:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
course is there but my question is if
 
05:36:37.310 --> 05:36:37.320 align:start position:0%
there is a review of the continuing ed
 
05:36:39.230 --> 05:36:39.240 align:start position:0%
the make sure it's appropriate for
 
05:36:42.030 --> 05:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
renewal is it oplc making that
 
05:36:43.270 --> 05:36:43.280 align:start position:0%
determination or is it going to be the
 
05:36:45.910 --> 05:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
board that sees that documentation for
 
05:36:48.310 --> 05:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
generally the board
 
05:36:50.510 --> 05:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
does all right as long as that's going
 
05:36:53.788 --> 05:36:53.798 align:start position:0%
back to the board and uh that's part of
 
05:36:56.190 --> 05:36:56.200 align:start position:0%
this process I will support
 
05:37:00.030 --> 05:37:00.040 align:start position:0%
it I will say that there's no change
 
05:37:02.230 --> 05:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
this bill does not change the renewal
 
05:37:04.350 --> 05:37:04.360 align:start position:0%
process other than the
 
05:37:07.750 --> 05:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
date the the current requirement ments
 
05:37:10.470 --> 05:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
for continuing education and who who
 
05:37:12.548 --> 05:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
reviews it is not
 
05:37:15.670 --> 05:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
changed thank
 
05:37:21.070 --> 05:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:23.948 --> 05:37:23.958 align:start position:0%

05:37:26.590 --> 05:37:26.600 align:start position:0%

to pass on House Bill
 
05:39:01.150 --> 05:39:01.160 align:start position:0%
302 which is the creation and use of
 
05:39:07.628 --> 05:39:07.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:14.628 --> 05:39:14.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:16.628 --> 05:39:16.638 align:start position:0%
you all
 
05:39:19.468 --> 05:39:19.478 align:start position:0%
right you I don't wish to speak on the
 
05:39:20.948 --> 05:39:20.958 align:start position:0%
motion representative Schmidt do you
 
05:39:22.468 --> 05:39:22.478 align:start position:0%
wish to speak on your
 
05:39:29.110 --> 05:39:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:31.468 --> 05:39:31.478 align:start position:0%
straightforward does anyone else wish to
 
05:39:36.310 --> 05:39:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:39.990 --> 05:39:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:45.110 --> 05:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam chair uh the I
 
05:39:46.750 --> 05:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
only have one concern and it's really
 
05:39:51.548 --> 05:39:51.558 align:start position:0%
not earth shattering here it's simply
 
05:39:53.830 --> 05:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
the simple concern that I have is that
 
05:39:57.628 --> 05:39:57.638 align:start position:0%
electronic records require electronic
 
05:40:00.230 --> 05:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
programming and as I've worked for the
 
05:40:03.590 --> 05:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
government now for 25 years we have
 
05:40:07.670 --> 05:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
records that we cannot access because we
 
05:40:09.628 --> 05:40:09.638 align:start position:0%
either no longer have the program to
 
05:40:13.948 --> 05:40:13.958 align:start position:0%
open said records or we lack the
 
05:40:15.390 --> 05:40:15.400 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge of the
 
05:40:17.868 --> 05:40:17.878 align:start position:0%
appropriate way to log into said
 
05:40:22.030 --> 05:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
records that that is a very real problem
 
05:40:22.040 --> 05:40:23.830 align:start position:0%
records that that is a very real problem
here

05:40:23.830 --> 05:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:40:27.910 --> 05:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
and you know I'm I'm certainly hopeful
 
05:40:30.548 --> 05:40:30.558 align:start position:0%
that you know this this bill certainly
 
05:40:32.190 --> 05:40:32.200 align:start position:0%
would allow and I don't see any
 
05:40:34.990 --> 05:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
prohibition of backing things up on in
 
05:40:37.070 --> 05:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
other formats whether it be microfilm or
 
05:40:40.430 --> 05:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
something else but it's just uh it's not
 
05:40:42.310 --> 05:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
really going to affect necessarily I
 
05:40:44.350 --> 05:40:44.360 align:start position:0%
suppose the way I vote it's just it's
 
05:40:46.230 --> 05:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
just something that we have to
 
05:40:48.350 --> 05:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
remember that's
 
05:40:50.788 --> 05:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
all thank you that's a very valid
 
05:40:53.468 --> 05:40:53.478 align:start position:0%
concern I know NASA has hundreds of
 
05:40:55.430 --> 05:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
thousands of hours of data that's no
 
05:40:55.440 --> 05:41:01.590 align:start position:0%
thousands of hours of data that's no
longer

05:41:01.590 --> 05:41:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:03.708 --> 05:41:03.718 align:start position:0%
accessible does anyone else wish to
 
05:41:09.628 --> 05:41:09.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:09.638 --> 05:41:11.708 align:start position:0%
 
well

05:41:11.708 --> 05:41:11.718 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:41:17.350 --> 05:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
IES I I'll just say that paper records
 
05:41:20.310 --> 05:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
um there there some paper records out
 
05:41:21.868 --> 05:41:21.878 align:start position:0%
there they're written on something
 
05:41:21.878 --> 05:41:23.030 align:start position:0%
there they're written on something
called

05:41:23.030 --> 05:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
called
 
05:41:27.230 --> 05:41:27.240 align:start position:0%
Papyrus um and they're WR written
 
05:41:32.868 --> 05:41:32.878 align:start position:0%
sometimes in in uh in um linear a and
 
05:41:36.590 --> 05:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
Linear B and or they're written in
 
05:41:39.030 --> 05:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
what's called bodon I think is the name
 
05:41:43.510 --> 05:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
of the term which means as the as the ox
 
05:41:45.868 --> 05:41:45.878 align:start position:0%
plows going back and forth and back and
 
05:41:47.910 --> 05:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
forth not the way we read left to right
 
05:41:50.350 --> 05:41:50.360 align:start position:0%
then left to right then left to right or
 
05:41:53.150 --> 05:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
the Japanese read top to bottom top to
 
05:41:55.708 --> 05:41:55.718 align:start position:0%
bottom um so they're all kinds of
 
05:41:58.590 --> 05:41:58.600 align:start position:0%
written records which are basically
 
05:42:01.670 --> 05:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
inaccessible or you have to be uh
 
05:42:01.680 --> 05:42:03.190 align:start position:0%
inaccessible or you have to be uh
extremely

05:42:03.190 --> 05:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
extremely
 
05:42:08.270 --> 05:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
skilled try reading old German script um
 
05:42:11.270 --> 05:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
records that are written in that these
 
05:42:13.270 --> 05:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
are all things that are written either
 
05:42:16.868 --> 05:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
on paper or uh or very similar
 
05:42:19.548 --> 05:42:19.558 align:start position:0%
substances which are extremely difficult
 
05:42:24.910 --> 05:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
to access um but uh one of the things we
 
05:42:28.430 --> 05:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
have to do is uh develop something which
 
05:42:33.670 --> 05:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
is um more universally available and not
 
05:42:35.628 --> 05:42:35.638 align:start position:0%
go away from it so
 
05:42:38.990 --> 05:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
obviously it it easier said than done I
 
05:42:41.708 --> 05:42:41.718 align:start position:0%
know thank you representative scitec
 
05:42:43.350 --> 05:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt have you seen my
 
05:42:45.990 --> 05:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
first teaching certificate you might
 
05:42:49.430 --> 05:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
want it's in Linear B yes you like to
 
05:42:53.310 --> 05:42:53.320 align:start position:0%
look at it l written in Linear B is
 
05:42:53.320 --> 05:42:58.830 align:start position:0%
look at it l written in Linear B is
it

05:42:58.830 --> 05:42:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:01.350 --> 05:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
later all right does anyone else wish
 
05:43:04.468 --> 05:43:04.478 align:start position:0%
repres like us um do you or anyone else
 
05:43:07.990 --> 05:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
know to what extent they're already uh
 
05:43:09.788 --> 05:43:09.798 align:start position:0%
standards that have been created and me
 
05:43:12.110 --> 05:43:12.120 align:start position:0%
this mentions that they're uh the
 
05:43:13.628 --> 05:43:13.638 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and cooperation
 
05:43:15.830 --> 05:43:15.840 align:start position:0%

05:43:19.830 --> 05:43:19.840 align:start position:0%
Services um was shall determine whether
 
05:43:21.510 --> 05:43:21.520 align:start position:0%
and to what extent now it says mayate
 
05:43:24.230 --> 05:43:24.240 align:start position:0%
standards if we pass this um do you know
 
05:43:26.868 --> 05:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
if there are existing standards and are
 
05:43:29.150 --> 05:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
are they generally used and do you know
 
05:43:30.390 --> 05:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
anything about
 
05:43:38.110 --> 05:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:40.510 --> 05:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
I do know that municipalities are using
 
05:43:43.390 --> 05:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
electronic records of various sorts but
 
05:43:45.670 --> 05:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know what standards they're F
 
05:43:47.270 --> 05:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
this is permissive right this is
 
05:43:47.280 --> 05:43:49.070 align:start position:0%
this is permissive right this is
permissive

05:43:49.070 --> 05:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
permissive
 
05:43:50.910 --> 05:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
permissive maybe one there a study
 
05:43:55.190 --> 05:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:57.670 --> 05:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
into is there anyone else who wishes to
 
05:44:00.510 --> 05:44:00.520 align:start position:0%
speak on House Bill
 
05:44:03.510 --> 05:44:03.520 align:start position:0%

05:46:56.990 --> 05:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
amendment number is
 
05:46:57.000 --> 05:46:59.548 align:start position:0%

202-

05:46:59.548 --> 05:46:59.558 align:start position:0%
202-
 
05:47:03.830 --> 05:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
0239 H that's the that's the um one from
 
05:47:06.390 --> 05:47:06.400 align:start position:0%
today it's slightly different than the
 
05:47:10.110 --> 05:47:10.120 align:start position:0%
one that sponsors showed us I'll second
 
05:47:13.310 --> 05:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
that all right one moment while I get
 
05:47:15.510 --> 05:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
cleared do you wish to speak to your
 
05:47:19.350 --> 05:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
motion yes what was the amendment number
 
05:47:22.310 --> 05:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment number is
 
05:47:27.230 --> 05:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
0239 and it was um sent out to you by
 
05:47:31.230 --> 05:47:31.240 align:start position:0%
Miriam uh just this morning so we don't
 
05:47:32.468 --> 05:47:32.478 align:start position:0%
have it in hard
 
05:47:35.830 --> 05:47:35.840 align:start position:0%
copy you you're changing the definitions
 
05:47:37.468 --> 05:47:37.478 align:start position:0%
right those there's three three
 
05:47:40.830 --> 05:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
definition changes okay um yeah just
 
05:47:40.840 --> 05:47:41.990 align:start position:0%
definition changes okay um yeah just
just

05:47:41.990 --> 05:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:47:45.750 --> 05:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
changing one um just changing the
 
05:47:49.030 --> 05:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
definition of mushroom the two things
 
05:47:51.230 --> 05:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
under that are identical it's just that
 
05:47:54.868 --> 05:47:54.878 align:start position:0%
the mushrooms is being slid into a slot
 
05:47:57.468 --> 05:47:57.478 align:start position:0%
um not at the end so it's just
 
05:48:00.350 --> 05:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
renumbering the other two if if you
 
05:48:02.788 --> 05:48:02.798 align:start position:0%
don't have this amendment the the
 
05:48:04.670 --> 05:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
difference between this and the first
 
05:48:07.788 --> 05:48:07.798 align:start position:0%
amendment is that it just um
 
05:48:10.030 --> 05:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
changes a couple of the words I think
 
05:48:14.310 --> 05:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
the first one s said mushrooms means the
 
05:48:17.830 --> 05:48:17.840 align:start position:0%
fruiting body of a fungus and this one
 
05:48:21.948 --> 05:48:21.958 align:start position:0%
says mushrooms mean the fleshy Spore
 
05:48:24.910 --> 05:48:24.920 align:start position:0%
bearing fruiting body of a
 
05:48:28.390 --> 05:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
fungus and the reason for this update is
 
05:48:30.310 --> 05:48:30.320 align:start position:0%
that there was some
 
05:48:33.030 --> 05:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
confusion particularly for the general
 
05:48:34.510 --> 05:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
public about
 
05:48:37.590 --> 05:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
chaga which is a
 
05:48:37.600 --> 05:48:39.510 align:start position:0%
chaga which is a
hard

05:48:39.510 --> 05:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
hard
 
05:48:42.270 --> 05:48:42.280 align:start position:0%
substance looks like charcoal that grows
 
05:48:47.670 --> 05:48:47.680 align:start position:0%
on a tree and people um pulverize it and
 
05:48:51.590 --> 05:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
they use it for tea and um the wild
 
05:48:53.350 --> 05:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
mushrooms we're talking about or
 
05:48:55.110 --> 05:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
something that you throw in a pan and
 
05:48:58.788 --> 05:48:58.798 align:start position:0%
cook so this definition um makes it
 
05:49:02.910 --> 05:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
clear that chaga is completely outside
 
05:49:08.030 --> 05:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:10.190 --> 05:49:10.200 align:start position:0%
are there question not only not only
 
05:49:14.430 --> 05:49:14.440 align:start position:0%
that but this uh line four is could be a
 
05:49:17.708 --> 05:49:17.718 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty terrific insult you fleshy
 
05:49:20.270 --> 05:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
Spore bearing fooding body of a
 
05:49:29.590 --> 05:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:32.510 --> 05:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
top does anyone else wish to speak about
 
05:49:38.350 --> 05:49:38.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:40.670 --> 05:49:40.680 align:start position:0%

05:50:00.390 --> 05:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
mushroom and tier 2 mushroom into the
 
05:50:02.468 --> 05:50:02.478 align:start position:0%

okay do you wish to speak to your
 
05:52:15.750 --> 05:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
motion um yes Madam chair um the purpose
 
05:52:20.310 --> 05:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
of this this bill resulted from a study
 
05:52:23.270 --> 05:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
commission that we had that involved
 
05:52:26.670 --> 05:52:26.680 align:start position:0%
mushroom experts um and included Colleen
 
05:52:28.548 --> 05:52:28.558 align:start position:0%
Smith from the Department of
 
05:52:32.230 --> 05:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
Health and uh the primary and also
 
05:52:36.110 --> 05:52:36.120 align:start position:0%
included a chef the primary reason for
 
05:52:39.708 --> 05:52:39.718 align:start position:0%
this bill is to protect Public Safety
 
05:52:45.030 --> 05:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
Public Health um we know that mushrooms
 
05:52:48.110 --> 05:52:48.120 align:start position:0%
are being sold that wild harvested this
 
05:52:49.390 --> 05:52:49.400 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with mushrooms that
 
05:52:51.350 --> 05:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
you buy in the grocery store Wild
 
05:52:54.030 --> 05:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
Harvest mushrooms were being sold at
 
05:52:57.030 --> 05:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
farmers markets into restaurants and
 
05:52:59.548 --> 05:52:59.558 align:start position:0%
while most of the time the mushrooms
 
05:53:02.070 --> 05:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
that were sold were safe they were not
 
05:53:04.390 --> 05:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
always safe and some of them were were
 
05:53:07.150 --> 05:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
even dangerous for people
 
05:53:10.670 --> 05:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
um the other thing that was important is
 
05:53:15.310 --> 05:53:15.320 align:start position:0%
that um right now A restaurant is not
 
05:53:19.750 --> 05:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
allowed to serve wild mushrooms because
 
05:53:23.110 --> 05:53:23.120 align:start position:0%
the food code that New Hampshire uses
 
05:53:26.070 --> 05:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
which is based on the federal food code
 
05:53:30.590 --> 05:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
says you can um serve and sell wild
 
05:53:34.670 --> 05:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
mushrooms only if they have been a from
 
05:53:36.990 --> 05:53:37.000 align:start position:0%
if only if they come from an approved D
 
05:53:41.070 --> 05:53:41.080 align:start position:0%
source so right now no New Hampshire has
 
05:53:45.070 --> 05:53:45.080 align:start position:0%
no statutes that identify an approved
 
05:53:48.868 --> 05:53:48.878 align:start position:0%
Source this process in this bill will
 
05:53:52.590 --> 05:53:52.600 align:start position:0%
create an an approved source so that
 
05:53:54.708 --> 05:53:54.718 align:start position:0%
restaurants can serve these mushrooms
 
05:53:58.070 --> 05:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
and they can be sold at at
 
05:54:01.830 --> 05:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
um farmers markets we did also hear
 
05:54:05.230 --> 05:54:05.240 align:start position:0%
stories about how the food inspectors
 
05:54:08.190 --> 05:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
would go to a rest and sometimes see
 
05:54:10.030 --> 05:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
that the restaurant has bought had
 
05:54:13.070 --> 05:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
bought some wild mushrooms and had to
 
05:54:15.750 --> 05:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
tell them because of the food code that
 
05:54:17.310 --> 05:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
they had to throw those out and they
 
05:54:19.788 --> 05:54:19.798 align:start position:0%
they could not serve them so this is
 
05:54:22.590 --> 05:54:22.600 align:start position:0%
good for business it um Can the
 
05:54:25.788 --> 05:54:25.798 align:start position:0%
restaurants can make dishes of wild
 
05:54:27.990 --> 05:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
mushrooms which usually are fairly
 
05:54:45.230 --> 05:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:47.350 --> 05:54:47.360 align:start position:0%
do any representative Schultz do you
 
05:54:50.270 --> 05:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
wish to speak I trust representative
 
05:54:55.590 --> 05:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:55.600 --> 05:54:57.510 align:start position:0%
 
fastidiousness

05:54:57.510 --> 05:54:57.520 align:start position:0%
fastidiousness
 
05:55:02.990 --> 05:55:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:09.670 --> 05:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:12.990 --> 05:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
well it's a good idea but I really it's
 
05:55:15.110 --> 05:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
not a topic for today but the federal
 
05:55:17.670 --> 05:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
government is just
 
05:55:23.590 --> 05:55:23.600 align:start position:0%
everywhere what and it's a good idea
 
05:55:26.150 --> 05:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
next representative
 
05:55:30.310 --> 05:55:30.320 align:start position:0%
leas um I agree with what at least about
 
05:55:32.070 --> 05:55:32.080 align:start position:0%
the the federal government issue I think
 
05:55:35.270 --> 05:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
the error was uh New Hampshire adopting
 
05:55:37.070 --> 05:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
the rules from the Federal food code in
 
05:55:39.190 --> 05:55:39.200 align:start position:0%
the first place concerning
 
05:55:42.030 --> 05:55:42.040 align:start position:0%
mushrooms um so I'm uh I'm torn on this
 
05:55:45.510 --> 05:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
on one hand I I really do not want uh
 
05:55:48.628 --> 05:55:48.638 align:start position:0%
any more licensing on the other hand I
 
05:55:50.110 --> 05:55:50.120 align:start position:0%
understand the position the mushroom
 
05:55:51.670 --> 05:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
Harvesters are
 
05:55:54.868 --> 05:55:54.878 align:start position:0%
in representative yes we didn't have a
 
05:55:57.430 --> 05:55:57.440 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a you you're on jail car
 
05:56:00.510 --> 05:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a choice did we we must
 
05:56:02.430 --> 05:56:02.440 align:start position:0%
these restaurants could not
 
05:56:05.788 --> 05:56:05.798 align:start position:0%
serve I'm not sure it was obvious to me
 
05:56:07.830 --> 05:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
it wasn't obvious to me at least when it
 
05:56:11.190 --> 05:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
came to Jael car that we were adopting
 
05:56:14.150 --> 05:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
that much I
 
05:56:17.750 --> 05:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
mean well it still seems like a good
 
05:56:17.760 --> 05:56:23.788 align:start position:0%
mean well it still seems like a good
idea

05:56:23.788 --> 05:56:23.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:28.868 --> 05:56:28.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:33.390 --> 05:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
speak yes Madam chair represent
 
05:56:37.270 --> 05:56:37.280 align:start position:0%
peon thank you as a uh as a former
 
05:56:40.110 --> 05:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
professional pizza maker I've seen uh
 
05:56:43.150 --> 05:56:43.160 align:start position:0%
many a pie ruined with the uh with the
 
05:56:45.270 --> 05:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
fungus and the F4 mentioned bill but I
 
05:56:47.670 --> 05:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
am going to support this because I
 
05:56:49.948 --> 05:56:49.958 align:start position:0%
recognize the struggles that especially
 
05:56:52.750 --> 05:56:52.760 align:start position:0%
at the farmers markets with the people's
 
05:56:54.830 --> 05:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
desire to do the right thing and and
 
05:56:57.350 --> 05:56:57.360 align:start position:0%
lacking uh subsid of
 
05:57:00.070 --> 05:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
direction to do so so I'm I'm going to
 
05:57:05.150 --> 05:57:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:08.110 --> 05:57:08.120 align:start position:0%
this is there is there anyone else who
 
05:57:11.110 --> 05:57:11.120 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak representative font
 
05:57:14.190 --> 05:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
now thank you madam chair yes I too when
 
05:57:16.310 --> 05:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
when we first heard this bill uh in the
 
05:57:20.270 --> 05:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
last session was very uh reluctant
 
05:57:21.868 --> 05:57:21.878 align:start position:0%
because I thought it was you know
 
05:57:23.628 --> 05:57:23.638 align:start position:0%
overreach of
 
05:57:26.270 --> 05:57:26.280 align:start position:0%
legislation uh however through all the
 
05:57:29.310 --> 05:57:29.320 align:start position:0%
testimony from the restaurant tours and
 
05:57:29.320 --> 05:57:30.670 align:start position:0%
testimony from the restaurant tours and
mushroom

05:57:30.670 --> 05:57:30.680 align:start position:0%
mushroom
 
05:57:34.270 --> 05:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
Growers I now view it more as enabling
 
05:57:36.708 --> 05:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
legislation than restrictive
 
05:57:39.150 --> 05:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
legislation that it it allows the
 
05:57:41.708 --> 05:57:41.718 align:start position:0%
restaurants and the farmers markets to
 
05:57:44.430 --> 05:57:44.440 align:start position:0%
uh to do something legally that they've
 
05:57:46.430 --> 05:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
probably already been doing so I will
 
05:57:46.440 --> 05:57:47.750 align:start position:0%
probably already been doing so I will
support

05:57:47.750 --> 05:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
support
 
05:57:47.760 --> 05:57:50.150 align:start position:0%
support
it

05:57:50.150 --> 05:57:50.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:57:54.150 --> 05:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:57.750 --> 05:57:57.760 align:start position:0%
else yeah I'm very torn on this because
 
05:58:01.030 --> 05:58:01.040 align:start position:0%
I think the license is is ridiculous but
 
05:58:03.670 --> 05:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
on the other hand we have federal
 
05:58:05.030 --> 05:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
regulations that are even more
 
05:58:07.030 --> 05:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
ridiculous that are restricting what we
 
05:58:11.190 --> 05:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
can do and so it's a question of how
 
05:58:14.350 --> 05:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
we how we accept
 
05:58:17.430 --> 05:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
that anyone
 
05:58:22.310 --> 05:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
else sure yes representative
 
05:58:25.110 --> 05:58:25.120 align:start position:0%
sorry so are we going to support our
 
05:58:29.670 --> 05:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
Merchants our Harvesters our restaurants
 
05:58:33.430 --> 05:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
or are we not this bill lets us to
 
05:58:38.708 --> 05:58:38.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:40.830 --> 05:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
I would just like to add it also creates

05:58:48.310 --> 05:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
who gets a to several people who get a
 
05:58:50.628 --> 05:58:50.638 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of income from
 
05:58:53.628 --> 05:58:53.638 align:start position:0%

06:03:03.230 --> 06:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
favor of of the concept of a lieutenant
 
06:03:08.910 --> 06:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:10.750 --> 06:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
what I missed that you said you're
 
06:03:12.230 --> 06:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to the bill as
 
06:03:15.510 --> 06:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
written rect moo that is correct I am
 
06:03:18.948 --> 06:03:18.958 align:start position:0%
opposed to this number seven as it is
 
06:03:18.958 --> 06:03:20.468 align:start position:0%
opposed to this number seven as it is
written

06:03:20.468 --> 06:03:20.478 align:start position:0%
written
 
06:03:24.030 --> 06:03:24.040 align:start position:0%
um I also have a technical
 
06:03:28.510 --> 06:03:28.520 align:start position:0%
issue that um the what I see on the web
 
06:03:31.708 --> 06:03:31.718 align:start position:0%
and what I print out it's not drafted
 
06:03:34.190 --> 06:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
correctly not all the the inserts are
 
06:03:39.468 --> 06:03:39.478 align:start position:0%
not bold after you get onto page four so
 
06:03:42.468 --> 06:03:42.478 align:start position:0%
I think that could create a
 
06:03:42.478 --> 06:03:44.750 align:start position:0%
I think that could create a
problem

06:03:44.750 --> 06:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
problem
 
06:03:48.230 --> 06:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
I I'm not in favor of the bill at all
 
06:03:50.990 --> 06:03:51.000 align:start position:0%
does someone have a motion presumably of
 
06:03:53.868 --> 06:03:53.878 align:start position:0%
itl my comments
 
06:03:59.150 --> 06:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
itl I Schmid Schmid moves itl all right
 
06:03:59.160 --> 06:04:03.548 align:start position:0%
itl I Schmid Schmid moves itl all right
I

06:04:03.548 --> 06:04:03.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:06.948 --> 06:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
second unless somebody else wants to
 
06:04:09.628 --> 06:04:09.638 align:start position:0%
wasn't representative Pearson first in
 
06:04:12.468 --> 06:04:12.478 align:start position:0%
line oh sorry representative Pearson
 
06:04:14.110 --> 06:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
would you like the honor of seconding I
 
06:04:16.350 --> 06:04:16.360 align:start position:0%
would I would gladly share that with you
 
06:04:18.150 --> 06:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
you know it's
 
06:04:20.750 --> 06:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's I'm not gonna lose sleep either way
 
06:04:23.230 --> 06:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't matter as a test before we
 
06:04:25.868 --> 06:04:25.878 align:start position:0%
spend a lot of time discussing this is
 
06:04:28.948 --> 06:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
there anyone I is there anyone who is
 
06:04:33.150 --> 06:04:33.160 align:start position:0%
going to definitely vote against the
 
06:04:41.750 --> 06:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:50.270 --> 06:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:52.628 --> 06:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
against so it sounds like it's going to
 
06:04:54.868 --> 06:04:54.878 align:start position:0%
be unanimously
 
06:04:54.878 --> 06:04:58.270 align:start position:0%
be unanimously

06:04:58.270 --> 06:04:58.280 align:start position:0%

U I'm sorry madam chair did you say that
 
06:05:02.750 --> 06:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
there was it was unnecessary for lengthy
 
06:05:05.390 --> 06:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
debate on this is that what I heard no I
 
06:05:06.910 --> 06:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
was just going
 
06:05:09.788 --> 06:05:09.798 align:start position:0%
to ask if anyone is definitely going to
 
06:05:11.868 --> 06:05:11.878 align:start position:0%
vote against it to see how much time we
 
06:05:14.788 --> 06:05:14.798 align:start position:0%
should devote to it if everybody already
 
06:05:17.548 --> 06:05:17.558 align:start position:0%
agrees with representative Schmidt then
 
06:05:20.430 --> 06:05:20.440 align:start position:0%

06:05:24.070 --> 06:05:24.080 align:start position:0%

06:05:26.788 --> 06:05:26.798 align:start position:0%
