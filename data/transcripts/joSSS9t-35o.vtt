to search a motor vehicle
 
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is a very similar if not exact
 
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.909 align:start position:0%
this bill is a very similar if not exact
initially

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 align:start position:0%
initially
 
00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
exact bill of one that was started in
 
00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:25.759 align:start position:0%
the house
 
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
as you
 
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
or many of you know
 
00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 align:start position:0%
uh oftentimes bills are started both in
 
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
the house and in the senate
 
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
each line
 
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
we have at least two bites of the apple
 
00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 align:start position:0%
if necessary
 
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
so this one was passed through your
 
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.350 align:start position:0%
so this one was passed through your
committee

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 align:start position:0%
and is now in front of your house
 
00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 align:start position:0%
version is in front of my committee over
 
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.030 align:start position:0%
in the senate
and

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
this varies
 
00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
very little
 
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 align:start position:0%
from the one you issued to us except
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
you'll notice
 
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
the changes the amendment do you have
 
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
so that is a that amendment
 
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
is a request from the courts
 
00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
in order to amend statutory requirements
 
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
for a search warrant
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
and it allows consistency with the
 
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
it changes the verbiage
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
from affidavit to win statement under
 
00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:45.830 align:start position:0%
from affidavit to win statement under
oath

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
that's the gist of the bill any
 
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.710 align:start position:0%
that's the gist of the bill any
questions

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 align:start position:0%

uh
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
verbiage of written statement change is
 
00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.469 align:start position:0%
verbiage of written statement change is
that

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
what the court has requested
 
00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:14.629 align:start position:0%

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
reason why that uh
 
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
written statement under oath was uh
 
00:06:31.029 --> 00:06:31.039 align:start position:0%
better than the affidavit
 
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
uh they said it was similar and it would
 
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
streamline the process for them

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:38.479 align:start position:0%
see seeing no hands right i want to

thank you all very much we'll be seeing
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.360 align:start position:0%
if there are any members of the public
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
who are in attendance that wish to
 
00:07:51.039 --> 00:07:53.029 align:start position:0%
who are in attendance that wish to
testify

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
testify
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.869 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:08:08.869 --> 00:08:08.879 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman members of the
 
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
committee my name is richard head i'm
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
the government affairs coordinator for
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch uh speaking in favor
 
00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
of part two of senate bills
 
00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.110 align:start position:0%
of part two of senate bills
40

00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
40
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
which deals with the search warrant form
 
00:08:27.189 --> 00:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
this was uh a request as senator french
 
00:08:29.029 --> 00:08:29.039 align:start position:0%
said of the judicial branch
 
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
it was added on to his bill as unrelated
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
to part one of the bill
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
um but it was added in after the um
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
after the court did a study evaluation
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
of the warren process and one of the
 
00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:43.919 align:start position:0%
recommendations out of that
 
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920 align:start position:0%
was to become what's called siegis
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
compliant the criminal justice
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
information system
 
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:51.760 align:start position:0%
which sets a baseline standard for
 
00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:54.240 align:start position:0%
security in various aspects of law
 
00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement including search warrants
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
and one of the aspects of that was to
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
a recommendation
 
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:02.790 align:start position:0%
a recommendation
the

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement convert to using the law
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
enforcement enterprise portal leap
 
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
which is hosted by the fbi it provides a
 
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
secure remote and telephonic warrant
 
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.949 align:start position:0%
secure remote and telephonic warrant
system

00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:14.959 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:17.920 align:start position:0%
and does so at no cost to the state
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
so essentially what what we want to move
 
00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
towards is a more secure process
 
00:09:25.829 --> 00:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
and one of the elements of that is
 
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the
 
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
the telephonics oath process that is
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
currently in place and authorized by new
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire statute
 
00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
but in order to become more sieges
 
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
compliant the the goal is to have the
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
warrant itself be self um
 
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.030 align:start position:0%
warrant itself be self um
a

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:46.880 align:start position:0%
self-sworn document so it doesn't
 
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.630 align:start position:0%
self-sworn document so it doesn't
require

00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:48.640 align:start position:0%
require
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
a telephonic access which which in off
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
hours can involve cell phones or other
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
communications which are not as secure
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
as other forms of communication
 
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
so this allows
 
00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
the document instead of doing it with an
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
affidavit and a swearing
 
00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
the document itself becomes
 
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
self-executing it is still a statement
 
00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
under oath
 
00:10:14.069 --> 00:10:14.079 align:start position:0%
it does not require a separate swearing
 
00:10:14.079 --> 00:10:15.110 align:start position:0%
it does not require a separate swearing
process

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
with a judge
 
00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:18.959 align:start position:0%
so essentially the the for it's a change
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
to the form that is that exists by
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
statute uh and it makes those changes so
 
00:10:26.949 --> 00:10:26.959 align:start position:0%
that it no longer would have to be
 
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
through an affidavit but would be a
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
written statement under oath
 
00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
that is signed by the executing officer
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's a process that came out
 
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
of a review that the court did with
 
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
prosecutors and um
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
in this
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
and the attorney general's office
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
involved in that with that i'd be happy
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
seeking your hands raised the witnesses
 
00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:02.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes
 
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
uh chief david goldstein
 
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.990 align:start position:0%

list of
these

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
assignments to testify
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
you don't
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%

and i signed in as neutral for the
 
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.829 align:start position:0%
and i signed in as neutral for the
the

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:53.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire association of chiefs of
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
police and we sincerely appreciate the
 
00:11:59.670 --> 00:11:59.680 align:start position:0%
work that senator french has done on
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
this and our conversations with him and
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
we certainly appreciate the since the
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill but we have just a
 
00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.310 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill but we have just a
very

00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
very
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
small concern about some of the language
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
as drafted
 
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
and i'll go right into that first and
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
foremost relative to that we're we're
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting adding the word solely in uh
 
00:12:21.829 --> 00:12:21.839 align:start position:0%
para one section d
 
00:12:23.509 --> 00:12:23.519 align:start position:0%
uh which would then read the operator
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
cannot be further detained solely for
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
refusing a consent to search
 
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.190 align:start position:0%
refusing a consent to search
um

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
the reason for this is because we feel
 
00:12:31.839 --> 00:12:32.629 align:start position:0%
the reason for this is because we feel
that

00:12:32.629 --> 00:12:32.639 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh if the individual and they have every
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
right to decides that we should not have
 
00:12:39.509 --> 00:12:39.519 align:start position:0%
they won't consent to a search let's say
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
of a motor vehicle does that mean that
 
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
as we're walking around the vehicle we
 
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:45.440 align:start position:0%
see blood dripping from the trunk does
 
00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:47.600 align:start position:0%
that mean we have to cease any and all
 
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:49.600 align:start position:0%
contact with that individual in further
 
00:12:51.990 --> 00:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
investigation so we feel by adding that
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
word um we can forestall any of that
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
i would like to offer just by way of
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
some quick information and background
 
00:13:02.949 --> 00:13:02.959 align:start position:0%
that there are oftentimes circumstances
 
00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:03.750 align:start position:0%
that there are oftentimes circumstances
and

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
quite frankly when law enforcement
 
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
officers wouldn't be doing their jobs by
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
beta by um detaining individuals and
 
00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
investigating further
 
00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.350 align:start position:0%
investigating further
um

00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:15.190 --> 00:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
and even after first contact with an
 
00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:16.880 align:start position:0%
individual should something else be
 
00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
observed it's very important that we
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
follow through with that um
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
we were going to testify on uh power on
 
00:13:26.949 --> 00:13:26.959 align:start position:0%
section two however we understand where
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
the courts are coming from and certainly
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
we have no problem with that
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh quite frankly there are numerous
 
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
there's no real law pertaining to um
 
00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
any consent searches or what have you in
 
00:13:40.389 --> 00:13:40.399 align:start position:0%
fact the united states constitution
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
doesn't even mention the word privacy uh
 
00:13:44.629 --> 00:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
it's actually established through the
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
bill of rights and through a number of
 
00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:49.760 align:start position:0%
examples of case law
 
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:50.870 align:start position:0%
examples of case law
and

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
we can ask for consent and of the four
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
police departments that i have served
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
over 41 years each and every department
 
00:13:59.040 --> 00:13:59.990 align:start position:0%
over 41 years each and every department
has

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:14:01.670 --> 00:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
a form that
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
informs an individual that they have a
 
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:06.959 align:start position:0%
constitutional right not to have their
 
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle premises themselves searched if
 
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
you will and certainly there are certain
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
exceptions that the supreme court has
 
00:14:15.509 --> 00:14:15.519 align:start position:0%
recognized over the years
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
we have uh decades of legal decisions
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
between both state and federal courts
 
00:14:22.389 --> 00:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
relative to this and we feel that in
 
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.560 align:start position:0%
many many cases this uh the discretion
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
should be left to the courts as to
 
00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not the uh police officer has
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
overstepped his or her bounds in
 
00:14:33.189 --> 00:14:33.199 align:start position:0%
conducting a search so with that i'll
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
end my testimony and certainly i'm happy
 
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:36.560 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions the committee
 
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
seen no hands raised i want to take it
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
with us for a second
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:59.910 --> 00:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
what you can recognize is
 
00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:15.750 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:17.910 --> 00:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you members
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
i uh i've been in front of the committee
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
give you a lengthy introduction nice as
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
i'm required to say
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh the opinions i expressed today are
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
solely mine they're not the opinions of
 
00:15:36.710 --> 00:15:36.720 align:start position:0%
the law school or of unh proper um
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
um i i worked both with senator french
 
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
and representative roy on each of their
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
bills representative roy was the prime
 
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh of hb 485 which uh is in the
 
00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.240 align:start position:0%
senate and before the senate judiciary
 
00:15:54.389 --> 00:15:54.399 align:start position:0%
committee right now
 
00:15:57.189 --> 00:15:57.199 align:start position:0%
i am obviously in support of sb40 i
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea um i'm not going
 
00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:02.320 align:start position:0%
to repeat uh what i said to this
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
committee when i testified in favor of
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
hb 485
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
i refer the committee to my written
 
00:16:10.829 --> 00:16:10.839 align:start position:0%
comments in favor of
 
00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360 align:start position:0%
sb485 i would point out that the
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation by chief goldstein to
 
00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
edward soley i think is a mistake it
 
00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:19.269 align:start position:0%
edward soley i think is a mistake it
puts

00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
puts
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that he wants to make
 
00:16:23.910 --> 00:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
sure is protected
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
that is not
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
that gets additional protection by
 
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:30.240 align:start position:0%
adding the word solely you know i um i i
 
00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759 align:start position:0%
think uh that confuses the issue and
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
the the police can take into
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
consideration as a reason for searching
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
a car
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
for having probable cause for searching
 
00:16:48.230 --> 00:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
a car that the person refused to consent
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
and that is not under the us
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
constitution and case law that is not
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
appropriate that is the unintended
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
effect of adding the word solely in
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
there so i think uh i think as written
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:01.430 align:start position:0%
the uh
uh

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:17:05.909 --> 00:17:05.919 align:start position:0%
sb40 is uh is well-worded and um
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
i uh you know i
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
i think as i said in front of the senate
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
uh i have great respect for both
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
representative roy and senator french so
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to pick between the two of
 
00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:18.959 align:start position:0%
them i don't want to piss either one of
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
them off for lack of a better way of
 
00:17:21.909 --> 00:17:21.919 align:start position:0%
putting it
 
00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
with that more than willing i recommend
 
00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
you vote ought to pass
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative newman you're recognized
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.909 --> 00:17:39.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i just have a
 
00:17:42.150 --> 00:17:42.160 align:start position:0%
question about what uh to the witness
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question about
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
your talking about the word solely
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
um if a police officer sees something in
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
a car that is suspicious that there's a
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
crime and he has probable cause
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
um what happens in that situation do
 
00:17:59.750 --> 00:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
they then just have to get a warrant to
 
00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
search the car or can they take some
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
action without a warrant uh it depends
 
00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh on the circumstance
 
00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
if it's perceived that it meets the
 
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.310 align:start position:0%
if it's perceived that it meets the
exigent

00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
exigent
 
00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.830 align:start position:0%
exigent
circumstances

00:18:12.830 --> 00:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
exception uh then they don't need to get
 
00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
a warrant they
 
00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
as long as they have probable cause so
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
blood dripping out of the car from the
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
trunk would probably meet the exigent
 
00:18:26.549 --> 00:18:26.559 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh suggested uh if they uh
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
if otherwise what they would do is they
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
just detain the car
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
and get a search warrant um so uh it
 
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
depends on the circumstances but
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
this this bill doesn't get in the way of
 
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
that one way or another
 
00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:43.520 align:start position:0%

circumstances is that in the
 
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:51.120 align:start position:0%

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
worked on
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
and our memo both to representative roy
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
and march and the senate judiciary
 
00:21:07.190 --> 00:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
committee the concern is really um with
 
00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:11.360 align:start position:0%
the lack of a carve out in sb40 hb 485
 
00:21:13.510 --> 00:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
had a section carving out precluding
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
some specific searches that did not
 
00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
require consent and that amendment added
 
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
an exception for department of
 
00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.830 align:start position:0%
an exception for department of
corrections

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
corrections
 
00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at the amend
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
the memo that director cusack drafted
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
already an administrative rule
 
00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
specifically cor
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
305 and 306. the department of
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
corrections does have the ability to
 
00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
search without consent or even warning
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
vehicles possessions and persons that
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
are on doc
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
property and it really is a matter of
 
00:21:51.669 --> 00:21:51.679 align:start position:0%
public safety and security of the
 
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
facilities that doc be able to do that
 
00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
so i did just want to draw your
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
attention to that specific issue and the
 
00:22:00.149 --> 00:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that was just
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
passed through the committee in the
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
senate and i'm happy to try and answer
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:13.190 --> 00:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
seeing no games raised i want to thank
 
00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:15.280 align:start position:0%

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:35.110 align:start position:0%
the chair now recognizes
joseph

00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman and members of
 
00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is joseph ebert
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
it's e-b-e-r-t
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
i'm a captain with the new hampshire
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
state police i oversee the investigative
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
services bureau
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
we are
 
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill however the new
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police does employ this
 
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.149 align:start position:0%
hampshire state police does employ this
process

00:22:52.149 --> 00:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
as we speak a written
 
00:22:56.070 --> 00:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
waiver for
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
a search of a motor vehicle
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
we do after review of this bill have one
 
00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
area that we would like the committee to
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
consider and that is under number one
 
00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
roman numeral two and we would recommend
 
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.390 align:start position:0%
roman numeral two and we would recommend
adding

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
adding
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
a statement that is similar to
 
00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
unless re-engaged by the operator
 
00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
so what it says is if the person refuses
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
a consent to search the officer shall uh
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
which is uh for obvious reasons a very
 
00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
strong term
 
00:23:28.789 --> 00:23:28.799 align:start position:0%
shall uh stop questioning about the
 
00:23:28.799 --> 00:23:29.830 align:start position:0%
shall uh stop questioning about the
consent

00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
consent
 
00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
my concern as i testified before the
 
00:23:34.149 --> 00:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
senate as well is that
 
00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
oftentimes we are re-engaged by the
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
uh the operator and a situation where
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
this might come into play is where you
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
advise the operator okay uh at this time
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
then i'm going to seize your motor
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
vehicle and i'm going to apply for a
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
warrant at which time the operator says
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
to you oh okay all right well i don't
 
00:23:57.270 --> 00:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
want you to do that um i have uh you
 
00:24:00.149 --> 00:24:00.159 align:start position:0%
know maybe a marijuana
 
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:02.240 align:start position:0%
joint in the console or
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
something that could be as little as a
 
00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
violation level offense that they could
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
be released on the side of the road with
 
00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:08.880 align:start position:0%
the summons with
 
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh so they're they're weighing out their
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
options and they're saying to you okay
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
well i don't want you to go through the
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
the process of towing my vehicle that
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's going to put me out further so
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
therefore i i want to uh go forward with
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
the consent church now there's an awful
 
00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
lot that is documented in a situation
 
00:24:27.269 --> 00:24:27.279 align:start position:0%
like that to make sure that the person
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel that they're being coerced
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
in any way or pressure is
 
00:24:32.549 --> 00:24:32.559 align:start position:0%
placed upon them and they're they're
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
making that choice freely however that
 
00:24:37.430 --> 00:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
entire discussion seems to be precluded
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh by number one roman numeral two
 
00:24:44.230 --> 00:24:44.240 align:start position:0%
unless there is a statement uh
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
added to
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that they could re-engage
 
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
the officer
 
00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
so with that uh that is my testimony for
 
00:24:52.710 --> 00:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
this morning i'm happy to answer any
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.430 align:start position:0%
 
o'hare

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you uh
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question i guess i would
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
assess the question uh i know you
 
00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
haven't spoke on it but what would be
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
your opinion
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
chief's recommendation uh
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
it was made earlier on testimony about
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
the words uh
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
was it solely
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh representative o'hara and i
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:31.520 align:start position:0%
you know we had not um
 
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
in our review saw that but when i heard
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh chief goldstein testified to that it
 
00:25:40.149 --> 00:25:40.159 align:start position:0%
seemed like uh a common sense addition i
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
understand that mr shearer disagrees
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
with that but we would be supportive of
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
adding the word solely um
 
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:50.000 align:start position:0%
as chief goldstein had mentioned
 
00:25:59.590 --> 00:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised i want to take it
 
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720 align:start position:0%

00:27:48.710 --> 00:27:48.720 align:start position:0%
amendment and we also have no concerns
 
00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
um with the amendment that was proposed
 
00:27:53.750 --> 00:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
by the department of corrections uh uh
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
in then that was uh adopted by the
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
senate judiciary committee as an
 
00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
amendment to hb 485 yesterday it's a
 
00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
sensible and limited um amendment
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
i do want to voice some concerns with
 
00:28:09.669 --> 00:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
the amendments that have been proposed
 
00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:11.679 align:start position:0%
in committee for um as far as i know for
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
the first time today
 
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:14.389 align:start position:0%
the first time today
um

00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:14.399 --> 00:28:15.110 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
the concern with adding the word solely
 
00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
to section one uh subsection d
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
of uh of sb40 i i just
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
i i we have similar concerns
 
00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:30.640 align:start position:0%
as to the ones that were raised by
 
00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
professor cher earlier um what adding
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
the word under the way that the language
 
00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
is written now
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
refusing to consent to a search cannot
 
00:28:43.909 --> 00:28:43.919 align:start position:0%
be considered as as as part of the
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
reason to detain an individual and that
 
00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:48.320 align:start position:0%
is right and correct under current case
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
law as well
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
if you add the word solely
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
refusing to consent to a search in
 
00:28:56.549 --> 00:28:56.559 align:start position:0%
addition to other factors
 
00:28:58.870 --> 00:28:58.880 align:start position:0%
that that refusal to consent to a search
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
can be considered as a reason to detain
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
now as it's written now a person can
 
00:29:06.070 --> 00:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
still be detained if there is reason to
 
00:29:08.549 --> 00:29:08.559 align:start position:0%
detain them and there are other factors
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
beyond the consent to search that that
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
would lend um the police to need to
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
detain someone and they they meet the
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
the necessary requirements that person
 
00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:22.480 align:start position:0%
can still be detained um but the
 
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:24.640 align:start position:0%
refusing to consent a search should not
 
00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
be a part of that equation
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
and that is why we feel strongly that
 
00:29:30.549 --> 00:29:30.559 align:start position:0%
the word solely should not should not be
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
included in that section
 
00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
um i i also was was a bit confused by
 
00:29:37.909 --> 00:29:37.919 align:start position:0%
the uh suggested amendment that was
 
00:29:40.389 --> 00:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
proposed by the state police
 
00:29:42.870 --> 00:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh right now as it's written if we can
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
and maybe if we can just read section
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
two reads if the operator of a motor
 
00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:50.240 align:start position:0%
vehicle refuses to consent to a search
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
officer shall cease any further
 
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.470 align:start position:0%
officer shall cease any further
questioning

00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
questioning
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
concerning consent to search
 
00:29:59.110 --> 00:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
there is nothing in that section
 
00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:01.520 align:start position:0%
currently that prevents an officer from
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
then re from from speaking with an
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
individual that that you know that they
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
have pulled over are in conversation
 
00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
with if that individual re-engages them
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
they simply have to cease further
 
00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:16.720 align:start position:0%
questioning about the consent to search
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
so i i see no reason why you would you
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
would need to add anything about
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
the person being reengaged by the op uh
 
00:30:23.919 --> 00:30:24.870 align:start position:0%
the person being reengaged by the op uh
um

00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
by the uh by the operator of the motor
 
00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:29.120 align:start position:0%
vehicle if the operator of the motor
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
vehicle wants to continue that con a
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
discussion they can certainly do that
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
the officers simply shall not continue
 
00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:38.720 align:start position:0%
to pressure that individual by through
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
questioning about the consent to search
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing that would prohibit
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
further conversation if the operator
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
re-engages the officer
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
the officer simply has to stop
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
questioning that person about the
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
consensus search so i really don't see
 
00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
the need for that amendment that has
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
been recommended as well
 
00:30:55.919 --> 00:30:56.710 align:start position:0%
been recommended as well
um

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.240 align:start position:0%
and with that i would simply say you
 
00:31:00.149 --> 00:31:00.159 align:start position:0%
know we we respectfully urge the members
 
00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:02.480 align:start position:0%
of this committee to vote to pass on sb
 
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
uh sb40 um and and again we do not have
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
strong feelings about you know the the
 
00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
language on sb40 versus uh hb 485 um you
 
00:31:15.510 --> 00:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
know other than to simply to let the
 
00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:17.200 align:start position:0%
flag for the committee that the senate
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee yesterday did vote
 
00:31:23.269 --> 00:31:23.279 align:start position:0%
ought to pass with amendment on hb 485
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
so that will likely be going to the
 
00:31:41.509 --> 00:31:41.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:43.029 --> 00:31:43.039 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and it's just a
 
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:44.640 align:start position:0%
question about the last part that was
 
00:31:46.870 --> 00:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
said about the uh questioning somebody
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
about the consent to search and the word
 
00:31:48.799 --> 00:31:50.310 align:start position:0%
about the consent to search and the word
solely

00:31:50.310 --> 00:31:50.320 align:start position:0%
solely
 
00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
um if the word solely was in there and
 
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:54.640 align:start position:0%
you want and the person changed their
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
mind which was the example given
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
would would you consider that those
 
00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799 align:start position:0%
additional questions then about that
 
00:32:03.509 --> 00:32:03.519 align:start position:0%
consent to search is is allowed by the
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
i i i have to be honest um
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
representative i wasn't sure that i
 
00:32:13.509 --> 00:32:13.519 align:start position:0%
fully understood the example that was
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
given um if if the uh
 
00:32:20.149 --> 00:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that there's nothing
 
00:32:23.990 --> 00:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
in this currently that prohibits the
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
officer from re-engaging in a
 
00:32:27.509 --> 00:32:27.519 align:start position:0%
conversation with the operator
 
00:32:30.149 --> 00:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
um i i don't understand why that
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
exchange would be prohibited by the
 
00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:34.080 align:start position:0%
language that that is there in the way
 
00:32:35.669 --> 00:32:35.679 align:start position:0%
that i understood the example as it was
 
00:32:35.679 --> 00:32:39.190 align:start position:0%
that i understood the example as it was
presented

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:52.960 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the witness for our
 
00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.310 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the witness for our
testimony

00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
we will note for the record that
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
representative colony has now physically
 
00:33:04.630 --> 00:33:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
if there's any members of the public who
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
wish to testify there that are in
 
00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
attendance that have not testified
 
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.710 align:start position:0%
attendance that have not testified
already

00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
see no uh for other hands raised at this
 
00:33:18.399 --> 00:33:20.630 align:start position:0%
see no uh for other hands raised at this
time

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
we'll close the public hearing on senate

yes
 
00:40:23.990 --> 00:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't believe so there's not
 
00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
least there's none that's been assigned
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
there was two uh second committee bills

11 towns on the seacoast
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
and i appreciate
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to introduce sb 110
 
00:41:53.109 --> 00:41:53.119 align:start position:0%
which is uh an act relative to animals
 
00:41:55.990 --> 00:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
and motor vehicles
 
00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.030 align:start position:0%
and motor vehicles
as

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:57.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
many of us who have been in the
 
00:42:00.630 --> 00:42:00.640 align:start position:0%
legislature for several years know this
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:42:05.109 --> 00:42:05.119 align:start position:0%
an effort that keeps coming back
 
00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
and my goal
 
00:42:08.950 --> 00:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
this bill was brought to my attention or
 
00:42:10.630 --> 00:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
this effort was brought to my attention
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
by a young high school student
 
00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:16.800 align:start position:0%
named olivia hammer who i believe is
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
able to testify
 
00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:20.069 align:start position:0%
able to testify
um

00:42:20.069 --> 00:42:20.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
who had great concern about animals
 
00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
being left in cars with the windows up
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
and during the summer
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:33.910 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
this version of the bill
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
is quite different from prior versions
 
00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:42.230 align:start position:0%
is quite different from prior versions
and

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:42.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:42:44.309 --> 00:42:44.319 align:start position:0%
i credit the attorney general's office
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
and others for helping me come up with a
 
00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
solution to the this
 
00:42:51.190 --> 00:42:51.200 align:start position:0%
recurrent concern
 
00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:52.390 align:start position:0%
recurrent concern
um

00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:57.430 --> 00:42:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:42:58.550 --> 00:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
concern is the the solution is
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
essentially and i'll use quotes around
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
this word to deputize
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
the person who would like to intervene
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
so if you're in a shopping mall parking
 
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.150 align:start position:0%
so if you're in a shopping mall parking
lot

00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
lot
 
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
and you see a dog
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
that's in extremis or or a cat for that
 
00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:21.760 align:start position:0%
matter that's in the extremis inside a
 
00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.950 align:start position:0%
matter that's in the extremis inside a
car

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:28.000 align:start position:0%
what you are able to do is actually get
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
in touch with law enforcement and with a
 
00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:32.720 align:start position:0%
witness present law enforcement can
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
authorize you
 
00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
whether you use a smartphone or however
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
get your message across to law
 
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:44.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement that that an intervention is
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
needed they can't get there in time
 
00:43:48.790 --> 00:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
they can authorize you to go ahead and
 
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.069 align:start position:0%
they can authorize you to go ahead and
act

00:43:50.069 --> 00:43:50.079 align:start position:0%
act
 
00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
and in my knowledge this is the first
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
time that the american kennel club has
 
00:43:59.430 --> 00:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
actually signed on in support of a bill
 
00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
that stacey ober on the senate side when
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
we heard the bill when we presented the
 
00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
bill on the senate side
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
this version was amended in the senate
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
to clarify that this is not just any
 
00:44:15.030 --> 00:44:15.040 align:start position:0%
animal that's confined anywhere but this
 
00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:16.960 align:start position:0%
is within a vehicle
 
00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.870 align:start position:0%
is within a vehicle
um

00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.670 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:44:19.670 --> 00:44:19.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
um so it's very specific uh you cannot
 
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:26.960 align:start position:0%
take action uh without the blessing of
 
00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:28.480 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:30.160 align:start position:0%
and a witness
 
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
um and that is what makes this very
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
different um
 
00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
and it provides
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
the indemnification
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
under roman four
 
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
but you have to be authorized by law
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement so that's why this is has
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
been able to move forward as opposed to
 
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
prior bills that did not have that
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
what i like to call deputization
 
00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.990 align:start position:0%
what i like to call deputization
component

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
component
 
00:44:57.990 --> 00:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm happy to take any
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:08.069 --> 00:45:08.079 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for your testimony if
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
the chair would like to acquire the
 
00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:10.790 align:start position:0%
the chair would like to acquire the
question

00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.470 align:start position:0%
question
but

00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:12.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
under six under roman numeral three
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
section b it says that
 
00:45:18.950 --> 00:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
in addition to the law enforcement
 
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.150 align:start position:0%
in addition to the law enforcement
officer

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
officer
 
00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:22.160 align:start position:0%
another witness or individual has to be
 
00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.349 align:start position:0%
another witness or individual has to be
present

00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
present
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
what's the rationale for having an
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:25.750 align:start position:0%
what's the rationale for having an
enough

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
enough
 
00:45:27.430 --> 00:45:27.440 align:start position:0%
another witness present
 
00:45:28.710 --> 00:45:28.720 align:start position:0%
if you're already authorized by law
 
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:30.640 align:start position:0%
enforcement i suppose what's the reason
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
for having that
 
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
actually yeah actually the reason for
 
00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
the witness
 
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.349 align:start position:0%
the witness
is

00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:45:37.359 --> 00:45:38.470 align:start position:0%
is
um

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh basically it's it's in a way it's
 
00:45:44.230 --> 00:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
protection for the law enforcement
 
00:45:46.309 --> 00:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
law enforcement to
 
00:45:47.829 --> 00:45:47.839 align:start position:0%
be able to know that there's another
 
00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:50.480 align:start position:0%
person on the scene who can verify the
 
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.910 align:start position:0%
person on the scene who can verify the
situation

00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh and is willing to
 
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.190 align:start position:0%
uh and is willing to
certify

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
certify
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
as a witness to the situation so that
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
you know law enforcement isn't depending
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
on one person's word
 
00:46:04.309 --> 00:46:04.319 align:start position:0%
they are um
 
00:46:04.319 --> 00:46:05.190 align:start position:0%
they are um
and

00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:05.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
and they do have that way they would
 
00:46:07.359 --> 00:46:08.790 align:start position:0%
and they do have that way they would
have

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
i guess the best way to say it is
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
back up documentation that the law
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement authorization was
 
00:46:15.200 --> 00:46:16.550 align:start position:0%
enforcement authorization was
appropriate

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
so it really is there and and this was
 
00:46:21.109 --> 00:46:21.119 align:start position:0%
part of the discussion
 
00:46:22.630 --> 00:46:22.640 align:start position:0%
you know this was a
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
2020 bill that was a victim of covid so
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
about a year and a half ago or a year
 
00:46:34.150 --> 00:46:34.160 align:start position:0%
ago at least
 
00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
and this was the way to be sure that
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
there was adequate documentation that
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
the situation was what it was and
 
00:46:46.150 --> 00:46:46.160 align:start position:0%
so when law enforcement authorized it
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
they would have the ability
 
00:46:48.079 --> 00:46:48.950 align:start position:0%
they would have the ability
to

00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:46:51.190 --> 00:46:51.200 align:start position:0%
call a witness if they needed to to say
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
yes who could then say yes i was there i
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
saw the interaction and
 
00:46:59.589 --> 00:46:59.599 align:start position:0%
that's the reason for that additional
 
00:47:03.510 --> 00:47:03.520 align:start position:0%
person being being brought into the
 
00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:09.510 align:start position:0%
person being being brought into the
authorization

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.590 --> 00:47:10.600 align:start position:0%
thank you process taking my question
 
00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:12.870 align:start position:0%
thank you process taking my question
[Music]

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
representative rhodes you recognized
 
00:47:16.069 --> 00:47:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.630 align:start position:0%
taking my question
so

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
my question is if you're if you see this
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
you know there's an animal in a car stay
 
00:47:25.030 --> 00:47:25.040 align:start position:0%
in a parking lot
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
and the person calls 911
 
00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
there's a witness present should it be
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
written in the law that that person and
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
witness needs to remain there until law
 
00:47:37.349 --> 00:47:37.359 align:start position:0%
enforcement arrives so that
 
00:47:39.670 --> 00:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
they're able to law enforcement at least
 
00:47:41.430 --> 00:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
able to try to
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
find the owner of the vehicle and or be
 
00:47:45.510 --> 00:47:45.520 align:start position:0%
there when the person comes out because
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
if my concern is the person coming out
 
00:47:49.190 --> 00:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
their car window is broken
 
00:47:51.109 --> 00:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
the police aren't there yet or the
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
police are there
 
00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.430 align:start position:0%
police are there
to

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:56.720 align:start position:0%
kind of protect that person from
 
00:47:58.550 --> 00:47:58.560 align:start position:0%
the hostile person that may be walking
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
up to their broken window
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
right i i um
 
00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:05.599 align:start position:0%
i absolutely would be would welcome an
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that that asked the witness to
 
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
remain until law enforcement arrived
 
00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh i i think that's a good suggestion
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know it it makes it a little bit
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
more difficult
 
00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:22.240 align:start position:0%
if they are not willing you know if they
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
say sure i'll stick around and then they
 
00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
take off
 
00:48:27.349 --> 00:48:27.359 align:start position:0%
but the idea is that that witness you
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
know we have to have a name
 
00:48:31.190 --> 00:48:31.200 align:start position:0%
contact information
 
00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:32.549 align:start position:0%
contact information
before

00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
law enforcement would authorize so i
 
00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
think even even if they did leave
 
00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.870 align:start position:0%
think even even if they did leave
um

00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
they would uh you know they would still
 
00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
be able to be contacted but
 
00:48:45.190 --> 00:48:45.200 align:start position:0%
i i think it's a great suggestion and
 
00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
representative road you recognize for a
 
00:48:55.109 --> 00:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you so just to clarify
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
that the
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
an officer is going to go to the sea
 
00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:06.470 align:start position:0%
 
i

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:06.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
that would be the expectation um
 
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know these
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
this situation uh where law enforcement
 
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
uh can't get there in time i i think
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
many people have
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
had that frustrating moment when they've
 
00:49:26.069 --> 00:49:26.079 align:start position:0%
seen a car compliant
 
00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
animal confined in the car
 
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:30.160 align:start position:0%
and can't you know they don't know what
 
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:31.839 align:start position:0%
to do um
 
00:49:31.839 --> 00:49:32.630 align:start position:0%
to do um
this

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
the expectat the problem is of course
 
00:49:35.359 --> 00:49:36.150 align:start position:0%
the expectat the problem is of course
that

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:37.589 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:49:37.589 --> 00:49:37.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
whether law enforcement could actually
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
get there in time if the animal is
 
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:44.559 align:start position:0%
unresponsive or anything like that so
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
uh yes the expectation would be that if
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
law enforcement uh authorizes that
 
00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
action i i mean
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding would be that they
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
would be coming one way or the other
 
00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:56.640 align:start position:0%
the question is can they get there in
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
time and if they can't get there in time
 
00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.589 align:start position:0%
time and if they can't get there in time
then

00:49:59.589 --> 00:49:59.599 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:50:01.510 --> 00:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
it would be important for them to be
 
00:50:03.589 --> 00:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
able to authorize the person on the
 
00:50:10.069 --> 00:50:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:12.309 --> 00:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
so they they have to be called in any
 
00:50:12.319 --> 00:50:13.670 align:start position:0%
so they they have to be called in any
event

00:50:13.670 --> 00:50:13.680 align:start position:0%
event
 
00:50:16.549 --> 00:50:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
 
00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:24.950 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you for taking my
question

00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:50:26.549 --> 00:50:26.559 align:start position:0%
um senator
 
00:50:27.670 --> 00:50:27.680 align:start position:0%
have you
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
asked any police officers in the state
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire if they feel
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
comfortable with deputizing a citizen
 
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:37.440 align:start position:0%
without being there and witnessing and
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
being a part of what's going on to see
 
00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:41.030 align:start position:0%
being a part of what's going on to see
exactly

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
if they should be putting their own
 
00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
careers at risk thank you
 
00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:47.510 align:start position:0%
careers at risk thank you
absolutely

00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:50:50.069 --> 00:50:50.079 align:start position:0%
we've talked to law enforcement on this
 
00:50:50.079 --> 00:50:52.150 align:start position:0%
we've talked to law enforcement on this
bill

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
remember there's no requirement that
 
00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
they do this so this is i guess the best
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
word this is enabling
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
but the law enforcement if they don't
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
this would have to be a willing law
 
00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:09.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer who
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
looks at the situation either through a
 
00:51:14.150 --> 00:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
smartphone or otherwise and says yes you
 
00:51:15.990 --> 00:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
can go ahead but there is
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
no pressure
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
no liability for law enforcement if they
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
say no we're not going to authorize them
 
00:51:27.750 --> 00:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
representatives you're recognized for a
 
00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:32.069 align:start position:0%
representatives you're recognized for a
follow-up

00:51:32.069 --> 00:51:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
so you've talked to many law enforcement
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
officers that would be okay deputizing
 
00:51:39.119 --> 00:51:42.069 align:start position:0%
officers that would be okay deputizing
citizens

00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:44.549 --> 00:51:44.559 align:start position:0%
i've talked to law enforcement
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
officers who are okay with this wording
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't require them to deputize
 
00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.990 align:start position:0%
that doesn't require them to deputize
anyone

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:54.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:51:54.790 --> 00:51:54.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
those that are willing to deputize
 
00:52:02.069 --> 00:52:02.079 align:start position:0%
this this bill the original language was
 
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
i talked to as i said the attorney
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
general's office
 
00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i talked to law enforcement and
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
they're comfortable with the language
 
00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:10.640 align:start position:0%
because it leaves it up to law
 
00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:11.910 align:start position:0%
because it leaves it up to law
enforcement

00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
what they are willing or not willing to
 
00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.109 align:start position:0%
what they are willing or not willing to
do

00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh and and there is no you know there's
 
00:52:20.309 --> 00:52:20.319 align:start position:0%
no requirement there's no liability for
 
00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:23.200 align:start position:0%
law enforcement no additional liability
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
the standard of practice is that they
 
00:52:28.230 --> 00:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
go to the scene
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
and this allows them
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
to be there remotely
 
00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
through uh the person who has called
 
00:52:41.349 --> 00:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.349 --> 00:52:43.359 align:start position:0%
just as an additional
 
00:52:45.109 --> 00:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement has already
 
00:52:48.549 --> 00:52:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
that they find these situation
 
00:52:52.150 --> 00:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
frustrating because they know something
 
00:52:53.430 --> 00:52:53.440 align:start position:0%
has to be done and they can't get there
 
00:52:55.510 --> 00:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
in time so
 
00:52:58.390 --> 00:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
that you know this makes it as flexible
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
as possible for law enforcement without
 
00:53:05.589 --> 00:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.510 --> 00:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
00:53:09.990 --> 00:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
hughes for a question
 
00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
would a dispatcher uh be authorized as a
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer under this bill
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
or would a dispatcher actually need to
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
find a sworn officer uh in order uh to
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
be able to get permission to do this i'm
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
just curious about how that would work
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
since a lot of the calls that come into
 
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:33.200 align:start position:0%
police departments aren't actually taken
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
by officers directly
 
00:53:40.710 --> 00:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%
my understanding of how this works is
 
00:53:44.309 --> 00:53:44.319 align:start position:0%
that the call would come into dispatch
 
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
dispatch would call
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
they do have the capacity to have direct
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
contact with the person who called in
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
they can have you hold on the line while
 
00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
they contact the officer they're
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
dispatching they're going to be
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
dispatching an officer one way or the
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
other if there's an animal in distress
 
00:54:06.549 --> 00:54:06.559 align:start position:0%
in the car and and that connection uh in
 
00:54:06.559 --> 00:54:07.510 align:start position:0%
in the car and and that connection uh in
fact

00:54:07.510 --> 00:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
fact
 
00:54:10.470 --> 00:54:10.480 align:start position:0%
in a recent experience
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
health related
 
00:54:14.710 --> 00:54:14.720 align:start position:0%
i was able to talk to law enforcement on
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
their way so
 
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
it you know we are
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
beautifully connected nowadays and so
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
this would be but dispatch would never
 
00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
be put in the position
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
of making this kind of decision this
 
00:54:29.829 --> 00:54:29.839 align:start position:0%
would be up to the
 
00:54:32.549 --> 00:54:32.559 align:start position:0%
the officer who has been dispatched by
 
00:54:32.559 --> 00:54:34.390 align:start position:0%
the officer who has been dispatched by
dispatch

00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
dispatch
 
00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:41.109 --> 00:54:41.119 align:start position:0%
the channel recognizes representative
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
trump for a question
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:54:47.109 --> 00:54:47.119 align:start position:0%
my question senator
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to envision how how this law
 
00:54:50.079 --> 00:54:50.829 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to envision how how this law
would

00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:50.839 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
this is going to be my car in the
 
00:54:56.079 --> 00:54:57.670 align:start position:0%
this is going to be my car in the
example

00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
and my dog is asleep in the car and a
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
concerned citizen
 
00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.309 align:start position:0%
concerned citizen
feels

00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
feels
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
i don't like i can't imagine a police
 
00:55:10.559 --> 00:55:14.150 align:start position:0%
i don't like i can't imagine a police
officer

00:55:14.150 --> 00:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
authorizing somebody to to break into my
 
00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:19.829 align:start position:0%
authorizing somebody to to break into my
car

00:55:19.829 --> 00:55:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
because they feel
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
that the dog is in danger i mean it's
 
00:55:25.109 --> 00:55:25.119 align:start position:0%
not like
 
00:55:28.790 --> 00:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's not like a an expert or a an animal
 
00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
control officer is watching
 
00:55:34.870 --> 00:55:34.880 align:start position:0%
um i'm just
 
00:55:37.109 --> 00:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to envision
 
00:55:39.510 --> 00:55:39.520 align:start position:0%
me coming out of a shopping center
 
00:55:42.390 --> 00:55:42.400 align:start position:0%
my my dog who was sleeping is now awake
 
00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
and my car's window is broken
 
00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
and no one is liable
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
for that situation
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
because a concerned citizen thought they
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
were doing the right thing
 
00:55:56.470 --> 00:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
can you see that problem
 
00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:00.829 align:start position:0%
can you see that problem
arising

00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
um well
 
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:04.960 align:start position:0%
that's always possible i mean that could
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
happen now uh i think
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
the it's interesting because
 
00:56:10.789 --> 00:56:10.799 align:start position:0%
speaking with
 
00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:13.300 align:start position:0%
uh trial attorneys on this issue
 
00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:14.630 align:start position:0%
uh trial attorneys on this issue
[Music]

00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
they actually opposed the original bill
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
which they have always opposed in the
 
00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
past and they are
 
00:56:22.470 --> 00:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
okay with this
 
00:56:24.710 --> 00:56:24.720 align:start position:0%
this one this version
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
because of the protections put in there
 
00:56:29.430 --> 00:56:29.440 align:start position:0%
through law enforcement that
 
00:56:31.829 --> 00:56:31.839 align:start position:0%
what they did say was that
 
00:56:31.839 --> 00:56:32.870 align:start position:0%
what they did say was that
um

00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:34.069 align:start position:0%
um
while

00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:34.079 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
you as the
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
angry car owner which i completely get
 
00:56:39.119 --> 00:56:41.589 align:start position:0%
angry car owner which i completely get
um

00:56:41.589 --> 00:56:41.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.599 --> 00:56:42.470 align:start position:0%
 
would

00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know would be able to
 
00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:48.240 align:start position:0%
bring suit or have some
 
00:56:51.190 --> 00:56:51.200 align:start position:0%
um you know demanding that the window be
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
replaced or or whatever
 
00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.789 align:start position:0%
replaced or or whatever
uh

00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
very few their comment was
 
00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.390 align:start position:0%
very few their comment was
that

00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
very few few people if the person who
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
broke the window was acting in good
 
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
faith right now with no additional
 
00:57:07.190 --> 00:57:07.200 align:start position:0%
authorization it would be very hard for
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
you to to bring suit or otherwise
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
you know there's there's a lot of things
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
to think about not just your broken
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
window there's suppose you had a dog
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
that has a history of biting
 
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:22.240 align:start position:0%
and somebody breaks the window thinking
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
they're being a good samaritan
 
00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
um right now they can do that if they
 
00:57:30.069 --> 00:57:30.079 align:start position:0%
think the dog's in distress and that dog
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
might then bite them
 
00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:35.839 align:start position:0%
or get loose to the risk of that
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
of that dog
 
00:57:37.599 --> 00:57:39.430 align:start position:0%
of that dog
and

00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
00:57:43.349 --> 00:57:43.359 align:start position:0%
very you know that that would be
 
00:57:45.030 --> 00:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
uh dangerous for the public and
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise that's why putting
 
00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
this gives an alternative
 
00:57:53.109 --> 00:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
where law enforcement is called they you
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
know they pretty much have to be called
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
and they can put the brakes on the whole
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
thing they can say no i'm you know three
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
minutes away
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
we can wait until i'm there
 
00:58:05.349 --> 00:58:05.359 align:start position:0%
or they can say you know i'm
 
00:58:06.870 --> 00:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
tied up with something it's going to be
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
20 minutes and they can question the
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
person they can say you know what kind
 
00:58:12.549 --> 00:58:12.559 align:start position:0%
of collar does the dog have on do they
 
00:58:14.789 --> 00:58:14.799 align:start position:0%
have a muzzle on
 
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
is there drool coming out of their mouth
 
00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:18.640 align:start position:0%
have you tried banging on the window to
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
see if the dog is arousable have you
 
00:58:20.559 --> 00:58:21.589 align:start position:0%
see if the dog is arousable have you
done

00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
done
 
00:58:21.599 --> 00:58:22.470 align:start position:0%
done
so

00:58:22.470 --> 00:58:22.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
in a way this is actually a speed bump
 
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:28.000 align:start position:0%
in the in the road towards somebody
 
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:29.190 align:start position:0%
in the in the road towards somebody
acting

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
acting
 
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
in what they think is good faith and
 
00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
what may actually put themselves in the
 
00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
public at risk
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
that's the reason why these kind of
 
00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
bills have been previously
 
00:58:39.040 --> 00:58:40.309 align:start position:0%
bills have been previously
opposed

00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
opposed
 
00:58:42.390 --> 00:58:42.400 align:start position:0%
and that's also why this bill is
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
actually rather than
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
being something in my opinion and in the
 
00:58:49.589 --> 00:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
opinion of many others this bill
 
00:58:49.599 --> 00:58:50.950 align:start position:0%
opinion of many others this bill
actually

00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.069 align:start position:0%
actually
um

00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:53.589 --> 00:58:53.599 align:start position:0%
keeps people from
 
00:58:55.829 --> 00:58:55.839 align:start position:0%
acting on their own
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
it clarifies in what setting
 
00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
would there be
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
any kind of indemnity
 
00:59:01.839 --> 00:59:02.870 align:start position:0%
any kind of indemnity
and

00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:06.950 --> 00:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
it um really puts a pretty hard
 
00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:10.230 align:start position:0%
it um really puts a pretty hard
um

00:59:10.230 --> 00:59:10.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:12.230 --> 00:59:12.240 align:start position:0%
stop on the process of people breaking
 
00:59:14.549 --> 00:59:14.559 align:start position:0%
people's windows or trying to get into a
 
00:59:14.559 --> 00:59:15.510 align:start position:0%
people's windows or trying to get into a
car

00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:15.520 align:start position:0%
car
 
00:59:17.510 --> 00:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
or even opening the door if the door
 
00:59:18.789 --> 00:59:18.799 align:start position:0%
isn't locked
 
00:59:21.030 --> 00:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
you know all those things we hope will
 
00:59:23.109 --> 00:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
be avoided unless there is really really
 
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
strong evidence
 
00:59:26.710 --> 00:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
that that animal is
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
in extremis and
 
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
and that's where law enforcement has
 
00:59:32.710 --> 00:59:32.720 align:start position:0%
some expertise
 
00:59:34.950 --> 00:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
most of the law enforcement officers
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
that i've spoken to
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
have been in this situation before
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
they've been called they know what to do
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
and they're not going to deputize
 
00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.630 align:start position:0%
and they're not going to deputize
somebody

00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
lightly for all the reasons that you all
 
00:59:48.630 --> 00:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
have brought up with your great
 
00:59:48.640 --> 00:59:49.990 align:start position:0%
have brought up with your great
questions

00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.030 align:start position:0%
questions
so

00:59:51.030 --> 00:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
my belief is that this makes the
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
situation actually more controlled
 
00:59:56.559 --> 00:59:57.430 align:start position:0%
situation actually more controlled
and

00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:59:59.670 --> 00:59:59.680 align:start position:0%
safer than it currently is where people
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
the go-to person is law enforcement if
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass
 
01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:10.319 align:start position:0%
and that's the safest
 
01:00:14.069 --> 01:00:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:14.079 --> 01:00:19.290 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:00:19.290 --> 01:00:19.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:21.670 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
representative o'hare and you were
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:30.000 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so section b
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
is only
 
01:00:33.349 --> 01:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
in the absence that the officer is not
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:39.680 align:start position:0%
correct yes this this would
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
this would not
 
01:00:43.990 --> 01:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh well i guess if the officer is on the
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
scene i can't imagine
 
01:00:45.599 --> 01:00:46.390 align:start position:0%
scene i can't imagine
why

01:00:46.390 --> 01:00:46.400 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
what the situation would be where an
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
officer on the scene would ask somebody
 
01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
else to take action but
 
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:52.950 align:start position:0%
else to take action but
um

01:00:52.950 --> 01:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.069 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:00:54.079 --> 01:00:54.870 align:start position:0%
but
this

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:00:57.510 --> 01:00:57.520 align:start position:0%
unless the officer needs help and then
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
they can authorize somebody to help them
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
um it would uh i hadn't thought of that
 
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:05.280 align:start position:0%
but it would allow the officer to say
 
01:01:07.510 --> 01:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
look you have my authorization to help
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
and and i'm trying to think of a
 
01:01:14.230 --> 01:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
situation where that would be the case
 
01:01:16.390 --> 01:01:16.400 align:start position:0%
but it does allow the officer to
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:22.829 align:start position:0%
 
follow

01:01:22.829 --> 01:01:22.839 align:start position:0%
follow
 
01:01:25.030 --> 01:01:25.040 align:start position:0%
up o'hara and you're recognized for a
 
01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:28.549 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
so

01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:31.349 --> 01:01:31.359 align:start position:0%
but if the officer wasn't there and
 
01:01:31.359 --> 01:01:32.230 align:start position:0%
but if the officer wasn't there and
the

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
person um
 
01:01:38.230 --> 01:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
would have that person would also again
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
have to find an another person to
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
witness it
 
01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:47.200 align:start position:0%
yeah but would you believe that uh
 
01:01:49.270 --> 01:01:49.280 align:start position:0%
not all witnesses will stay around and
 
01:01:51.670 --> 01:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
wait for the police to arrive
 
01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
yes and so
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
the only way this individual
 
01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
has any protection
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
is if they are authorized by a police
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
officer and they have that witness i i
 
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:04.160 align:start position:0%
like the idea
 
01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
of qualifying
 
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:22.150 --> 01:02:22.160 align:start position:0%
can you hear me
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:02:27.510 --> 01:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry so what i was saying um
 
01:02:30.150 --> 01:02:30.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully are you able to hear me okay
 
01:02:31.349 --> 01:02:31.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:02:31.359 --> 01:02:32.309 align:start position:0%
you know
yeah

01:02:32.309 --> 01:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:02:32.319 --> 01:02:33.589 align:start position:0%
yeah
so

01:02:33.589 --> 01:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
what that
 
01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.750 align:start position:0%
what that
um

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.069 align:start position:0%
um
person

01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
person
 
01:02:40.069 --> 01:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
um what the
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
i like the idea of further qualifying
 
01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
the requirements on the witness
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
uh that that they have to stay around
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
until law enforcement is there and that
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
to qualify as a witness the person has
 
01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
to have their contact information or
 
01:02:59.430 --> 01:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
however you want to word it but
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
the the benefit of that of course is
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
what we've talked about is that if
 
01:03:06.870 --> 01:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
the person cannot act if they don't have
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
all the information
 
01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:15.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:28.390 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
he's a senator
 
01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:39.589 align:start position:0%
he's a senator
hello

01:03:39.589 --> 01:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
are you able to hear me hello
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative fine knight we generally
 
01:03:47.589 --> 01:03:47.599 align:start position:0%
have been limiting
 
01:03:49.510 --> 01:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
members of two questions for witness uh
 
01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:52.000 align:start position:0%
we will allow an exception for this this
 
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.870 align:start position:0%
we will allow an exception for this this
time

01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
thank you chair thank you senator for
 
01:03:58.470 --> 01:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
taking another question
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
is there currently an actual process in
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
law that police officers have to follow
 
01:04:07.349 --> 01:04:07.359 align:start position:0%
as like a sort of checklist before
 
01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:10.160 align:start position:0%
they themselves break into
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
a car for an animal and if that is a
 
01:04:14.630 --> 01:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
current process
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
would you be open to putting that and as
 
01:04:20.230 --> 01:04:20.240 align:start position:0%
amended or amend this to include
 
01:04:22.950 --> 01:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
a certain series of checkpoints
 
01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so the answer to the first part of
 
01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
the question is i don't know um what law
 
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement whether they have
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
any codified steps they have to follow
 
01:04:38.829 --> 01:04:38.839 align:start position:0%
before they can enter another person's
 
01:04:38.839 --> 01:04:40.549 align:start position:0%
before they can enter another person's
vehicle

01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
01:04:43.029 --> 01:04:43.039 align:start position:0%
and the answer is i would be absolutely
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
open to an amendment that would
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
require the authorized person to follow
 
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:56.950 --> 01:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
gabriel you're recognized for a question
 
01:05:02.309 --> 01:05:02.319 align:start position:0%
here um
 
01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:04.240 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
it's thinked here that um
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
an individual may take action to rest
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
rest for an animal combined with the
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
vehicle endangered
 
01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:15.760 align:start position:0%
extreme temperatures
 
01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
um can you define extreme temperatures
 
01:05:23.109 --> 01:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:24.390 align:start position:0%
 
well

01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:24.400 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:05:26.950 --> 01:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
hmm that's a good question
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
extreme temperatures it can vary uh
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
you can have a an animal confined in a
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
car if it's sunny out uh
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
even if it's
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
you know 75 80 degrees if it's sunny the
 
01:05:44.309 --> 01:05:44.319 align:start position:0%
interior of the car
 
01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:47.520 align:start position:0%
may heat up very rapidly
 
01:05:50.309 --> 01:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
and i think we all have know that from
 
01:05:52.549 --> 01:05:52.559 align:start position:0%
our own personal experience
 
01:05:52.559 --> 01:05:53.270 align:start position:0%
our own personal experience
so

01:05:53.270 --> 01:05:53.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
that is a judgment call um
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
the uh the other possibility is that
 
01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's you know rare but it happens in new
 
01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire that's over 100 degrees out
 
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.230 align:start position:0%
hampshire that's over 100 degrees out
and

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:09.349 --> 01:06:09.359 align:start position:0%
and the car is closed up and
 
01:06:10.789 --> 01:06:10.799 align:start position:0%
you know the car's not on the air
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
conditioning is not on and
 
01:06:14.870 --> 01:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
that pretty is pretty straightforward so
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
the ambient outdoor temperature is not
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
the qualifier here the
 
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
the qualifier is what's going on inside
 
01:06:23.010 --> 01:06:23.020 align:start position:0%
the car and
 
01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:26.069 align:start position:0%
the car and
[Music]

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:26.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:06:26.079 --> 01:06:26.789 align:start position:0%
[Music]
so

01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:26.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
if the car is closed on a sunny day and
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
it may be as i said the ambient
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
temperature may be 75 80 but the
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
temperature in that car is well over 100
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:06:46.950 --> 01:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:49.270 --> 01:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
representative o'hare
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
you recognize
 
01:06:52.150 --> 01:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
01:06:53.589 --> 01:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
for taking another question i'm just
 
01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
play i guess devil's advocate off of
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
representative uh harriet catherine's
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
question extreme temperatures could also
 
01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
i guess be considered uh cold weather
 
01:07:07.670 --> 01:07:07.680 align:start position:0%
would it not
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
sure could and um
 
01:07:10.079 --> 01:07:11.109 align:start position:0%
sure could and um
uh

01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:11.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
you know again the idea of it
 
01:07:16.789 --> 01:07:16.799 align:start position:0%
certainly we we have those days as you
 
01:07:19.510 --> 01:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
know sir that that it can get well below
 
01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.630 align:start position:0%
know sir that that it can get well below
zero

01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
zero
 
01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.230 align:start position:0%
zero
uh

01:07:22.230 --> 01:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:07:24.150 --> 01:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
animals are better equipped than we are
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
for that kind of weather but a dog or a
 
01:07:29.109 --> 01:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
cat stuck in a car for
 
01:07:36.390 --> 01:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:39.109 --> 01:07:39.119 align:start position:0%
may suffer from that so yes that's a
 
01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
good question
 
01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:47.839 align:start position:0%
and senator would you believe that
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
my previous
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
experience was in law enforcement and
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
during my period time there i've
 
01:07:55.119 --> 01:07:56.870 align:start position:0%
during my period time there i've
experienced

01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
numerous times of going calls to dogs
 
01:08:03.349 --> 01:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
in cars and have learned over the years
 
01:08:03.359 --> 01:08:04.630 align:start position:0%
in cars and have learned over the years
that

01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:06.630 --> 01:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
even dogs that
 
01:08:10.549 --> 01:08:10.559 align:start position:0%
short hair to long hair um
 
01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:12.799 align:start position:0%
are affected differently and
 
01:08:12.799 --> 01:08:13.750 align:start position:0%
are affected differently and
um

01:08:13.750 --> 01:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:15.910 --> 01:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
the average person probably would not
 
01:08:18.630 --> 01:08:18.640 align:start position:0%
have that knowledge
 
01:08:20.070 --> 01:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
would you believe right and
 
01:08:22.550 --> 01:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
and uh thank you for that
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
observation because that's exactly why
 
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
this depends on law enforcement for any
 
01:08:35.110 --> 01:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:36.829 --> 01:08:36.839 align:start position:0%
representative muse you
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
recognized thank you mr chair and thank
 
01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:41.520 align:start position:0%
you for taking another question from me
 
01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.390 align:start position:0%
you for taking another question from me
um

01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i'm curious about
 
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:46.400 align:start position:0%
is whether or not we actually have a
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
similar law in the books uh for children
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
um as i sort of quickly look through our
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
statutes it looks like uh it's legal to
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
leave a child in an unattended vehicle
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
uh and i'm just curious if you know if
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
an officer is facing the same situation
 
01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
with a child
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
could or a person who on the street who
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
walks by and notice uh notices a child
 
01:09:12.709 --> 01:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
in distress in a hot car
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
would they actually run into uh similar
 
01:09:16.870 --> 01:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
sorts of
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
liability issues that this law is
 
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
attempting to address
 
01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.430 align:start position:0%
attempting to address
uh

01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
i i i just i'm sorry representative i
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
just don't know the answer to your
 
01:09:27.839 --> 01:09:28.870 align:start position:0%
just don't know the answer to your
question

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:09:31.349 --> 01:09:31.359 align:start position:0%
um i'm happy to do some
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
digging on it and find out what the
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
situation is i think it's a little
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
clearer though if it's a human whether
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's a child or an elderly adult or
 
01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:40.470 align:start position:0%
it's a child or an elderly adult or
otherwise

01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:41.669 align:start position:0%
otherwise
anyone

01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319 align:start position:0%
or a disabled adult who can't extract
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
themselves from a dangerous environment
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
i do think there there is protection
 
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
there but um
 
01:09:53.030 --> 01:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
i i can't answer that with
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
concrete knowledge this is this bill
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:05.990 --> 01:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes i just want to say that i i don't
 
01:10:07.110 --> 01:10:07.120 align:start position:0%
think uh
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
all laws can address uh all situations
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
but um this particular bill uh does
 
01:10:13.990 --> 01:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
raise an interesting question in that
 
01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.030 align:start position:0%
raise an interesting question in that
area

01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
area
 
01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
see no
 
01:10:28.550 --> 01:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative green you're recognized
 
01:10:31.430 --> 01:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
mr speaker uh representative
 
01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative chairman uh senator
 
01:10:35.830 --> 01:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
sherman i have a question
 
01:10:38.790 --> 01:10:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh line two effective day this actually
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
take effect 60 days after this passage
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
would you object change that to be
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
effective as a sign
 
01:10:48.229 --> 01:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
because we're coming from warm weather
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
in fact we're already into warm weather
 
01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:51.430 align:start position:0%
in fact we're already into warm weather
now

01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:51.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.390 align:start position:0%
now
right

01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:54.159 align:start position:0%
no i saw as long as there's no rule
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
making i would have no objection to that
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
and i i don't think there would be any
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
rule making required
 
01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:10.830 --> 01:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
see seeing no further hands
 
01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:12.960 align:start position:0%
raised on thank you center first

good morning my name is olivia hammer

i'm a 17 year old student at the
 
01:11:50.470 --> 01:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
governor's academy in massachusetts but
 
01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
i am a new hampshire resident
 
01:11:54.070 --> 01:11:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you senator sherman for inviting
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
me back to support and work toward
 
01:11:57.669 --> 01:11:57.679 align:start position:0%
helping dogs left in the car without
 
01:11:59.270 --> 01:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
proper ventilation and without their
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
owner being present
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
thank you to the house criminal justice
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
and public safety committee for taking
 
01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
the time to listen to my testimony in
 
01:12:09.189 --> 01:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
support of senate bill 110.
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
it is timely to be here
 
01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
to discuss this topic as we approach
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
another summer in new england
 
01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:17.840 align:start position:0%
dog lovers and owners do not
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
intentionally leave their dogs in a car
 
01:12:21.750 --> 01:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
to harm them it is most likely an error
 
01:12:23.750 --> 01:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
where they have lost track of time while
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
running errands i hope this bill
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
senate bill 110 will allow people like
 
01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
me and you to have the ability to do
 
01:12:32.470 --> 01:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
something for a dog that is in distress
 
01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:34.239 align:start position:0%
without experiencing the possible
 
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
negative repercussions of their actions
 
01:12:38.950 --> 01:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
hopefully this bill will pass to ensure
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
animal safety and protect the citizen
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps most dog owners will be happy
 
01:12:46.630 --> 01:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
that their dog was aided and saved from
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
heat exhaustion heat stroke brain damage
 
01:12:51.350 --> 01:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
and possible death
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
when we
 
01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:54.320 align:start position:0%
when we last discussed this bill in
 
01:12:56.950 --> 01:12:56.960 align:start position:0%
february a senate judiciary member asked
 
01:12:58.790 --> 01:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
a question about the number of dogs that
 
01:13:01.030 --> 01:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
have expired last year while being left
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
in vehicles in new hampshire
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
although i could not get an accurate
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
number for the state of new hampshire my
 
01:13:08.229 --> 01:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
research shows that across the country
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
31 animal companions have endured
 
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
heat-related deaths since 21 2020
 
01:13:15.030 --> 01:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
however these are the only ones that
 
01:13:16.950 --> 01:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
were reported according to an article
 
01:13:18.709 --> 01:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
posted by the people for the ethical
 
01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
treatment of animals
 
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
this specific article includes
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
descriptions dates and locations of
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
several avoidable dog deaths
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
it ends with and i quote
 
01:13:30.950 --> 01:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
tell lawmakers to take action for kids
 
01:13:33.669 --> 01:13:33.679 align:start position:0%

01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
another valuable source of information
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
that i found was a statement in the bark
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
post made by dr katie nelson a
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
veterinarian in virginia
 
01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:46.640 align:start position:0%
she said mortality from heat stroke is
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
approximately 50 percent and it worsens
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
with every wasted second end quote and
 
01:13:54.390 --> 01:13:54.400 align:start position:0%

the outside temperature is 75 degrees
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
the inside temperature of the car is
 
01:14:12.390 --> 01:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
going to be a much higher 118 degrees
 
01:14:14.550 --> 01:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
this is too hot for a dog to withstand
 
01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
for any length of time a dog's normal
 
01:14:19.709 --> 01:14:19.719 align:start position:0%
temperature is 101.5 to
 
01:14:22.709 --> 01:14:22.719 align:start position:0%
102.2 degrees and anything above that is
 
01:14:25.350 --> 01:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
a risk for the dog just as it would be
 
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
for a human
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
the dog does not have to be foaming at
 
01:14:30.149 --> 01:14:30.159 align:start position:0%
the mouth or showing signs of distress
 
01:14:32.229 --> 01:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
for the police to take necessary action
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
the brain is already starting
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
irreparable damage between 107 and 108
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
degrees end quote
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
according to senate bill 110 an
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
individual may take actions to rescue a
 
01:14:45.990 --> 01:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
confined animal as long as such
 
01:14:48.149 --> 01:14:48.159 align:start position:0%
activities are expressly authorized by a
 
01:14:50.229 --> 01:14:50.239 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer and witnessed by
 
01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:51.920 align:start position:0%
another individual
 
01:14:54.550 --> 01:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
to add maybe it comes down to a specific
 
01:14:56.390 --> 01:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
protocol that an average citizen can
 
01:14:58.709 --> 01:14:58.719 align:start position:0%
carry out in the parking lot a list of
 
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
actions that a citizen can and must
 
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
consider are
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
obviously contact law enforcement seek
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
out another citizen to be a witness if
 
01:15:08.790 --> 01:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
you feel the need to break the window to
 
01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:11.120 align:start position:0%
get into the car to save the dog
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
and thirdly screenshot the local
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
temperature for your own added
 
01:15:16.390 --> 01:15:16.400 align:start position:0%
protection this could be extremely
 
01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:18.320 align:start position:0%
helpful to have the outside temperature
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
temperature documented to determine the
 
01:15:23.350 --> 01:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
car's inside temperature
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
again according to the nhspca
 
01:15:28.310 --> 01:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
temperatures rise exponentially inside a
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
vehicle and veterinarians across the
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
country are always trying to save those
 
01:15:34.470 --> 01:15:34.480 align:start position:0%
victims of unintentional neglect
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
leaving an animal in a hot car occurs in
 
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
every state across this country it can
 
01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:40.640 align:start position:0%
be prevented if we act now and make a
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
positive change today please consider
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
looking out for our animal companions
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
thanks to all of you for your time and
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%

again there's any members of the public
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%

mr chair we had eight people signing in

in support of the bill and no one
 
01:16:53.270 --> 01:16:53.280 align:start position:0%

better reception can you hear me

uh let me get to a little table so i'm
 
01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
not out of breath
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
i'm the blue collar senator who has to
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
do work so i've been hanging stage
 
01:27:25.510 --> 01:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
curtains this morning
 
01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:26.470 align:start position:0%
curtains this morning
okay

01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
sb 60. um
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
a simple bill really for
 
01:27:33.430 --> 01:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
uh we passed it bipartisan legislation
 
01:27:34.950 --> 01:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
you probably can see the count better
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
than i think it was about 16 to 8 17 to
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
five or six
 
01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.030 align:start position:0%
five or six
um

01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
we're losing ten thousand lives here on
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
our roads pre-covered uh 1.6 million
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
arrests per year for driving under the
 
01:27:51.270 --> 01:27:51.280 align:start position:0%
influence and the evidence prior to cove
 
01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
had suggested that alcohol is going down
 
01:27:55.750 --> 01:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
for impairment but
 
01:27:58.310 --> 01:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
um use of illicit drugs
 
01:28:01.110 --> 01:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
and marijuana going up so our roads have
 
01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.229 align:start position:0%
and marijuana going up so our roads have
become

01:28:02.229 --> 01:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
become
 
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
less safe for people under the influence
 
01:28:06.149 --> 01:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
the chiefs of police in new hampshire
 
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:07.520 align:start position:0%
came to me and said they were having a
 
01:28:09.030 --> 01:28:09.040 align:start position:0%
problem on the roads
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
that people were
 
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
using gummies and other stuff stuff that
 
01:28:16.149 --> 01:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
they were medicinally medicating for
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
and they had them next to them on the
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
seat and they were having a problem
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
people handing them off to the other
 
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
people in the car saying oh it wasn't
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
mine i didn't take it it's somebody
 
01:28:26.470 --> 01:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
else's in the car so they said they were
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
having problems and that's why we
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
brought the bill forward
 
01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's a simple idea i sat on the
 
01:28:33.110 --> 01:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
marijuana commission
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
four or five years ago i've been very
 
01:28:37.110 --> 01:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
involved in a lot of the marijuana bills
 
01:28:39.510 --> 01:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
over the last eight years so i was
 
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
always told by all the marijuana
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
advocates to treat it
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
the same as alcohol as far as like being
 
01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
in a car or anything so you can't have
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
an open bottle we don't want you have an
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
open container because there's a
 
01:28:53.350 --> 01:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
temptation so if you do have an unsealed
 
01:28:55.030 --> 01:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
container we're asking you put it in the
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
glove box put it under a back seat put
 
01:28:59.669 --> 01:28:59.679 align:start position:0%
it under the trunk same as you would
 
01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
have to do if you had an open bottle now
 
01:29:03.270 --> 01:29:03.280 align:start position:0%
i realize some people have an amendment
 
01:29:05.510 --> 01:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
today and they're going to say there and
 
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
that may be a good amendment it wasn't
 
01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
really thought of in the senate the idea
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
and the amendment i believe
 
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:13.360 align:start position:0%
is to
 
01:29:15.910 --> 01:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
for people who have medicinal marijuana
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
they could have it open but the problem
 
01:29:19.669 --> 01:29:19.679 align:start position:0%
is medicinal marijuana isn't really
 
01:29:19.679 --> 01:29:20.870 align:start position:0%
is medicinal marijuana isn't really
prescribed

01:29:20.870 --> 01:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
prescribed
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
accurately by a doctor you get a
 
01:29:25.830 --> 01:29:25.840 align:start position:0%
prescription but then you're sent to
 
01:29:28.149 --> 01:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
a medicinal marijuana
 
01:29:30.070 --> 01:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
place and you get stuff but you don't
 
01:29:31.189 --> 01:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
know how much you're getting we don't
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
know dosage don't know amounts i wish
 
01:29:35.669 --> 01:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
someday when the government gets more
 
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
involved that they would regulate it you
 
01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:38.639 align:start position:0%
can't have
 
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:40.960 align:start position:0%
your doctor or physician's assistant
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't send you to get medication
 
01:29:45.510 --> 01:29:45.520 align:start position:0%
and you decide the prescription the
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
amount the dosage the strength so i
 
01:29:50.070 --> 01:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
don't see that it should be treated
 
01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as any other medication
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
again the idea of the bill was to keep
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
substances away from the driver we
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
lowered the penalty to 150
 
01:30:05.030 --> 01:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't an onerous burden
 
01:30:06.470 --> 01:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
and the police have said they are not
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
going to use it to
 
01:30:09.669 --> 01:30:09.679 align:start position:0%
they're going to try to keep our roads
 
01:30:11.189 --> 01:30:11.199 align:start position:0%
safer they're not going after people
 
01:30:13.510 --> 01:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
they're not after anyone on medicinal
 
01:30:16.709 --> 01:30:16.719 align:start position:0%
marijuana they are not on any purge of
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
marijuana they again chest are having
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
problems keeping people from being
 
01:30:23.430 --> 01:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
impaired while driving and that was the
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
idea behind the bill
 
01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:27.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm open to any questions uh some of
 
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
the chiefs are coming after me and
 
01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
they're probably better but i'm okay on
 
01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
can you still hear me
 
01:30:38.950 --> 01:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:41.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

01:30:41.030 --> 01:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:30:45.270 --> 01:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
there seems to be a lot of issues about
 
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
whether the container
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
open sealed
 
01:30:49.679 --> 01:30:51.910 align:start position:0%
open sealed
whatever

01:30:51.910 --> 01:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
why don't we just ban any marijuana in
 
01:30:57.189 --> 01:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
the passenger compartment
 
01:30:58.709 --> 01:30:58.719 align:start position:0%
of a car
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
well we were trying to make it a less
 
01:31:02.550 --> 01:31:02.560 align:start position:0%
onerous burden on people who may have
 
01:31:04.950 --> 01:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
medicinal marijuana if it's sealed in
 
01:31:07.270 --> 01:31:07.280 align:start position:0%
the container and the police stop you
 
01:31:08.790 --> 01:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
then you can they'll see it's a sealed
 
01:31:10.709 --> 01:31:10.719 align:start position:0%
package they'll know you're not using it
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
just like if you had a bottle any other
 
01:31:15.350 --> 01:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
get alcohol in the car it's in a sealed
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
bottle we don't ban it from being in the
 
01:31:19.189 --> 01:31:19.199 align:start position:0%
car we just pan it from being open
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
because we don't want people to be
 
01:31:22.470 --> 01:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
tempted to use it i don't want people to
 
01:31:24.629 --> 01:31:24.639 align:start position:0%
be tempted to grab a couple gummies and
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
then be impaired while they're driving
 
01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:37.590 --> 01:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative morgan you're recognized
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
very much senator i
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
have a question about
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
um it says marijuana show me have the
 
01:31:47.189 --> 01:31:47.199 align:start position:0%
same meaning as cannabis type drug
 
01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
and i looked up rsa 318 b 1 4. and
 
01:31:55.510 --> 01:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
does it uh does it in fact
 
01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't in fact
 
01:32:00.070 --> 01:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
cover like cannabis you know
 
01:32:02.229 --> 01:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
cannabis infused gummies that you've uh
 
01:32:03.910 --> 01:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
referred to several times that sort of
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
thing it does yes it does it does we
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
added if you i think you should have the
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
amended version from the senate uh the
 
01:32:14.870 --> 01:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:32:16.310 --> 01:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
had us add
 
01:32:19.030 --> 01:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
um i was using the phraseology too
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
loosely with marijuana and they wanted
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and they had a
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
coverall that that was legally accepted
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
in the in the state of new hampshire so
 
01:32:30.950 --> 01:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
we deferred to them and they put in a
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
couple phrases so it covered everything
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
all right thanks
 
01:32:38.830 --> 01:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative knight you were
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for taking my question
 
01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:32:49.750 --> 01:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
what is the definition of sealed
 
01:32:52.070 --> 01:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
um so when you go to
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
you buy your cannabis there is the seal
 
01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
much like
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen it i haven't been to the
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
dispensaries myself yeah there's not
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
it's a sticker
 
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay i okay so as long as the sticker
 
01:33:06.229 --> 01:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
seal is not broken i've been told it's
 
01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
sort of like a pack of cigarettes or
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
a carton of stars and there's either an
 
01:33:13.910 --> 01:33:13.920 align:start position:0%
ill label as long as that hasn't been
 
01:33:13.920 --> 01:33:14.950 align:start position:0%
ill label as long as that hasn't been
broken

01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
broken
 
01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
the police should be able to see if the
 
01:33:17.910 --> 01:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
seal is broken or not
 
01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:19.360 align:start position:0%

01:33:42.229 --> 01:33:42.239 align:start position:0%
think the police will testify as they
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
have more familiarity with it this
 
01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
couple the police chiefs are going to
 
01:33:47.430 --> 01:33:47.440 align:start position:0%
testify after me
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
they have let indicated to me that you
 
01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:51.280 align:start position:0%
could tell it wasn't just like you'd
 
01:33:53.189 --> 01:33:53.199 align:start position:0%
open and close the sticker they were i
 
01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
have been informed that once the seal is
 
01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
broken it would be evident that the seal
 
01:34:00.229 --> 01:34:00.239 align:start position:0%
was broken so you could ask chief zigori
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
and there's a couple of the chiefs if in
 
01:34:05.590 --> 01:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
fact that's the case
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
i just want to remind the members of the
 
01:34:09.030 --> 01:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
committee that we as members are going
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:11.990 align:start position:0%
to be
witnesses

01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
witnesses
 
01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:19.189 align:start position:0%
witnesses
anyways

01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative newman you're recognized
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
i don't uh have a question i just did
 
01:34:26.470 --> 01:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
not hear what you said uh we should be
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
aware of it was not didn't come through
 
01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:29.430 align:start position:0%
aware of it was not didn't come through
clearly

01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
clearly
 
01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
i apologize again i'm sorry i usually
 
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:33.920 align:start position:0%
would zoom this i just
 
01:34:36.149 --> 01:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
i had to work today um so i'm under a
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
big tent here at in tewkesbury high
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
school um so i i think we were talking
 
01:34:43.110 --> 01:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
about me and the other representative
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
she was asking about the seal i the
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
police will come after me and they can
 
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:49.280 align:start position:0%
testify they have told me that it is
 
01:34:51.030 --> 01:34:51.040 align:start position:0%
evident when the seal is broken much
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
like a pack of cigarettes are much like
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
a cigar carton some of them have plastic
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
seals some of them have maybe there are
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
more seals than i'm aware of but they
 
01:35:02.790 --> 01:35:02.800 align:start position:0%
can testify to what they're finding out
 
01:35:05.110 --> 01:35:05.120 align:start position:0%
there again i haven't physically seen
 
01:35:07.189 --> 01:35:07.199 align:start position:0%
the sealed container but i've been told
 
01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's much like a pack of cigarettes when
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
representative newman you have a
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
yeah well it's a statement i want to
 
01:35:22.470 --> 01:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
apologize to the senator that i did not
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
correctly address the chair and i was
 
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
talking to the senator but i mean to the
 
01:35:28.470 --> 01:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
chair and i appreciate that additional
 
01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.669 align:start position:0%
chair and i appreciate that additional
information

01:35:29.669 --> 01:35:29.679 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
no no i'm i'm probably the one
 
01:35:33.669 --> 01:35:33.679 align:start position:0%
i want to apologize to the committee
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
that i'm i'm not my suit and tie dressed
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
up and rearing and ready to go but again
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
um the idea is that we keep the
 
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
container or keep any marijuana a
 
01:35:45.030 --> 01:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
temptation away from the driver and you
 
01:35:46.470 --> 01:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
don't want him to be able to hand it to
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
the passenger next to him because
 
01:35:50.950 --> 01:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
it would be much like if he had no my
 
01:35:52.709 --> 01:35:52.719 align:start position:0%
friends like to drive and drink in high
 
01:35:54.790 --> 01:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
school i always told him it was a bad
 
01:35:57.669 --> 01:35:57.679 align:start position:0%
idea but they say oh you can just pass
 
01:35:59.110 --> 01:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
it to the guy in the next seat and we
 
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:01.360 align:start position:0%
don't want you passing anything to the
 
01:36:03.270 --> 01:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
guy in the next seat we just don't want
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
an open temptation there the police have
 
01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
said they're having problems on our
 
01:36:09.030 --> 01:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
roads that's why we brought the bill
 
01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:13.270 align:start position:0%
roads that's why we brought the bill
forward

01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.550 --> 01:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:16.790 --> 01:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:18.870 --> 01:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative conley you're recognized
 
01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
01:36:22.390 --> 01:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
01:36:23.430 --> 01:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh as
 
01:36:25.030 --> 01:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
as i suspect you know new hampshire
 
01:36:26.790 --> 01:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
hasn't carefully negotiated the
 
01:36:29.110 --> 01:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
criminalization statute
 
01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:31.669 align:start position:0%
criminalization statute
yup

01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
i've lost you i'm sorry go can you
 
01:36:36.070 --> 01:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
repeat that
 
01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:38.880 align:start position:0%
my question is does this
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
do you are you concerned that this bill
 
01:36:44.790 --> 01:36:44.800 align:start position:0%
does not order with the careful needed
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
criminalization statute around cannabis
 
01:36:48.790 --> 01:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
which i
 
01:36:50.470 --> 01:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
we had um
 
01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
senate our senate attorney examined it
 
01:36:55.750 --> 01:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
the police the police had their lawyers
 
01:36:58.149 --> 01:36:58.159 align:start position:0%
look over the bill and i have been told
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
that everything conforms to new
 
01:37:02.870 --> 01:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire state laws
 
01:37:03.910 --> 01:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
i appreciate that i guess my question is
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
this goes well beyond what is
 
01:37:10.229 --> 01:37:10.239 align:start position:0%
contemplated in the decriminalization
 
01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
statute particularly the suspension of a
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
license i guess i'm wondering
 
01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:16.950 align:start position:0%
license i guess i'm wondering
uh

01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:19.430 --> 01:37:19.440 align:start position:0%
how do these statutes coexist could
 
01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:21.600 align:start position:0%
someone be charged under both
 
01:37:26.229 --> 01:37:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:28.310 --> 01:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
so chief chigory and the other police
 
01:37:30.550 --> 01:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
chiefs have assured me senator french
 
01:37:33.030 --> 01:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
has the same concern
 
01:37:35.189 --> 01:37:35.199 align:start position:0%
was very concerned that there was a
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
higher fine we lowered it actually lower
 
01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:39.440 align:start position:0%
than i believe massachusetts maine and
 
01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:40.470 align:start position:0%
than i believe massachusetts maine and
vermont

01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
vermont
 
01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:41.510 align:start position:0%
vermont
um

01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
and he was afraid that people are going
 
01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:44.470 align:start position:0%
and he was afraid that people are going
to

01:37:44.470 --> 01:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:47.030 --> 01:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
be overly zealous in enforcing this the
 
01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
chiefs will come on later and
 
01:37:51.669 --> 01:37:51.679 align:start position:0%
they confirm to senator french that this
 
01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:53.119 align:start position:0%
will be used
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
at the beginning it's really just going
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
to be used as as an option they're going
 
01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
to tell you the first time
 
01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
you know you have an open container
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
please don't do that anymore as it
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
mounts up time after time and they have
 
01:38:07.030 --> 01:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
a record that you're breaking the law
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
you'll go after the 150 then if you're a
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
repeat offender
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
and they they have reason to believe
 
01:38:14.709 --> 01:38:14.719 align:start position:0%
that you're using the stuff then then
 
01:38:16.709 --> 01:38:16.719 align:start position:0%
they're going to be more zealous in
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
their advocacy of the bill
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:24.550 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
representative

01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things i'm i'm kind of
 
01:38:30.310 --> 01:38:30.320 align:start position:0%
curious about it are the the
 
01:38:32.790 --> 01:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
implications of having to store
 
01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:33.910 align:start position:0%
implications of having to store
um

01:38:33.910 --> 01:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know what could be medicine in a
 
01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
trunk in a hot trunk you know possibly
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh for hours uh i know that when people
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
if we uh if we insisted everybody put it
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
uh in there
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
in their trunk
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
we'd probably be stopping 95 percent of
 
01:38:56.550 --> 01:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
the cars that leave
 
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire state liquor stores
 
01:38:58.880 --> 01:38:59.830 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire state liquor stores
so

01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:01.590 --> 01:39:01.600 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm curious
 
01:39:01.600 --> 01:39:02.709 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm curious
why

01:39:02.709 --> 01:39:02.719 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:39:05.750 --> 01:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
the the different standard for for
 
01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:08.159 align:start position:0%
marijuana that could actually
 
01:39:08.159 --> 01:39:10.790 align:start position:0%
marijuana that could actually
um

01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:13.830 --> 01:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh let's jeopardize the efficacy of
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
what's medicine uh for some people uh if
 
01:39:19.030 --> 01:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
it if it actually gets damaged in a
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
trunk um when we don't require the same
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
thing for for alcohol
 
01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:27.840 align:start position:0%
so the idea is to keep the roads safe so
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
if you have so you're not going to
 
01:39:32.310 --> 01:39:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh let's say you're asking me
 
01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:33.830 align:start position:0%
uh let's say you're asking me
uh

01:39:33.830 --> 01:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
you can oh most must most of it you
 
01:39:37.750 --> 01:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
could just put in glove compartment you
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
could put it under your back seat it's
 
01:39:41.590 --> 01:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
stupid you don't have to put it in the
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
trunk the idea is to keep it there's a
 
01:39:47.109 --> 01:39:47.119 align:start position:0%
idea and law called um
 
01:39:48.790 --> 01:39:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's an arms reach doctrine you want to
 
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
keep weapons you want to keep drugs you
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
want to keep everything as far away from
 
01:39:54.629 --> 01:39:54.639 align:start position:0%
the driver as possible that's sort of
 
01:39:57.430 --> 01:39:57.440 align:start position:0%
where we're mirroring that if you put it
 
01:39:59.750 --> 01:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
under the back seat that would be fine
 
01:40:02.070 --> 01:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
as far as possible from the driver if
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
you put it in either of the glove most
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
cars have two glove compartments put it
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
in the car some type of compartment
 
01:40:10.310 --> 01:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
just don't have it sitting out next to
 
01:40:12.229 --> 01:40:12.239 align:start position:0%
you open
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
just again treating is the same as
 
01:40:17.510 --> 01:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol saying don't have something that
 
01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:18.790 align:start position:0%
alcohol saying don't have something that
can

01:40:18.790 --> 01:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:40:21.189 --> 01:40:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh impair your driving next to you it's
 
01:40:23.590 --> 01:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
very hard to prosecute
 
01:40:27.590 --> 01:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
people on thc as opposed to alcohol the
 
01:40:29.590 --> 01:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
tests are much harder to prove
 
01:40:31.669 --> 01:40:31.679 align:start position:0%
and so again we the idea here is to keep
 
01:40:34.709 --> 01:40:34.719 align:start position:0%
the roads as safe as possible
 
01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
i think the chiefs are probably
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
probably better than me at this but
 
01:41:02.470 --> 01:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
hi representative how you doing today
 
01:41:07.510 --> 01:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
section four i have a problem
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
okay i don't have the bill in front of
 
01:41:11.189 --> 01:41:11.199 align:start position:0%
me i'm sorry it's back on the stage but
 
01:41:15.030 --> 01:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead i've read it many times
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
a taxi or a limousine in this smoking
 
01:41:17.679 --> 01:41:18.790 align:start position:0%
a taxi or a limousine in this smoking
water

01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
water
 
01:41:20.709 --> 01:41:20.719 align:start position:0%
should there be a petition between them
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:28.870 --> 01:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
that that's a good observation um
 
01:41:31.109 --> 01:41:31.119 align:start position:0%
i like that officer yes the chief said
 
01:41:33.350 --> 01:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
i'll defer to their judgment on that
 
01:41:34.629 --> 01:41:34.639 align:start position:0%
they'll have a minute or two to think
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
about their answer so why don't we defer
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:52.629 --> 01:41:52.639 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry it was under these
 
01:41:58.149 --> 01:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
the channel recognizes chief andrew
 
01:42:00.719 --> 01:42:28.790 align:start position:0%
the channel recognizes chief andrew

01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:35.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:42:35.669 --> 01:42:35.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh taking my
 
01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:40.470 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh taking my
um

01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
my call into this meeting thank you for
 
01:42:44.310 --> 01:42:44.320 align:start position:0%

chairman abbas
 
01:42:49.350 --> 01:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
um this is designed to mirror
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
transporting alcohol in a vehicle um
 
01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:53.750 align:start position:0%
transporting alcohol in a vehicle um
it's

01:42:53.750 --> 01:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:42:55.910 --> 01:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
it's similar to the same requirements in
 
01:42:58.149 --> 01:42:58.159 align:start position:0%
many other states vermont
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%

oklahoma oregon from i said vermont and
 
01:43:20.149 --> 01:43:20.159 align:start position:0%
washington very very similar laws
 
01:43:22.830 --> 01:43:22.840 align:start position:0%
i want to emphasize this isn't about
 
01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
legalization decriminalization or
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
anything this is about public safety
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
with vehicles on public ways
 
01:43:32.229 --> 01:43:32.239 align:start position:0%
right now as uh
 
01:43:33.990 --> 01:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative connolly pointed out we
 
01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:34.990 align:start position:0%
representative connolly pointed out we
have

01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:36.800 align:start position:0%
decriminalization but there's a kind of
 
01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:37.510 align:start position:0%
decriminalization but there's a kind of
a

01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:43:38.790 --> 01:43:38.800 align:start position:0%
there's a miss in there there's a
 
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:40.320 align:start position:0%
there's an issue in there
 
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
um and i just ran into this not too long
 
01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:43.430 align:start position:0%
um and i just ran into this not too long
ago

01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:44.790 align:start position:0%
ago
um

01:43:44.790 --> 01:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
the decrim law treats somebody driving
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
down the road the same as somebody on
 
01:43:49.990 --> 01:43:50.000 align:start position:0%
the sidewalk using it
 
01:43:51.830 --> 01:43:51.840 align:start position:0%
and i think there's quite a difference
 
01:43:53.750 --> 01:43:53.760 align:start position:0%
between somebody driving down the road
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
with marijuana
 
01:44:00.149 --> 01:44:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
what can happen is if you get somebody
 
01:44:04.149 --> 01:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
between the age of 16 and 18
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
they potentially face uh a misdemeanor
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
for transporting drugs
 
01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
under uh
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
265 a 43
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
and that's a mandatory loss license for
 
01:44:18.070 --> 01:44:18.080 align:start position:0%
60 days
 
01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
and it's a higher fine this treats
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
everybody that's doing this dangerous
 
01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:23.430 align:start position:0%
everybody that's doing this dangerous
thing

01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
transporting potentially using it while
 
01:44:26.870 --> 01:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
they're driving
 
01:44:27.910 --> 01:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
as if
 
01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
the same
 
01:44:31.350 --> 01:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that i was looking
 
01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:32.070 align:start position:0%
uh one of the things that i was looking
at

01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
recently was a colorado department of
 
01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
health and human services they did
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
they do a compendium of the studies and
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
what they're experiencing out there
 
01:44:41.910 --> 01:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
what um they're seeing through the
 
01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:42.870 align:start position:0%
what um they're seeing through the
studies

01:44:42.870 --> 01:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
studies
 
01:44:45.350 --> 01:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh and what happens first off they said
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
that drivers should wait six hours after
 
01:44:50.149 --> 01:44:50.159 align:start position:0%
use some marijuana at least
 
01:44:51.590 --> 01:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
and they're also saying it could be
 
01:44:53.990 --> 01:44:54.000 align:start position:0%
longer if they're using edibles
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
they're finding there's a strong
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
evidence of studies showing that edibles
 
01:45:01.990 --> 01:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
can take up to four hours to
 
01:45:03.750 --> 01:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
the thc to enter the bloodstream and
 
01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:04.709 align:start position:0%
the thc to enter the bloodstream and
impact

01:45:04.709 --> 01:45:04.719 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:45:07.189 --> 01:45:07.199 align:start position:0%
a person's ability after they ingest it
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
and i'd point out therapeutic cannabis
 
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
impairs drivers just as any other
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana there's no difference in how
 
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
it affect how the impairment that can
 
01:45:21.109 --> 01:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
come from
 
01:45:21.119 --> 01:45:23.270 align:start position:0%
come from
marijuana

01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
we're seeing more and more drivers
 
01:45:26.390 --> 01:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
impaired with it we're dealing with it
 
01:45:28.870 --> 01:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
on the streets um
 
01:45:31.030 --> 01:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
again it's it's not targeted at any
 
01:45:32.629 --> 01:45:32.639 align:start position:0%
group this is
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
we believe all unsealed containers
 
01:45:36.390 --> 01:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
should be out of reach of the driver
 
01:45:39.030 --> 01:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh if there's an issue that like uh
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
representative harriet garth wright
 
01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:42.480 align:start position:0%
brought up and apologize if i
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
mispronounced the name
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
that could be addressed to rulemaking
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
with health and human services is what
 
01:45:50.550 --> 01:45:50.560 align:start position:0%
the atcs need to do
 
01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
as far as sealing
 
01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
but if it can't be sealed it really
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be within reach of the driver
 
01:45:57.910 --> 01:45:57.920 align:start position:0%
while it's on a public way
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
in a in a private way it doesn't count
 
01:46:02.229 --> 01:46:02.239 align:start position:0%
this law doesn't apply
 
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh this is this is essentially treating
 
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol like marijuana the same as the
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
law uh and i used as a model when i was
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
framing this uh the current open contain
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's happening
 
01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
legislatively this session and i don't
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
know if some of you may or may not be
 
01:46:21.910 --> 01:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
aware of this because it has gone
 
01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
through other committees there's more
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
atc's opening alternative treatment
 
01:46:27.350 --> 01:46:27.360 align:start position:0%
centers there's one opening keene
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
there's one opening in chichester people
 
01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
aren't having to drive long distances
 
01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:33.570 align:start position:0%
now to get their
 
01:46:33.570 --> 01:46:34.950 align:start position:0%
now to get their
[Music]

01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis
 
01:46:39.510 --> 01:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
so it they shouldn't have to have a long
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
period to get home after they get it
 
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
um so there shouldn't be a need and if
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
there is a sudden urge that they need to
 
01:46:48.550 --> 01:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
use it it's critical
 
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:50.560 align:start position:0%
they can pull into a private place and
 
01:46:52.390 --> 01:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
do it or they can wait till they get
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
home the problem the problem with
 
01:46:55.830 --> 01:46:55.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana unlike alcohol alcohol
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
typically about 45 minutes after you
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
ingest alcohol all of it is in your
 
01:47:01.030 --> 01:47:01.040 align:start position:0%
system elevates and you're being able to
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
be tested and we have standard numbers
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
for that problem with marijuana is when
 
01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
people ingest it it could hit them later
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
for example i guess mentioned the
 
01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
edibles can take four hours to impact
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
somebody's ability to drive they could
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
take it go off driving thinking they're
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:23.189 --> 01:47:23.199 align:start position:0%
part of the problem with therapeutic 2
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
is there's really no way to check
 
01:47:25.199 --> 01:47:26.390 align:start position:0%
is there's really no way to check
cards

01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
cards
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
so if we're just exempt therapeutic
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
patients we have no way of knowing who
 
01:47:32.550 --> 01:47:32.560 align:start position:0%
has a card who doesn't have a card it's
 
01:47:34.709 --> 01:47:34.719 align:start position:0%
all privileged no and it's not an issue
 
01:47:35.990 --> 01:47:36.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not raising that issue but i'm
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
saying there's no way for an officer on
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
the street to verify that easily if they
 
01:47:41.189 --> 01:47:41.199 align:start position:0%
don't have the card or if they're from
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:49.030 --> 01:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:50.709 --> 01:47:50.719 align:start position:0%
this is about fundamentally it's about
 
01:47:52.470 --> 01:47:52.480 align:start position:0%
public safety and safety on the roads
 
01:47:53.830 --> 01:47:53.840 align:start position:0%
not about use
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
no uh into one of the points that was
 
01:47:59.109 --> 01:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
raised was um
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
on the penalties how how obtainer of
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol is typically done
 
01:48:06.870 --> 01:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
typically now the there is no mandate
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
that a license gets suspended with open
 
01:48:10.390 --> 01:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
containers of alcohol in fact i can't
 
01:48:11.830 --> 01:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
think of a time
 
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
with an open container of alcohol that
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
we've seen somebody
 
01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
uh that that comes to my mind anyways
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
i've done this 33 years this law wasn't
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
in place all 33 years
 
01:48:22.629 --> 01:48:22.639 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
it is in an egregious case a judge could
 
01:48:27.030 --> 01:48:27.040 align:start position:0%
say hey you're going to lose your
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
license for 30 days that was outrageous
 
01:48:31.109 --> 01:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
for you to do what you did and
 
01:48:34.229 --> 01:48:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen it but it gives the judge
 
01:48:37.750 --> 01:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
that opportunity it's not the police
 
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.000 align:start position:0%
that are that can take the license it's
 
01:48:42.229 --> 01:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
up to a judge gives them that discretion
 
01:48:45.189 --> 01:48:45.199 align:start position:0%
as opposed to 265 843 which gives no
 
01:48:45.199 --> 01:48:46.390 align:start position:0%
as opposed to 265 843 which gives no
discretion

01:48:46.390 --> 01:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
01:48:48.790 --> 01:48:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's you shall lose your license
 
01:48:51.109 --> 01:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
uh if you run into if i just ran into
 
01:48:53.270 --> 01:48:53.280 align:start position:0%
somebody not too long ago 17
 
01:48:55.030 --> 01:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
and she fell into that it's an a
 
01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:56.310 align:start position:0%
and she fell into that it's an a
misdemeanor

01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
01:48:58.229 --> 01:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
and you shall lose your license and it's
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
it's more punitive this kind of pulls a
 
01:49:01.830 --> 01:49:01.840 align:start position:0%
penalty back
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
makes it a violation
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
and it
 
01:49:07.109 --> 01:49:07.119 align:start position:0%
and it makes it up to the judge if the
 
01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
judge feels it's an egregious case that
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
needs to send a message to that
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
particular person because of their
 
01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:14.629 align:start position:0%
particular person because of their
history

01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:49:16.390 --> 01:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
they could the judge could impose it
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
i've never seen it happen
 
01:49:20.550 --> 01:49:20.560 align:start position:0%
but it it gives that ability if somebody
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
were really endangering the public
 
01:49:25.430 --> 01:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
through their conduct um
 
01:49:26.790 --> 01:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
there was a question also about a
 
01:49:28.550 --> 01:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
barrier with
 
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
i i don't know about that i mean it's
 
01:49:35.669 --> 01:49:35.679 align:start position:0%
according to what the colorado
 
01:49:37.669 --> 01:49:37.679 align:start position:0%
department health and human services
 
01:49:39.750 --> 01:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
their study there's no evidence of
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
second-hand smoke
 
01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:43.910 align:start position:0%
second-hand smoke
impairs

01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
impairs
 
01:49:45.590 --> 01:49:45.600 align:start position:0%
other people in the vehicle
 
01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:47.199 align:start position:0%
and and something like a limo or
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
something it i
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
unless it's like you know the proverbial
 
01:49:52.550 --> 01:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
you know vehicle from cheech and chong
 
01:49:53.590 --> 01:49:53.600 align:start position:0%
that was
 
01:49:55.109 --> 01:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
had smoke rolling out the windows i
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
don't see how somebody could uh
 
01:49:59.669 --> 01:49:59.679 align:start position:0%
ingest enough to impact the you know if
 
01:50:01.189 --> 01:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
the passenger is using it in the back
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
seat and as in a taxi that the driver
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
would be impaired but again if it's a
 
01:50:07.590 --> 01:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
taxi that'd be up to the the actually
 
01:50:10.229 --> 01:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
the company policy really i would think
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
uh but i think we have to because
 
01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:14.149 align:start position:0%
uh but i think we have to because
recognize

01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
what i've seen for especially with the
 
01:50:18.070 --> 01:50:18.080 align:start position:0%
edibles like the gummies and the the
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
sour worms i've seen they're in sealed
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
package just like you get gummies in the
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know candy so if that were ripped
 
01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:25.830 align:start position:0%
you know candy so if that were ripped
open

01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
open
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's the way i've seen them anyways uh
 
01:50:30.310 --> 01:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
that we've
 
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
collected them from other places so that
 
01:50:33.510 --> 01:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
would be uh pretty obvious and this
 
01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
really like i said because of the new
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
places opening the distance between them
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
is much shorter than it was when this
 
01:50:43.350 --> 01:50:43.360 align:start position:0%
started with therapeutic there's really
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
no reason that somebody should go hours
 
01:50:47.590 --> 01:50:47.600 align:start position:0%
if they really have to have it on such a
 
01:50:49.109 --> 01:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
frequent basis
 
01:50:49.119 --> 01:50:51.510 align:start position:0%
frequent basis
that

01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:54.390 --> 01:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
that they couldn't accommodate that
 
01:50:56.470 --> 01:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
without driving
 
01:50:59.750 --> 01:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you i'll take your questions
 
01:51:01.750 --> 01:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chief for your testimony the
 
01:51:01.760 --> 01:51:02.790 align:start position:0%
thank you chief for your testimony the
chair

01:51:02.790 --> 01:51:02.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
has a question
 
01:51:05.669 --> 01:51:05.679 align:start position:0%
of the witness and i want to thank you
 
01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
in advance for taking my question
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh for someone who's driving a vehicle
 
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a trunk
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
let's just say at the
 
01:51:17.430 --> 01:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:20.950 --> 01:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
where in that vehicle would you
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
suggest is the least accessible to the
 
01:51:23.360 --> 01:51:24.870 align:start position:0%
suggest is the least accessible to the
driver

01:51:24.870 --> 01:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
driver
 
01:51:26.310 --> 01:51:26.320 align:start position:0%
thank you this is modeled right after
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
the alcohol container law which has the
 
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
same provision it says has to be as far
 
01:51:32.310 --> 01:51:32.320 align:start position:0%
as possible away from
 
01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
from the driver so if you have a pickup
 
01:51:37.830 --> 01:51:37.840 align:start position:0%
i have a f350 single cab no
 
01:51:39.589 --> 01:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
spare seat or anything
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
i i can put stuff behind my seat and
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
it's out of my reach i couldn't i'd have
 
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:45.599 align:start position:0%
in order for me to grab like a bottle or
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
something behind my seat i'd have to
 
01:51:49.430 --> 01:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
stop and pull over grab it or you could
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
put it away as far as you can away from
 
01:51:53.030 --> 01:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
the driver within their confines that
 
01:51:55.350 --> 01:51:55.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle uh nobody's asking people you
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
have to get a vehicle with a trunk but
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
it has to be as far away as possible
 
01:52:01.109 --> 01:52:01.119 align:start position:0%
and i realize there's fewer fewer and
 
01:52:03.589 --> 01:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
fewer sedans are being made more suvs
 
01:52:04.790 --> 01:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
you put it in the back where you put
 
01:52:07.270 --> 01:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
your groceries and stuff
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
and to raise there was a question about
 
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:10.480 align:start position:0%
conditioning well that would be
 
01:52:12.950 --> 01:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
conditioned too
 
01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:22.790 align:start position:0%
conditioned too
but

01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:42.550 align:start position:0%
 
is

01:52:42.550 --> 01:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:47.910 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
we have problems here in that last uh
 
01:52:51.350 --> 01:52:51.360 align:start position:0%
last question
 
01:52:53.910 --> 01:52:53.920 align:start position:0%
so the follow-up question is
 
01:52:55.910 --> 01:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
i read it to say which is the least
 
01:52:58.070 --> 01:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
accessible to the driver and i interpret
 
01:52:58.080 --> 01:52:58.870 align:start position:0%
accessible to the driver and i interpret
that

01:52:58.870 --> 01:52:58.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:02.149 --> 01:53:02.159 align:start position:0%
to apply to just a single location
 
01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
in the vehicle
 
01:53:06.629 --> 01:53:06.639 align:start position:0%
so i'm what i'm what i'm asking
 
01:53:06.639 --> 01:53:08.950 align:start position:0%
so i'm what i'm what i'm asking
is

01:53:08.950 --> 01:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:10.709 --> 01:53:10.719 align:start position:0%
maybe more than one location that may
 
01:53:12.709 --> 01:53:12.719 align:start position:0%
not be accessible to the driver
 
01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:15.679 align:start position:0%
but i'm i'm reading that that the it has
 
01:53:17.270 --> 01:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
to be stored
 
01:53:18.790 --> 01:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
where that is least accessible to the
 
01:53:20.070 --> 01:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
driver so
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
i'm just asking how is that determined
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
i understand it may not may not be
 
01:53:28.470 --> 01:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
i hear what you're saying because it
 
01:53:32.070 --> 01:53:32.080 align:start position:0%
could be two places inaccessible one
 
01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:33.030 align:start position:0%
could be two places inaccessible one
more

01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:53:34.310 --> 01:53:34.320 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:36.070 align:start position:0%
i think
uh

01:53:36.070 --> 01:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
i think in the case of like i think with
 
01:53:39.589 --> 01:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
my pickup where it's least accessible
 
01:53:41.109 --> 01:53:41.119 align:start position:0%
behind the front behind the seat
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
obviously is least accessible to me
 
01:53:44.159 --> 01:53:46.390 align:start position:0%
obviously is least accessible to me
uh

01:53:46.390 --> 01:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:53:48.870 --> 01:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
i i think
 
01:53:52.229 --> 01:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
i understand the question i think when
 
01:53:54.480 --> 01:53:55.430 align:start position:0%
i understand the question i think when
you

01:53:55.430 --> 01:53:55.440 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:53:56.550 --> 01:53:56.560 align:start position:0%
that we've been applying this for
 
01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
alcohol for quite a while and i don't
 
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
think that's ever come up as i think
 
01:54:01.510 --> 01:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's always been
 
01:54:02.709 --> 01:54:02.719 align:start position:0%
we're trying to keep it away from the
 
01:54:04.149 --> 01:54:04.159 align:start position:0%
front seat with the driver you know what
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
i mean where they can easily access it
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
and use it as they're driving
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
uh that's
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
there may be some language but then this
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
is again i modeled it after the alcohol
 
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:16.800 align:start position:0%
one to keep it
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
along the same
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
experience line for police and the
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
public for alcohol
 
01:54:23.910 --> 01:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
and it's along the lines of what other
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:46.790 --> 01:54:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:50.550 --> 01:54:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um
 
01:54:52.390 --> 01:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things that you testified to
 
01:54:55.350 --> 01:54:55.360 align:start position:0%
is that edibles can take
 
01:54:58.229 --> 01:54:58.239 align:start position:0%
up to four hours to take effect
 
01:54:58.239 --> 01:54:59.030 align:start position:0%
up to four hours to take effect
so

01:54:59.030 --> 01:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:00.950 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:55:00.950 --> 01:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
one of the things that made me wonder is
 
01:55:06.070 --> 01:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
whether whether edibles should actually
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
be exempt
 
01:55:09.189 --> 01:55:09.199 align:start position:0%
because even if a person had an open
 
01:55:11.109 --> 01:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
container sitting next to them
 
01:55:13.669 --> 01:55:13.679 align:start position:0%
um and had just had one five minutes
 
01:55:13.679 --> 01:55:14.870 align:start position:0%
um and had just had one five minutes
before

01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
before
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't necessarily feel the
 
01:55:20.070 --> 01:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
effects for for quite a while um
 
01:55:20.080 --> 01:55:21.589 align:start position:0%
effects for for quite a while um
so

01:55:21.589 --> 01:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:23.830 --> 01:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
i guess my my question is is there seems
 
01:55:25.030 --> 01:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
well there are there are differences in
 
01:55:30.149 --> 01:55:30.159 align:start position:0%
the way that alcohol work versus the way
 
01:55:32.550 --> 01:55:32.560 align:start position:0%
that some of the cannabis products work
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
that don't seem to be accounted for in
 
01:55:36.310 --> 01:55:36.320 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:55:38.229 --> 01:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
and i guess my question is is do you
 
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:39.920 align:start position:0%
think we need to do a better job of
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
accounting for those variations
 
01:55:45.109 --> 01:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
no i don't think so because i think they
 
01:55:47.030 --> 01:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
both impair drivers
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
um part of the issue would be
 
01:55:51.030 --> 01:55:51.040 align:start position:0%
you don't know when when i stop somebody
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know when they've had alcohol i
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't know when they've had that
 
01:55:53.520 --> 01:55:54.790 align:start position:0%
don't know when they've had that
marijuana

01:55:54.790 --> 01:55:54.800 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
if they have edibles
 
01:55:58.550 --> 01:55:58.560 align:start position:0%
a common thing that happens
 
01:56:00.229 --> 01:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
somebody will go to a party say with it
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
with a bunch of beer or a bottle they'll
 
01:56:04.149 --> 01:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
take bottles with them
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
they're not they may not leave them well
 
01:56:08.070 --> 01:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
same thing with edibles if you have a
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
bag of edibles you took to you know i've
 
01:56:11.669 --> 01:56:11.679 align:start position:0%
i've heard of dorm parties where they
 
01:56:12.790 --> 01:56:12.800 align:start position:0%
bring them
 
01:56:14.070 --> 01:56:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know if you have a bag of edibles
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
and now you're not going to just leave
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
them you're going to take your the
 
01:56:18.390 --> 01:56:18.400 align:start position:0%
remaining home with you you may have had
 
01:56:19.589 --> 01:56:19.599 align:start position:0%
them earlier
 
01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:21.199 align:start position:0%
we have no idea when somebody actually
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
took it when we stopped somebody
 
01:56:25.109 --> 01:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
that you your
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
edibles still impair people
 
01:56:29.510 --> 01:56:29.520 align:start position:0%
and it can take up to four hours it
 
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
depends on how it is what kind
 
01:56:33.430 --> 01:56:33.440 align:start position:0%
depends on what you've eaten
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
your experience with it
 
01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:38.070 align:start position:0%
your experience with it
unlike

01:56:38.070 --> 01:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
unlike
 
01:56:39.910 --> 01:56:39.920 align:start position:0%
unlike alcohol
 
01:56:42.709 --> 01:56:42.719 align:start position:0%
marijuana thc thc is the active part
 
01:56:45.430 --> 01:56:45.440 align:start position:0%
that impairs your ability to drive
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
thc doesn't necessarily follow along a
 
01:56:51.589 --> 01:56:51.599 align:start position:0%
straight path like alcohol alcohol 45
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
minutes it's typically in your system
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
depending upon how much you had to eat
 
01:56:57.990 --> 01:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
and how much you drank how fast and it
 
01:56:59.589 --> 01:56:59.599 align:start position:0%
dissipates from your body at a steady
 
01:57:02.790 --> 01:57:02.800 align:start position:0%
rate 0.015
 
01:57:04.070 --> 01:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
per hour
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
marijuana doesn't work that way it's fat
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
soluble it takes longer
 
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
to dissipate depending upon your
 
01:57:12.310 --> 01:57:12.320 align:start position:0%
your body makeup how much you have how
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
frequently you have it because it
 
01:57:14.709 --> 01:57:14.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily all dissipate at
 
01:57:14.719 --> 01:57:15.589 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily all dissipate at
once

01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
once
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
so i i don't this is all about public
 
01:57:19.669 --> 01:57:19.679 align:start position:0%
safety and driving down the road i don't
 
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
think you need to make a differentiation
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
because they both impair you
 
01:57:24.950 --> 01:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
they both
 
01:57:27.510 --> 01:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
cause problems for drivers and you don't
 
01:57:31.669 --> 01:57:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:33.350 --> 01:57:33.360 align:start position:0%
representative news you recognized for a
 
01:57:35.910 --> 01:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:37.589 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
um

01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
one thing i'm i'm also wondering about
 
01:57:43.030 --> 01:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
are the circumstances for potential
 
01:57:45.109 --> 01:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
stops in this area
 
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
so for this law to be enforced or or in
 
01:57:51.030 --> 01:57:51.040 align:start position:0%
circumstances where you think this law
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
would be enforced what are the most
 
01:57:54.950 --> 01:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
likely circumstances
 
01:57:58.229 --> 01:57:58.239 align:start position:0%
that would uh involve the officer making
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:03.430 --> 01:58:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh well it could be any number of
 
01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:04.629 align:start position:0%
uh well it could be any number of
reasons

01:58:04.629 --> 01:58:04.639 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
01:58:04.639 --> 01:58:06.149 align:start position:0%
reasons
typically

01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
typically
 
01:58:06.159 --> 01:58:07.669 align:start position:0%
typically
um

01:58:07.669 --> 01:58:07.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:09.350 --> 01:58:09.360 align:start position:0%
the one in my particular case it's an
 
01:58:11.189 --> 01:58:11.199 align:start position:0%
open case i'm kind of shouldn't probably
 
01:58:12.629 --> 01:58:12.639 align:start position:0%
shouldn't talk a whole lot about it but
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
this person blew a stop sign and pulled
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
into my lane of travel
 
01:58:19.990 --> 01:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
uh and i stopped this person for a stop
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
sign violation
 
01:58:22.709 --> 01:58:22.719 align:start position:0%
and driving on the wrong side of the
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
road afterwards um
 
01:58:28.149 --> 01:58:28.159 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a matter
 
01:58:30.550 --> 01:58:30.560 align:start position:0%
i don't see that you could
 
01:58:32.470 --> 01:58:32.480 align:start position:0%
you know with with vape cartridges for
 
01:58:34.229 --> 01:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
example you you can't you can't tell
 
01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:36.320 align:start position:0%
what's in them so even if you saw smoke
 
01:58:37.750 --> 01:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't know what somebody's
 
01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
smoking you so you couldn't necessarily
 
01:58:41.589 --> 01:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
stop for that um
 
01:58:44.470 --> 01:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
it's it'd be in most of this mostly you
 
01:58:45.830 --> 01:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
if it was a gummy you couldn't tell if
 
01:58:46.950 --> 01:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's a gummy or not it would be
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
something you stop them for another
 
01:58:48.719 --> 01:58:50.790 align:start position:0%
something you stop them for another
reason

01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:58:53.189 --> 01:58:53.199 align:start position:0%
typically or erratic operation they're
 
01:58:57.189 --> 01:58:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm senator pantalas you're
 
01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:14.830 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm senator pantalas you're
recognized

01:59:14.830 --> 01:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:17.510 --> 01:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
01:59:17.520 --> 01:59:19.510 align:start position:0%
oh okay
yes

01:59:19.510 --> 01:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:20.310 align:start position:0%
yes
it

01:59:20.310 --> 01:59:20.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:59:23.990 --> 01:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
is not to do with uh
 
01:59:26.950 --> 01:59:26.960 align:start position:0%
accidents and what not occur
 
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
and they cannot be charged with drunken
 
01:59:32.950 --> 01:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
driving because it was not there but
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
would just serve as evidence
 
01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:41.109 align:start position:0%
would just serve as evidence
so

01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
part of what happened with the alcohol
 
01:59:45.030 --> 01:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
and how the open container came to be is
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
we had people drinking and driving
 
01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:48.229 align:start position:0%
we had people drinking and driving
and

01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
part of the problem is you know like i
 
01:59:52.149 --> 01:59:52.159 align:start position:0%
said it takes 45 minutes well you could
 
01:59:54.390 --> 01:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
stop somebody right after they drank
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
and they're passing the test i'd have no
 
01:59:58.629 --> 01:59:58.639 align:start position:0%
problem cause to arrest them because
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
they passed sobriety tests they could go
 
02:00:02.790 --> 02:00:02.800 align:start position:0%
down the roads to continue driving and
 
02:00:04.629 --> 02:00:04.639 align:start position:0%
then it could by that time they could be
 
02:00:05.750 --> 02:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
impaired to a degree where it's
 
02:00:05.760 --> 02:00:06.950 align:start position:0%
impaired to a degree where it's
dangerous

02:00:06.950 --> 02:00:06.960 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
02:00:08.310 --> 02:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
a similar thing could happen with
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
marijuana they could use marijuana it
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
may not be affecting them at the time
 
02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
you stopped them because they just used
 
02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:15.030 align:start position:0%
you stopped them because they just used
it

02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:00:16.950 --> 02:00:16.960 align:start position:0%
so now i have no problem cause to arrest
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
them i
 
02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
you know i let them drive off and then
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
they could be impaired down the road
 
02:00:24.870 --> 02:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
because that's when the effects will
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
will overcome them their ability to
 
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
safely drive a vehicle
 
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
so this is this again it's it's a it's a
 
02:00:33.589 --> 02:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
tool to help make sure we're safer on
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
the roads
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
it's not something it's very hard to get
 
02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
people with with with marijuana they
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't test the same as far as seeing
 
02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:42.709 align:start position:0%
don't test the same as far as seeing
them

02:00:42.709 --> 02:00:42.719 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
they manifest how they act
 
02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:45.669 align:start position:0%
they manifest how they act
uh

02:00:45.669 --> 02:00:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
they do
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
there is no per se or prima facie limit
 
02:00:52.950 --> 02:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
so even if we get a test back saying
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
they have 10 nanograms
 
02:00:58.470 --> 02:00:58.480 align:start position:0%
per milliliter in blood we don't know
 
02:01:00.550 --> 02:01:00.560 align:start position:0%
we can't necessarily say that's that's
 
02:01:00.560 --> 02:01:01.669 align:start position:0%
we can't necessarily say that's that's
enough

02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
enough
 
02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
but that's different that's a different
 
02:01:04.950 --> 02:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
topic i guess i'm kind of shifting gears
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
it is tough this is just another tool to
 
02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
help us deal with people who decide to
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
use it while driving it may deter some
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
people from having it with them where
 
02:01:15.910 --> 02:01:15.920 align:start position:0%
they could use it while driving it's
 
02:01:17.830 --> 02:01:17.840 align:start position:0%
it's that's what it's about it's trying
 
02:01:20.310 --> 02:01:20.320 align:start position:0%
to keep the public safe it's not about
 
02:01:22.149 --> 02:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
criminalizing marijuana it's not about
 
02:01:24.870 --> 02:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
punishing therapeutic patients it's
 
02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
it's about
 
02:01:28.470 --> 02:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
safety on the roads and it and i don't
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
and to the decrim law treats people
 
02:01:32.629 --> 02:01:32.639 align:start position:0%
driving the same as somebody sitting on
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
a park bench using it which i think
 
02:01:37.109 --> 02:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
there's a difference
 
02:01:41.270 --> 02:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:44.229 --> 02:01:44.239 align:start position:0%
representative newman you're recognized
 
02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you chief
 
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:47.440 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
02:01:50.070 --> 02:01:50.080 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with the last part
 
02:01:52.870 --> 02:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
of paragraph roman numeral one and it
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
says essentially that if if a vehicle
 
02:01:59.669 --> 02:01:59.679 align:start position:0%
has a trunk you shall transport um open
 
02:02:02.709 --> 02:02:02.719 align:start position:0%
uh containers in that trunk
 
02:02:05.030 --> 02:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
is that is that a correct interpretation
 
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
because people keep talking about having
 
02:02:10.709 --> 02:02:10.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
02:02:14.070 --> 02:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
if you have a trunk if you have an old
 
02:02:15.750 --> 02:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
container of alcohol you have to put it
 
02:02:18.149 --> 02:02:18.159 align:start position:0%
in there if you do not have a trunk then
 
02:02:20.229 --> 02:02:20.239 align:start position:0%
you have to put it in a place that's rel
 
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
inaccessible to the driver as best you
 
02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:23.109 align:start position:0%
inaccessible to the driver as best you
can

02:02:23.109 --> 02:02:23.119 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:02:24.950 --> 02:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't know of anybody
 
02:02:27.750 --> 02:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
and it's to treat it the same it should
 
02:02:31.830 --> 02:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
be in the trunk
 
02:02:34.470 --> 02:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
so it's not in accessible to the driver
 
02:02:36.229 --> 02:02:36.239 align:start position:0%
i don't think i i've never known anybody
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
to sit there and say oh well it was
 
02:02:40.550 --> 02:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
they put it in the you know with an suv
 
02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
for example while they put it in the
 
02:02:45.270 --> 02:02:45.280 align:start position:0%
left rear which is closer than the right
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
rear to the driver i've never heard
 
02:02:48.950 --> 02:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
anybody charged like that because they
 
02:02:50.550 --> 02:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
made an effort you know what i mean i
 
02:02:50.560 --> 02:02:56.470 align:start position:0%
made an effort you know what i mean i
think

02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.270 --> 02:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative newman you recognized
 
02:03:01.030 --> 02:03:01.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up question just to understand
 
02:03:03.109 --> 02:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
what the response was there it doesn't
 
02:03:05.109 --> 02:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
say you should keep it in the trunk the
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
law says
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
you shall keep it in the trunk is that a
 
02:03:08.239 --> 02:03:10.310 align:start position:0%
you shall keep it in the trunk is that a
problem

02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:10.320 align:start position:0%
problem
 
02:03:12.149 --> 02:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so i think if if you
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
have a trunk you shall put it in the
 
02:03:16.070 --> 02:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
trunk if you don't have a trunk
 
02:03:18.390 --> 02:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
then you have to go the other way
 
02:03:19.270 --> 02:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
if the motor vehicle or hiv does not
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
have a trunk such container shall be
 
02:03:23.910 --> 02:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
stored and transported in that
 
02:03:25.589 --> 02:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
compartment or area which is least
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
accessible so it's a compartment too
 
02:03:30.470 --> 02:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's an area it's not necessarily a uh
 
02:03:32.790 --> 02:03:32.800 align:start position:0%
a defined the furthest point it's an
 
02:03:34.709 --> 02:03:34.719 align:start position:0%
area compartment
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
again this is right after the alcohol
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
law this is how we
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
deal with the open containers of alcohol
 
02:03:42.629 --> 02:03:42.639 align:start position:0%
now so i don't see a big
 
02:03:42.639 --> 02:03:43.910 align:start position:0%
now so i don't see a big
uh

02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:45.990 --> 02:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
learning curve for law enforcement
 
02:03:47.830 --> 02:03:47.840 align:start position:0%
because we're used to applying this in
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
alcohol cases
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
uh and i don't see it uh it being a
 
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
major impediment
 
02:03:56.070 --> 02:03:56.080 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a major impediment for the
 
02:03:57.830 --> 02:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
for the motor in public because it is
 
02:03:59.589 --> 02:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
the same as alcohol they have to do now
 
02:04:03.350 --> 02:04:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:04.629 --> 02:04:04.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight you're
 
02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:09.189 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight you're
recognized

02:04:09.189 --> 02:04:09.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:10.870 --> 02:04:10.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chair um
 
02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
02:04:14.790 --> 02:04:14.800 align:start position:0%
chief for taking my question
 
02:04:17.109 --> 02:04:17.119 align:start position:0%
in your opinion what do you think is
 
02:04:22.550 --> 02:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
worse oxycodone alcohol or marijuana
 
02:04:24.950 --> 02:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
all three
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
well uh if
 
02:04:28.390 --> 02:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
any one of them is bad free for use on
 
02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
the impaired drivers which is what this
 
02:04:32.870 --> 02:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
is about in public safety they each have
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
different uh impacts on people and
 
02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:36.870 align:start position:0%
different uh impacts on people and
um

02:04:36.870 --> 02:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:39.030 --> 02:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
probably oxy is the worst but in
 
02:04:41.109 --> 02:04:41.119 align:start position:0%
different ways and
 
02:04:44.550 --> 02:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:49.910 --> 02:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a follow-up
 
02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:51.669 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a follow-up
question

02:04:51.669 --> 02:04:51.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:04:51.679 --> 02:04:52.709 align:start position:0%
question
why

02:04:52.709 --> 02:04:52.719 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:04:54.950 --> 02:04:54.960 align:start position:0%
isn't anybody making laws about
 
02:04:57.350 --> 02:04:57.360 align:start position:0%
medication like oxycodone men in
 
02:04:57.360 --> 02:05:02.149 align:start position:0%
medication like oxycodone men in
comparison

02:05:02.149 --> 02:05:02.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:03.350 --> 02:05:03.360 align:start position:0%
good question
 
02:05:03.360 --> 02:05:04.550 align:start position:0%
good question
uh

02:05:04.550 --> 02:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to
 
02:05:09.189 --> 02:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
one piece at a time making our way there
 
02:05:10.709 --> 02:05:10.719 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
02:05:11.589 --> 02:05:11.599 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:13.280 align:start position:0%
the diff there's a difference though i
 
02:05:13.280 --> 02:05:15.589 align:start position:0%
the diff there's a difference though i
mean

02:05:15.589 --> 02:05:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:19.109 --> 02:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
there is a law on transporting drugs for
 
02:05:19.119 --> 02:05:20.390 align:start position:0%
there is a law on transporting drugs for
oxycodone

02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
oxycodone
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
that would be 265 843
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
so if somebody is carrying it and
 
02:05:26.550 --> 02:05:26.560 align:start position:0%
they're not supposed to have it
 
02:05:27.669 --> 02:05:27.679 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
02:05:29.189 --> 02:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
a penalty
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
uh that mandates a loss of license
 
02:05:35.750 --> 02:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
so it's it's actually more severe
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:41.830 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

02:05:41.830 --> 02:05:41.840 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:05:47.189 --> 02:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:49.030 --> 02:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
limiting members did
 
02:05:50.390 --> 02:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
a few questions
 
02:05:50.400 --> 02:05:52.310 align:start position:0%
a few questions
so

02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
seeing no uh for the hands raised
 
02:06:08.390 --> 02:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh i'm gonna make the appointments for

okay fine and i also serve as the chair
 
02:06:37.750 --> 02:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
of the therapeutic cannabis medical
 
02:06:40.709 --> 02:06:40.719 align:start position:0%
oversight board
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
the tcmob of therapeutic cannabis
 
02:06:44.790 --> 02:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
medical oversight board is composed of
 
02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
the chief medical officer of dhhs
 
02:06:50.069 --> 02:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
a qualifying patient representative a
 
02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
clinical representative from an atc and
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
10 medical providers from various fields
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
we're charged with the task of advising
 
02:06:59.030 --> 02:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program on
 
02:07:01.510 --> 02:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
medical issues including qualifying
 
02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:03.510 align:start position:0%
medical issues including qualifying
conditions

02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
now today i'm not here to report a
 
02:07:07.510 --> 02:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
recommendation of the tcmob as we did
 
02:07:10.149 --> 02:07:10.159 align:start position:0%
not review this specific bill
 
02:07:13.030 --> 02:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
but i am presenting how we view the use
 
02:07:15.030 --> 02:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
of therapeutic cannabis
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
i am here to urge exemption of
 
02:07:18.550 --> 02:07:18.560 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients and
 
02:07:21.030 --> 02:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
caregivers from this bill
 
02:07:23.669 --> 02:07:23.679 align:start position:0%
using therapeutic cannabis is simply not
 
02:07:26.069 --> 02:07:26.079 align:start position:0%
the same as alcohol this comparison of
 
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis and alcohol has been made many
 
02:07:29.669 --> 02:07:29.679 align:start position:0%
times but i'd like to note that we do
 
02:07:32.069 --> 02:07:32.079 align:start position:0%
not have a therapeutic alcohol program
 
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
in this state
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
the goal of using cannabis in the
 
02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
therapeutic setting
 
02:07:39.589 --> 02:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
is different from the goal and
 
02:07:42.709 --> 02:07:42.719 align:start position:0%
recreational use of cannabis
 
02:07:44.390 --> 02:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
in recreational use
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
the point is to get high
 
02:07:49.589 --> 02:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis is not used to get
 
02:07:49.599 --> 02:07:50.470 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis is not used to get
high

02:07:50.470 --> 02:07:50.480 align:start position:0%
high
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
but instead to treat a condition
 
02:07:55.430 --> 02:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
doses in therapeutic cannabis are
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
titrated using the rubric
 
02:07:59.510 --> 02:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
low and slow
 
02:08:01.830 --> 02:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
you start with a low dose
 
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
and you very slowly build to achieve the
 
02:08:06.229 --> 02:08:06.239 align:start position:0%
therapeutic effect
 
02:08:08.629 --> 02:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
while minimizing the side effect of
 
02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
getting high
 
02:08:13.270 --> 02:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
in therapeutic cannabis getting high
 
02:08:15.430 --> 02:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
is a negative side effect
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
it is not
 
02:08:18.790 --> 02:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
the desired effect
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
in the therapeutic cannabis program
 
02:08:22.870 --> 02:08:22.880 align:start position:0%
patients are certified as having a
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
qualifying condition for which
 
02:08:27.990 --> 02:08:28.000 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis is approved
 
02:08:30.790 --> 02:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
they then possess and use the cannabis
 
02:08:34.470 --> 02:08:34.480 align:start position:0%
as though it were a regular medication
 
02:08:36.709 --> 02:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
contrary to what senator gannon earlier
 
02:08:39.830 --> 02:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
stated the cannabis obtained in an atc
 
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:43.040 align:start position:0%
comes in a clearly labeled container
 
02:08:45.350 --> 02:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
which states precisely the content of
 
02:08:48.149 --> 02:08:48.159 align:start position:0%
the cannabinoids determined by analysis
 
02:08:51.189 --> 02:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
of that specific batch of cannabis
 
02:08:53.350 --> 02:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
the dose is not
 
02:08:55.109 --> 02:08:55.119 align:start position:0%
unknown to the patient they know
 
02:08:57.270 --> 02:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
precisely what they're taking
 
02:09:00.390 --> 02:09:00.400 align:start position:0%
the patient may use cannabis regularly
 
02:09:01.669 --> 02:09:01.679 align:start position:0%
or they may just use it when their
 
02:09:03.990 --> 02:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
symptoms flare
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
comments are made about
 
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
being on the road from picking up their
 
02:09:09.910 --> 02:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
cannabis that's not likely that's not
 
02:09:11.030 --> 02:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
likely the time when they're going to
 
02:09:13.589 --> 02:09:13.599 align:start position:0%
unseal it when traveling
 
02:09:16.229 --> 02:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
for example to go visit a friend
 
02:09:19.270 --> 02:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
to go out to dinner to go anywhere they
 
02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
may need to take their therapeutic
 
02:09:22.629 --> 02:09:22.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis with them
 
02:09:24.470 --> 02:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
because they may take it again regularly
 
02:09:26.310 --> 02:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
or may have a flare of a symptom at a
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
time they don't expect it
 
02:09:29.830 --> 02:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
and it is highly likely that when
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
traveling and taking their therapeutic
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
cannabis from home that they probably
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
have already unsealed the container of
 
02:09:36.320 --> 02:09:37.430 align:start position:0%
have already unsealed the container of
cannabis

02:09:37.430 --> 02:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
which they legally obtained at the atc
 
02:09:42.629 --> 02:09:42.639 align:start position:0%
they would have already opened it to use
 
02:09:43.990 --> 02:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
at home
 
02:09:46.069 --> 02:09:46.079 align:start position:0%
just like if i have a prescription for
 
02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:47.760 align:start position:0%
medication in my
 
02:09:47.760 --> 02:09:48.550 align:start position:0%
medication in my
uh

02:09:48.550 --> 02:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
closet it's not likely that it would not
 
02:09:52.550 --> 02:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
have ever been opened because i would be
 
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
using it
 
02:09:55.510 --> 02:09:55.520 align:start position:0%
now i really need to comment on a few
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
earlier statements there was a comment
 
02:09:59.910 --> 02:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
made about sharing therapeutic cannabis
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
just handing a gummy to your passenger
 
02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
it is already illegal for a therapeutic
 
02:10:06.950 --> 02:10:06.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient to divert their
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis to another
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
subject to criminal penalties and
 
02:10:14.709 --> 02:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
resulting in loss of certification
 
02:10:16.870 --> 02:10:16.880 align:start position:0%
regarding the officer not being able to
 
02:10:18.149 --> 02:10:18.159 align:start position:0%
check cards
 
02:10:20.870 --> 02:10:20.880 align:start position:0%

02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
a qualifying patient or designated

a qualifying patient or designated
caregiver

02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%

02:10:40.390 --> 02:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
subject to a fine of 100
 
02:10:42.550 --> 02:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
regarding that issue about being in the
 
02:10:45.189 --> 02:10:45.199 align:start position:0%
trunk that representative muse asked
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
high heat is likely to adversely affect
 
02:10:51.109 --> 02:10:51.119 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis just as it does
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:55.599 align:start position:0%
comet was just made about other
 
02:10:57.510 --> 02:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
medicines and referred to
 
02:10:57.520 --> 02:10:58.790 align:start position:0%
medicines and referred to
um

02:10:58.790 --> 02:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:01.109 --> 02:11:01.119 align:start position:0%
controlled substances being transported
 
02:11:02.790 --> 02:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's controlled substances of people
 
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
who are not supposed to have them
 
02:11:09.510 --> 02:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that rsa 318 b14
 
02:11:11.669 --> 02:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
which previously required controlled
 
02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
drugs to be in their original container
 
02:11:17.990 --> 02:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
was repealed in 2011.
 
02:11:20.550 --> 02:11:20.560 align:start position:0%
this bill would impose an even more
 
02:11:22.629 --> 02:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
stringent burden on therapeutic cannabis
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
patients than the original repealed
 
02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:27.589 align:start position:0%
patients than the original repealed
318b14

02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
318b14
 
02:11:29.669 --> 02:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
as it requires not only the original
 
02:11:34.950 --> 02:11:34.960 align:start position:0%
candidater but an unbroken original seal
 
02:11:36.709 --> 02:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis is the equivalent
 
02:11:38.550 --> 02:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
of a prescribed medication
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
it is not the same as an open can of
 
02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:43.030 align:start position:0%
it is not the same as an open can of
beer

02:11:43.030 --> 02:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
beer
 
02:11:45.189 --> 02:11:45.199 align:start position:0%
if the patient is not actively using
 
02:11:46.629 --> 02:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
their therapeutic cannabis in the
 
02:11:46.639 --> 02:11:47.830 align:start position:0%
their therapeutic cannabis in the
vehicle

02:11:47.830 --> 02:11:47.840 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
02:11:49.109 --> 02:11:49.119 align:start position:0%
and they say they just have it in a
 
02:11:50.629 --> 02:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
backpack they just threw in their back
 
02:11:52.870 --> 02:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
seaters they're going to visit a friend
 
02:11:54.950 --> 02:11:54.960 align:start position:0%
they should not be penalized
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
so i urge you to amend this bill
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
to create an exemption for a registered
 
02:12:02.149 --> 02:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program patients
 
02:12:02.159 --> 02:12:02.870 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program patients
and

02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:06.550 --> 02:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
caregivers both from this law i also do
 
02:12:07.990 --> 02:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
have a concern
 
02:12:12.229 --> 02:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
that on section 4 of sb 60 lines 19 to
 
02:12:12.239 --> 02:12:13.430 align:start position:0%
that on section 4 of sb 60 lines 19 to
21

02:12:13.430 --> 02:12:13.440 align:start position:0%
21
 
02:12:15.589 --> 02:12:15.599 align:start position:0%
there is an exemption for a driver
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
transporting a person for hire
 
02:12:21.430 --> 02:12:21.440 align:start position:0%
but should this amendment also exempt a
 
02:12:24.149 --> 02:12:24.159 align:start position:0%
friend who gives a ride to a therapeutic
 
02:12:26.390 --> 02:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient who just happens to
 
02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
have his therapeutic cannabis with him
 
02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:31.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps in his pocket so that he just so
 
02:12:32.709 --> 02:12:32.719 align:start position:0%
that he does not forget to take it with
 
02:12:35.430 --> 02:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
him when he reaches his destination
 
02:12:37.109 --> 02:12:37.119 align:start position:0%
he may be dropped off he hops out and he
 
02:12:39.430 --> 02:12:39.440 align:start position:0%
says oh my gosh i left my cannabis in
 
02:12:41.109 --> 02:12:41.119 align:start position:0%
the guy's trunk
 
02:12:42.870 --> 02:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
well under this bill with that driver
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
who's not for hire be held responsible
 
02:12:47.589 --> 02:12:47.599 align:start position:0%
for the passengers behavior they may not
 
02:12:49.910 --> 02:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
even be aware that this person has it
 
02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:51.109 align:start position:0%
even be aware that this person has it
so

02:12:51.109 --> 02:12:51.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:53.589 --> 02:12:53.599 align:start position:0%
we keep talking about people using it
 
02:12:53.599 --> 02:12:54.470 align:start position:0%
we keep talking about people using it
it's

02:12:54.470 --> 02:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:12:55.990 --> 02:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
if you're a therapeutic cannabis patient
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's already illegal to use it it's
 
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
already illegal to share it
 
02:13:02.069 --> 02:13:02.079 align:start position:0%
i do agree that there are difficulties
 
02:13:04.790 --> 02:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
in determining impairment with thc that
 
02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
is a problem but this bill
 
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't really solve that problem it
 
02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
just places an undue burden on
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients holding to
 
02:13:14.390 --> 02:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
a higher standard that we do for
 
02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:15.750 align:start position:0%
a higher standard that we do for
narcotics

02:13:15.750 --> 02:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
narcotics
 
02:13:17.189 --> 02:13:17.199 align:start position:0%
somewhat in reference to what
 
02:13:17.199 --> 02:13:18.310 align:start position:0%
somewhat in reference to what
representative

02:13:18.310 --> 02:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
klein knight just said and it simply is
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
something that should have an exemption
 
02:13:24.470 --> 02:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
for therapeutic cannabis patients
 
02:13:26.470 --> 02:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
caregiver and caregivers both thank you
 
02:13:30.709 --> 02:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
and i'll be glad to take any questions
 
02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:47.109 --> 02:13:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:49.109 --> 02:13:49.119 align:start position:0%
see no hands raised i want to thank the
 
02:13:51.430 --> 02:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
representative for this testimony
 
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
02:13:55.270 --> 02:13:55.280 align:start position:0%
i want to apologize i did not announce
 
02:14:06.770 --> 02:14:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:06.780 --> 02:14:11.750 align:start position:0%

good morning members of the committee
 
02:14:38.790 --> 02:14:38.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing my testimony
 
02:14:41.109 --> 02:14:41.119 align:start position:0%
my name is helena josephson and i live
 
02:14:43.589 --> 02:14:43.599 align:start position:0%
in canaan new hampshire and i'm speaking
 
02:14:47.270 --> 02:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
in opposition to sb60
 
02:14:49.350 --> 02:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
this bill unfairly targets people like
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
me a disabled granite stater who legally
 
02:14:54.709 --> 02:14:54.719 align:start position:0%
uses therapeutic cannabis to treat my
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
medical conditions
 
02:14:58.950 --> 02:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
by treating therapeutic cannabis like
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
alcohol rather than like other
 
02:15:02.790 --> 02:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
prescription medications we're further
 
02:15:04.870 --> 02:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
stigmatizing patients whose medicine
 
02:15:06.950 --> 02:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
happens to be cannabis
 
02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
other prescription medications can be
 
02:15:11.270 --> 02:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
within reach of a driver why single out
 
02:15:13.109 --> 02:15:13.119 align:start position:0%
this one it's a medicine but we aren't
 
02:15:14.870 --> 02:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
doing this for other medicines
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
i'd like to eliminate stigma around
 
02:15:18.229 --> 02:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis and i'm not sure
 
02:15:20.550 --> 02:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
that this does that
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
intoxicated driving is a top health and
 
02:15:24.870 --> 02:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
safety concern and other medications
 
02:15:27.270 --> 02:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
cause impairment dui laws applies to
 
02:15:30.310 --> 02:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
substances beyond alcohol the term open
 
02:15:32.229 --> 02:15:32.239 align:start position:0%
container refers to a substance that
 
02:15:35.189 --> 02:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
might be consumed while driving i heard
 
02:15:37.430 --> 02:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
testimony referring to temptation and
 
02:15:39.350 --> 02:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
frankly i'm appalled how does my
 
02:15:41.510 --> 02:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
medication tempt my driver
 
02:15:43.589 --> 02:15:43.599 align:start position:0%
i keep my medication in my purse which
 
02:15:45.910 --> 02:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
is an extension of my person if a friend
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
or relative is giving me a ride my purse
 
02:15:50.550 --> 02:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
stays on my lap the driver can reach my
 
02:15:52.229 --> 02:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
purse would this law mean that the
 
02:15:54.310 --> 02:15:54.320 align:start position:0%
driver might be liable for what's in my
 
02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:55.430 align:start position:0%
driver might be liable for what's in my
purse

02:15:55.430 --> 02:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
purse
 
02:15:57.589 --> 02:15:57.599 align:start position:0%
i also heard testimony suggesting that
 
02:15:59.990 --> 02:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
the open container helps police know to
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
check a driver for cannabis related
 
02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:02.790 align:start position:0%
check a driver for cannabis related
impairment

02:16:02.790 --> 02:16:02.800 align:start position:0%
impairment
 
02:16:04.550 --> 02:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
i carry my patient card in my purse and
 
02:16:06.229 --> 02:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
i'd happily present it
 
02:16:08.229 --> 02:16:08.239 align:start position:0%
but i would never drive while under the
 
02:16:10.629 --> 02:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
influence of my medication i just that's
 
02:16:12.870 --> 02:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
a choice that i make because
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
i don't need this law to prevent me from
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
driving while impaired
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
i also heard testimony suggesting that a
 
02:16:21.030 --> 02:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
patient quote shouldn't need to carry an
 
02:16:23.350 --> 02:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
open package of gummy medicine
 
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
how is it anyone's business how and when
 
02:16:28.069 --> 02:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
i take my medication as long as i'm not
 
02:16:29.990 --> 02:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
driving while impaired
 
02:16:31.270 --> 02:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like the writers of
 
02:16:32.870 --> 02:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
this bill understand therapeutic
 
02:16:34.950 --> 02:16:34.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis and it also sounds like the
 
02:16:36.629 --> 02:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill
 
02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
is really not about driver safety but
 
02:16:41.589 --> 02:16:41.599 align:start position:0%
really to give police more reason to
 
02:16:43.349 --> 02:16:43.359 align:start position:0%
check drivers
 
02:16:49.509 --> 02:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:54.150 --> 02:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
getting your hands raised
 
02:17:01.669 --> 02:17:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
chair now recognizes jim
 
02:17:06.230 --> 02:17:06.240 align:start position:0%
our wiki
 
02:17:07.990 --> 02:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
just a reminder
 
02:17:14.150 --> 02:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:15.830 --> 02:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for hearing me today can you
 
02:17:18.870 --> 02:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
my name is jim kawaki i reside in san
 
02:17:23.669 --> 02:17:23.679 align:start position:0%
bernardin new hampshire
 
02:17:27.030 --> 02:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
i actually hold the first federal hemp
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
license since hemp was legal through the
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
farm bill in 2018
 
02:17:35.669 --> 02:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
now that license i hold also means
 
02:17:37.509 --> 02:17:37.519 align:start position:0%
something to new hampshire
 
02:17:39.990 --> 02:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
it means new hampshire has the first
 
02:17:43.349 --> 02:17:43.359 align:start position:0%
federal license for hemp legalization
 
02:17:45.830 --> 02:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire
 
02:17:49.910 --> 02:17:49.920 align:start position:0%
we have up to 10 farms now
 
02:17:51.669 --> 02:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
that is it
 
02:17:55.509 --> 02:17:55.519 align:start position:0%
so we have a history here for a plant
 
02:17:57.669 --> 02:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
that has been
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
prohibited for so many years
 
02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
and we have finally legalized it i
 
02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
worked with the house and the body
 
02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
on the legalization
 
02:18:09.270 --> 02:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
the implementation
 
02:18:13.270 --> 02:18:13.280 align:start position:0%
um we are allowed to sell products
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
that look like marijuana but they are
 
02:18:15.840 --> 02:18:17.110 align:start position:0%
that look like marijuana but they are
not

02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
so this bill has serious implications
 
02:18:21.990 --> 02:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
for people who purchase
 
02:18:24.709 --> 02:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
hemp and cbd products
 
02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
because now it leaves a whole another
 
02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:28.309 align:start position:0%
because now it leaves a whole another
area

02:18:28.309 --> 02:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
area
 
02:18:30.070 --> 02:18:30.080 align:start position:0%
for law enforcement
 
02:18:33.750 --> 02:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
to look into and if someone is
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
walking up a hiking trail
 
02:18:39.110 --> 02:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
pulled over on their bicycle a nice pawn
 
02:18:41.270 --> 02:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
having a break smoking
 
02:18:42.709 --> 02:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
some hemp
 
02:18:44.709 --> 02:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
and they're harassed for that and we
 
02:18:47.349 --> 02:18:47.359 align:start position:0%
have legalized that in this state
 
02:18:48.709 --> 02:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
uh we're going to follow that same
 
02:18:50.469 --> 02:18:50.479 align:start position:0%
category with the marijuana that they're
 
02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
trying to do now
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
honestly i have hemp accessible in my
 
02:18:57.270 --> 02:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle all the time
 
02:18:59.669 --> 02:18:59.679 align:start position:0%
it helps me a lot with my inflammation
 
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
and if i have a flare-up and i'm driving
 
02:19:04.629 --> 02:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
for a long distance i can use my hemp
 
02:19:07.349 --> 02:19:07.359 align:start position:0%
smoke it it's gonna smell like marijuana
 
02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
but it is federally legal and it helps
 
02:19:13.110 --> 02:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
my inflammation and more likely than not
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
if a cop law enforcement officer smells
 
02:19:15.679 --> 02:19:16.709 align:start position:0%
if a cop law enforcement officer smells
that

02:19:16.709 --> 02:19:16.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna have a conversation and
 
02:19:23.589 --> 02:19:23.599 align:start position:0%
and once again it's the stigma again and
 
02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
i just see this as a very bad bill
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
and from a farmer's standpoint um with
 
02:19:30.870 --> 02:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
the history new hampshire has it would
 
02:19:33.190 --> 02:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
be a shame to say that we were the first
 
02:19:36.150 --> 02:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
federally licensed state
 
02:19:38.709 --> 02:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
and all of our farmers are closing down
 
02:19:41.190 --> 02:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
because law enforcement is
 
02:19:42.150 --> 02:19:42.160 align:start position:0%
going to
 
02:19:45.750 --> 02:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
put such stringent policies against the
 
02:19:48.549 --> 02:19:48.559 align:start position:0%
plant cannabis which is an herb not
 
02:19:51.910 --> 02:19:51.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily a drug so fire
 
02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:02.150 --> 02:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh so you mentioned
 
02:20:08.150 --> 02:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
hemp and you mentioned c
 
02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:09.510 align:start position:0%
hemp and you mentioned c
cpd

02:20:09.510 --> 02:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
cpd
 
02:20:11.750 --> 02:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
and my understanding is the cpd does not
 
02:20:14.870 --> 02:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
have the chemical necessary to
 
02:20:16.630 --> 02:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
impair a person
 
02:20:18.950 --> 02:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
um is it the same thing for hemp does it
 
02:20:21.349 --> 02:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
not have tcp in it
 
02:20:24.630 --> 02:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
that is correct um our hemp is grown we
 
02:20:26.389 --> 02:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
have a
 
02:20:29.190 --> 02:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
person who comes from a dea lab to our
 
02:20:31.910 --> 02:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
farm actually pulls a sample brings it
 
02:20:35.110 --> 02:20:35.120 align:start position:0%
back to their lab and tests it and sends
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
us as well as the fbi in the usda a
 
02:20:40.710 --> 02:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
certificate of analysis of the hemp we
 
02:20:41.750 --> 02:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
have grown
 
02:20:44.870 --> 02:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
to prove that it is legal to have in new
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire and sell and i personally hand
 
02:20:49.510 --> 02:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
delivered a copy of my certificate
 
02:20:52.070 --> 02:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
analysis to our police chief because we
 
02:20:54.070 --> 02:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
have a very good
 
02:20:59.270 --> 02:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:00.790 --> 02:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:21:03.670 --> 02:21:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:05.590 --> 02:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands raised the
 
02:21:07.110 --> 02:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
witnesses excuse i want to thank you for
 
02:21:08.309 --> 02:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:21:18.150 --> 02:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:19.990 --> 02:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
just a reminder of your testimonies in
 
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much my name is michael
 
02:21:29.030 --> 02:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
holt i'm the administrator of the
 
02:21:31.270 --> 02:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
state's therapeutic cannabis program the
 
02:21:32.630 --> 02:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
department doesn't take a position on
 
02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
this bill my testimony is informational
 
02:21:37.270 --> 02:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
including a request for an amendment
 
02:21:39.429 --> 02:21:39.439 align:start position:0%
as we know senate bill 60 would create
 
02:21:40.870 --> 02:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire an open container law
 
02:21:42.309 --> 02:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
for cannabis
 
02:21:43.910 --> 02:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
first i want to thank senator gannon for
 
02:21:45.190 --> 02:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
working with the department on an
 
02:21:46.950 --> 02:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill in the senate
 
02:21:48.950 --> 02:21:48.960 align:start position:0%
that clarified that this legislation was
 
02:21:51.750 --> 02:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
not intended to specifically target
 
02:21:53.670 --> 02:21:53.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients that
 
02:21:55.429 --> 02:21:55.439 align:start position:0%
amendment fixed the statutory reference
 
02:21:57.270 --> 02:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
to the definition of cannabis from a
 
02:21:59.429 --> 02:21:59.439 align:start position:0%
citation in the therapeutic cannabis law
 
02:22:01.510 --> 02:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
to the citation and the controlled drug
 
02:22:03.830 --> 02:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
act so thank you senator gannon
 
02:22:05.030 --> 02:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
the department requests your
 
02:22:06.870 --> 02:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
consideration of an additional amendment
 
02:22:08.710 --> 02:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
to this bill that affords further
 
02:22:10.469 --> 02:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
protection to therapeutic cannabis
 
02:22:10.479 --> 02:22:11.510 align:start position:0%
protection to therapeutic cannabis
patients

02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
patients
 
02:22:13.030 --> 02:22:13.040 align:start position:0%
as written this bill would apply the
 
02:22:15.030 --> 02:22:15.040 align:start position:0%
proposed open container prohibitions and
 
02:22:17.190 --> 02:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
penalties to every person including
 
02:22:19.349 --> 02:22:19.359 align:start position:0%
those qualifying patients and designated
 
02:22:21.270 --> 02:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
caregivers who are registered with the
 
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
state's therapeutic cannabis program and
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
who can legally possess therapeutic
 
02:22:26.710 --> 02:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis as though it were any other
 
02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
regular medication
 
02:22:30.870 --> 02:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
there is no open container law for
 
02:22:32.230 --> 02:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
prescription medications in new
 
02:22:34.230 --> 02:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire the public is permitted to
 
02:22:37.030 --> 02:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
possess in their vehicle or anywhere
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
their unsealed prescription containers
 
02:22:43.270 --> 02:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
without penalty in fact in 2010 the new
 
02:22:45.750 --> 02:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire legislature via this committee
 
02:22:47.429 --> 02:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
repealed the law that required
 
02:22:49.429 --> 02:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
prescribed controlled medication to be
 
02:22:51.910 --> 02:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
maintained in its original container
 
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
that bill was house bill 1667
 
02:22:57.590 --> 02:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire therapeutic cannabis
 
02:22:59.349 --> 02:22:59.359 align:start position:0%
for registered patients is the effective
 
02:23:01.429 --> 02:23:01.439 align:start position:0%
equivalent of prescribed medication
 
02:23:02.950 --> 02:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
should not be considered the equivalent
 
02:23:05.110 --> 02:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
of an open can of beer or bottle of
 
02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:06.870 align:start position:0%
of an open can of beer or bottle of
liquor

02:23:06.870 --> 02:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
02:23:08.710 --> 02:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
this requested amendment would protect
 
02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
the more than 11 000 qualifying patients
 
02:23:13.510 --> 02:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
registered with the therapeutic cannabis
 
02:23:16.630 --> 02:23:16.640 align:start position:0%
program from a violation a fine and a
 
02:23:19.910 --> 02:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
60-day or one-year licensed suspension
 
02:23:21.510 --> 02:23:21.520 align:start position:0%
for possessing their therapeutic
 
02:23:23.750 --> 02:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis the same way as they are
 
02:23:26.150 --> 02:23:26.160 align:start position:0%
allowed by state law to handle any of
 
02:23:28.309 --> 02:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
their other medications
 
02:23:29.510 --> 02:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
the department asks for your
 
02:23:31.710 --> 02:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
consideration of amendment number
 
02:23:35.270 --> 02:23:35.280 align:start position:0%
1161 which would exempt tcp patients and
 
02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
caregivers from this proposed open
 
02:23:39.270 --> 02:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
container law for cannabis
 
02:23:41.510 --> 02:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
i want to thank representative welch for
 
02:23:43.270 --> 02:23:43.280 align:start position:0%
agreeing to present that amendment to
 
02:23:45.510 --> 02:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
if i may i'd like to provide one more
 
02:23:48.950 --> 02:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
piece of information about current and
 
02:23:51.349 --> 02:23:51.359 align:start position:0%
long-standing department practice
 
02:23:52.790 --> 02:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
every patient
 
02:23:56.230 --> 02:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
the whole your time is expired
 
02:23:56.240 --> 02:24:07.190 align:start position:0%
the whole your time is expired
strength

02:24:07.190 --> 02:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:11.190 --> 02:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:12.710 --> 02:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
aaron thanks for the witness to taking
 
02:24:20.790 --> 02:24:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:24.309 align:start position:0%
 
muted

02:24:24.309 --> 02:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:26.150 --> 02:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and the witness
 
02:24:28.309 --> 02:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
witness for taking the question should
 
02:24:30.710 --> 02:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
cbd also be included in that type of
 
02:24:32.870 --> 02:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
amendment or do you think that
 
02:24:35.429 --> 02:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
that the law um
 
02:24:38.070 --> 02:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
as written covers that that you wouldn't
 
02:24:42.070 --> 02:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:43.110 --> 02:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
02:24:44.389 --> 02:24:44.399 align:start position:0%
question you're going in and out in
 
02:24:46.309 --> 02:24:46.319 align:start position:0%
terms of muting um
 
02:24:48.630 --> 02:24:48.640 align:start position:0%
my uh the statutory change the
 
02:24:50.790 --> 02:24:50.800 align:start position:0%
definition of cannabis that happened in
 
02:24:54.070 --> 02:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
the senate um now sites to the
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
definition of cannabis in the controlled
 
02:24:59.670 --> 02:24:59.680 align:start position:0%
drug act that definition does not
 
02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:00.950 align:start position:0%
drug act that definition does not
exclude

02:25:00.950 --> 02:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
exclude
 
02:25:03.670 --> 02:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
industrial hemp
 
02:25:05.990 --> 02:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
like other definitions of cannabis
 
02:25:07.830 --> 02:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
throughout state law
 
02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:09.110 align:start position:0%
throughout state law
so

02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:25:12.309 --> 02:25:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh thinking on the fly here um
 
02:25:14.710 --> 02:25:14.720 align:start position:0%
this uh based on the testimony we heard
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
from um mr kawaki um then a further
 
02:25:21.910 --> 02:25:21.920 align:start position:0%
amendment may be justified to exclude
 
02:25:24.230 --> 02:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
hemp products from this but again that's
 
02:25:26.630 --> 02:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
this is an answer on the fly and uh and
 
02:25:27.910 --> 02:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
the department doesn't have a position
 
02:25:31.670 --> 02:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
particularly on the treatment of hemp um
 
02:25:33.670 --> 02:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
separate from that
 
02:25:38.630 --> 02:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:40.230 --> 02:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
representative newman you recognize for
 
02:25:42.070 --> 02:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
a follow-up
 
02:25:44.070 --> 02:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and and just for further
 
02:25:46.550 --> 02:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
clarification cbd the medication that
 
02:25:48.630 --> 02:25:48.640 align:start position:0%
people take that does not make them
 
02:25:48.640 --> 02:25:50.870 align:start position:0%
people take that does not make them
impaired

02:25:50.870 --> 02:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
impaired
 
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
is that affected by this law if you had
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
an open container of that type of
 
02:25:54.960 --> 02:25:56.630 align:start position:0%
an open container of that type of
medication

02:25:56.630 --> 02:25:56.640 align:start position:0%
medication
 
02:25:58.469 --> 02:25:58.479 align:start position:0%
would you be subject to this open
 
02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.200 align:start position:0%
container law
 
02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:03.110 align:start position:0%
container law
cbd

02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
cbd
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
that's a that is that is a good question
 
02:26:07.750 --> 02:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patients have
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
access through the licensed alternative
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
treatment centers in the state to a
 
02:26:14.710 --> 02:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
variety of cannabis products some of
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
them are thc rich and some of them are
 
02:26:19.429 --> 02:26:19.439 align:start position:0%
cbd rich
 
02:26:21.429 --> 02:26:21.439 align:start position:0%
the point of this requested amendment
 
02:26:24.550 --> 02:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
would would be to exempt the population
 
02:26:26.550 --> 02:26:26.560 align:start position:0%
of therapeutic cannabis patients and
 
02:26:28.309 --> 02:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
their caregivers from this open
 
02:26:30.070 --> 02:26:30.080 align:start position:0%
container provision
 
02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:31.110 align:start position:0%
container provision
that

02:26:31.110 --> 02:26:31.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:33.510 --> 02:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
the complicating factor that you raise
 
02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
representative newman is that cbd
 
02:26:38.309 --> 02:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
is available
 
02:26:38.319 --> 02:26:39.429 align:start position:0%
is available
retail

02:26:39.429 --> 02:26:39.439 align:start position:0%
retail
 
02:26:42.070 --> 02:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
to anyone in the public it is available
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
anywhere gas stations
 
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
health food stores etc etc cbd is
 
02:26:51.830 --> 02:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
cannabis under the uh controlled drug um
 
02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
act in new hampshire um and so what this
 
02:26:58.230 --> 02:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
sugg that suggests that somebody who is
 
02:27:00.349 --> 02:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
possessing an open container of a
 
02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
non-intoxicating substance like cbd
 
02:27:06.630 --> 02:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
would be impacted negatively by this
 
02:27:08.870 --> 02:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
this bill as well
 
02:27:11.590 --> 02:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
again my testimony is in
 
02:27:13.030 --> 02:27:13.040 align:start position:0%
is requesting an amendment for the
 
02:27:15.670 --> 02:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis population and not
 
02:27:15.680 --> 02:27:16.469 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis population and not
the

02:27:16.469 --> 02:27:16.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:27:20.230 --> 02:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
new hampshire citizenry at large
 
02:27:22.790 --> 02:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:27:27.750 --> 02:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:29.349 --> 02:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question my
 
02:27:31.349 --> 02:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
question is about the amendment itself
 
02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
well it sounds like you and
 
02:27:34.469 --> 02:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
representative welch had actually
 
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
drafted an amendment um which which i do
 
02:27:40.550 --> 02:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
not have uh is that amendment uh in the
 
02:27:43.510 --> 02:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
works uh in terms of sending it to
 
02:27:44.870 --> 02:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
members of the committee so we can take
 
02:27:46.150 --> 02:27:46.160 align:start position:0%
a look at it
 
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:51.190 --> 02:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
that's a question for whoever wants to
 
02:27:53.750 --> 02:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:56.070 --> 02:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
i haven't i have not seen any
 
02:28:00.309 --> 02:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:02.389 --> 02:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
it's been asked to be sent out it will
 
02:28:03.990 --> 02:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
be resent
 
02:28:20.309 --> 02:28:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:24.309 --> 02:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh i um as always uh
 
02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
my opinions are my own not those
 
02:28:31.349 --> 02:28:31.359 align:start position:0%
supernh law or uh unh itself um i'll be
 
02:28:33.550 --> 02:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
uh as brief as i can again
 
02:28:36.630 --> 02:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
uncharacteristically but i think this uh
 
02:28:39.429 --> 02:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
this statute uh this proposal needs a
 
02:28:41.910 --> 02:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
good bit of drafting work uh partly
 
02:28:43.510 --> 02:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
because of the therapeutic cannabis
 
02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
issues partly because what it partly
 
02:28:48.790 --> 02:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
because of the 60-day license loss which
 
02:28:51.910 --> 02:28:51.920 align:start position:0%
will cause people to lose their job
 
02:28:54.870 --> 02:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh even though there's only 150 fine
 
02:28:58.070 --> 02:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
60-day license loss has a heavy impact
 
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
on people who depend uh particularly in
 
02:29:02.389 --> 02:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
the north country on their car to get to
 
02:29:03.670 --> 02:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
places so
 
02:29:06.389 --> 02:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
i have problems with that uh one of my
 
02:29:08.550 --> 02:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
biggest drafting problems is the
 
02:29:08.560 --> 02:29:09.830 align:start position:0%
biggest drafting problems is the
language

02:29:09.830 --> 02:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
language
 
02:29:12.790 --> 02:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
least accessible to the driver
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
you know it doesn't say inaccessible to
 
02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
the driver least accessible means you
 
02:29:20.710 --> 02:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
got to find the place in your car where
 
02:29:22.790 --> 02:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
it's least accessible
 
02:29:25.270 --> 02:29:25.280 align:start position:0%
um does that mean somebody who's got a
 
02:29:28.230 --> 02:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
pickup the least accessible place in a
 
02:29:29.830 --> 02:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
pickup that
 
02:29:32.150 --> 02:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a trunk is in the bed of
 
02:29:33.910 --> 02:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
the pickup
 
02:29:35.510 --> 02:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think that's what this is
 
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
intended but it's a very broad
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
language uh least accessible as opposed
 
02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:42.469 align:start position:0%
language uh least accessible as opposed
to

02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:29:44.469 --> 02:29:44.479 align:start position:0%
inaccessible and i i think that needs
 
02:29:46.950 --> 02:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
work i think the definition of sealed
 
02:29:48.230 --> 02:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
needs work
 
02:29:51.510 --> 02:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
um you know i think sealed suggests this
 
02:29:54.389 --> 02:29:54.399 align:start position:0%
is really targeted at therapeutic
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
marijuana people
 
02:29:58.630 --> 02:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh those who have marijuana in the car
 
02:30:01.270 --> 02:30:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh that they've acquired at a dispensary
 
02:30:02.550 --> 02:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
of some sort
 
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
um what about uh people who are
 
02:30:07.030 --> 02:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
possessing what
 
02:30:09.030 --> 02:30:09.040 align:start position:0%
more formally is known as marijuana
 
02:30:10.630 --> 02:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
cigarettes cigarettes what is fondly
 
02:30:12.630 --> 02:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
known as joints
 
02:30:13.510 --> 02:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:30:15.429 --> 02:30:15.439 align:start position:0%
they never were sealed
 
02:30:18.790 --> 02:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
um you know it's uh
 
02:30:22.230 --> 02:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
i think while in theory well-intentioned
 
02:30:24.469 --> 02:30:24.479 align:start position:0%
the the real problem here is that the
 
02:30:24.479 --> 02:30:26.070 align:start position:0%
the the real problem here is that the
proposal

02:30:26.070 --> 02:30:26.080 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
seeks to do indirectly
 
02:30:31.270 --> 02:30:31.280 align:start position:0%
what needs to what is you know directly
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
already prohibited that is you can't
 
02:30:36.070 --> 02:30:36.080 align:start position:0%
drive while under the influence of
 
02:30:39.349 --> 02:30:39.359 align:start position:0%
marijuana the example chief sugary gave
 
02:30:41.349 --> 02:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
of somebody running a red light pulling
 
02:30:42.870 --> 02:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
into the wrong lane
 
02:30:42.880 --> 02:30:44.070 align:start position:0%
into the wrong lane
they're

02:30:44.070 --> 02:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:30:46.630 --> 02:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
going to be at able to char if they test
 
02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
that person for marijuana and find
 
02:30:51.270 --> 02:30:51.280 align:start position:0%
marijuana in their system
 
02:30:53.030 --> 02:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
they're going to be able to charge that
 
02:30:55.910 --> 02:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
person because there's there's uh bad
 
02:30:58.309 --> 02:30:58.319 align:start position:0%
driving that's the key to that kind of
 
02:31:01.270 --> 02:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
charge so i think this is a over
 
02:31:04.469 --> 02:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
criminalization the statute the proposal
 
02:31:04.479 --> 02:31:06.389 align:start position:0%
criminalization the statute the proposal
needs

02:31:06.389 --> 02:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
needs
 
02:31:09.670 --> 02:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
mr accept my apology your
 
02:31:13.590 --> 02:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
time's expired you go over by 24 seconds
 
02:31:13.600 --> 02:31:14.469 align:start position:0%
time's expired you go over by 24 seconds
uh

02:31:14.469 --> 02:31:14.479 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:31:16.070 --> 02:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
but we do the time constraints we do
 
02:31:17.830 --> 02:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
have to
 
02:31:27.190 --> 02:31:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:29.990 --> 02:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
this time the chair recognizes heather
 
02:31:34.710 --> 02:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:37.429 --> 02:31:37.439 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you so much for sitting
 
02:31:39.270 --> 02:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
here and going through all of this today
 
02:31:41.110 --> 02:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
i truly appreciate it
 
02:31:44.150 --> 02:31:44.160 align:start position:0%
my name is heather marie brown i am a
 
02:31:46.070 --> 02:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patient in the
 
02:31:49.830 --> 02:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire but i am also the
 
02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
co-chair of the new hampshire
 
02:31:55.510 --> 02:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis medical oversight
 
02:31:58.389 --> 02:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
board i hold my seat as the patient
 
02:32:01.750 --> 02:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative and on behalf of the 11
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
000 plus patients in the state of new
 
02:32:07.830 --> 02:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire we are opposed to this bill
 
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
this bill has been
 
02:32:12.630 --> 02:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
developed and created with the intent
 
02:32:12.640 --> 02:32:13.670 align:start position:0%
developed and created with the intent
of

02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:32:16.150 --> 02:32:16.160 align:start position:0%
going after therapeutic cannabis
 
02:32:19.429 --> 02:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
patients that is all this bill does this
 
02:32:22.710 --> 02:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
is a very poorly written bill and it
 
02:32:24.790 --> 02:32:24.800 align:start position:0%
will cause detrimental harm to the
 
02:32:26.710 --> 02:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
patient community
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
when i go to a dispensary and i pick up
 
02:32:33.190 --> 02:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
my medication i go home
 
02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
and if i have to leave my home i don't
 
02:32:38.870 --> 02:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily take my entire bottle with
 
02:32:41.910 --> 02:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
me i will separate what it is i will
 
02:32:44.230 --> 02:32:44.240 align:start position:0%
need for the time period i am around my
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
house put it in another container and
 
02:32:49.590 --> 02:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
that is what i carry on me
 
02:32:52.469 --> 02:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
now this bill suggests that i would not
 
02:32:55.510 --> 02:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
be able to do that even as a patient
 
02:32:58.790 --> 02:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
even as a passenger in a vehicle
 
02:33:00.870 --> 02:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
so if my mother
 
02:33:03.590 --> 02:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
is driving me someplace and i have
 
02:33:06.389 --> 02:33:06.399 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis in a container that
 
02:33:08.630 --> 02:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
does not have the safety seal on it that
 
02:33:10.309 --> 02:33:10.319 align:start position:0%
has been unbroken
 
02:33:12.790 --> 02:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
then my mother could potentially be
 
02:33:12.800 --> 02:33:14.070 align:start position:0%
then my mother could potentially be
arrested

02:33:14.070 --> 02:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
arrested
 
02:33:15.910 --> 02:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:33:18.389 --> 02:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
i think this bill is developed to create
 
02:33:21.349 --> 02:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
discrimination and division
 
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
and i think that a better way to go
 
02:33:26.710 --> 02:33:26.720 align:start position:0%
about it would have been using it in a
 
02:33:26.720 --> 02:33:28.870 align:start position:0%
about it would have been using it in a
more

02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:33:33.670 --> 02:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
manner towards recreational usage versus
 
02:33:36.550 --> 02:33:36.560 align:start position:0%
the language that's in this bill
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
it's just a direct attack against
 
02:33:41.030 --> 02:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
patients and this bill is going to
 
02:33:43.670 --> 02:33:43.680 align:start position:0%
undermine not only a patient but in some
 
02:33:46.469 --> 02:33:46.479 align:start position:0%
ways that they're
 
02:33:48.230 --> 02:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
ms brown i want to thank you for your
 
02:33:52.070 --> 02:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
testimony the two minutes has expired
 
02:33:55.270 --> 02:33:55.280 align:start position:0%
so i do have to suspend the testimony
 
02:33:56.389 --> 02:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you in advance for
 
02:33:56.399 --> 02:33:58.150 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you in advance for
testifying

02:33:58.150 --> 02:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
02:33:59.590 --> 02:33:59.600 align:start position:0%
we are running a little behind schedule
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
that's no surprise the criminal justice
 
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
public safety let me just let everyone
 
02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
know in the members of the public
 
02:34:07.590 --> 02:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to put the hearing on senate
 
02:34:10.230 --> 02:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
bill 60 in a brief recess
 
02:34:11.910 --> 02:34:11.920 align:start position:0%
so i can open the public hearing on
 
02:34:12.870 --> 02:34:12.880 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
02:34:12.880 --> 02:34:13.910 align:start position:0%
senate bill
92

02:34:13.910 --> 02:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
92
 
02:34:15.670 --> 02:34:15.680 align:start position:0%
i do know the prime sponsor is
 
02:34:17.830 --> 02:34:17.840 align:start position:0%
independence that wishes to
 
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
reduce the bill it does have a limited
 
02:34:22.710 --> 02:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
time schedule so out of respect for uh
 
02:34:23.830 --> 02:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
the senator
 
02:34:26.070 --> 02:34:26.080 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna just open the public hearing
 
02:34:27.349 --> 02:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
on 92
 
02:34:29.270 --> 02:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
simply to allow that bill to be
 
02:34:31.030 --> 02:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
introduced and for the response to
 
02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:32.150 align:start position:0%
introduced and for the response to
testify

02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
testify
 
02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
then we will then
 
02:34:36.309 --> 02:34:36.319 align:start position:0%
go into recess and then open and reopen
 
02:34:37.670 --> 02:34:37.680 align:start position:0%
the public hearing
 
02:34:46.230 --> 02:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:47.670 --> 02:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
this time the
 
02:34:49.590 --> 02:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing on senate bill 60 is in
 
02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:52.309 align:start position:0%
public hearing on senate bill 60 is in
recess

02:34:52.309 --> 02:34:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:54.150 --> 02:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
02:34:57.910 --> 02:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on senate bill 92
 
02:34:59.190 --> 02:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
is open
 
02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:11.670 --> 02:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:13.670 --> 02:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
yes and thank you very much for the
 
02:35:13.680 --> 02:35:15.110 align:start position:0%
yes and thank you very much for the
consideration

02:35:15.110 --> 02:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
02:35:18.230 --> 02:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
of being able to uh testify before your
 
02:35:20.469 --> 02:35:20.479 align:start position:0%
other hearing is concluded
 
02:35:22.950 --> 02:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
um i'm pleased to be here
 
02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
supporting um senate bill 92 which
 
02:35:28.150 --> 02:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
passed the senate
 
02:35:30.630 --> 02:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
um on a bipartisan vote i believe of
 
02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:33.030 align:start position:0%
um on a bipartisan vote i believe of
1727.

02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
1727.
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
there will be a lot of um
 
02:35:37.510 --> 02:35:37.520 align:start position:0%
you know folks that want to test
 
02:35:39.910 --> 02:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
for supporting this bill
 
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
so let me just say what the bill
 
02:35:46.950 --> 02:35:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:48.070 --> 02:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
it makes
 
02:35:50.070 --> 02:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
surgical changes
 
02:35:52.870 --> 02:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
to the bail reform statute that was
 
02:35:55.830 --> 02:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
passed several years ago it does not
 
02:35:58.870 --> 02:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
undermine the bail reform statute it
 
02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
does not
 
02:36:00.160 --> 02:36:01.110 align:start position:0%
does not
um

02:36:01.110 --> 02:36:01.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:36:04.389 --> 02:36:04.399 align:start position:0%
make it more difficult for people of
 
02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
modest means to be able to
 
02:36:09.830 --> 02:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
obtain bail which was the
 
02:36:12.469 --> 02:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
premise for efforts a couple of years
 
02:36:15.910 --> 02:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
ago what it does do on the other hand
 
02:36:19.429 --> 02:36:19.439 align:start position:0%
is protect victims and protect future
 
02:36:22.790 --> 02:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
victims from violent behavior
 
02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:24.070 align:start position:0%
victims from violent behavior
so

02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:36:26.790 --> 02:36:26.800 align:start position:0%
let me just go through the four sections
 
02:36:28.309 --> 02:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
02:36:30.870 --> 02:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
the first section dealing with criminal
 
02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:32.630 align:start position:0%
the first section dealing with criminal
mischief

02:36:32.630 --> 02:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
mischief
 
02:36:32.640 --> 02:36:33.429 align:start position:0%
mischief
we

02:36:33.429 --> 02:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:36:35.190 --> 02:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
in the legislature
 
02:36:37.750 --> 02:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
had dropped the penalty
 
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
of um to a violation for any defacing of
 
02:36:43.110 --> 02:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
public property
 
02:36:46.309 --> 02:36:46.319 align:start position:0%
the compromise that the senate reached
 
02:36:50.070 --> 02:36:50.080 align:start position:0%
in going to a class a misdemeanor is if
 
02:36:52.309 --> 02:36:52.319 align:start position:0%
damage exceeds a thousand dollars or
 
02:36:55.910 --> 02:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
more that seems to make sense um to try

02:37:04.550 --> 02:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
starts on line seven
 
02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
is one of the changes to bail reform
 
02:37:10.550 --> 02:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
and what the the nuts and bolts of it
 
02:37:13.349 --> 02:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
really is on the second page of the bill
 
02:37:16.309 --> 02:37:16.319 align:start position:0%
where it lists a number of crimes that
 
02:37:19.110 --> 02:37:19.120 align:start position:0%
are violent in nature homicide first

been charged with
 
02:37:50.309 --> 02:37:50.319 align:start position:0%
as requiring that person seeking bail
 
02:37:50.319 --> 02:37:51.349 align:start position:0%
as requiring that person seeking bail
to

02:37:51.349 --> 02:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:37:53.429 --> 02:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
go before a judge
 
02:37:57.429 --> 02:37:57.439 align:start position:0%
in order to obtain bail within 72 hours
 
02:38:00.070 --> 02:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
of the time of that person's arrest it
 
02:38:03.270 --> 02:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
doesn't end the opportunity for bail it
 
02:38:05.030 --> 02:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
just makes certain
 
02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
that people who have
 
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
allegedly committed violent crimes are
 
02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
not released into the public without
 
02:38:16.230 --> 02:38:16.240 align:start position:0%
having gone before a judge
 
02:38:19.030 --> 02:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
and so in my view and in the view of the
 
02:38:22.070 --> 02:38:22.080 align:start position:0%
senate it does not undermine
 
02:38:24.710 --> 02:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
the bail reform effort that we undertook
 
02:38:27.670 --> 02:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
a few years ago but it again as i said
 
02:38:29.429 --> 02:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
before protects
 
02:38:32.550 --> 02:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
victims in particular of those i think
 
02:38:35.429 --> 02:38:35.439 align:start position:0%
it's nine or ten different crimes that i
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
have cited
 
02:38:40.230 --> 02:38:40.240 align:start position:0%
that is at the top of page two of the
 
02:38:40.240 --> 02:38:41.349 align:start position:0%
that is at the top of page two of the
bill

02:38:41.349 --> 02:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:38:42.469 --> 02:38:42.479 align:start position:0%
the third
 
02:38:45.670 --> 02:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
provision of the bill is to change
 
02:38:47.590 --> 02:38:47.600 align:start position:0%
um from
 
02:38:50.150 --> 02:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
five years to three years
 
02:38:53.429 --> 02:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
the number of times that you could have
 
02:38:54.950 --> 02:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
three or more
 
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
um failures to appear
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
and then if that were to happen a person
 
02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
could be held in pre-trial detention and
 
02:39:04.950 --> 02:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
02:39:07.750 --> 02:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh page two and page three
 
02:39:11.270 --> 02:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the bill and i given the testimony i
 
02:39:13.030 --> 02:39:13.040 align:start position:0%
think you will hear
 
02:39:13.040 --> 02:39:14.150 align:start position:0%
think you will hear
from

02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:39:16.309 --> 02:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
various law enforcement personnel who
 
02:39:18.870 --> 02:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
are going to testify today
 
02:39:22.309 --> 02:39:22.319 align:start position:0%
there as a result of the bail reform
 
02:39:24.550 --> 02:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
efforts have been numerous
 
02:39:27.670 --> 02:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
failures to appear this puts some
 
02:39:31.910 --> 02:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
guard rails um back in place if people
 
02:39:31.920 --> 02:39:33.190 align:start position:0%
guard rails um back in place if people
are

02:39:33.190 --> 02:39:33.200 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:39:35.990 --> 02:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
failing to appear
 
02:39:39.110 --> 02:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
on the charges that they have to face
 
02:39:41.510 --> 02:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
and then the last section which is
 
02:39:43.910 --> 02:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
starts on the bottom of page four which
 
02:39:46.389 --> 02:39:46.399 align:start position:0%
my good friend chief shigori will uh
 
02:39:47.990 --> 02:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
testify to
 
02:39:51.590 --> 02:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
allows for background checks for
 
02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:52.469 align:start position:0%
allows for background checks for
um

02:39:52.469 --> 02:39:52.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:55.030 --> 02:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
that are going to be employed as peace
 
02:39:56.870 --> 02:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
officers and i think that
 
02:39:59.990 --> 02:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
um giving the emphasis on training and
 
02:40:02.150 --> 02:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that
 
02:40:03.670 --> 02:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
02:40:09.110 --> 02:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:11.349 --> 02:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
really conducting things in a in an
 
02:40:13.590 --> 02:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
aboveboard manner there should be an
 
02:40:17.030 --> 02:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get that kind of um
 
02:40:20.469 --> 02:40:20.479 align:start position:0%
employment data from a past employer so
 
02:40:20.479 --> 02:40:21.910 align:start position:0%
employment data from a past employer so
um

02:40:21.910 --> 02:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:24.550 --> 02:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
let me just stress that some of the
 
02:40:28.309 --> 02:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
um testimony i think you'll hear
 
02:40:28.319 --> 02:40:29.349 align:start position:0%
um testimony i think you'll hear
and

02:40:29.349 --> 02:40:29.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:40:32.070 --> 02:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
what you know my sense of why this bill
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
is so important in particular
 
02:40:37.190 --> 02:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
the provision that people
 
02:40:39.429 --> 02:40:39.439 align:start position:0%
who are charged with those 10 violent
 
02:40:42.950 --> 02:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
crimes or pornography which let's face
 
02:40:45.190 --> 02:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
it that's a violent crime against
 
02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:46.389 align:start position:0%
it that's a violent crime against
children

02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:40:48.950 --> 02:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
should see a judge because of what's
 
02:40:52.070 --> 02:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
happened if we hadn't had incidences
 
02:40:52.080 --> 02:40:52.950 align:start position:0%
happened if we hadn't had incidences
of

02:40:52.950 --> 02:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:40:55.990 --> 02:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
violent behavior and then reoffending
 
02:40:58.469 --> 02:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
after people getting bail
 
02:41:00.790 --> 02:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
this bill would not be necessary but
 
02:41:03.190 --> 02:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
it's been necessary by real world
 
02:41:06.150 --> 02:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
examples of what's happened when people
 
02:41:08.550 --> 02:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
have not seen a judge and have been
 
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
accused of a violent crime and then have
 
02:41:14.630 --> 02:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
reoffended so let me just cite a few of
 
02:41:16.870 --> 02:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
them and they'll probably be somewhat
 
02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
more testimony on more examples
 
02:41:21.429 --> 02:41:21.439 align:start position:0%
in nashua
 
02:41:23.190 --> 02:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
02:41:25.670 --> 02:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
unbelievable case a subject was charged
 
02:41:28.870 --> 02:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
with domestic violence was released
 
02:41:30.950 --> 02:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
and then return to
 
02:41:34.550 --> 02:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
the home to brutalize and rape the same
 
02:41:37.990 --> 02:41:38.000 align:start position:0%
victim after being released on bail
 
02:41:39.510 --> 02:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
in portsmouth
 
02:41:41.910 --> 02:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
a subject was involved in a vandalism
 
02:41:41.920 --> 02:41:43.030 align:start position:0%
a subject was involved in a vandalism
case

02:41:43.030 --> 02:41:43.040 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:41:45.910 --> 02:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
led police on a chase
 
02:41:48.469 --> 02:41:48.479 align:start position:0%
intentionally rammed the vehicle
 
02:41:51.830 --> 02:41:51.840 align:start position:0%
was arrested and released the next day
 
02:41:54.070 --> 02:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
the same subject tried to set a school
 
02:41:58.710 --> 02:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
on fire and was charged with arson
 
02:42:01.510 --> 02:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
another example the subject was arrested
 
02:42:04.389 --> 02:42:04.399 align:start position:0%
and charged with arson and stalking
 
02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:07.680 align:start position:0%
released on bail and the next day the
 
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
subject stabbed a massachusetts state
 
02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:11.190 align:start position:0%
subject stabbed a massachusetts state
trooper

02:42:11.190 --> 02:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
trooper
 
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
the last example i would cite
 
02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
is the subject was involved in a pursuit
 
02:42:19.030 --> 02:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
and an assault on a police officer in
 
02:42:22.150 --> 02:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
manchester he was released on bail and
 
02:42:24.790 --> 02:42:24.800 align:start position:0%
thereafter was arrested in bedford for
 
02:42:27.110 --> 02:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
an assault at a hotel
 
02:42:30.389 --> 02:42:30.399 align:start position:0%
these are but a few of the examples
 
02:42:32.309 --> 02:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
of violent
 
02:42:32.319 --> 02:42:33.510 align:start position:0%
of violent
behavior

02:42:33.510 --> 02:42:33.520 align:start position:0%
behavior
 
02:42:35.110 --> 02:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
that people have
 
02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:36.230 align:start position:0%
that people have
committed

02:42:36.230 --> 02:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
committed
 
02:42:39.750 --> 02:42:39.760 align:start position:0%
alleged crimes been released and then
 
02:42:42.070 --> 02:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
recommitted and that's why
 
02:42:44.630 --> 02:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
i think it's so important that
 
02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:46.469 align:start position:0%
i think it's so important that
um

02:42:46.469 --> 02:42:46.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:49.510 --> 02:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
the provision on page two of the bill
 
02:42:51.990 --> 02:42:52.000 align:start position:0%
goes into effect so that those violent
 
02:42:54.550 --> 02:42:54.560 align:start position:0%
crimes i think we'd all agree that those
 
02:42:56.710 --> 02:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
are violent crimes
 
02:42:59.670 --> 02:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
in order to get bail somebody must see a
 
02:43:02.710 --> 02:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
judge so thank you very much mr chair
 
02:43:04.150 --> 02:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
02:43:18.870 --> 02:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:20.550 --> 02:43:20.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much mr chair thank
 
02:43:22.950 --> 02:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
you senator certainly um
 
02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:23.910 align:start position:0%
you senator certainly um
those

02:43:23.910 --> 02:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
four or five examples you uh cited are
 
02:43:28.309 --> 02:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
horrendous but
 
02:43:28.319 --> 02:43:30.710 align:start position:0%
horrendous but
um

02:43:30.710 --> 02:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:33.110 --> 02:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
is uh what would the uh
 
02:43:35.190 --> 02:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
would the uh would this have a cost for
 
02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:43:37.830 --> 02:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
for the county jails where they have to
 
02:43:40.150 --> 02:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
expand their detention cells especially
 
02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:41.190 align:start position:0%
expand their detention cells especially
um

02:43:41.190 --> 02:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:43.590 --> 02:43:43.600 align:start position:0%
some of these things like uh domestic
 
02:43:45.670 --> 02:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
violence that have taken a wide range of
 
02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:47.269 align:start position:0%
violence that have taken a wide range of
uh

02:43:47.269 --> 02:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:43:49.510 --> 02:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
wide range of offenders some of whom
 
02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:50.469 align:start position:0%
wide range of offenders some of whom
the

02:43:50.469 --> 02:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:43:52.550 --> 02:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
police probably believe rightly or
 
02:43:55.429 --> 02:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
wrongly are not necessarily uh
 
02:43:57.269 --> 02:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
dangerous to anyone else and the person
 
02:43:57.279 --> 02:43:58.070 align:start position:0%
dangerous to anyone else and the person
they

02:43:58.070 --> 02:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
they
 
02:44:00.550 --> 02:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
assaulted so will this uh will this have
 
02:44:03.110 --> 02:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
this will require the counties to spend
 
02:44:04.790 --> 02:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
more money
 
02:44:08.469 --> 02:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
on spend more money under jails
 
02:44:12.150 --> 02:44:12.160 align:start position:0%
i i think uh representative horgan the
 
02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
purpose of detaining somebody who is
 
02:44:17.429 --> 02:44:17.439 align:start position:0%
charged with a violent crime
 
02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
and then the adjudication of that is to
 
02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:21.110 align:start position:0%
and then the adjudication of that is to
prevent

02:44:21.110 --> 02:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
02:44:24.309 --> 02:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
violent crime in the future and minimize
 
02:44:25.670 --> 02:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
the impact
 
02:44:28.550 --> 02:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
on victims and i think the senate
 
02:44:31.190 --> 02:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
position is that victims in new
 
02:44:33.349 --> 02:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
hampshire need to be
 
02:44:36.230 --> 02:44:36.240 align:start position:0%
protected and with the examples and i
 
02:44:37.830 --> 02:44:37.840 align:start position:0%
think you will hear
 
02:44:39.990 --> 02:44:40.000 align:start position:0%
many more examples from people that will
 
02:44:40.000 --> 02:44:41.190 align:start position:0%
many more examples from people that will
testify

02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
testify
 
02:44:45.349 --> 02:44:45.359 align:start position:0%
subsequent to me of some very
 
02:44:48.710 --> 02:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
difficult situations to say the least
 
02:44:48.720 --> 02:44:49.510 align:start position:0%
difficult situations to say the least
of

02:44:49.510 --> 02:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:44:52.389 --> 02:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
people charged with violent crimes then
 
02:44:55.670 --> 02:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
almost automatically getting pr bail and
 
02:44:58.389 --> 02:44:58.399 align:start position:0%
going out and reoffending in a violent
 
02:45:02.630 --> 02:45:02.640 align:start position:0%
nature again means that
 
02:45:05.269 --> 02:45:05.279 align:start position:0%
we should be detaining those individuals
 
02:45:07.190 --> 02:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
until a judge
 
02:45:10.710 --> 02:45:10.720 align:start position:0%
has determined within 72 hours
 
02:45:15.190 --> 02:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
as the statute as the proposed law
 
02:45:17.590 --> 02:45:17.600 align:start position:0%
um requires
 
02:45:19.349 --> 02:45:19.359 align:start position:0%
would have to go in front of a judge for
 
02:45:21.830 --> 02:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
a bail here i don't think
 
02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:22.710 align:start position:0%
a bail here i don't think
given

02:45:22.710 --> 02:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
given
 
02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
the importance of protecting victims
 
02:45:25.920 --> 02:45:26.830 align:start position:0%
the importance of protecting victims
that

02:45:26.830 --> 02:45:26.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:30.389 --> 02:45:30.399 align:start position:0%
that's an awful lot to ask as long as
 
02:45:33.429 --> 02:45:33.439 align:start position:0%
our goal is protecting victims i hope
 
02:45:35.349 --> 02:45:35.359 align:start position:0%
representative you share that goal with
 
02:45:35.359 --> 02:45:36.309 align:start position:0%
representative you share that goal with
me

02:45:36.309 --> 02:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:45:38.710 --> 02:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
of course follow up
 
02:45:41.110 --> 02:45:41.120 align:start position:0%
well of course i i follow it so it's
 
02:45:44.150 --> 02:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
like so i guess as i understand it um
 
02:45:46.790 --> 02:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
you have if the bail hearing can be held
 
02:45:49.990 --> 02:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
before the 72 hours send the uh
 
02:45:52.469 --> 02:45:52.479 align:start position:0%
and the judge the judge rules that the
 
02:45:54.389 --> 02:45:54.399 align:start position:0%
person is not dangerous um then they can
 
02:45:56.790 --> 02:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
be released at that time after the bail
 
02:45:56.800 --> 02:46:02.550 align:start position:0%
be released at that time after the bail
hearing

02:46:02.550 --> 02:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:04.469 --> 02:46:04.479 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the way this would
 
02:46:07.990 --> 02:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
work is that within 72 hours excluding
 
02:46:10.150 --> 02:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
saturdays and sundays and holidays of
 
02:46:10.160 --> 02:46:11.110 align:start position:0%
saturdays and sundays and holidays of
course

02:46:11.110 --> 02:46:11.120 align:start position:0%
course
 
02:46:13.030 --> 02:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
there would have to be a here the judge
 
02:46:13.040 --> 02:46:13.830 align:start position:0%
there would have to be a here the judge
would

02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:46:16.070 --> 02:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
get to make that determination of
 
02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:17.269 align:start position:0%
get to make that determination of
whether

02:46:17.269 --> 02:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
whether
 
02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
the subject who was being detained was a
 
02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:21.670 align:start position:0%
the subject who was being detained was a
danger

02:46:21.670 --> 02:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
danger
 
02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:22.830 align:start position:0%
danger
to

02:46:22.830 --> 02:46:22.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
society and should be
 
02:46:28.790 --> 02:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
continue to be held until trial or could
 
02:46:29.990 --> 02:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
be released
 
02:46:32.230 --> 02:46:32.240 align:start position:0%
that's the way the system had always
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
worked until bail reform subsequent with
 
02:46:39.510 --> 02:46:39.520 align:start position:0%
bail reform we're seeing um
 
02:46:41.990 --> 02:46:42.000 align:start position:0%
you know these violent criminals
 
02:46:43.190 --> 02:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
charged with
 
02:46:45.190 --> 02:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
you know a violent crime let me put it
 
02:46:46.469 --> 02:46:46.479 align:start position:0%
that way
 
02:46:50.150 --> 02:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
that automatically virtually got pr bail
 
02:46:52.870 --> 02:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
were released and committed another
 
02:46:55.349 --> 02:46:55.359 align:start position:0%
violent offense and that's
 
02:46:58.230 --> 02:46:58.240 align:start position:0%
um what i think we're trying to
 
02:46:58.240 --> 02:46:59.510 align:start position:0%
um what i think we're trying to
minimize

02:46:59.510 --> 02:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
minimize
 
02:47:02.389 --> 02:47:02.399 align:start position:0%
obviously no system is perfect but you
 
02:47:05.750 --> 02:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
know we've seen examples of where
 
02:47:07.910 --> 02:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
legislation from several years ago with
 
02:47:09.830 --> 02:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
the best of intentions
 
02:47:12.150 --> 02:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
kind of got off the rails and so this is
 
02:47:14.389 --> 02:47:14.399 align:start position:0%
a surgical fix
 
02:47:16.309 --> 02:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
to protect the public and to protect
 
02:47:16.319 --> 02:47:18.630 align:start position:0%
to protect the public and to protect
victims

02:47:18.630 --> 02:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
victims
 
02:47:22.150 --> 02:47:22.160 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right thank you
 
02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
representative knight you're recognized
 
02:47:28.309 --> 02:47:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:30.389 --> 02:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
question um i
 
02:47:33.269 --> 02:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
really love the fact that we're so
 
02:47:35.670 --> 02:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
focused on victims we do really care
 
02:47:38.150 --> 02:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
about victims this in this committee
 
02:47:41.990 --> 02:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
my concern is that this uh creates
 
02:47:44.389 --> 02:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
victims in the system
 
02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
because we
 
02:47:45.600 --> 02:47:46.710 align:start position:0%
because we
aren't

02:47:46.710 --> 02:47:46.720 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
02:47:49.750 --> 02:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
we're not fixing the bail reform process
 
02:47:50.870 --> 02:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
we're just
 
02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:52.150 align:start position:0%
we're just
blaming

02:47:52.150 --> 02:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
blaming
 
02:47:54.309 --> 02:47:54.319 align:start position:0%
the few people that
 
02:47:56.550 --> 02:47:56.560 align:start position:0%
that get through that make it
 
02:47:58.790 --> 02:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
make things very bad for our community
 
02:48:02.710 --> 02:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
yes so my my question is don't you think
 
02:48:04.630 --> 02:48:04.640 align:start position:0%
that there is a potential for this
 
02:48:08.230 --> 02:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
72-hour hold to create more victims than
 
02:48:11.590 --> 02:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
the ones we're actually saving and open
 
02:48:14.230 --> 02:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
further litigation to the state to being
 
02:48:15.429 --> 02:48:15.439 align:start position:0%
sued for
 
02:48:18.790 --> 02:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:23.190 --> 02:48:23.200 align:start position:0%
i do not um share that concern based on
 
02:48:25.590 --> 02:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
um the numbers and i think you will hear
 
02:48:29.110 --> 02:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
testimony um and and i've got a long
 
02:48:30.469 --> 02:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
list of
 
02:48:30.479 --> 02:48:31.830 align:start position:0%
list of
um

02:48:31.830 --> 02:48:31.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:34.309 --> 02:48:34.319 align:start position:0%
you know people that were released on pr
 
02:48:35.990 --> 02:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
bail that went out and committed violent
 
02:48:38.469 --> 02:48:38.479 align:start position:0%
crimes afterwards i don't think
 
02:48:40.550 --> 02:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
for purposes of this hearing i need to
 
02:48:43.190 --> 02:48:43.200 align:start position:0%
go through it that will be submitted i
 
02:48:44.950 --> 02:48:44.960 align:start position:0%
believe by the
 
02:48:47.030 --> 02:48:47.040 align:start position:0%
police chief from bedford as part of the
 
02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:49.760 align:start position:0%
record but i think the case some of the
 
02:48:52.070 --> 02:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
cases that i raised
 
02:48:55.110 --> 02:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
show that we need to fix a real problem
 
02:48:58.389 --> 02:48:58.399 align:start position:0%
because real people have had their lives
 
02:49:00.550 --> 02:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
devastated i mean the situation in
 
02:49:03.110 --> 02:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
nashua where the subject was charged
 
02:49:06.070 --> 02:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
with domestic violence was released and
 
02:49:06.080 --> 02:49:07.269 align:start position:0%
with domestic violence was released and
returned

02:49:07.269 --> 02:49:07.279 align:start position:0%
returned
 
02:49:11.590 --> 02:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
to brutalize and rape the same victim
 
02:49:15.349 --> 02:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
i think representative that calls for
 
02:49:19.510 --> 02:49:19.520 align:start position:0%
a 72-hour period in which a judge as
 
02:49:21.830 --> 02:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
opposed to a bail commissioner
 
02:49:23.910 --> 02:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
makes that determination
 
02:49:27.110 --> 02:49:27.120 align:start position:0%
that's all we're asking that is a
 
02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
very surgical fix on the most serious
 
02:49:33.670 --> 02:49:33.680 align:start position:0%
crimes of homicide of felonious sexual
 
02:49:33.680 --> 02:49:34.790 align:start position:0%
crimes of homicide of felonious sexual
assault

02:49:34.790 --> 02:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
assault
 
02:49:34.800 --> 02:49:35.670 align:start position:0%
assault
um

02:49:35.670 --> 02:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:37.750 --> 02:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
stalking kidnapping
 
02:49:40.469 --> 02:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
pornography those crimes
 
02:49:43.030 --> 02:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
rise to a level if somebody is charged
 
02:49:45.190 --> 02:49:45.200 align:start position:0%
with them in my view at least where we
 
02:49:48.389 --> 02:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
should be very careful and make sure
 
02:49:48.399 --> 02:49:49.269 align:start position:0%
should be very careful and make sure
that

02:49:49.269 --> 02:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:49:52.230 --> 02:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
the person before he or she gets bail
 
02:49:58.870 --> 02:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:58.880 --> 02:50:00.469 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

02:50:00.469 --> 02:50:00.479 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:50:01.750 --> 02:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
02:50:04.790 --> 02:50:04.800 align:start position:0%

newman

02:50:10.309 --> 02:50:10.319 align:start position:0%
newman
 
02:50:12.150 --> 02:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chair and thank you
 
02:50:15.110 --> 02:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question um
 
02:50:17.269 --> 02:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
the you listed the number of the crimes
 
02:50:19.269 --> 02:50:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh that have to be considered and the
 
02:50:20.309 --> 02:50:20.319 align:start position:0%
part that says they have to be
 
02:50:22.389 --> 02:50:22.399 align:start position:0%
considered says that the court
 
02:50:24.469 --> 02:50:24.479 align:start position:0%
and a bail commissioner shall consider
 
02:50:26.469 --> 02:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
the following issues
 
02:50:30.469 --> 02:50:30.479 align:start position:0%
so does that particular phrase mean that
 
02:50:32.710 --> 02:50:32.720 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner can't do it by
 
02:50:35.590 --> 02:50:35.600 align:start position:0%
itself and a judge can or it's either or
 
02:50:38.070 --> 02:50:38.080 align:start position:0%
what what exactly does it mean by and a
 
02:50:40.469 --> 02:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner the court and a bail
 
02:50:40.479 --> 02:50:41.910 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner the court and a bail
commissioner

02:50:41.910 --> 02:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
02:50:44.630 --> 02:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh the intent of the statute is for
 
02:50:46.630 --> 02:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
those crimes listed
 
02:50:49.349 --> 02:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
um from on page two of the bill from
 
02:50:51.830 --> 02:50:51.840 align:start position:0%
lines one through ten that that person
 
02:50:53.590 --> 02:50:53.600 align:start position:0%
would have to go
 
02:50:55.590 --> 02:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
um in front of a judge
 
02:51:00.389 --> 02:51:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:00.399 --> 02:51:01.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:51:05.750 --> 02:51:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:07.429 --> 02:51:07.439 align:start position:0%
okay and i have just one other thing it
 
02:51:09.190 --> 02:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
seems when after they consider those
 
02:51:09.200 --> 02:51:10.389 align:start position:0%
seems when after they consider those
conditions

02:51:10.389 --> 02:51:10.399 align:start position:0%
conditions
 
02:51:12.710 --> 02:51:12.720 align:start position:0%
it says that for a period not more than
 
02:51:14.710 --> 02:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
72 hours so
 
02:51:16.309 --> 02:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to figure out like you gave
 
02:51:19.429 --> 02:51:19.439 align:start position:0%
those examples before of judges they had
 
02:51:21.110 --> 02:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
discretion in that case because this
 
02:51:22.790 --> 02:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
wording didn't exist
 
02:51:24.950 --> 02:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
and now they still have they would still
 
02:51:27.710 --> 02:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
have the possibility of personal
 
02:51:29.750 --> 02:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
recognizance in this
 
02:51:32.150 --> 02:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't necessarily have to hold
 
02:51:35.590 --> 02:51:35.600 align:start position:0%
the person for 72 hours is that correct
 
02:51:37.910 --> 02:51:37.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that
 
02:51:37.920 --> 02:51:39.510 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that that
determination

02:51:39.510 --> 02:51:39.520 align:start position:0%
determination
 
02:51:42.870 --> 02:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
would have to be made by a judge
 
02:51:45.190 --> 02:51:45.200 align:start position:0%
and that's the difference
 
02:51:54.469 --> 02:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:56.230 --> 02:51:56.240 align:start position:0%
representative hopper you're recognized
 
02:51:58.070 --> 02:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you senator for
 
02:51:59.830 --> 02:51:59.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:52:01.190 --> 02:52:01.200 align:start position:0%
and this bill
 
02:52:03.269 --> 02:52:03.279 align:start position:0%
it appears you have
 
02:52:06.710 --> 02:52:06.720 align:start position:0%
three separate bills in one bill
 
02:52:09.030 --> 02:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
all of which in my mind
 
02:52:11.190 --> 02:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
should have separate hearings why did
 
02:52:15.190 --> 02:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:17.990 --> 02:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
well um
 
02:52:20.070 --> 02:52:20.080 align:start position:0%
i think that you could
 
02:52:22.389 --> 02:52:22.399 align:start position:0%
potentially say that
 
02:52:23.830 --> 02:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
number one and
 
02:52:26.550 --> 02:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
section one and section four
 
02:52:28.630 --> 02:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
are a little bit different than the bail
 
02:52:28.640 --> 02:52:29.990 align:start position:0%
are a little bit different than the bail
provisions

02:52:29.990 --> 02:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
02:52:33.110 --> 02:52:33.120 align:start position:0%
um that we've spent a lot of time this
 
02:52:34.870 --> 02:52:34.880 align:start position:0%
morning talking about
 
02:52:34.880 --> 02:52:36.230 align:start position:0%
morning talking about
um

02:52:36.230 --> 02:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:52:38.469 --> 02:52:38.479 align:start position:0%
you know because of covid
 
02:52:40.790 --> 02:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
um and because there were so many bills
 
02:52:43.429 --> 02:52:43.439 align:start position:0%
both filed in your chamber and in the
 
02:52:47.190 --> 02:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
senate i made a determination um
 
02:52:49.990 --> 02:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
to put all of these provisions in one
 
02:52:53.190 --> 02:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
bill i did not think that either section
 
02:52:54.830 --> 02:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
one or four
 
02:52:57.429 --> 02:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
um would
 
02:52:59.830 --> 02:52:59.840 align:start position:0%
sort of interfere with
 
02:53:02.469 --> 02:53:02.479 align:start position:0%
um what i am trying to accomplish in
 
02:53:02.479 --> 02:53:03.990 align:start position:0%
um what i am trying to accomplish in
section

02:53:03.990 --> 02:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
02:53:13.990 --> 02:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:16.230 --> 02:53:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
02:53:18.389 --> 02:53:18.399 align:start position:0%
for taking the question
 
02:53:20.150 --> 02:53:20.160 align:start position:0%
something that stuck with me this term
 
02:53:22.550 --> 02:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony earlier this year
 
02:53:25.670 --> 02:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
along the lines of hard cases make bad
 
02:53:25.680 --> 02:53:26.870 align:start position:0%
along the lines of hard cases make bad
law

02:53:26.870 --> 02:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:53:26.880 --> 02:53:28.469 align:start position:0%
law
essentially

02:53:28.469 --> 02:53:28.479 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
02:53:30.230 --> 02:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
indicating that
 
02:53:33.670 --> 02:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
very serious crimes that that need to
 
02:53:36.630 --> 02:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
proposals to address specific cases
 
02:53:38.389 --> 02:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
rather than the vast majority of
 
02:53:40.630 --> 02:53:40.640 align:start position:0%
situations that
 
02:53:43.830 --> 02:53:43.840 align:start position:0%
are not requiring a change in law
 
02:53:47.670 --> 02:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:49.910 --> 02:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
it seems like bail reform other than a
 
02:53:51.190 --> 02:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
number of
 
02:53:51.200 --> 02:53:53.030 align:start position:0%
number of
very

02:53:53.030 --> 02:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
very
 
02:53:55.429 --> 02:53:55.439 align:start position:0%
high profile cases is generally working
 
02:53:57.429 --> 02:53:57.439 align:start position:0%
okay and i guess i'm concerned about
 
02:53:59.110 --> 02:53:59.120 align:start position:0%
throwing out the baby with that water
 
02:54:00.469 --> 02:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
for a few
 
02:54:02.550 --> 02:54:02.560 align:start position:0%
serious crimes that could still occur
 
02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
even if this change were enacted
 
02:54:06.790 --> 02:54:06.800 align:start position:0%
so again
 
02:54:10.150 --> 02:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
again and thank you for the question um
 
02:54:12.630 --> 02:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
you know there are awful lot of um
 
02:54:15.830 --> 02:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
crimes that people can get charged with
 
02:54:15.840 --> 02:54:17.349 align:start position:0%
crimes that people can get charged with
and

02:54:17.349 --> 02:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:54:21.110 --> 02:54:21.120 align:start position:0%
on page two lines one through ten those
 
02:54:23.670 --> 02:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
crimes are the most serious and the most
 
02:54:23.680 --> 02:54:24.950 align:start position:0%
crimes are the most serious and the most
violent

02:54:24.950 --> 02:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
violent
 
02:54:27.830 --> 02:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
and we have seen examples of people that
 
02:54:29.590 --> 02:54:29.600 align:start position:0%
have been charged with violent crimes
 
02:54:31.349 --> 02:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
that have been re-released that have
 
02:54:34.309 --> 02:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
been released on pr bail and reoffended
 
02:54:36.790 --> 02:54:36.800 align:start position:0%
almost immediately and so
 
02:54:40.389 --> 02:54:40.399 align:start position:0%
i would argue that this is indeed a very
 
02:54:42.389 --> 02:54:42.399 align:start position:0%
surgical approach it's not throwing out
 
02:54:45.269 --> 02:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
the baby with the bath water that the
 
02:54:47.910 --> 02:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
um intent of bail reform which was to
 
02:54:47.920 --> 02:54:49.110 align:start position:0%
um intent of bail reform which was to
provide

02:54:49.110 --> 02:54:49.120 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:54:51.429 --> 02:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
you know access to people with more
 
02:54:54.230 --> 02:54:54.240 align:start position:0%
modest means to be able to get bail
 
02:54:56.790 --> 02:54:56.800 align:start position:0%
has not been undermined but
 
02:54:58.990 --> 02:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:00.630 align:start position:0%
at the same time
recognizing

02:55:00.630 --> 02:55:00.640 align:start position:0%
recognizing
 
02:55:02.870 --> 02:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
the problems that
 
02:55:07.030 --> 02:55:07.040 align:start position:0%
that law created with regard to violent
 
02:55:09.910 --> 02:55:09.920 align:start position:0%
charges and then reoffending in a
 
02:55:12.870 --> 02:55:12.880 align:start position:0%
violent manner that a surgical approach
 
02:55:16.469 --> 02:55:16.479 align:start position:0%
to and the approach is simple one has to
 
02:55:19.429 --> 02:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
be in front of a judge to get bail when
 
02:55:21.670 --> 02:55:21.680 align:start position:0%
charged with those violent crimes to me
 
02:55:23.349 --> 02:55:23.359 align:start position:0%
that is a
 
02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
very surgical and limited approach to
 
02:55:28.309 --> 02:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
02:55:37.429 --> 02:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:39.670 --> 02:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
seeing no for the hands raised senator i
 
02:55:41.349 --> 02:55:41.359 align:start position:0%
want to thank you for your testimony
 
02:55:42.630 --> 02:55:42.640 align:start position:0%
yeah and thank you very much for
 
02:55:44.710 --> 02:55:44.720 align:start position:0%
allowing me to uh
 
02:55:46.389 --> 02:55:46.399 align:start position:0%
sort of jump start your other hearing
 
02:55:48.309 --> 02:55:48.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate that very much and look
 
02:55:49.830 --> 02:55:49.840 align:start position:0%
forward to working with the committee
 
02:55:51.269 --> 02:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:55:55.670 --> 02:55:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:56.870 --> 02:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
02:55:59.110 --> 02:55:59.120 align:start position:0%
the public hearing on senate bill 92
 
02:56:02.150 --> 02:56:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:04.150 --> 02:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
at this time we are now reopening the
 
02:56:06.710 --> 02:56:06.720 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
02:56:10.710 --> 02:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:12.950 --> 02:56:12.960 align:start position:0%

02:56:33.269 --> 02:56:33.279 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me

administrator for sanctuary atc

sanctuary atc opposes sb60 due to
 
02:56:46.550 --> 02:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
language that essentially targets new
 
02:56:49.269 --> 02:56:49.279 align:start position:0%
hampshire therapeutic cannabis patients
 
02:56:51.349 --> 02:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
with the way that this bill is written a
 
02:56:52.870 --> 02:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
qualified new hampshire therapeutic
 
02:56:55.110 --> 02:56:55.120 align:start position:0%

reminding you your testimony is in two

02:58:29.349 --> 02:58:29.359 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
02:58:30.950 --> 02:58:30.960 align:start position:0%
good morning mr chairman first i'll ask
 
02:58:32.630 --> 02:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
the question can you hear me
 
02:58:33.990 --> 02:58:34.000 align:start position:0%
yes we can here
 
02:58:34.000 --> 02:58:35.429 align:start position:0%
yes we can here
uh

02:58:35.429 --> 02:58:35.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:58:36.950 --> 02:58:36.960 align:start position:0%
interesting enough so far this morning i
 
02:58:38.790 --> 02:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
always mentioned that in uh new
 
02:58:40.230 --> 02:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
hampshire law right now there's an
 
02:58:41.990 --> 02:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
affirmative defense available to
 
02:58:43.670 --> 02:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
qualified patients
 
02:58:46.750 --> 02:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
who hold id cards uh
 
02:58:50.230 --> 02:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
rxa126x5 provides a defense against
 
02:58:52.230 --> 02:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
transporting uh
 
02:58:53.670 --> 02:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis what i'm trying to
 
02:58:56.230 --> 02:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
point out real quickly is
 
02:58:59.750 --> 02:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
sb60 is conflicting with rsa
 
02:59:03.110 --> 02:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
x5 so it's really not legislatively uh
 
02:59:05.910 --> 02:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
efficient to create a crime in one
 
02:59:07.910 --> 02:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
section and give an indemnification to
 
02:59:09.349 --> 02:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
the other so you'll see that the
 
02:59:11.269 --> 02:59:11.279 align:start position:0%
affirmative defense would force a
 
02:59:14.309 --> 02:59:14.319 align:start position:0%
cannabis patient to get the violation
 
02:59:17.349 --> 02:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
then have to go to court spend money and
 
02:59:19.590 --> 02:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
to present his affirmative defense so
 
02:59:21.510 --> 02:59:21.520 align:start position:0%
early we had testimony about not having
 
02:59:23.750 --> 02:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
the id card the id card does not have
 
02:59:25.269 --> 02:59:25.279 align:start position:0%
your condition on it you can show your
 
02:59:27.670 --> 02:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
id card show your license and you should
 
02:59:30.309 --> 02:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
have no consequences uh but under senate
 
02:59:32.309 --> 02:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
bill 60 you will so the early
 
02:59:35.750 --> 02:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
discussions of having a uh amendment to
 
02:59:38.630 --> 02:59:38.640 align:start position:0%
put therapeutic cannabis patients into
 
02:59:41.750 --> 02:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
senators bill 60 as an exemption is a
 
02:59:43.750 --> 02:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
good idea because otherwise you've got
 
02:59:45.990 --> 02:59:46.000 align:start position:0%
two laws in direct conflict which isn't
 
02:59:48.070 --> 02:59:48.080 align:start position:0%
fair to a patient to give him a ticket
 
02:59:50.150 --> 02:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
and als also provide him an absolute
 
02:59:52.150 --> 02:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
defense against the ticket having to go
 
02:59:55.030 --> 02:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
find out in court spend money to get out
 
02:59:56.550 --> 02:59:56.560 align:start position:0%
of it so hopefully that's within two
 
02:59:58.150 --> 02:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
minutes but there's your conflict and
 
03:00:05.030 --> 03:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:07.030 --> 03:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
i want to thank you for your testimony
 
03:00:08.070 --> 03:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:00:09.910 --> 03:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
you know hands raised the witness is
 
03:00:09.920 --> 03:00:20.630 align:start position:0%
you know hands raised the witness is
excused

03:00:20.630 --> 03:00:20.640 align:start position:0%

thank you for adding me on here mr chair

thank you very much uh for taking my
 
03:01:37.429 --> 03:01:37.439 align:start position:0%
testimony for the for the record my name
 
03:01:39.190 --> 03:01:39.200 align:start position:0%
is uh honorable tim josephson former
 
03:01:41.349 --> 03:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
representative from grafton11 and i live
 
03:01:43.510 --> 03:01:43.520 align:start position:0%
here in canaan uh you heard my wife
 
03:01:46.070 --> 03:01:46.080 align:start position:0%
testimony testify earlier she is a
 
03:01:47.590 --> 03:01:47.600 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis patient and i am a
 
03:01:49.830 --> 03:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
licensed caregiver um
 
03:01:51.269 --> 03:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
so one of my main concerns about this
 
03:01:51.279 --> 03:01:52.070 align:start position:0%
so one of my main concerns about this
bill

03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:01:53.590 --> 03:01:53.600 align:start position:0%
is that it literally lifts the language
 
03:01:57.429 --> 03:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
from rsa 265 a 44 which is about open
 
03:01:59.110 --> 03:01:59.120 align:start position:0%
containers of alcohol it is literally
 
03:02:01.349 --> 03:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
the same language cannabis is not
 
03:02:03.110 --> 03:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
alcohol we can't just lift language from
 
03:02:05.030 --> 03:02:05.040 align:start position:0%
one and put it on another especially
 
03:02:06.630 --> 03:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
when cannabis is used in new hampshire
 
03:02:08.710 --> 03:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
as a medication by thousands of patients
 
03:02:10.389 --> 03:02:10.399 align:start position:0%
and this is a step backwards you know we
 
03:02:11.590 --> 03:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
heard that we heard the police chief
 
03:02:12.950 --> 03:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
talking about how different cannabis is
 
03:02:14.870 --> 03:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
from alcohol so why does this bill treat
 
03:02:17.510 --> 03:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
it the same um you know and and and we
 
03:02:19.750 --> 03:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
talked about you know inaccessibility
 
03:02:21.910 --> 03:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
and the trunk and that sort of thing
 
03:02:21.920 --> 03:02:23.349 align:start position:0%
and the trunk and that sort of thing
um

03:02:23.349 --> 03:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:25.910 --> 03:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
you know as a caregiver and as the
 
03:02:27.830 --> 03:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
patient we have to carry our cards with
 
03:02:30.070 --> 03:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
us all the time so you know when the
 
03:02:31.429 --> 03:02:31.439 align:start position:0%
chief said there's no way for an officer
 
03:02:32.870 --> 03:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
to check and see if someone has a card
 
03:02:34.710 --> 03:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's not true we have to we have to
 
03:02:36.790 --> 03:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
have our cards uh one question that i
 
03:02:38.710 --> 03:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
haven't heard asked by anybody yet is
 
03:02:41.190 --> 03:02:41.200 align:start position:0%
how many people have been um pulled over
 
03:02:43.110 --> 03:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
or or are charged
 
03:02:44.870 --> 03:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
with a dui
 
03:02:46.630 --> 03:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
for uh driving under the influence of
 
03:02:49.030 --> 03:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis or marijuana uh that the police
 
03:02:50.550 --> 03:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
chief alluded to that it was a problem
 
03:02:51.910 --> 03:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
that it was an issue
 
03:02:54.070 --> 03:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
um that they've been seeing so i'm just
 
03:02:56.150 --> 03:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
curious what the data is on that
 
03:02:58.630 --> 03:02:58.640 align:start position:0%
um you know by definition the only the
 
03:02:58.640 --> 03:02:59.429 align:start position:0%
um you know by definition the only the
only

03:02:59.429 --> 03:02:59.439 align:start position:0%
only
 
03:03:01.590 --> 03:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
sealed container has to come from an atc
 
03:03:03.110 --> 03:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire that's the only way you
 
03:03:05.750 --> 03:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
can get a sealed container um therefore
 
03:03:08.070 --> 03:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
this is primarily applied to patients uh
 
03:03:10.630 --> 03:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
here's an example so i'm a caregiver i'm
 
03:03:12.389 --> 03:03:12.399 align:start position:0%
the driver of the car i take the patient
 
03:03:13.990 --> 03:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
to the atc for a meeting because they
 
03:03:15.670 --> 03:03:15.680 align:start position:0%
want to meet their uh the the people
 
03:03:17.670 --> 03:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
there at the at the atc they help the
 
03:03:19.269 --> 03:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
patient with selecting some gummies or
 
03:03:20.790 --> 03:03:20.800 align:start position:0%
capsules and then the patient who's glad
 
03:03:22.630 --> 03:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
to get some relief from their nausea
 
03:03:24.070 --> 03:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
takes one as a passenger and puts the
 
03:03:25.910 --> 03:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
container in their purse or bag they're
 
03:03:27.349 --> 03:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
driving along and the caregiver
 
03:03:28.790 --> 03:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
caregivers by the way are often the
 
03:03:30.790 --> 03:03:30.800 align:start position:0%
spouse of the patient
 
03:03:32.230 --> 03:03:32.240 align:start position:0%
they're driving they get pulled over for
 
03:03:33.670 --> 03:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
whatever reason the police notice the
 
03:03:35.269 --> 03:03:35.279 align:start position:0%
open container and then they find the
 
03:03:37.110 --> 03:03:37.120 align:start position:0%
caregiver and take away their license
 
03:03:38.710 --> 03:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
now we're just taking away the only way
 
03:03:40.070 --> 03:03:40.080 align:start position:0%
that that patient has to get their
 
03:03:42.150 --> 03:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
medicine if they're an elderly patient
 
03:03:43.510 --> 03:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
and that's how they you know they they
 
03:03:45.910 --> 03:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
rely on their caregiver um you know this
 
03:03:47.750 --> 03:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
happens with with cancer patients who
 
03:03:50.230 --> 03:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
take chemo a lot of the the use of
 
03:03:52.070 --> 03:03:52.080 align:start position:0%
therapy cannabis for those type of
 
03:03:54.389 --> 03:03:54.399 align:start position:0%
patients is to offset the nausea that
 
03:03:56.230 --> 03:03:56.240 align:start position:0%
comes with the chemo
 
03:03:58.070 --> 03:03:58.080 align:start position:0%
so you know it
 
03:04:00.070 --> 03:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
it we don't treat other medications the
 
03:04:02.630 --> 03:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
same way is really my point uh we we
 
03:04:04.150 --> 03:04:04.160 align:start position:0%
don't have any bills we don't have any
 
03:04:05.349 --> 03:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
laws to talk about prescription
 
03:04:07.030 --> 03:04:07.040 align:start position:0%
medications i could have a car seat full
 
03:04:08.550 --> 03:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
of prescription medications next to me
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
in my name that i have you know legally
 
03:04:12.950 --> 03:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
access to they could all be open
 
03:04:14.870 --> 03:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
and that's fine um i just asked that
 
03:04:16.309 --> 03:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
this bill either be found in expedient
 
03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
to legislate or retain because it is
 
03:04:20.150 --> 03:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
obvious that it needs some work so thank
 
03:04:21.190 --> 03:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
you and i'm happy to answer any
 
03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:24.150 align:start position:0%
you and i'm happy to answer any
questions

03:04:24.150 --> 03:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:28.469 --> 03:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:30.070 --> 03:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised the witnesses
 
03:04:32.389 --> 03:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
excused we do miss you in the house sir
 
03:04:37.830 --> 03:04:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:39.750 --> 03:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
03:04:42.710 --> 03:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
the channel recognizes
 
03:04:50.950 --> 03:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me okay
 
03:04:54.000 --> 03:04:55.830 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me okay
yes

03:04:55.830 --> 03:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:04:57.269 --> 03:04:57.279 align:start position:0%
great thank you for the record matt
 
03:04:59.510 --> 03:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
simon uh representing the marijuana
 
03:05:01.110 --> 03:05:01.120 align:start position:0%
policy project
 
03:05:03.590 --> 03:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
i oppose this bill for a lot of reasons
 
03:05:05.750 --> 03:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
you've already heard but primarily
 
03:05:08.550 --> 03:05:08.560 align:start position:0%
because it would be a big step backwards
 
03:05:10.630 --> 03:05:10.640 align:start position:0%
for criminal justice reform in new
 
03:05:10.640 --> 03:05:11.670 align:start position:0%
for criminal justice reform in new
hampshire

03:05:11.670 --> 03:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
03:05:13.190 --> 03:05:13.200 align:start position:0%
this bill has been described as an
 
03:05:15.670 --> 03:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
attempt to treat cannabis similarly to
 
03:05:17.910 --> 03:05:17.920 align:start position:0%
the way we treat alcohol it's a very
 
03:05:19.590 --> 03:05:19.600 align:start position:0%
familiar argument to me it's one that
 
03:05:21.190 --> 03:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
i've been making for a long time with
 
03:05:26.070 --> 03:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
regard to regulation of cannabis markets
 
03:05:27.750 --> 03:05:27.760 align:start position:0%
in most respects i support treating
 
03:05:29.590 --> 03:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis similarly to alcohol but in
 
03:05:31.510 --> 03:05:31.520 align:start position:0%
this case there is an obvious difference
 
03:05:31.520 --> 03:05:32.550 align:start position:0%
this case there is an obvious difference
between

03:05:32.550 --> 03:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
between
 
03:05:34.309 --> 03:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
alcohol and cannabis and it's the
 
03:05:36.550 --> 03:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
difference between a liquid and a solid
 
03:05:38.469 --> 03:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
if somebody has a can of beer or a
 
03:05:40.870 --> 03:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
bottle of whiskey in in the passenger
 
03:05:42.630 --> 03:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
compartment of their vehicle and it's
 
03:05:45.510 --> 03:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
open they're probably drinking it
 
03:05:47.750 --> 03:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
with cannabis that simply isn't the case
 
03:05:49.750 --> 03:05:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's more like a pack of cigarettes that
 
03:05:51.830 --> 03:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
you've already taken a cigarette out of
 
03:05:53.349 --> 03:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
there's no
 
03:05:54.950 --> 03:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
likelihood that you're actually
 
03:05:56.790 --> 03:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
consuming it just because it happens to
 
03:05:58.710 --> 03:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
not be sealed
 
03:06:00.070 --> 03:06:00.080 align:start position:0%
so i think it's important to remember
 
03:06:01.110 --> 03:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
one of the main goals of
 
03:06:04.230 --> 03:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
decriminalization was to refocus limited
 
03:06:06.710 --> 03:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
law enforcement resources away from
 
03:06:08.950 --> 03:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
simple possession of cannabis
 
03:06:11.670 --> 03:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
encouraging police to instead focus on
 
03:06:13.830 --> 03:06:13.840 align:start position:0%
serious crimes and threats to public
 
03:06:16.389 --> 03:06:16.399 align:start position:0%
safety as we've heard it is already a
 
03:06:19.190 --> 03:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
crime to drive while impaired
 
03:06:21.110 --> 03:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
i think i also think it's very important
 
03:06:23.750 --> 03:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
to remember that the proponents of this
 
03:06:23.760 --> 03:06:24.630 align:start position:0%
to remember that the proponents of this
bill

03:06:24.630 --> 03:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:06:28.550 --> 03:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh were staunch vigorous opponents of
 
03:06:30.870 --> 03:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
the modest and very popular decrim law
 
03:06:34.230 --> 03:06:34.240 align:start position:0%
that passed in 2017 in any other context
 
03:06:36.790 --> 03:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
this bill's proponents oppose treating
 
03:06:39.510 --> 03:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
cannabis like alcohol in this case they
 
03:06:41.750 --> 03:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
seem to want to be returning to the days
 
03:06:43.990 --> 03:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
when police did consider it their
 
03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:44.950 align:start position:0%
when police did consider it their
business

03:06:44.950 --> 03:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
business
 
03:06:46.870 --> 03:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
if somebody possessed a small amount of
 
03:06:49.349 --> 03:06:49.359 align:start position:0%
cannabis whether or not they were consum
 
03:06:51.110 --> 03:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
consuming it or presenting a public
 
03:06:53.269 --> 03:06:53.279 align:start position:0%
threat to public safety so as we
 
03:06:54.710 --> 03:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
consider what the role of policing
 
03:06:57.349 --> 03:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
should be in the 21st century this bill
 
03:06:58.950 --> 03:06:58.960 align:start position:0%
would take new hampshire back to the
 
03:07:01.429 --> 03:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
20th century by giving police a new
 
03:07:04.150 --> 03:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
excuse to search people's cars absent
 
03:07:06.150 --> 03:07:06.160 align:start position:0%
any threat to public safety i would
 
03:07:07.510 --> 03:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
strongly encourage you to find it
 
03:07:09.990 --> 03:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate and if you're
 
03:07:11.830 --> 03:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
not going to do that please retain it so
 
03:07:14.190 --> 03:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
that we can argue about the many
 
03:07:15.990 --> 03:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
misrepresentations that were made by the
 
03:07:17.830 --> 03:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
proponents of this bill during during
 
03:07:28.870 --> 03:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:28.880 --> 03:07:31.269 align:start position:0%
 
hey

03:07:31.269 --> 03:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:34.870 --> 03:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:37.030 --> 03:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised the witnesses
 
03:07:37.040 --> 03:07:39.190 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised the witnesses
excused

public who are in attendance if we
 
03:07:44.170 --> 03:07:44.180 align:start position:0%
should testify

regardless of senate bill 60 that have
 
03:07:49.670 --> 03:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
not testified already

on senate bill 60 representative muse
 
03:08:07.990 --> 03:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
we read the results
 
03:08:10.630 --> 03:08:10.640 align:start position:0%
we had 33 people who signed in in
 
03:08:13.349 --> 03:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
support of this bill we had 95 who
 
03:08:15.190 --> 03:08:15.200 align:start position:0%
signed in in opposition
 
03:08:17.110 --> 03:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
and we had one person who signed in as
 
03:08:17.120 --> 03:08:22.070 align:start position:0%
and we had one person who signed in as
neutral

03:08:22.070 --> 03:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:25.030 --> 03:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:27.429 --> 03:08:27.439 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
03:08:30.389 --> 03:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
we are going to reopen the
 
03:08:43.830 --> 03:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:45.429 --> 03:08:45.439 align:start position:0%
and does any members of the public more

03:09:07.840 --> 03:09:18.070 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:09:18.070 --> 03:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:19.830 --> 03:09:19.840 align:start position:0%

and for the purposes of this the public
hearing

03:09:27.030 --> 03:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:09:29.030 --> 03:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to limit testimony three
 
03:09:31.670 --> 03:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
minutes per week
 
03:09:33.030 --> 03:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:09:35.030 --> 03:09:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh just briefly what what i was going to
 
03:09:38.150 --> 03:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
talk about was the section on um
 
03:09:40.710 --> 03:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
background uh as you know the leak
 
03:09:42.790 --> 03:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
commission recommended that we look at
 
03:09:44.950 --> 03:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
bias and other
 
03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
things that show up in background
 
03:09:50.550 --> 03:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
this bit this section is modeled after a
 
03:09:52.150 --> 03:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
large sar in california when i get a
 
03:09:53.910 --> 03:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
request for information
 
03:09:56.630 --> 03:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
i looked at it kind of
 
03:09:58.630 --> 03:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
looked at what we need to do there's a
 
03:10:00.710 --> 03:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
similar bill that actually i think went
 
03:10:02.790 --> 03:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
through your committee already
 
03:10:02.800 --> 03:10:03.590 align:start position:0%
through your committee already
and

03:10:03.590 --> 03:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:10:05.190 --> 03:10:05.200 align:start position:0%
went to the senate it just puts it in a
 
03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
different section
 
03:10:08.790 --> 03:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
the idea is that
 
03:10:11.030 --> 03:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
businesses will share this information
 
03:10:13.590 --> 03:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
and they get exemption from liability
 
03:10:15.670 --> 03:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't have to be shared the
 
03:10:17.750 --> 03:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
more information we get to give a better
 
03:10:17.760 --> 03:10:18.790 align:start position:0%
more information we get to give a better
picture

03:10:18.790 --> 03:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
picture
 
03:10:20.150 --> 03:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
of people we're bringing into this
 
03:10:23.190 --> 03:10:23.200 align:start position:0%
profession the better it will be
 
03:10:25.670 --> 03:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
the other section on on i think uh
 
03:10:27.349 --> 03:10:27.359 align:start position:0%
senator bradley spoke quite well about
 
03:10:28.469 --> 03:10:28.479 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
03:10:30.790 --> 03:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
and the uh amendments we made on the
 
03:10:32.870 --> 03:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
criminal mischief so i'll
 
03:10:35.830 --> 03:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
yield my time i see a question so
 
03:10:37.110 --> 03:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
i think i've uh
 
03:10:42.469 --> 03:10:42.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:44.150 --> 03:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognized
 
03:10:48.630 --> 03:10:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:50.309 --> 03:10:50.319 align:start position:0%
with all the members
 
03:10:52.070 --> 03:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
if you're recognized
 
03:10:54.150 --> 03:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
by the chair for a question i expect a
 
03:10:56.630 --> 03:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
question to be asked to witness
 
03:10:59.110 --> 03:10:59.120 align:start position:0%
not i'm not a state
 
03:11:00.950 --> 03:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
03:11:00.960 --> 03:11:03.269 align:start position:0%
oh okay
um

03:11:03.269 --> 03:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:05.269 --> 03:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
so yeah and then
 
03:11:08.150 --> 03:11:08.160 align:start position:0%
your in your experience um without this
 
03:11:09.190 --> 03:11:09.200 align:start position:0%
law do
 
03:11:09.200 --> 03:11:10.630 align:start position:0%
law do
do

03:11:10.630 --> 03:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
do
 
03:11:12.790 --> 03:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
employers usually give you uh the type
 
03:11:15.590 --> 03:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
of detailed information that
 
03:11:16.870 --> 03:11:16.880 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
03:11:18.150 --> 03:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
this law
 
03:11:19.349 --> 03:11:19.359 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
03:11:21.269 --> 03:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
attempting to give so are they usually
 
03:11:22.550 --> 03:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
fairly uh
 
03:11:24.389 --> 03:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
fairly circumspect what they say about
 
03:11:26.469 --> 03:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
former employees
 
03:11:28.790 --> 03:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh it's hit or miss i've had a few
 
03:11:28.800 --> 03:11:30.150 align:start position:0%
uh it's hit or miss i've had a few
occasions

03:11:30.150 --> 03:11:30.160 align:start position:0%
occasions
 
03:11:33.750 --> 03:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
one just last year where a previous
 
03:11:37.110 --> 03:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
employer refused to give information um
 
03:11:39.429 --> 03:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
but for the most part people do share
 
03:11:41.110 --> 03:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
but they may not
 
03:11:42.790 --> 03:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
they may limit what they share too they
 
03:11:45.670 --> 03:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
may just say the person worked here
 
03:11:47.269 --> 03:11:47.279 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:11:49.510 --> 03:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
this is how much they made
 
03:11:52.230 --> 03:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
and they may not be willing especially
 
03:11:54.230 --> 03:11:54.240 align:start position:0%
if there's uh some concerns that they
 
03:11:56.230 --> 03:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
could be sued this gives them
 
03:11:57.429 --> 03:11:57.439 align:start position:0%
and we have to jump through certain
 
03:11:58.950 --> 03:11:58.960 align:start position:0%
steps to ask it we have to do it in
 
03:12:00.469 --> 03:12:00.479 align:start position:0%
writing we have to cite the law we have
 
03:12:02.550 --> 03:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
to do you know cite the conditions of
 
03:12:05.510 --> 03:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
the law so it's not just
 
03:12:08.230 --> 03:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
we we probe people pretty hard i try to
 
03:12:10.710 --> 03:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
but occasionally it has been thwarted
 
03:12:12.950 --> 03:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh i had to look other ways to try and
 
03:12:14.230 --> 03:12:14.240 align:start position:0%
get that info
 
03:12:16.309 --> 03:12:16.319 align:start position:0%
hopefully this just makes it easier and
 
03:12:18.389 --> 03:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
everybody feels uh comfortable sharing
 
03:12:20.230 --> 03:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
that information that's critical to make
 
03:12:23.110 --> 03:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
a good hiring decision
 
03:12:23.120 --> 03:12:24.950 align:start position:0%
a good hiring decision
follow-up

03:12:24.950 --> 03:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
03:12:26.309 --> 03:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
representative morgan you're recognized
 
03:12:27.910 --> 03:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question
 
03:12:27.920 --> 03:12:29.590 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question
yes

03:12:29.590 --> 03:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:12:32.309 --> 03:12:32.319 align:start position:0%
and of course we have a
 
03:12:35.590 --> 03:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
sub-paragraph for this section um
 
03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
gives uh
 
03:12:38.710 --> 03:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
tries to take away the
 
03:12:40.230 --> 03:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
applicant's right to
 
03:12:42.870 --> 03:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
just sue to sue um do you think that
 
03:12:44.469 --> 03:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
would be uh
 
03:12:46.710 --> 03:12:46.720 align:start position:0%
would that would that do you think
 
03:12:48.469 --> 03:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
in your opinion which i may not be
 
03:12:49.990 --> 03:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
asking the right person but your opinion
 
03:12:51.269 --> 03:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
would that uh
 
03:12:54.070 --> 03:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
restrict a uh applicant from suing a
 
03:12:57.269 --> 03:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
out-of-state employer
 
03:12:59.269 --> 03:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
it may not apply to other states i'm not
 
03:13:02.630 --> 03:13:02.640 align:start position:0%
an expert on on cross state
 
03:13:05.910 --> 03:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
i think it would may limit it but
 
03:13:08.710 --> 03:13:08.720 align:start position:0%
i can't answer for that honestly
 
03:13:10.950 --> 03:13:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay thanks thank you mr chair thank you
 
03:13:10.960 --> 03:13:19.910 align:start position:0%
okay thanks thank you mr chair thank you
chief

03:13:19.910 --> 03:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:22.150 --> 03:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
seeing no for the hands race i want to
 
03:13:36.150 --> 03:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:39.510 --> 03:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
at this time the chair recognizes
 
03:13:49.269 --> 03:13:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:50.469 --> 03:13:50.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman abbas and
 
03:13:52.150 --> 03:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
03:13:53.750 --> 03:13:53.760 align:start position:0%
my name is lieutenant tim patterson and
 
03:13:54.870 --> 03:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
i've been in law enforcement with
 
03:13:56.550 --> 03:13:56.560 align:start position:0%
manchester police department for 24
 
03:13:58.950 --> 03:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
years i am here to testify in support of
 
03:14:00.710 --> 03:14:00.720 align:start position:0%
sb 92 for the manchester police
 
03:14:00.720 --> 03:14:02.150 align:start position:0%
sb 92 for the manchester police
department

03:14:02.150 --> 03:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
department
 
03:14:03.670 --> 03:14:03.680 align:start position:0%
we see this bill as a way to tweak
 
03:14:05.269 --> 03:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
existing legislation and ensure that
 
03:14:07.110 --> 03:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
dangerous individuals are brought before
 
03:14:10.389 --> 03:14:10.399 align:start position:0%
a judge to properly consider bail these
 
03:14:12.309 --> 03:14:12.319 align:start position:0%
changes are necessary as we continue to
 
03:14:14.150 --> 03:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
see dangerous individuals released on
 
03:14:16.229 --> 03:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
personal recognizance bail
 
03:14:18.070 --> 03:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
there is inconsistency in the
 
03:14:19.750 --> 03:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
application of current law by bill
 
03:14:19.760 --> 03:14:21.110 align:start position:0%
application of current law by bill
commissioners

03:14:21.110 --> 03:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
03:14:23.110 --> 03:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
for example earlier this week an
 
03:14:25.429 --> 03:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
individual was released on pr bail after
 
03:14:27.269 --> 03:14:27.279 align:start position:0%
being charged with reckless conduct with
 
03:14:28.630 --> 03:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
a deadly weapon
 
03:14:30.229 --> 03:14:30.239 align:start position:0%
during an argument she threw a knife in
 
03:14:32.229 --> 03:14:32.239 align:start position:0%
the air striking the individual she was
 
03:14:34.309 --> 03:14:34.319 align:start position:0%
arguing with
 
03:14:37.750 --> 03:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
chief profonsky will detail an incident
 
03:14:40.389 --> 03:14:40.399 align:start position:0%
in his testimony involving a convicted
 
03:14:42.630 --> 03:14:42.640 align:start position:0%
felon who shot another individual on the
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
streets of manchester back in november
 
03:14:47.670 --> 03:14:47.680 align:start position:0%
this individual was from massachusetts
 
03:14:49.349 --> 03:14:49.359 align:start position:0%
and was also released on personal
 
03:14:51.510 --> 03:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
recognizance bail
 
03:14:53.110 --> 03:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
these individuals and others should have
 
03:14:54.870 --> 03:14:54.880 align:start position:0%
been hailed for a bail hearing in front
 
03:14:56.950 --> 03:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
of a judge so that an informed decision
 
03:14:59.349 --> 03:14:59.359 align:start position:0%
can be made regarding release conditions
 
03:15:01.110 --> 03:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
imposed or
 
03:15:02.950 --> 03:15:02.960 align:start position:0%

03:16:44.870 --> 03:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
the second bail commission had a
 
03:16:47.110 --> 03:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
majority of law enforcement officers on
 
03:16:48.550 --> 03:16:48.560 align:start position:0%
it um
 
03:16:52.309 --> 03:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
we heard many of the same uh complaints
 
03:16:54.950 --> 03:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
and anecdotes uh that you will hear
 
03:16:54.960 --> 03:16:56.469 align:start position:0%
and anecdotes uh that you will hear
today

03:16:56.469 --> 03:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:16:59.110 --> 03:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
about that some of which uh senator uh
 
03:17:00.790 --> 03:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
bradley talked about
 
03:17:03.590 --> 03:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
uh i i've heard the the example senator
 
03:17:06.309 --> 03:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
bradley talked about before i heard them
 
03:17:07.990 --> 03:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh when i was on the second bail
 
03:17:10.309 --> 03:17:10.319 align:start position:0%
commission the second bail commission
 
03:17:11.910 --> 03:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
had a majority of law enforcement
 
03:17:13.349 --> 03:17:13.359 align:start position:0%

03:17:21.110 --> 03:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
or jail individuals superintendents
 
03:17:23.590 --> 03:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
at the end when we arrived at a
 
03:17:25.990 --> 03:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
compromise and we heard this testimony
 
03:17:28.710 --> 03:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
about protecting victims when we arrived
 
03:17:31.349 --> 03:17:31.359 align:start position:0%
at a compromise then senator levaik who
 
03:17:34.309 --> 03:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
was chair of the committee um uh senator
 
03:17:36.150 --> 03:17:36.160 align:start position:0%
representative welch and representative
 
03:17:38.070 --> 03:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
woodbury were on the committee
 
03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
senator senator levaik said does anyone
 
03:17:43.830 --> 03:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
want to add any more anything more to
 
03:17:45.349 --> 03:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
what we've crafted
 
03:17:45.359 --> 03:17:46.550 align:start position:0%
what we've crafted
everybody

03:17:46.550 --> 03:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
nobody said yes
 
03:17:51.190 --> 03:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
does anyone want to make any changes
 
03:17:54.389 --> 03:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
nobody said yes does everybody agree
 
03:17:56.309 --> 03:17:56.319 align:start position:0%
with what we've drafted
 
03:17:59.349 --> 03:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
nobody's everybody said yes
 
03:17:59.359 --> 03:18:00.550 align:start position:0%
nobody's everybody said yes
those

03:18:00.550 --> 03:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
03:18:03.030 --> 03:18:03.040 align:start position:0%
those changes went into effect on
 
03:18:07.429 --> 03:18:07.439 align:start position:0%
september 17th of this past year 2020
 
03:18:10.790 --> 03:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
we have nowhere near enough data
 
03:18:12.150 --> 03:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
at all
 
03:18:12.160 --> 03:18:13.349 align:start position:0%
at all
to

03:18:13.349 --> 03:18:13.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:18:17.110 --> 03:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
say let's tweak what we just tweaked
 
03:18:19.190 --> 03:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
seven months ago we don't have that
 
03:18:22.550 --> 03:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
information and i strongly urge the
 
03:18:25.349 --> 03:18:25.359 align:start position:0%
committee not to not to pass this
 
03:18:29.150 --> 03:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
legislation to vote uh itl on this
 
03:18:32.150 --> 03:18:32.160 align:start position:0%
legislation because it's an effort
 
03:18:35.030 --> 03:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
to legislate by anecdote
 
03:18:37.349 --> 03:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
and that's a mistake
 
03:18:41.030 --> 03:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh and uh we worked hard on the bail
 
03:18:43.750 --> 03:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
commission we met at le met at least 10
 
03:18:46.870 --> 03:18:46.880 align:start position:0%
times to try and accommodate all the
 
03:18:49.510 --> 03:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
concerns everybody had from both sides
 
03:18:51.990 --> 03:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
of the criminal criminal justice system
 
03:18:54.950 --> 03:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
and we did a good job and now
 
03:18:57.510 --> 03:18:57.520 align:start position:0%
here comes the uh police chiefs and
 
03:18:59.990 --> 03:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
others back saying
 
03:19:02.070 --> 03:19:02.080 align:start position:0%
we got to make changes because we didn't
 
03:19:03.590 --> 03:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
really mean it when we agreed with what
 
03:19:03.600 --> 03:19:04.389 align:start position:0%
really mean it when we agreed with what
we

03:19:04.389 --> 03:19:04.399 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:19:06.550 --> 03:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
what you did last year we got some more
 
03:19:08.710 --> 03:19:08.720 align:start position:0%
changes so
 
03:19:11.429 --> 03:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
i urge uh that you vote in expedient to
 
03:19:11.439 --> 03:19:19.030 align:start position:0%
i urge uh that you vote in expedient to
legislate

03:19:19.030 --> 03:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:21.990 --> 03:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony
 
03:19:23.269 --> 03:19:23.279 align:start position:0%
the chair recognizes representative
 
03:19:24.870 --> 03:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
hopper for a question
 
03:19:26.950 --> 03:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman thank you thank
 
03:19:32.630 --> 03:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:35.349 --> 03:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
so the the example that the senator gave
 
03:19:37.750 --> 03:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
were they outdated
 
03:19:40.550 --> 03:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
and um you know were they
 
03:19:43.429 --> 03:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
with those before
 
03:19:46.790 --> 03:19:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh the effects of the law took place
 
03:19:48.790 --> 03:19:48.800 align:start position:0%
i remember uh
 
03:19:50.630 --> 03:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
somebody in a presentation to the bail
 
03:19:53.349 --> 03:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
commission talking about at least two
 
03:19:56.070 --> 03:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
about at least two of those examples
 
03:19:58.389 --> 03:19:58.399 align:start position:0%
um and and you know
 
03:20:01.349 --> 03:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
senator bradley for whatever reason uh
 
03:20:03.190 --> 03:20:03.200 align:start position:0%
didn't date those examples
 
03:20:04.309 --> 03:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:20:06.950 --> 03:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
some of the examples he gave as i
 
03:20:09.110 --> 03:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
understood them back then
 
03:20:12.630 --> 03:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
and would have been uh uh
 
03:20:14.870 --> 03:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
the outcome would have been different if
 
03:20:17.190 --> 03:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh the current version had been in place
 
03:20:20.309 --> 03:20:20.319 align:start position:0%
at that time that's why uh
 
03:20:22.710 --> 03:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
these outdated examples uh are really
 
03:20:25.750 --> 03:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
not useful because we heard a lot about
 
03:20:26.830 --> 03:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
the very
 
03:20:29.670 --> 03:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
problem senator bradley talked about on
 
03:20:32.469 --> 03:20:32.479 align:start position:0%
the bail commission and we as a group we
 
03:20:34.389 --> 03:20:34.399 align:start position:0%
work really hard to
 
03:20:34.399 --> 03:20:35.349 align:start position:0%
work really hard to
um

03:20:35.349 --> 03:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:20:37.349 --> 03:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
to figure that out and accommodate it
 
03:20:39.590 --> 03:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
both in terms of failures to appear
 
03:20:41.269 --> 03:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
and in terms of
 
03:20:44.150 --> 03:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
potential uh dangerous people being
 
03:20:44.160 --> 03:20:46.070 align:start position:0%
potential uh dangerous people being
released

03:20:46.070 --> 03:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
released
 
03:20:50.229 --> 03:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:51.510 --> 03:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
china recognize representative
 
03:20:54.870 --> 03:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:54.880 --> 03:20:57.349 align:start position:0%
 
muted

03:20:57.349 --> 03:20:57.359 align:start position:0%
muted
 
03:20:57.359 --> 03:20:59.830 align:start position:0%
muted
uh

03:20:59.830 --> 03:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:02.630 --> 03:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for mr chairman and
 
03:21:04.150 --> 03:21:04.160 align:start position:0%
mr shirt
 
03:21:06.630 --> 03:21:06.640 align:start position:0%
in your um
 
03:21:07.670 --> 03:21:07.680 align:start position:0%
in your
 
03:21:10.070 --> 03:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
package or whatever you want to call it
 
03:21:11.750 --> 03:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
that i've never seen
 
03:21:14.389 --> 03:21:14.399 align:start position:0%
um did you put in it a cooling off
 
03:21:17.349 --> 03:21:17.359 align:start position:0%
period for people that had beat other
 
03:21:20.229 --> 03:21:20.239 align:start position:0%
people or domestic violence or anything
 
03:21:22.150 --> 03:21:22.160 align:start position:0%
like that
 
03:21:25.750 --> 03:21:25.760 align:start position:0%
the the bail commission uh the proposals
 
03:21:25.760 --> 03:21:26.870 align:start position:0%
the the bail commission uh the proposals
uh

03:21:26.870 --> 03:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:21:26.880 --> 03:21:27.990 align:start position:0%
uh
uh

03:21:27.990 --> 03:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:21:31.910 --> 03:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
sought to empower better to make
 
03:21:33.110 --> 03:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
it clear
 
03:21:36.070 --> 03:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh several things one that bail
 
03:21:38.469 --> 03:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
commissioners who are the first people
 
03:21:40.950 --> 03:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
who set bail
 
03:21:43.110 --> 03:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners have all the
 
03:21:45.590 --> 03:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
authority that a judge has in setting
 
03:21:49.110 --> 03:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
bail uh and that was the case back then
 
03:21:51.510 --> 03:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
and and the problem has been that bail
 
03:21:54.070 --> 03:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
commissioners um have not been
 
03:21:56.229 --> 03:21:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh have not been getting paid and it's
 
03:21:57.990 --> 03:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
been hard to find
 
03:22:01.269 --> 03:22:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh good bail commissioners who will uh
 
03:22:04.550 --> 03:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh who will accept training and do it
 
03:22:06.469 --> 03:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
simply because they're not getting paid
 
03:22:08.950 --> 03:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
and so that's been the choke point in
 
03:22:11.590 --> 03:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
terms of dangerous people getting relief
 
03:22:15.429 --> 03:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
um that and the the the superior court
 
03:22:17.990 --> 03:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
system and the district court system
 
03:22:21.030 --> 03:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
which supervises bail commissioners had
 
03:22:23.110 --> 03:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
had a strong commitment and made a
 
03:22:25.429 --> 03:22:25.439 align:start position:0%
strong commitment in the uh during the
 
03:22:27.269 --> 03:22:27.279 align:start position:0%
bail commission to training the bail
 
03:22:29.830 --> 03:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
commissioners better so
 
03:22:32.309 --> 03:22:32.319 align:start position:0%
that's the way uh
 
03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
we the bail co the bail commission tried
 
03:22:37.910 --> 03:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
to address that problem rather than a
 
03:22:44.630 --> 03:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:46.389 --> 03:22:46.399 align:start position:0%
representative antelope is recognized
 
03:22:50.389 --> 03:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question yes uh you
 
03:22:52.950 --> 03:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
you say that they didn't put in any
 
03:22:56.710 --> 03:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
stipulation of somebody being held for a
 
03:22:59.910 --> 03:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
certain length of time to cool them off
 
03:23:01.990 --> 03:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
it just left it the way it was to the
 
03:23:03.590 --> 03:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
bail commission
 
03:23:06.870 --> 03:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
it it it directed the
 
03:23:08.950 --> 03:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
district courts to educate bail
 
03:23:12.469 --> 03:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
commissioners about the powers they have
 
03:23:15.030 --> 03:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
and to you know be
 
03:23:17.910 --> 03:23:17.920 align:start position:0%
exercised their powers to hold somebody
 
03:23:20.150 --> 03:23:20.160 align:start position:0%
temporarily um uh
 
03:23:20.160 --> 03:23:21.349 align:start position:0%
temporarily um uh
we

03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:23:23.670 --> 03:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
decided that there was no
 
03:23:27.110 --> 03:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
need given what we had heard for a
 
03:23:29.590 --> 03:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
cooling off period uh and there are the
 
03:23:33.190 --> 03:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
way this is written this uh this uh the
 
03:23:34.950 --> 03:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
way this pro
 
03:23:38.790 --> 03:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
proposal uh sb92 is written it may well
 
03:23:41.429 --> 03:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
be unconstitutional to include a
 
03:23:44.150 --> 03:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
presumption against release for certain
 
03:23:44.160 --> 03:23:45.429 align:start position:0%
presumption against release for certain
crimes

03:23:45.429 --> 03:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
crimes
 
03:23:47.030 --> 03:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
so there's ways to do cooling off
 
03:23:49.030 --> 03:23:49.040 align:start position:0%
periods and there's other ways to do
 
03:23:51.190 --> 03:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
them some of them are unconstitutional
 
03:23:53.670 --> 03:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
which i think is a substantial concern
 
03:23:55.429 --> 03:23:55.439 align:start position:0%
with this when you build in a
 
03:23:58.550 --> 03:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
presumption against release
 
03:23:58.560 --> 03:23:59.349 align:start position:0%
presumption against release
so

03:23:59.349 --> 03:23:59.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:24:01.349 --> 03:24:01.359 align:start position:0%
yes there's no formal cooling off period
 
03:24:03.110 --> 03:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
and what the bail commission did but we
 
03:24:05.590 --> 03:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
thought about it we talked about it and
 
03:24:08.150 --> 03:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
we decided to focus better on bail
 
03:24:10.950 --> 03:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
commissioners and in fact uh i think sb
 
03:24:12.790 --> 03:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
uh if i'm not mistaken
 
03:24:15.429 --> 03:24:15.439 align:start position:0%
sb 490a
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
uh is making its way uh through the
 
03:24:19.590 --> 03:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
legislature which ensures that bail
 
03:24:26.550 --> 03:24:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:28.870 --> 03:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
yes i'm not interested in whether they
 
03:24:31.590 --> 03:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
get paid or not i think they need to be
 
03:24:34.469 --> 03:24:34.479 align:start position:0%
told that if a man is beating his wife
 
03:24:35.990 --> 03:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
after death
 
03:24:38.950 --> 03:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
he should not be released on
 
03:24:41.750 --> 03:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
permanent whatever it is pr
 
03:24:44.150 --> 03:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
because this is a very dangerous
 
03:24:47.590 --> 03:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
situation not only defects the wife but
 
03:24:50.630 --> 03:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
it also affects the children
 
03:24:52.469 --> 03:24:52.479 align:start position:0%
i agree i agree completely uh
 
03:24:54.630 --> 03:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
representative panalakas
 
03:24:58.150 --> 03:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
and i think that does not happen very
 
03:25:01.990 --> 03:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
very often at all and the court system
 
03:25:02.000 --> 03:25:02.710 align:start position:0%
very often at all and the court system
is

03:25:02.710 --> 03:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:25:05.510 --> 03:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
doing more and more to empower
 
03:25:07.510 --> 03:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioners so they
 
03:25:09.990 --> 03:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
understand that and i don't think i
 
03:25:11.670 --> 03:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
think it's too soon
 
03:25:13.349 --> 03:25:13.359 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
03:25:15.990 --> 03:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
make yet another very significant tweak
 
03:25:18.550 --> 03:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
uh to this legislation before we get
 
03:25:21.110 --> 03:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
better data as to how often that has
 
03:25:21.120 --> 03:25:22.710 align:start position:0%
better data as to how often that has
occurred

03:25:22.710 --> 03:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
occurred
 
03:25:28.550 --> 03:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:29.990 --> 03:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative newman you're recognized
 
03:25:32.070 --> 03:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
03:25:34.870 --> 03:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mister and thank you uh
 
03:25:37.030 --> 03:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
03:25:39.510 --> 03:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
um could could you just you say we don't
 
03:25:41.910 --> 03:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
have any data could you just uh
 
03:25:43.910 --> 03:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
address specifically
 
03:25:45.910 --> 03:25:45.920 align:start position:0%
how um the
 
03:25:49.030 --> 03:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
the bill has been changed that has what
 
03:25:50.710 --> 03:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
effect it has
 
03:25:54.309 --> 03:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
on the ability to give pr uh instead of
 
03:25:54.319 --> 03:25:55.269 align:start position:0%
on the ability to give pr uh instead of
bail

03:25:55.269 --> 03:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
bail
 
03:25:58.150 --> 03:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
um is that weakened or or improved by
 
03:26:01.349 --> 03:26:01.359 align:start position:0%
this bill or what uh
 
03:26:02.830 --> 03:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
it is
 
03:26:05.750 --> 03:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh it is
 
03:26:08.469 --> 03:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to find i'm trying to say
 
03:26:10.469 --> 03:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
two things at once so i'll try and pick
 
03:26:18.950 --> 03:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:21.750 --> 03:26:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:25.750 --> 03:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:27.750 --> 03:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry i'm not sure what
 
03:26:27.760 --> 03:26:28.790 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry i'm not sure what
happened

03:26:28.790 --> 03:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
happened
 
03:26:30.550 --> 03:26:30.560 align:start position:0%
it it takes a
 
03:26:33.269 --> 03:26:33.279 align:start position:0%
a group of ten or so crimes and
 
03:26:35.510 --> 03:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
categorically says
 
03:26:37.910 --> 03:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
you can you the presumption is you're
 
03:26:40.229 --> 03:26:40.239 align:start position:0%
not going to get pr bail until you see
 
03:26:43.110 --> 03:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh and and you've got to see a judge
 
03:26:43.120 --> 03:26:44.229 align:start position:0%
uh and and you've got to see a judge
um

03:26:44.229 --> 03:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:26:47.830 --> 03:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
so it takes away access uh
 
03:26:50.630 --> 03:26:50.640 align:start position:0%
in a substantial number of circumstances
 
03:26:54.150 --> 03:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
it will take away access to pr bail for
 
03:26:56.070 --> 03:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
those group of people and and one of the
 
03:26:58.950 --> 03:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
problems representative newman is
 
03:26:58.960 --> 03:27:01.030 align:start position:0%
problems representative newman is
that

03:27:01.030 --> 03:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:27:04.550 --> 03:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
categorically using categories of crimes
 
03:27:07.190 --> 03:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
is not an effective way to do it there
 
03:27:07.200 --> 03:27:08.630 align:start position:0%
is not an effective way to do it there
are

03:27:08.630 --> 03:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:27:11.910 --> 03:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
certain kinds of assaults that uh are
 
03:27:14.309 --> 03:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
frightening and dangerous and the huge
 
03:27:16.630 --> 03:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
majority of judges i've seen in my
 
03:27:19.190 --> 03:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
tracking how these prevail hearings work
 
03:27:19.200 --> 03:27:19.910 align:start position:0%
tracking how these prevail hearings work
out

03:27:19.910 --> 03:27:19.920 align:start position:0%
out
 
03:27:22.550 --> 03:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
will hold people for that kind of
 
03:27:24.469 --> 03:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
first-degree assault but then there's
 
03:27:26.150 --> 03:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
other kinds of first-degree assaults
 
03:27:28.630 --> 03:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
that are a unique circumstance there are
 
03:27:33.110 --> 03:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:34.710 --> 03:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
they're not you know they're not going
 
03:27:37.110 --> 03:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
to be dangerous and they'll lose their
 
03:27:41.429 --> 03:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:43.030 --> 03:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
before particularly if it's over a
 
03:27:45.510 --> 03:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
weekend which extends into
 
03:27:48.309 --> 03:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
so yeah that's the balance here there
 
03:27:51.429 --> 03:27:51.439 align:start position:0%
the original bail reform act and the two
 
03:27:53.670 --> 03:27:53.680 align:start position:0%
revisions that occurred
 
03:27:56.710 --> 03:27:56.720 align:start position:0%
have always focused on empowering the
 
03:27:58.870 --> 03:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
individual bail commissioner and the
 
03:28:02.790 --> 03:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
individual judge to decide each case on
 
03:28:05.110 --> 03:28:05.120 align:start position:0%
its merits
 
03:28:08.070 --> 03:28:08.080 align:start position:0%
and by categorizing
 
03:28:11.030 --> 03:28:11.040 align:start position:0%
a certain number of crimes it takes that
 
03:28:13.110 --> 03:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
power away from the bail commissioner
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
and the judge so yes it reduces
 
03:28:19.349 --> 03:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
access to pr bail when you categorize
 
03:28:19.359 --> 03:28:22.229 align:start position:0%
access to pr bail when you categorize
crimes

03:28:22.229 --> 03:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:27.840 --> 03:28:27.850 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:27.850 --> 03:28:29.190 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:28:29.190 --> 03:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:28:31.030 --> 03:28:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
03:28:31.040 --> 03:28:32.229 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

03:28:32.229 --> 03:28:32.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:34.309 --> 03:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
one thing is i think this this can be a
 
03:28:35.990 --> 03:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
little bit confusing for people who
 
03:28:38.229 --> 03:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
haven't been tracking with the with the
 
03:28:41.590 --> 03:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
journey of bail reform over time um
 
03:28:43.349 --> 03:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
one of the things that um
 
03:28:45.030 --> 03:28:45.040 align:start position:0%
you know that i'm wondering is if is if
 
03:28:46.710 --> 03:28:46.720 align:start position:0%
you might be able to
 
03:28:50.830 --> 03:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
uh fairly quickly take us through
 
03:28:53.590 --> 03:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
03:28:56.309 --> 03:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
kind of how we got to this place and and
 
03:28:59.590 --> 03:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
why these specific exemptions uh in your
 
03:29:02.150 --> 03:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
opinion uh
 
03:29:04.550 --> 03:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
really aren't uh
 
03:29:06.790 --> 03:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh aren't wise i guess at this point in
 
03:29:09.349 --> 03:29:09.359 align:start position:0%
time i i understand the focus on bail
 
03:29:10.950 --> 03:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
commissioners what i'm what i'm
 
03:29:12.950 --> 03:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
struggling with a little bit is that
 
03:29:15.750 --> 03:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
these do seem like very serious issues
 
03:29:15.760 --> 03:29:16.630 align:start position:0%
these do seem like very serious issues
um

03:29:16.630 --> 03:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:19.110 --> 03:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
and uh i just want to make sure that
 
03:29:20.710 --> 03:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
that i understand
 
03:29:23.750 --> 03:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh that we're not doing something uh
 
03:29:25.190 --> 03:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
that we're being as pragmatic as
 
03:29:27.830 --> 03:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
possible and that we're not just basing
 
03:29:30.070 --> 03:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
you know decisions on
 
03:29:32.070 --> 03:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
ideology or what we would like to see
 
03:29:34.550 --> 03:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
happen but we're really basing them on
 
03:29:36.870 --> 03:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the real world um i
 
03:29:41.030 --> 03:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
will uh uh uh uh chair abbas uh will i'm
 
03:29:43.190 --> 03:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
sure remind me uh i have difficulty
 
03:29:44.710 --> 03:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
doing pretty quickly
 
03:29:46.710 --> 03:29:46.720 align:start position:0%
okay but i'll do the best i can pretty
 
03:29:49.429 --> 03:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
quickly uh three three getting on four
 
03:29:52.550 --> 03:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
years ago now uh bail legislation was
 
03:29:52.560 --> 03:29:53.910 align:start position:0%
years ago now uh bail legislation was
introduced

03:29:53.910 --> 03:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
03:29:56.950 --> 03:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh to target primarily to target the
 
03:29:58.630 --> 03:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
problem of
 
03:30:01.830 --> 03:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
people um people who are being held on
 
03:30:05.910 --> 03:30:05.920 align:start position:0%
500 or 250 or a thousand dollars bail
 
03:30:08.710 --> 03:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
not because they were dangerous
 
03:30:10.950 --> 03:30:10.960 align:start position:0%
but because they just are there at risk
 
03:30:12.870 --> 03:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
of fleeing because they didn't have the
 
03:30:15.510 --> 03:30:15.520 align:start position:0%
money uh to meet that uh they were being
 
03:30:17.910 --> 03:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
held because of they were poor
 
03:30:20.150 --> 03:30:20.160 align:start position:0%
that was one of the primary
 
03:30:22.389 --> 03:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
focuses of the original bail reform
 
03:30:23.990 --> 03:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
accompanying that one of the other
 
03:30:25.510 --> 03:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
primary focuses
 
03:30:28.229 --> 03:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
was a concern for people who are a
 
03:30:30.950 --> 03:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
danger to themselves or others and we
 
03:30:33.990 --> 03:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
expanded in the original bailiff reform
 
03:30:37.190 --> 03:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
act uh the number of people to all
 
03:30:41.190 --> 03:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
crimes uh misdemeanors and felonies any
 
03:30:44.550 --> 03:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
crime a person could be held without
 
03:30:47.190 --> 03:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
bail if if the judge if it could be
 
03:30:49.510 --> 03:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
shown by clear and convincing evidence
 
03:30:52.229 --> 03:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
that they were dangerous that was a huge
 
03:30:55.269 --> 03:30:55.279 align:start position:0%
expansion of the opportunity
 
03:30:57.429 --> 03:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
or the power of a court for that matter
 
03:30:59.750 --> 03:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
a bail commissioner to hold people
 
03:31:01.429 --> 03:31:01.439 align:start position:0%
without bail
 
03:31:05.670 --> 03:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
and uh and that's been happening at uh a
 
03:31:08.950 --> 03:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
far greater rate best we can tell from
 
03:31:10.870 --> 03:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
the what little data we've been able to
 
03:31:13.510 --> 03:31:13.520 align:start position:0%
connect collect that's been happening
 
03:31:16.550 --> 03:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
since bail reform post bail reform a lot
 
03:31:18.790 --> 03:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
more people are being held without bail
 
03:31:22.389 --> 03:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
that were ever held without bail before
 
03:31:24.950 --> 03:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
so that's the original bail reform the
 
03:31:28.070 --> 03:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
original bail form act recognized that
 
03:31:30.309 --> 03:31:30.319 align:start position:0%
this was a significant shift in the way
 
03:31:31.910 --> 03:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
things had been done
 
03:31:33.990 --> 03:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
and therefore it put in place the bail
 
03:31:36.469 --> 03:31:36.479 align:start position:0%
commission to deal with
 
03:31:39.110 --> 03:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
expected tweaks that were needed
 
03:31:42.790 --> 03:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh and so the first bail uh reform uh
 
03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
bail commission made some tweaks that
 
03:31:48.630 --> 03:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
were passed i believe in the
 
03:31:50.389 --> 03:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
two thousand uh
 
03:31:50.399 --> 03:31:52.630 align:start position:0%
two thousand uh
uh

03:31:52.630 --> 03:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
eighteen 18 2019 session um
 
03:31:59.110 --> 03:31:59.120 align:start position:0%
that made it easier
 
03:32:01.670 --> 03:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
easier for prosecutors not to have to
 
03:32:01.680 --> 03:32:02.950 align:start position:0%
easier for prosecutors not to have to
call

03:32:02.950 --> 03:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
call
 
03:32:02.960 --> 03:32:03.990 align:start position:0%
call
victims

03:32:03.990 --> 03:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
victims
 
03:32:06.950 --> 03:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
that in the first instance empowered
 
03:32:09.750 --> 03:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
empowered judges
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
uh to uh to
 
03:32:15.670 --> 03:32:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh extend the detention for a brief
 
03:32:17.190 --> 03:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
03:32:19.830 --> 03:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
in order uh for the prosecution in the
 
03:32:21.910 --> 03:32:21.920 align:start position:0%
defense to collect evidence when a
 
03:32:24.710 --> 03:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
detention hearing uh when uh was being
 
03:32:24.720 --> 03:32:25.590 align:start position:0%
detention hearing uh when uh was being
held

03:32:25.590 --> 03:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
held
 
03:32:30.070 --> 03:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh and uh and it it tweaked the issue of
 
03:32:31.990 --> 03:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
how do we deal with failures to appear
 
03:32:34.630 --> 03:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
that was a source of great conversation
 
03:32:37.830 --> 03:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
so those tweets were passed in the 1819
 
03:32:37.840 --> 03:32:38.950 align:start position:0%
so those tweets were passed in the 1819
session

03:32:38.950 --> 03:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:32:41.110 --> 03:32:41.120 align:start position:0%
it also proposed that the bail
 
03:32:43.349 --> 03:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
commission continued to sit
 
03:32:46.070 --> 03:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
um the bail commission that went in
 
03:32:48.510 --> 03:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
place in the eight the
 
03:32:50.469 --> 03:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
1920 session
 
03:32:52.630 --> 03:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh was com a little different it had
 
03:32:55.349 --> 03:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
more police it had more prosecutors uh
 
03:32:56.469 --> 03:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
it had
 
03:32:59.030 --> 03:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh some jail superintendent
 
03:33:01.990 --> 03:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
um and it had a bail commissioner on it
 
03:33:04.550 --> 03:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh and it continued to look at the issue
 
03:33:07.030 --> 03:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
of failures to appear uh and it
 
03:33:08.630 --> 03:33:08.640 align:start position:0%
continued to look at the issue of
 
03:33:08.640 --> 03:33:09.990 align:start position:0%
continued to look at the issue of
dangerousness

03:33:09.990 --> 03:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
dangerousness
 
03:33:10.000 --> 03:33:10.870 align:start position:0%
dangerousness
and

03:33:10.870 --> 03:33:10.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:33:13.510 --> 03:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's where we ended up with what is
 
03:33:15.510 --> 03:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
now in effect that went into effect
 
03:33:18.389 --> 03:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
signed by the governor on june 17th last
 
03:33:21.190 --> 03:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
year went into effect september 17th 60
 
03:33:23.670 --> 03:33:23.680 align:start position:0%
days after
 
03:33:26.229 --> 03:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are now
 
03:33:26.239 --> 03:33:30.830 align:start position:0%
so that's where we are now
and

03:33:30.830 --> 03:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:35.030 --> 03:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
um i think we need to be careful about
 
03:33:37.349 --> 03:33:37.359 align:start position:0%
adopting changes
 
03:33:40.229 --> 03:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
that have not been vetted in
 
03:33:43.910 --> 03:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
the way the two previous uh waves of
 
03:33:46.229 --> 03:33:46.239 align:start position:0%
changes of tweaks have been vetted those
 
03:33:47.990 --> 03:33:48.000 align:start position:0%
were all the tweaks were comprehensively
 
03:33:51.750 --> 03:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
benefited with stakeholders from every
 
03:33:54.630 --> 03:33:54.640 align:start position:0%
every part of the spectrum uh
 
03:33:57.510 --> 03:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
talking about it in a very practical way
 
03:34:00.309 --> 03:34:00.319 align:start position:0%
and one of my difficulties with the
 
03:34:03.349 --> 03:34:03.359 align:start position:0%
process here is that these are tweaks
 
03:34:06.229 --> 03:34:06.239 align:start position:0%
that are not gonna do not get that kind
 
03:34:06.239 --> 03:34:14.710 align:start position:0%
that are not gonna do not get that kind
of

03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:16.150 --> 03:34:16.160 align:start position:0%
representative muse you're recognized
 
03:34:18.469 --> 03:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question yes just one
 
03:34:20.150 --> 03:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
one quick follow-up when you say that
 
03:34:22.870 --> 03:34:22.880 align:start position:0%
the changes uh haven't been vetted this
 
03:34:24.070 --> 03:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
time around
 
03:34:27.750 --> 03:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
um how is the process different between
 
03:34:29.910 --> 03:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
the set of tweaks that senator bradley
 
03:34:32.229 --> 03:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
is recommending and the set of tweaks
 
03:34:33.429 --> 03:34:33.439 align:start position:0%
that were implemented in the last
 
03:34:33.439 --> 03:34:34.790 align:start position:0%
that were implemented in the last
session

03:34:34.790 --> 03:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:34:34.800 --> 03:34:35.830 align:start position:0%
session
uh

03:34:35.830 --> 03:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:34:37.750 --> 03:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
the tweaks that senator which yeah
 
03:34:39.269 --> 03:34:39.279 align:start position:0%
they're more than tweaks this is the
 
03:34:41.190 --> 03:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
biggest change that's been proposed to
 
03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
bail commission the the the big changes
 
03:34:46.309 --> 03:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
that senator bradley is proposing uh
 
03:34:48.389 --> 03:34:48.399 align:start position:0%
have not gone through a conversation at
 
03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
a bail commission with all the
 
03:34:51.750 --> 03:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders present
 
03:34:54.150 --> 03:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
where we talk about language we propose
 
03:34:56.950 --> 03:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
changes a language gets changed we
 
03:35:00.550 --> 03:35:00.560 align:start position:0%
listen to witnesses we listen to police
 
03:35:02.389 --> 03:35:02.399 align:start position:0%
on the commission prosecutors who
 
03:35:04.550 --> 03:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
testify who are on the commission
 
03:35:04.560 --> 03:35:05.590 align:start position:0%
testify who are on the commission
uh

03:35:05.590 --> 03:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:08.150 --> 03:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
it just hasn't gone through that very
 
03:35:11.349 --> 03:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
solid comprehensive process
 
03:35:13.510 --> 03:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
and it needs to do that this is a tough
 
03:35:15.670 --> 03:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's a tough issue
 
03:35:17.750 --> 03:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh it is
 
03:35:19.190 --> 03:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
you know we're talking about public
 
03:35:21.349 --> 03:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
safety and we're talking about putting
 
03:35:23.910 --> 03:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
people in jail who have not been found
 
03:35:26.790 --> 03:35:26.800 align:start position:0%
guilty people who are presumed innocent
 
03:35:29.349 --> 03:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
for an extended period of time before
 
03:35:33.510 --> 03:35:33.520 align:start position:0%
trial and both of those are incredibly
 
03:35:36.790 --> 03:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
powerful instincts in each of us and
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
we need to be really careful before we
 
03:35:42.309 --> 03:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
make as dramatic a change as senator
 
03:35:44.870 --> 03:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
bradley is proposing
 
03:35:49.750 --> 03:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:51.429 --> 03:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
mr morgan you were recognized for a
 
03:35:51.439 --> 03:35:52.630 align:start position:0%
mr morgan you were recognized for a
question

03:35:52.630 --> 03:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:35:54.229 --> 03:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
03:35:56.469 --> 03:35:56.479 align:start position:0%
very much professor chair i'm
 
03:35:58.870 --> 03:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
i'm actually uh president of hopper you
 
03:36:01.510 --> 03:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
recognize red hopper myself from a
 
03:36:03.190 --> 03:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee he was reassigned
 
03:36:05.990 --> 03:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
this year but i'm just here for the day
 
03:36:08.469 --> 03:36:08.479 align:start position:0%
and i see i have to educate more
 
03:36:10.469 --> 03:36:10.479 align:start position:0%
how this works um
 
03:36:12.469 --> 03:36:12.479 align:start position:0%
so the bail commissioner
 
03:36:14.309 --> 03:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
the bill commissioner basically makes a
 
03:36:17.349 --> 03:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
uh initial decision so it seems to me
 
03:36:19.590 --> 03:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
just looking quickly at the rsa while i
 
03:36:21.429 --> 03:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
was listening is multitasking it looks
 
03:36:23.990 --> 03:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
like the state already can
 
03:36:24.950 --> 03:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
ask for
 
03:36:27.750 --> 03:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
a field bail commissioner's decision if
 
03:36:29.590 --> 03:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
they feel the person should not be
 
03:36:31.590 --> 03:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
released i'm not sure
 
03:36:42.790 --> 03:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:44.229 --> 03:36:44.239 align:start position:0%
before i got to the question so
 
03:36:46.229 --> 03:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
professor share is that a
 
03:36:48.070 --> 03:36:48.080 align:start position:0%
so you're saying your opinion this is a
 
03:36:50.389 --> 03:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
that's a sufficient remedy in case the
 
03:36:52.710 --> 03:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
bill commissioner makes a recommendation
 
03:36:53.590 --> 03:36:53.600 align:start position:0%
that it
 
03:36:56.469 --> 03:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
that the state disagrees with yeah the
 
03:36:59.190 --> 03:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner uh has all the powers
 
03:37:01.830 --> 03:37:01.840 align:start position:0%
that a judge has by statute they have
 
03:37:03.670 --> 03:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
all the powers that a judge has in
 
03:37:06.630 --> 03:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
setting bail and the police what's
 
03:37:09.269 --> 03:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
interesting is
 
03:37:10.870 --> 03:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
generally speaking the only person that
 
03:37:12.309 --> 03:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
appears in front of the bail
 
03:37:14.150 --> 03:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
commissioner in addition to the the
 
03:37:17.269 --> 03:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
suspect defendant is the police a police
 
03:37:17.279 --> 03:37:18.630 align:start position:0%

officer
 
03:37:20.710 --> 03:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
although now it turns out
 
03:37:20.720 --> 03:37:21.510 align:start position:0%
although now it turns out
they

03:37:21.510 --> 03:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
they
 
03:37:23.670 --> 03:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes county attorneys seem to be
 
03:37:25.110 --> 03:37:25.120 align:start position:0%
assistant county attorneys seem to be
 
03:37:27.429 --> 03:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
appearing but if the police or the
 
03:37:29.269 --> 03:37:29.279 align:start position:0%
county attorney disagrees with what the
 
03:37:31.269 --> 03:37:31.279 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner did
 
03:37:33.269 --> 03:37:33.279 align:start position:0%
they can um
 
03:37:35.990 --> 03:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
they can go into court that same day
 
03:37:37.590 --> 03:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
let's assume the bail commissioner set
 
03:37:39.510 --> 03:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
bail at two in the morning they can get
 
03:37:42.710 --> 03:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
into superior court at nine the next day
 
03:37:49.910 --> 03:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:51.590 --> 03:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
follow up mr chair yes
 
03:37:55.110 --> 03:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a follow-up
 
03:37:55.120 --> 03:37:56.309 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a follow-up
question

03:37:56.309 --> 03:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:37:58.389 --> 03:37:58.399 align:start position:0%
of course yes i understand
 
03:37:58.399 --> 03:37:59.590 align:start position:0%
of course yes i understand
um

03:37:59.590 --> 03:37:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:01.990 --> 03:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
are the bill commissioners necessarily
 
03:38:04.070 --> 03:38:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh more uh
 
03:38:06.389 --> 03:38:06.399 align:start position:0%
more lenient than the than the judges
 
03:38:08.070 --> 03:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
since of course
 
03:38:09.990 --> 03:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
even if we pass this bill the judge can
 
03:38:11.349 --> 03:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
still release somebody on personal
 
03:38:13.670 --> 03:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
recognizance or even
 
03:38:15.110 --> 03:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
on cash bail and then somebody can
 
03:38:17.030 --> 03:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
reoffend after paying the cash bail so
 
03:38:18.870 --> 03:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
are you are the bill commissioners more
 
03:38:20.790 --> 03:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
lenient than the judges
 
03:38:20.800 --> 03:38:21.670 align:start position:0%
lenient than the judges
uh

03:38:21.670 --> 03:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:38:23.750 --> 03:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know the the good law professor
 
03:38:26.550 --> 03:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
answer that's not useful is it depends
 
03:38:28.710 --> 03:38:28.720 align:start position:0%
uh you know i think uh just like some
 
03:38:30.630 --> 03:38:30.640 align:start position:0%
judges are more lenient or more strict
 
03:38:32.309 --> 03:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
than other judges the same is true with
 
03:38:35.590 --> 03:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners uh but i i emphasize
 
03:38:37.429 --> 03:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
once again they have all the powers of
 
03:38:39.750 --> 03:38:39.760 align:start position:0%
the judge and there's no defense lawyer
 
03:38:41.910 --> 03:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
there uh bark
 
03:38:44.389 --> 03:38:44.399 align:start position:0%
bengal commissioners here it's uh it's
 
03:38:46.870 --> 03:38:46.880 align:start position:0%
the police yeah and
 
03:38:49.269 --> 03:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
i i think we need
 
03:38:52.309 --> 03:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
to wait and and see how the efforts on
 
03:38:54.710 --> 03:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
part of the judiciary uh the district
 
03:38:56.710 --> 03:38:56.720 align:start position:0%

03:38:59.349 --> 03:38:59.359 align:start position:0%
uh go in terms of better educating uh
 
03:39:01.269 --> 03:39:01.279 align:start position:0%
the bail commissioners which they've
 
03:39:02.870 --> 03:39:02.880 align:start position:0%

03:39:04.790 --> 03:39:04.800 align:start position:0%

question

03:39:24.550 --> 03:39:24.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:39:24.560 --> 03:39:25.590 align:start position:0%
question

03:39:28.469 --> 03:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
am i hearing that a lot of the concerns
 
03:39:30.870 --> 03:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
that the police chief and the senator
 
03:39:33.910 --> 03:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
are holding could simply be
 
03:39:35.510 --> 03:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
we could simply be amending these
 
03:39:35.520 --> 03:39:36.469 align:start position:0%
we could simply be amending these
concerns

03:39:36.469 --> 03:39:36.479 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
03:39:36.479 --> 03:39:37.670 align:start position:0%
concerns
with

03:39:37.670 --> 03:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:39:39.830 --> 03:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
reforming uh
 
03:39:42.150 --> 03:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners education and making
 
03:39:45.269 --> 03:39:45.279 align:start position:0%
a mandatory education process
 
03:39:48.469 --> 03:39:48.479 align:start position:0%
there is a somewhat mandatory education
 
03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
process are already in place
 
03:39:50.399 --> 03:39:51.750 align:start position:0%
process are already in place
historically

03:39:51.750 --> 03:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
historically
 
03:39:55.590 --> 03:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
it was not used very aggressively uh
 
03:39:55.600 --> 03:39:56.790 align:start position:0%
it was not used very aggressively uh
uh

03:39:56.790 --> 03:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:39:59.910 --> 03:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
judge uh david david king the chief
 
03:39:59.920 --> 03:40:01.670 align:start position:0%
judge uh david david king the chief
judge

03:40:01.670 --> 03:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
judge
 
03:40:04.070 --> 03:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
of the circuit court system committed at
 
03:40:06.070 --> 03:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
front of the bail commission
 
03:40:07.910 --> 03:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
to being much more aggressive about the
 
03:40:11.590 --> 03:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
education process so i i'm always in
 
03:40:14.229 --> 03:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
favor of education of judges and bail
 
03:40:16.070 --> 03:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
commissioners and i would be very
 
03:40:18.389 --> 03:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
supportive of formalizing even more the
 
03:40:20.910 --> 03:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
education of bail commissioners
 
03:40:23.590 --> 03:40:23.600 align:start position:0%
rather than taking the dramatic step
 
03:40:33.269 --> 03:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:35.030 --> 03:40:35.040 align:start position:0%

knight to ask the question of the
 
03:44:50.239 --> 03:44:51.429 align:start position:0%
knight to ask the question of the
witness

03:44:51.429 --> 03:44:51.439 align:start position:0%
witness
 
03:44:51.439 --> 03:44:53.110 align:start position:0%
witness
okay

03:44:53.110 --> 03:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:44:56.950 --> 03:44:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um sir for taking my question
 
03:44:59.429 --> 03:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
what was the chief of police involvement
 
03:45:01.269 --> 03:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
in the past commission that the previous
 
03:45:04.150 --> 03:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
witness spoke about
 
03:45:05.910 --> 03:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
well again uh the there were
 
03:45:08.630 --> 03:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
representatives uh on that particular
 
03:45:11.269 --> 03:45:11.279 align:start position:0%
commission and um i wasn't on the
 
03:45:13.189 --> 03:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
commission but i can tell you
 
03:45:13.199 --> 03:45:14.070 align:start position:0%
commission but i can tell you
that

03:45:14.070 --> 03:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:45:16.550 --> 03:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
we had predicted that some of these
 
03:45:18.389 --> 03:45:18.399 align:start position:0%
consequences would occur
 
03:45:21.110 --> 03:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
uh but nevertheless as was previously
 
03:45:24.790 --> 03:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
testified to there was a compromise and
 
03:45:27.110 --> 03:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
again although we predicted that these
 
03:45:29.030 --> 03:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
incidences incidents would occur and
 
03:45:30.070 --> 03:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
they have
 
03:45:33.189 --> 03:45:33.199 align:start position:0%
um whether or not we look back and
 
03:45:34.790 --> 03:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
attempt to
 
03:45:36.630 --> 03:45:36.640 align:start position:0%
determine recriminations or who was
 
03:45:38.710 --> 03:45:38.720 align:start position:0%
present or not present
 
03:45:40.630 --> 03:45:40.640 align:start position:0%
i want to emphasize that the cases and
 
03:45:42.150 --> 03:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
victims are real
 
03:45:45.189 --> 03:45:45.199 align:start position:0%
uh today um and we need to address the
 
03:45:47.750 --> 03:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
victims of crime today
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
not about who was on what commission
 
03:45:52.389 --> 03:45:52.399 align:start position:0%
later on with all due respect
 
03:45:55.349 --> 03:45:55.359 align:start position:0%
great thank you i have a follow-up sir
 
03:45:57.110 --> 03:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
representative you were recognized for a
 
03:45:58.630 --> 03:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
follow-up question
 
03:46:00.870 --> 03:46:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have the data
 
03:46:03.510 --> 03:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
of how things were conducted before the
 
03:46:06.710 --> 03:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
previous law wasn't enacted let's say
 
03:46:08.710 --> 03:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
all these cases you spoke about i want
 
03:46:10.710 --> 03:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
to know how many have happened since we
 
03:46:12.950 --> 03:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
passed this last year's bail reform and
 
03:46:14.950 --> 03:46:14.960 align:start position:0%
how many that have happened before then
 
03:46:16.550 --> 03:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
because you want to have the same law
 
03:46:18.309 --> 03:46:18.319 align:start position:0%
come back i want to see if the numbers
 
03:46:21.510 --> 03:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:23.030 --> 03:46:23.040 align:start position:0%
i wish i could tell you that it would be
 
03:46:25.349 --> 03:46:25.359 align:start position:0%
an easy thing to do to be able to make
 
03:46:29.349 --> 03:46:29.359 align:start position:0%
that data call um you have 177 or more
 
03:46:31.110 --> 03:46:31.120 align:start position:0%
police departments with various records
 
03:46:33.269 --> 03:46:33.279 align:start position:0%
management systems and the state system
 
03:46:35.110 --> 03:46:35.120 align:start position:0%
that makes it very difficult to be able
 
03:46:37.030 --> 03:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
to determine the answers to that
 
03:46:38.950 --> 03:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
question but i can tell you that in a
 
03:46:41.590 --> 03:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
data call and just from cases that we
 
03:46:42.950 --> 03:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
receive from the chiefs of police
 
03:46:44.630 --> 03:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
throughout the state these are recent
 
03:46:46.710 --> 03:46:46.720 align:start position:0%
cases these are cases that are occurring
 
03:46:48.630 --> 03:46:48.640 align:start position:0%
each and every day and as the senator
 
03:46:50.790 --> 03:46:50.800 align:start position:0%
indicated these are cases that
 
03:46:54.550 --> 03:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
surgically uh um focus on only the most
 
03:46:57.269 --> 03:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
violent criminals um on the streets of
 
03:46:59.429 --> 03:46:59.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire each and every day so it
 
03:47:01.429 --> 03:47:01.439 align:start position:0%
should be easy to get that data of how
 
03:47:03.030 --> 03:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
many of you are not recognized for a
 
03:47:11.429 --> 03:47:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:12.790 --> 03:47:12.800 align:start position:0%
representative newman you're right you
 
03:47:15.830 --> 03:47:15.840 align:start position:0%
were recognized for a question
 
03:47:17.830 --> 03:47:17.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you chief
 
03:47:17.840 --> 03:47:18.630 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you chief
um

03:47:18.630 --> 03:47:18.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:21.030 --> 03:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
i just have a basic question given that
 
03:47:24.150 --> 03:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
it's up to 72 hours here and
 
03:47:26.150 --> 03:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
it involves it sounds like the bail
 
03:47:28.229 --> 03:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
commissioner and the court
 
03:47:30.389 --> 03:47:30.399 align:start position:0%
um could you just
 
03:47:33.590 --> 03:47:33.600 align:start position:0%
tell us what's different
 
03:47:35.910 --> 03:47:35.920 align:start position:0%
what actually would be different if this
 
03:47:37.990 --> 03:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
law were to pass
 
03:47:40.389 --> 03:47:40.399 align:start position:0%
than in all of that list of cases you
 
03:47:40.399 --> 03:47:41.110 align:start position:0%
than in all of that list of cases you
you

03:47:41.110 --> 03:47:41.120 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:47:43.030 --> 03:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh told us about
 
03:47:43.040 --> 03:47:44.070 align:start position:0%
uh told us about
where

03:47:44.070 --> 03:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
where
 
03:47:45.990 --> 03:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
either a judge or a bail commissioner
 
03:47:46.000 --> 03:47:47.189 align:start position:0%
either a judge or a bail commissioner
released

03:47:47.189 --> 03:47:47.199 align:start position:0%
released
 
03:47:48.469 --> 03:47:48.479 align:start position:0%
a person
 
03:47:51.349 --> 03:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
and how this bill would constrain the
 
03:47:53.910 --> 03:47:53.920 align:start position:0%
release of that person if it were passed
 
03:47:55.269 --> 03:47:55.279 align:start position:0%
i'm having a hard time seeing the
 
03:47:55.279 --> 03:47:57.189 align:start position:0%
i'm having a hard time seeing the
difference

03:47:57.189 --> 03:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
difference
 
03:47:58.950 --> 03:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
03:48:02.229 --> 03:48:02.239 align:start position:0%
and it's very simple bail commissioners
 
03:48:04.710 --> 03:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
have a very wide degree of latitude they
 
03:48:07.110 --> 03:48:07.120 align:start position:0%
take their instructions from judges and
 
03:48:09.429 --> 03:48:09.439 align:start position:0%
they may apply those uh the way that
 
03:48:12.070 --> 03:48:12.080 align:start position:0%
they see fit and despite the urgings of
 
03:48:13.750 --> 03:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
police officers at the scene bail
 
03:48:15.269 --> 03:48:15.279 align:start position:0%
commissioners as you've seen in these
 
03:48:17.750 --> 03:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
cases have continually released people
 
03:48:20.870 --> 03:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
who have been arrested with very clear
 
03:48:22.870 --> 03:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
evidence beyond probable cause that they
 
03:48:25.830 --> 03:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
engage in a violent crime and so the
 
03:48:28.389 --> 03:48:28.399 align:start position:0%
changes in this particular bill
 
03:48:28.399 --> 03:48:29.269 align:start position:0%
changes in this particular bill
would

03:48:29.269 --> 03:48:29.279 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
require that there be an argument a
 
03:48:34.630 --> 03:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
legal argument not necessarily 72 hours
 
03:48:36.309 --> 03:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
it could occur the next day if it
 
03:48:38.309 --> 03:48:38.319 align:start position:0%
occurred during the weekday the 72-hour
 
03:48:40.469 --> 03:48:40.479 align:start position:0%
provision is to take into account a
 
03:48:42.389 --> 03:48:42.399 align:start position:0%
weekend and a holiday so this could
 
03:48:45.590 --> 03:48:45.600 align:start position:0%
occur within 12 hours let's say of the
 
03:48:47.990 --> 03:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
act occurring or even less but let's
 
03:48:50.550 --> 03:48:50.560 align:start position:0%
talk about the fact that this uh is an
 
03:48:54.070 --> 03:48:54.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a legal argument to be
 
03:48:56.550 --> 03:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
made before a judge with better
 
03:48:59.110 --> 03:48:59.120 align:start position:0%
information from both the defense
 
03:49:01.750 --> 03:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
attorney as well as the assistant county
 
03:49:04.309 --> 03:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
attorney these are serious crimes these
 
03:49:07.189 --> 03:49:07.199 align:start position:0%
are a felony crimes that are going to be
 
03:49:08.870 --> 03:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
prosecuted by
 
03:49:11.030 --> 03:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
the superior by the assistant county
 
03:49:13.349 --> 03:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
attorneys not by police prosecutors
 
03:49:15.030 --> 03:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
these are serious felony crimes and
 
03:49:17.750 --> 03:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
let's have that um argument before a
 
03:49:21.110 --> 03:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
judge in a courtroom so that the um
 
03:49:23.189 --> 03:49:23.199 align:start position:0%
neutral magistrate can make the proper
 
03:49:25.670 --> 03:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether or not to release
 
03:49:27.429 --> 03:49:27.439 align:start position:0%
someone who shot up the streets of
 
03:49:27.439 --> 03:49:32.790 align:start position:0%
someone who shot up the streets of
manchester

03:49:32.790 --> 03:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:33.830 --> 03:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative newman you were
 
03:49:37.349 --> 03:49:37.359 align:start position:0%
recognized for a follow-up question
 
03:49:39.429 --> 03:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
thank you uh mr chair uh
 
03:49:41.510 --> 03:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
the follow-up question is
 
03:49:44.309 --> 03:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
were all of the cases that you told us
 
03:49:46.870 --> 03:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
about um as a result of the bail
 
03:49:46.880 --> 03:49:48.309 align:start position:0%
about um as a result of the bail
commissioner

03:49:48.309 --> 03:49:48.319 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
03:49:50.790 --> 03:49:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh doing the release uh
 
03:49:52.870 --> 03:49:52.880 align:start position:0%
or was were some of them released by
 
03:49:54.550 --> 03:49:54.560 align:start position:0%
judges and would that have an effect on
 
03:49:57.590 --> 03:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
the judge's ability to give vr
 
03:50:00.229 --> 03:50:00.239 align:start position:0%
would it be any different
 
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
the judge is the final arbiter of making
 
03:50:04.630 --> 03:50:04.640 align:start position:0%
a determination as to whether or not an
 
03:50:04.640 --> 03:50:06.309 align:start position:0%
a determination as to whether or not an
individual

03:50:06.309 --> 03:50:06.319 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:50:08.469 --> 03:50:08.479 align:start position:0%
is a danger to the community or a risk
 
03:50:11.429 --> 03:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
of flight so in the final analysis it's
 
03:50:14.389 --> 03:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
the neutral magistrate that we want that
 
03:50:16.630 --> 03:50:16.640 align:start position:0%
here that the proponents of this bill
 
03:50:18.630 --> 03:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
want to make the decision the neutral
 
03:50:21.269 --> 03:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
magistrate not a bail commissioner
 
03:50:23.590 --> 03:50:23.600 align:start position:0%
without all the facts
 
03:50:25.990 --> 03:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
and as to the dates
 
03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
again we do have some dates i'm not
 
03:50:30.229 --> 03:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
prepared to provide those dates because
 
03:50:32.309 --> 03:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
they're in another data system but if
 
03:50:33.990 --> 03:50:34.000 align:start position:0%
you need those dates we could probably
 
03:50:36.070 --> 03:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
go back and try to find the dates to the
 
03:50:38.790 --> 03:50:38.800 align:start position:0%
cases that we do have
 
03:50:40.710 --> 03:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
well that's fine i was just
 
03:50:42.070 --> 03:50:42.080 align:start position:0%
worried about the difference between the
 
03:50:50.150 --> 03:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:51.590 --> 03:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative muse
 
03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a question
 
03:50:54.479 --> 03:50:55.269 align:start position:0%
you're recognized for a question
yes

03:50:55.269 --> 03:50:55.279 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:50:57.269 --> 03:50:57.279 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question my
 
03:50:59.750 --> 03:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is that bail commissioners
 
03:50:59.760 --> 03:51:01.030 align:start position:0%
understanding is that bail commissioners
um

03:51:01.030 --> 03:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:02.710 --> 03:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
basically are
 
03:51:02.720 --> 03:51:03.670 align:start position:0%
basically are
uh

03:51:03.670 --> 03:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:51:06.150 --> 03:51:06.160 align:start position:0%
are instructed not to release people uh
 
03:51:07.830 --> 03:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
who may be a danger to themselves and
 
03:51:10.309 --> 03:51:10.319 align:start position:0%
others and that's basically our current
 
03:51:10.319 --> 03:51:11.269 align:start position:0%
others and that's basically our current
law

03:51:11.269 --> 03:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:51:14.309 --> 03:51:14.319 align:start position:0%
so it it seems like there's obviously a
 
03:51:14.319 --> 03:51:15.670 align:start position:0%
so it it seems like there's obviously a
failure

03:51:15.670 --> 03:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
failure
 
03:51:15.680 --> 03:51:17.590 align:start position:0%
failure
somewhere

03:51:17.590 --> 03:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
03:51:17.600 --> 03:51:19.030 align:start position:0%
somewhere
and

03:51:19.030 --> 03:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:22.309 --> 03:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
attorney share alluded to the fact that
 
03:51:24.950 --> 03:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
training has been inconsistent with with
 
03:51:27.910 --> 03:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
bail commissioners
 
03:51:29.590 --> 03:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
what it seems like this law would do is
 
03:51:32.870 --> 03:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
to take certain cases out of their hands
 
03:51:32.880 --> 03:51:33.670 align:start position:0%
to take certain cases out of their hands
um

03:51:33.670 --> 03:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:35.990 --> 03:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
i i guess what i'm what i'm curious
 
03:51:38.550 --> 03:51:38.560 align:start position:0%
about is what your experience has been
 
03:51:40.950 --> 03:51:40.960 align:start position:0%
in general on cases like this when you
 
03:51:44.070 --> 03:51:44.080 align:start position:0%
work with bail commissioners are cases
 
03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
like this um really a very very minor
 
03:51:50.550 --> 03:51:50.560 align:start position:0%
exception to the rule
 
03:51:53.030 --> 03:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh because i i think sometimes it sounds
 
03:51:55.990 --> 03:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
like you know these cases are happening
 
03:51:57.429 --> 03:51:57.439 align:start position:0%
you know all the time they're happening
 
03:51:58.870 --> 03:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
left and right they're happening more
 
03:52:00.710 --> 03:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
often than not
 
03:52:03.030 --> 03:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
but kind of getting to what i i think
 
03:52:04.630 --> 03:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
representative knight was getting at
 
03:52:07.030 --> 03:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
what i'm trying to get a better and
 
03:52:09.030 --> 03:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
clearer understanding of is
 
03:52:12.150 --> 03:52:12.160 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the of these types of
 
03:52:12.160 --> 03:52:13.189 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the of these types of
cases

03:52:13.189 --> 03:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
cases
 
03:52:15.590 --> 03:52:15.600 align:start position:0%
um you know to the examples that you're
 
03:52:18.150 --> 03:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
giving really sort of fallen into you
 
03:52:21.030 --> 03:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
know how prevalent are they
 
03:52:24.229 --> 03:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
well um i don't think anyone is equipped
 
03:52:26.950 --> 03:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
um today
 
03:52:29.110 --> 03:52:29.120 align:start position:0%
to provide the answer with respect to
 
03:52:31.110 --> 03:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
the percentage
 
03:52:33.670 --> 03:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
just the number of cases that came to
 
03:52:36.070 --> 03:52:36.080 align:start position:0%
the chiefs association from various
 
03:52:37.990 --> 03:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
chiefs throughout the state
 
03:52:40.550 --> 03:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
and these are only a smattering of those
 
03:52:43.110 --> 03:52:43.120 align:start position:0%
cases uh there are more
 
03:52:45.830 --> 03:52:45.840 align:start position:0%
but the reality is uh and thank you for
 
03:52:48.550 --> 03:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
the question let us focus on the
 
03:52:52.070 --> 03:52:52.080 align:start position:0%
severity of the charge in the crimes
 
03:52:54.870 --> 03:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
involved hopefully we're talking about a
 
03:52:58.229 --> 03:52:58.239 align:start position:0%
very small percentage of cases overall
 
03:53:01.429 --> 03:53:01.439 align:start position:0%
and they probably are when we talk about
 
03:53:04.389 --> 03:53:04.399 align:start position:0%
the total number of a and b felony cases
 
03:53:07.110 --> 03:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
charged and a and b misdemeanor cases
 
03:53:09.910 --> 03:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
charged every single day let us hope in
 
03:53:12.389 --> 03:53:12.399 align:start position:0%
the granite state that these are very
 
03:53:15.510 --> 03:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
few cases but again these are the cases
 
03:53:18.469 --> 03:53:18.479 align:start position:0%
that involve serious bodily injury and
 
03:53:21.189 --> 03:53:21.199 align:start position:0%
potential death to victims and that is
 
03:53:24.710 --> 03:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
the difference we don't want this to
 
03:53:27.830 --> 03:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
occur anymore today tomorrow or the next
 
03:53:29.670 --> 03:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
day when we have victims that are
 
03:53:33.269 --> 03:53:33.279 align:start position:0%
brutalized shot at on and nearly killed
 
03:53:35.349 --> 03:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
on on the streets of the granite state
 
03:53:37.429 --> 03:53:37.439 align:start position:0%
it's about the severity of the crime and
 
03:53:38.950 --> 03:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
the victims
 
03:53:48.070 --> 03:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:48.080 --> 03:53:49.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:53:49.510 --> 03:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:53:51.670 --> 03:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
you were recognized for a question
 
03:53:53.349 --> 03:53:53.359 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair thank you
 
03:53:56.309 --> 03:53:56.319 align:start position:0%
much for your chief i asked um attorney
 
03:53:58.070 --> 03:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
share a similar question it looks like
 
03:54:00.389 --> 03:54:00.399 align:start position:0%
there there already is a uh at the time
 
03:54:02.229 --> 03:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
of the bail commissioners
 
03:54:04.070 --> 03:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
hearing an opportunity for the state
 
03:54:06.309 --> 03:54:06.319 align:start position:0%
which i assume would normally
 
03:54:07.510 --> 03:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
mean the uh
 
03:54:10.229 --> 03:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
police officer to uh appeal the hearing
 
03:54:12.630 --> 03:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
so why is and then um then the judge
 
03:54:14.950 --> 03:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
would would get it uh shortly thereafter
 
03:54:15.910 --> 03:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
so why
 
03:54:19.189 --> 03:54:19.199 align:start position:0%
why isn't the existing remedy sufficient
 
03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:54:21.990 --> 03:54:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question well there's
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
a bit of a misnomer there because a bail
 
03:54:25.910 --> 03:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner walks into the bedford
 
03:54:28.070 --> 03:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
police station at 2 a.m
 
03:54:29.910 --> 03:54:29.920 align:start position:0%
and makes a determination to release
 
03:54:32.389 --> 03:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
someone on pr bail and that person walks
 
03:54:34.469 --> 03:54:34.479 align:start position:0%
out the door one case the person walked
 
03:54:35.830 --> 03:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
out the door and threw a brick through
 
03:54:37.030 --> 03:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
our window
 
03:54:38.950 --> 03:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
and was rearrested again
 
03:54:41.189 --> 03:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
um so there is no hearing with the bail
 
03:54:42.710 --> 03:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner the bail commissioners
 
03:54:45.269 --> 03:54:45.279 align:start position:0%
independently make a determination with
 
03:54:47.510 --> 03:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
respect to whether or not the subject
 
03:54:50.150 --> 03:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
should be released or presented on bail
 
03:54:51.429 --> 03:54:51.439 align:start position:0%
or not
 
03:54:54.070 --> 03:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes they may or may not
 
03:54:56.229 --> 03:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
listen to
 
03:54:56.239 --> 03:54:57.189 align:start position:0%
listen to
the

03:54:57.189 --> 03:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:54:59.670 --> 03:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
the request from the officer in charge
 
03:55:01.670 --> 03:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
typically a sergeant or trooper or
 
03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
deputy sheriff or a police officer
 
03:55:06.070 --> 03:55:06.080 align:start position:0%
or not it's not a hearing
 
03:55:08.790 --> 03:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
they make those decisions independently
 
03:55:10.630 --> 03:55:10.640 align:start position:0%
all law enforcement and the proponents
 
03:55:13.110 --> 03:55:13.120 align:start position:0%
of this bill are asking for is for the
 
03:55:15.110 --> 03:55:15.120 align:start position:0%
most serious crimes in which serious
 
03:55:18.309 --> 03:55:18.319 align:start position:0%
bodily injury or death are in play to
 
03:55:20.950 --> 03:55:20.960 align:start position:0%
reserve that judgment before a judge a
 
03:55:23.510 --> 03:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
neutral magistrate as soon as possible
 
03:55:26.469 --> 03:55:26.479 align:start position:0%
but no later than 72 hours
 
03:55:40.830 --> 03:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:42.790 --> 03:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
representative fine knight
 
03:55:45.750 --> 03:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
you are recognized to ask a question
 
03:55:48.150 --> 03:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
thank you so much i'm just having a
 
03:55:51.269 --> 03:55:51.279 align:start position:0%
really hard time understanding if crimes
 
03:55:53.110 --> 03:55:53.120 align:start position:0%
that are committed in our state are so
 
03:55:53.120 --> 03:55:54.150 align:start position:0%
that are committed in our state are so
heinous

03:55:54.150 --> 03:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
heinous
 
03:55:56.229 --> 03:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
they're not being documented for data
 
03:55:58.070 --> 03:55:58.080 align:start position:0%
purposes that makes me really troubled
 
03:56:00.790 --> 03:56:00.800 align:start position:0%
can you speak about that
 
03:56:02.309 --> 03:56:02.319 align:start position:0%
i'm sure they're being documented the
 
03:56:04.150 --> 03:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
question is how do we get that
 
03:56:06.550 --> 03:56:06.560 align:start position:0%
information out of whatever database it
 
03:56:09.510 --> 03:56:09.520 align:start position:0%
may be in um and so to be able to
 
03:56:11.510 --> 03:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
determine how many people
 
03:56:13.670 --> 03:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
have been rearrested on breach of bail
 
03:56:15.670 --> 03:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
charges or how many people have been
 
03:56:19.349 --> 03:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
arrested for assault one or uh robbery
 
03:56:21.670 --> 03:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
or assault with a deadly weapon would
 
03:56:23.830 --> 03:56:23.840 align:start position:0%
require a data call search
 
03:56:26.389 --> 03:56:26.399 align:start position:0%
of a statewide database and then a hand
 
03:56:28.389 --> 03:56:28.399 align:start position:0%
search of those particular
 
03:56:31.110 --> 03:56:31.120 align:start position:0%
cases to determine um
 
03:56:32.870 --> 03:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not the individual was
 
03:56:36.229 --> 03:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
released on personal recognizance and if
 
03:56:39.030 --> 03:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
so who made that decision to release the
 
03:56:39.040 --> 03:56:40.950 align:start position:0%
so who made that decision to release the
individual

03:56:40.950 --> 03:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
individual
 
03:56:43.670 --> 03:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
it would be great if we had one central
 
03:56:45.910 --> 03:56:45.920 align:start position:0%
records management system
 
03:56:47.510 --> 03:56:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire with the
 
03:56:49.830 --> 03:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
granularity to be able to
 
03:56:52.630 --> 03:56:52.640 align:start position:0%
pull that information out quickly we
 
03:56:54.950 --> 03:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
don't have it i'm not aware of it we
 
03:56:56.229 --> 03:56:56.239 align:start position:0%
don't we don't even have it here in
 
03:56:57.590 --> 03:56:57.600 align:start position:0%
bedford we would have to do a hand
 
03:56:59.429 --> 03:56:59.439 align:start position:0%
search here of our own records
 
03:57:01.510 --> 03:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
management system to be able to pull
 
03:57:04.070 --> 03:57:04.080 align:start position:0%
that out going into the court system
 
03:57:05.910 --> 03:57:05.920 align:start position:0%
would even be worse because they have
 
03:57:09.830 --> 03:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:11.349 --> 03:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
management systems in the county
 
03:57:13.110 --> 03:57:13.120 align:start position:0%
attorney's office for example here in
 
03:57:14.790 --> 03:57:14.800 align:start position:0%
hillsborough which handles the most
 
03:57:16.870 --> 03:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
cases in the state it would require a
 
03:57:16.880 --> 03:57:18.830 align:start position:0%
cases in the state it would require a
hand

03:57:18.830 --> 03:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
hand
 
03:57:21.910 --> 03:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
search you so much for answering all
 
03:57:24.150 --> 03:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
that that makes it a lot clearer that we
 
03:57:25.990 --> 03:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
have more of
 
03:57:27.750 --> 03:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
no you're not you're not recognized to
 
03:57:29.260 --> 03:57:29.270 align:start position:0%
make a statement
 
03:57:29.270 --> 03:57:33.990 align:start position:0%
make a statement

represent remember representative
 
03:57:43.110 --> 03:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
i'm recognizing your last follow-up
 
03:57:45.030 --> 03:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
question this way thank you so much
 
03:57:47.990 --> 03:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you officer for explaining our
 
03:57:50.309 --> 03:57:50.319 align:start position:0%
technology issues so what i'm hearing is
 
03:57:53.189 --> 03:57:53.199 align:start position:0%
we shouldn't be putting people's lives
 
03:57:55.349 --> 03:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
and changing the constitution we should
 
03:57:57.590 --> 03:57:57.600 align:start position:0%
be updating our technology so we can
 
03:58:00.550 --> 03:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
track this data properly across the
 
03:58:06.550 --> 03:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:08.389 --> 03:58:08.399 align:start position:0%
is that true we should be focusing on
 
03:58:10.469 --> 03:58:10.479 align:start position:0%
updating our technology
 
03:58:13.189 --> 03:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
in our police systems versus changing
 
03:58:17.429 --> 03:58:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:19.830 --> 03:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
with all due respect representative
 
03:58:21.910 --> 03:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
technology has nothing to do with the
 
03:58:24.070 --> 03:58:24.080 align:start position:0%
safety of individuals in this particular
 
03:58:26.389 --> 03:58:26.399 align:start position:0%
case it all has to do with making the
 
03:58:28.630 --> 03:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
right decision when an individual has
 
03:58:30.710 --> 03:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
been charged with a crime that could
 
03:58:32.309 --> 03:58:32.319 align:start position:0%
result in the death
 
03:58:34.389 --> 03:58:34.399 align:start position:0%
of someone else here in the grand states
 
03:58:36.389 --> 03:58:36.399 align:start position:0%
that's what this case is about
 
03:58:38.630 --> 03:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
again victims are not anecdotes they are
 
03:58:48.630 --> 03:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:50.150 --> 03:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
see no hands raised i want to thank the
 
03:58:51.750 --> 03:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
witness for his testimony
 
03:58:59.670 --> 03:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:01.269 --> 03:59:01.279 align:start position:0%

chief of police for the nashua police
 
03:59:20.229 --> 03:59:20.239 align:start position:0%
department i'm here today representing
 
03:59:22.309 --> 03:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
the association for the chiefs of police
 
03:59:24.389 --> 03:59:24.399 align:start position:0%
in the nashville police department
 
03:59:26.870 --> 03:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
i will be brief i would i'm going to try
 
03:59:29.030 --> 03:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
not to reiterate a lot of what chief
 
03:59:30.790 --> 03:59:30.800 align:start position:0%
profonsky just said
 
03:59:32.870 --> 03:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to give to you a perspective
 
03:59:34.870 --> 03:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
of what the reality is that law
 
03:59:36.790 --> 03:59:36.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement has to deal with as opposed
 
03:59:38.950 --> 03:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
to the academic
 
03:59:40.790 --> 03:59:40.800 align:start position:0%
thoughts out there as to how the system
 
03:59:41.830 --> 03:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
is working
 
03:59:44.710 --> 03:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh in december of 2020 which was several
 
03:59:46.389 --> 03:59:46.399 align:start position:0%
months after the june
 
03:59:48.550 --> 03:59:48.560 align:start position:0%
legislation changes nashville police
 
03:59:50.229 --> 03:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
department received a call for domestic
 
03:59:52.469 --> 03:59:52.479 align:start position:0%
assault that was in progress the suspect
 
03:59:53.990 --> 03:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
had showed up at a female's house with a
 
03:59:56.150 --> 03:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
gun and proceeded to force his entry in
 
03:59:58.870 --> 03:59:58.880 align:start position:0%
there and assaulted her several times we
 
04:00:00.389 --> 04:00:00.399 align:start position:0%
placed him under arrest and secured the
 
04:00:02.150 --> 04:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
firearm as evidence
 
04:00:04.710 --> 04:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
after we gave assistance to the victim
 
04:00:06.389 --> 04:00:06.399 align:start position:0%
and we gave her a lethality assessment
 
04:00:08.389 --> 04:00:08.399 align:start position:0%
protocol which is best practice for
 
04:00:10.150 --> 04:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
domestic violence victims
 
04:00:12.389 --> 04:00:12.399 align:start position:0%
she checked off every box every single
 
04:00:14.150 --> 04:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
box indicating that she was the highest
 
04:00:16.229 --> 04:00:16.239 align:start position:0%
risk of danger from the suspect
 
04:00:18.469 --> 04:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
so we brought him in for booking
 
04:00:20.070 --> 04:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
we tried three times to convince the
 
04:00:21.830 --> 04:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner that this person was
 
04:00:23.830 --> 04:00:23.840 align:start position:0%
dangerous and couldn't be released three
 
04:00:26.070 --> 04:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
times we explained to him what the what
 
04:00:28.389 --> 04:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
his past was and how she triggered on
 
04:00:30.870 --> 04:00:30.880 align:start position:0%
the lap forms he didn't want to hear it
 
04:00:32.630 --> 04:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
he said that it doesn't change anything
 
04:00:33.830 --> 04:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
and he was released on two hundred
 
04:00:36.790 --> 04:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
dollars bail this suspect then got out
 
04:00:38.550 --> 04:00:38.560 align:start position:0%
returned to the victim's house forced
 
04:00:40.630 --> 04:00:40.640 align:start position:0%
his way in and proceeded to beat her and
 
04:00:42.630 --> 04:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
rape her for the remainder of the night
 
04:00:44.550 --> 04:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
after he was again arrested he made full
 
04:00:46.710 --> 04:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
admissions to these charges so i'm here
 
04:00:49.750 --> 04:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
to give you a concrete example of
 
04:00:51.030 --> 04:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
you know i'm hearing a lot about
 
04:00:52.950 --> 04:00:52.960 align:start position:0%
protecting the citizens and protecting
 
04:00:54.870 --> 04:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
everybody's rights well i had to look at
 
04:00:56.309 --> 04:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
this young lady in the eye and explain
 
04:00:58.309 --> 04:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
to her why she was raped after we didn't
 
04:01:00.070 --> 04:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
keep this person in jail and i'm
 
04:01:02.870 --> 04:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
struggling with listening to um the
 
04:01:04.870 --> 04:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
system is working fine and we need more
 
04:01:07.110 --> 04:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
time we need more data i believe that uh
 
04:01:10.150 --> 04:01:10.160 align:start position:0%
we owe it to the sick to the victims um
 
04:01:12.870 --> 04:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
to protect them and i think law
 
04:01:14.790 --> 04:01:14.800 align:start position:0%
enforcement has
 
04:01:16.309 --> 04:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
has to be respected in the fact that
 
04:01:18.389 --> 04:01:18.399 align:start position:0%
they're on scene they have a
 
04:01:19.990 --> 04:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
an idea of what actually happened they
 
04:01:21.990 --> 04:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
can articulate why these people need to
 
04:01:23.750 --> 04:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
be in the build commissioners they show
 
04:01:25.910 --> 04:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
up when they're called they look at a
 
04:01:27.750 --> 04:01:27.760 align:start position:0%
anything if at all and then they release
 
04:01:29.590 --> 04:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
them and i struggle with them being able
 
04:01:31.590 --> 04:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
to do that i'm happy to entertain any
 
04:01:37.030 --> 04:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:38.550 --> 04:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
representative true you're recognized
 
04:01:39.670 --> 04:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
04:01:41.030 --> 04:01:41.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:01:42.550 --> 04:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:01:44.950 --> 04:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
certainly not denying that the example's
 
04:01:46.870 --> 04:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
given are horrible examples but in the
 
04:01:49.590 --> 04:01:49.600 align:start position:0%
example you just gave
 
04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
seems like the bail commissioner made a
 
04:01:53.110 --> 04:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
bad decision
 
04:01:55.590 --> 04:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
was there any
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
follow-up penalty or assessment to the
 
04:02:01.510 --> 04:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
bail commissioner for that bad decision
 
04:02:03.670 --> 04:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
no there is there is not and nor has
 
04:02:07.189 --> 04:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
there been ever any um
 
04:02:09.670 --> 04:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
uh disciplinary issues or re-education
 
04:02:11.030 --> 04:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
on the bail commissions that we're aware
 
04:02:11.040 --> 04:02:11.830 align:start position:0%
on the bail commissions that we're aware
of

04:02:11.830 --> 04:02:11.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:02:11.840 --> 04:02:13.429 align:start position:0%
of
we

04:02:13.429 --> 04:02:13.439 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:02:15.189 --> 04:02:15.199 align:start position:0%
spent our time
 
04:02:17.830 --> 04:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
um trying to get him to reconsider his
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
decision based on what we saw and this
 
04:02:21.349 --> 04:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
is i gave you an extreme example a
 
04:02:23.670 --> 04:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
horrible example but but an example
 
04:02:25.510 --> 04:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
nonetheless this happens on a daily
 
04:02:27.510 --> 04:02:27.520 align:start position:0%
basis regular basis people that we've
 
04:02:30.550 --> 04:02:30.560 align:start position:0%
arrested 6 7 8 11 12 13 times and
 
04:02:32.150 --> 04:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
they're always getting out on bail and
 
04:02:33.670 --> 04:02:33.680 align:start position:0%
we're asking them not to do it we're
 
04:02:34.950 --> 04:02:34.960 align:start position:0%
getting complaints from the public that
 
04:02:36.790 --> 04:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
these people keep reappearing
 
04:02:38.710 --> 04:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
and causing the same problems and
 
04:02:40.150 --> 04:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
they're getting re-released getting
 
04:02:41.990 --> 04:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
re-released i understand the concept and
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
i think law enforcement basically agrees
 
04:02:45.189 --> 04:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
with the concept of
 
04:02:47.670 --> 04:02:47.680 align:start position:0%
making sure people are not held in jail
 
04:02:49.670 --> 04:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily until their trial
 
04:02:51.510 --> 04:02:51.520 align:start position:0%
against their will through
 
04:02:53.030 --> 04:02:53.040 align:start position:0%
whether it be socio-economic means or
 
04:02:55.189 --> 04:02:55.199 align:start position:0%
whatever but you have to understand that
 
04:02:57.269 --> 04:02:57.279 align:start position:0%
there are there's a common sense factor
 
04:02:59.349 --> 04:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
in here that is ignored and we have to
 
04:03:00.550 --> 04:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
deal with that as law enforcement
 
04:03:00.560 --> 04:03:02.469 align:start position:0%
deal with that as law enforcement
officers

04:03:02.469 --> 04:03:02.479 align:start position:0%
officers
 
04:03:06.070 --> 04:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:07.110 --> 04:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative hopper you were
 
04:03:08.870 --> 04:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
04:03:11.110 --> 04:03:11.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair are there any uh
 
04:03:13.349 --> 04:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
statistics kept on what failed
 
04:03:15.110 --> 04:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner is
 
04:03:19.269 --> 04:03:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh the results of their actions um like
 
04:03:20.870 --> 04:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
is there any way we trade male
 
04:03:22.309 --> 04:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
commissioners is
 
04:03:26.550 --> 04:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:28.389 --> 04:03:28.399 align:start position:0%
so sir a little bit the question was a
 
04:03:29.910 --> 04:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
little bit broken up but i appreciate it
 
04:03:31.750 --> 04:03:31.760 align:start position:0%
and i think i understood the question is
 
04:03:33.590 --> 04:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
there any statistics or is there any
 
04:03:34.630 --> 04:03:34.640 align:start position:0%
accountability for the bill
 
04:03:34.640 --> 04:03:35.750 align:start position:0%
accountability for the bill
commissioners

04:03:35.750 --> 04:03:35.760 align:start position:0%
commissioners
 
04:03:37.189 --> 04:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i can't answer it because
 
04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have control of the bail
 
04:03:40.389 --> 04:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
commissioners as a police department or
 
04:03:41.590 --> 04:03:41.600 align:start position:0%
any of the other local police
 
04:03:43.030 --> 04:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
departments and again i'm going to
 
04:03:44.870 --> 04:03:44.880 align:start position:0%
reiterate what chief rufonski said it's
 
04:03:47.349 --> 04:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
really difficult due to various types of
 
04:03:49.269 --> 04:03:49.279 align:start position:0%
record management systems in the time
 
04:03:51.189 --> 04:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
effort it would take to dial in on each
 
04:03:53.750 --> 04:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
individual case to ask certain questions
 
04:03:57.349 --> 04:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
and get that data um to give you a
 
04:04:00.309 --> 04:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
formalized answer uh in in a report what
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
we're giving you and we're trying to
 
04:04:02.630 --> 04:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
give you is the reality of what we're
 
04:04:13.349 --> 04:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:15.510 --> 04:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
04:04:17.269 --> 04:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
04:04:20.150 --> 04:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
chief kerrigan for taking my question my
 
04:04:22.550 --> 04:04:22.560 align:start position:0%
question is when you deal with the bail
 
04:04:26.630 --> 04:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
commissioners and they let's say
 
04:04:28.550 --> 04:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
don't they make the bad decision as
 
04:04:31.110 --> 04:04:31.120 align:start position:0%
representative said
 
04:04:35.830 --> 04:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:37.910 --> 04:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
so the only the recourses that we have
 
04:04:39.110 --> 04:04:39.120 align:start position:0%
would be to
 
04:04:41.189 --> 04:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
explain to a judge that's willing to
 
04:04:42.950 --> 04:04:42.960 align:start position:0%
listen that or the head bail
 
04:04:44.710 --> 04:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner that we had these issues
 
04:04:47.110 --> 04:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
but i think all law enforcement has been
 
04:04:49.349 --> 04:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
dealing with it falling on deaf ears and
 
04:04:50.870 --> 04:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
really while this is bail reform this is
 
04:04:52.309 --> 04:04:52.319 align:start position:0%
the very format you can't do anything
 
04:04:54.550 --> 04:04:54.560 align:start position:0%
about it so we've been kind of uh
 
04:04:57.030 --> 04:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
hamstrung for it representative gathered
 
04:05:00.830 --> 04:05:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:02.150 --> 04:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
representative jeff are you recognized
 
04:05:04.469 --> 04:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
for a follow-up question okay if i
 
04:05:06.150 --> 04:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
understood you correctly
 
04:05:09.189 --> 04:05:09.199 align:start position:0%
your resource is to the uh to a judge
 
04:05:09.199 --> 04:05:10.550 align:start position:0%
your resource is to the uh to a judge
correct

04:05:10.550 --> 04:05:10.560 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:05:11.830 --> 04:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
well the head bail commissioner would be
 
04:05:16.469 --> 04:05:16.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:18.150 --> 04:05:18.160 align:start position:0%
and i think i forget who's i don't know
 
04:05:20.309 --> 04:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
who's in charge currently from my role
 
04:05:21.990 --> 04:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
of the bail commissioners out of nashor
 
04:05:22.000 --> 04:05:22.950 align:start position:0%
of the bail commissioners out of nashor
district

04:05:22.950 --> 04:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
district
 
04:05:30.550 --> 04:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:31.910 --> 04:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
newman you're recognizing and for the
 
04:05:34.309 --> 04:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
members that participating on zoom it is
 
04:05:35.910 --> 04:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
easier for the chair to recognize you
 
04:05:38.550 --> 04:05:38.560 align:start position:0%
raise your uh digital hand or your zoom
 
04:05:39.990 --> 04:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
handle whatever you want to refer to it
 
04:05:40.000 --> 04:05:41.269 align:start position:0%
handle whatever you want to refer to it
as

04:05:41.269 --> 04:05:41.279 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:05:42.630 --> 04:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
it's easy for me to track even if you're
 
04:05:45.990 --> 04:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:47.590 --> 04:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
representing new york thank you
 
04:05:50.309 --> 04:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
thank thank you mr chair i'll try to uh
 
04:05:51.429 --> 04:05:51.439 align:start position:0%
get my
 
04:05:53.429 --> 04:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
virtual hand going here
 
04:05:55.670 --> 04:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh chief corrigan for
 
04:05:58.710 --> 04:05:58.720 align:start position:0%
taking that uh taking my question
 
04:06:01.349 --> 04:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
um i'm having a little confusion about
 
04:06:04.309 --> 04:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
well let me ask you this way
 
04:06:06.710 --> 04:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
where the bill now says it will be
 
04:06:09.110 --> 04:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
that the court and the bail commissioner
 
04:06:09.770 --> 04:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
have to
 
04:06:09.780 --> 04:06:10.870 align:start position:0%
have to
[Music]

04:06:10.870 --> 04:06:10.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:06:14.710 --> 04:06:14.720 align:start position:0%
consider these uh specific cases
 
04:06:17.349 --> 04:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
to determine that whether they keep the
 
04:06:19.349 --> 04:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
person for 72 hours or the hearing
 
04:06:21.110 --> 04:06:21.120 align:start position:0%
within 72 hours
 
04:06:21.120 --> 04:06:22.309 align:start position:0%
within 72 hours
um

04:06:22.309 --> 04:06:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:06:22.319 --> 04:06:23.830 align:start position:0%
um
is

04:06:23.830 --> 04:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:06:26.389 --> 04:06:26.399 align:start position:0%
does that in your mind say that it seems
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
like that the
 
04:06:30.870 --> 04:06:30.880 align:start position:0%
judge will always hear it if this bill
 
04:06:34.469 --> 04:06:34.479 align:start position:0%
is passed is that your understanding
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
at some point the judge will have to
 
04:06:37.670 --> 04:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
hear it within the 72 hours and like
 
04:06:39.990 --> 04:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
chief burfonsky said it could be earlier
 
04:06:41.990 --> 04:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
if it's a tuesday night at two o'clock
 
04:06:43.830 --> 04:06:43.840 align:start position:0%
in the morning that judge would hear it
 
04:06:45.910 --> 04:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
wednesday at the uh at the appointed
 
04:06:48.630 --> 04:06:48.640 align:start position:0%
time either at nine or at one um so that
 
04:06:50.630 --> 04:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
it would be heard earlier
 
04:06:50.640 --> 04:06:52.150 align:start position:0%
it would be heard earlier
but

04:06:52.150 --> 04:06:52.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:06:54.630 --> 04:06:54.640 align:start position:0%
it should be if we if if the law
 
04:06:57.110 --> 04:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
enforcement was able to articulate
 
04:06:58.469 --> 04:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
why they needed to be held and be
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
respected for that then the then we
 
04:07:02.469 --> 04:07:02.479 align:start position:0%
would have to wait for a judge to review
 
04:07:03.910 --> 04:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
all the facts and that is where the
 
04:07:06.830 --> 04:07:06.840 align:start position:0%
disconnect seems to be happening in my
 
04:07:08.950 --> 04:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
opinion and
 
04:07:09.910 --> 04:07:09.920 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
04:07:12.630 --> 04:07:12.640 align:start position:0%
you recognize for a follow-up
 
04:07:12.640 --> 04:07:14.309 align:start position:0%
you recognize for a follow-up
uh

04:07:14.309 --> 04:07:14.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:07:19.030 --> 04:07:19.040 align:start position:0%
so am i correct in in thinking that um
 
04:07:21.910 --> 04:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
that where it says up to 72 hours that
 
04:07:26.389 --> 04:07:26.399 align:start position:0%
that 72 hours only applies to
 
04:07:28.229 --> 04:07:28.239 align:start position:0%
the time between they're arrested and
 
04:07:30.630 --> 04:07:30.640 align:start position:0%
the time they have a hearing
 
04:07:34.070 --> 04:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
and it is not a limitation
 
04:07:37.590 --> 04:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
on the time that they may be detained
 
04:07:40.070 --> 04:07:40.080 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
04:07:41.830 --> 04:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
i apologize representative newman i'm
 
04:07:43.349 --> 04:07:43.359 align:start position:0%
not sure i understand the question we
 
04:07:45.910 --> 04:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
have we are asking to be able to hold
 
04:07:47.750 --> 04:07:47.760 align:start position:0%
them until we can get in front of a
 
04:07:50.309 --> 04:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
judge for up to 72 hours because that's
 
04:07:52.229 --> 04:07:52.239 align:start position:0%
the time frame that would allow us to be
 
04:07:53.830 --> 04:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
able to do that to get in front of a
 
04:07:55.590 --> 04:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
judge given the holidays given a weekend
 
04:07:58.229 --> 04:07:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:01.590 --> 04:08:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:14.450 --> 04:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:14.460 --> 04:08:16.309 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:08:16.309 --> 04:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:08:19.269 --> 04:08:19.279 align:start position:0%
shows up for their judicial hearings and
 
04:08:20.469 --> 04:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
their process
 
04:08:22.070 --> 04:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
their court dates
 
04:08:23.910 --> 04:08:23.920 align:start position:0%
sounds like from you and others that
 
04:08:26.469 --> 04:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
it's being used as a crime-fighting
 
04:08:29.189 --> 04:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism i'm curious you could
 
04:08:32.229 --> 04:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
04:08:34.150 --> 04:08:34.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative i'm sorry you you
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
broke up at the first part of your
 
04:08:39.429 --> 04:08:39.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:40.870 --> 04:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
i don't i guess i don't understand what
 
04:08:43.269 --> 04:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
you mean by a crime-fighting technique
 
04:08:45.349 --> 04:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
we're asking if if somebody's arrested
 
04:08:47.429 --> 04:08:47.439 align:start position:0%
for a crime we have probable cause to
 
04:08:49.110 --> 04:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
believe there's a crime and we believe
 
04:08:50.950 --> 04:08:50.960 align:start position:0%
this is dangerous we need to be able to
 
04:08:52.389 --> 04:08:52.399 align:start position:0%
articulate that to the bail commissioner
 
04:08:54.070 --> 04:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
to be able to hold that person until
 
04:08:56.309 --> 04:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
they can go in front of a judge and they
 
04:08:58.229 --> 04:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
can fax can be presented in front of the
 
04:09:03.429 --> 04:09:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:07.750 --> 04:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:09.910 --> 04:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative o'hara
 
04:09:11.830 --> 04:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
04:09:13.429 --> 04:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:09:15.030 --> 04:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:09:17.510 --> 04:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to try to award it in ways
 
04:09:17.520 --> 04:09:18.229 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to try to award it in ways
so

04:09:18.229 --> 04:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:09:21.030 --> 04:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
regards the 72-hour hold
 
04:09:21.040 --> 04:09:22.550 align:start position:0%
regards the 72-hour hold
excluding

04:09:22.550 --> 04:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
excluding
 
04:09:24.469 --> 04:09:24.479 align:start position:0%
weekends and holidays
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
and it's only for certain crimes
 
04:09:28.389 --> 04:09:28.399 align:start position:0%
and i'm probably going to age myself but
 
04:09:31.189 --> 04:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
are we just going back uh to where once
 
04:09:32.630 --> 04:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
was uh
 
04:09:35.189 --> 04:09:35.199 align:start position:0%
for most other crimes uh that you could
 
04:09:37.910 --> 04:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
hold them over the weekend um
 
04:09:41.510 --> 04:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
for some and up to 72 hours
 
04:09:41.520 --> 04:09:42.309 align:start position:0%
for some and up to 72 hours
well

04:09:42.309 --> 04:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:09:43.910 --> 04:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
we're not asking to hold everybody for
 
04:09:45.830 --> 04:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
72 hours we're asking if we can
 
04:09:47.830 --> 04:09:47.840 align:start position:0%
articulate a reason that they should be
 
04:09:50.550 --> 04:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
held that that be respected and we'd be
 
04:09:52.150 --> 04:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
able to do that or have more say in it
 
04:09:53.990 --> 04:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that's just not happening and as a
 
04:09:54.000 --> 04:09:55.110 align:start position:0%
and that's just not happening and as a
result

04:09:55.110 --> 04:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
result
 
04:09:56.469 --> 04:09:56.479 align:start position:0%
some seriously dangerous people are
 
04:10:05.189 --> 04:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:07.910 --> 04:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up question
 
04:10:11.100 --> 04:10:11.110 align:start position:0%
no i'm awesome
 
04:10:11.110 --> 04:10:12.710 align:start position:0%
no i'm awesome

[Music]
 
04:10:14.389 --> 04:10:14.399 align:start position:0%
representative klein knight you were
 
04:10:16.309 --> 04:10:16.319 align:start position:0%
recognized for a question
 
04:10:18.630 --> 04:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman thank you chief for
 
04:10:20.150 --> 04:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:10:23.189 --> 04:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
my question is in regards to
 
04:10:25.510 --> 04:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh
 
04:10:27.830 --> 04:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
gathright's question which is
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
if your next course of action is to
 
04:10:33.269 --> 04:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
speak to the the head or the of the
 
04:10:37.670 --> 04:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
board commission in your city or town
 
04:10:39.830 --> 04:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
and you don't even know their name how
 
04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
many times have you actually taken that
 
04:10:43.670 --> 04:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
course of action
 
04:10:45.429 --> 04:10:45.439 align:start position:0%
well representative i guess to answer
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
that question i'm representing the
 
04:10:50.070 --> 04:10:50.080 align:start position:0%
entire agency of 178 officers so i don't
 
04:10:52.469 --> 04:10:52.479 align:start position:0%
have a dealing where it's it's my role
 
04:10:54.550 --> 04:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
to do that we have people at several
 
04:10:56.950 --> 04:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
levels that do that what how i would
 
04:10:58.550 --> 04:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
answer the call is
 
04:10:59.910 --> 04:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
when there's a problem and we try to
 
04:11:01.429 --> 04:11:01.439 align:start position:0%
address it and it falls on deaf ears
 
04:11:02.790 --> 04:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
time and time again for all law
 
04:11:05.429 --> 04:11:05.439 align:start position:0%
enforcement agencies then
 
04:11:06.790 --> 04:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
you really don't know what to do other
 
04:11:07.830 --> 04:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
than to
 
04:11:10.550 --> 04:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
go to the state legislature and testify
 
04:11:12.469 --> 04:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
that you need to build the change and be
 
04:11:14.389 --> 04:11:14.399 align:start position:0%
amended which is i believe what we're
 
04:11:24.469 --> 04:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:26.550 --> 04:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
say no for the hands raised i want to
 
04:11:28.630 --> 04:11:28.640 align:start position:0%
thank the witness for assessment
 
04:11:38.150 --> 04:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:39.510 --> 04:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
if there's any members of the public
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
that are in attendance that we should
 
04:11:43.349 --> 04:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
testify that have not testified already
 
04:11:45.429 --> 04:11:45.439 align:start position:0%
uh please raise your hand the china
 
04:11:52.950 --> 04:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:54.710 --> 04:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you mr chairman and
 
04:11:56.070 --> 04:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for holding
 
04:11:58.150 --> 04:11:58.160 align:start position:0%
this hearing for the record my name is
 
04:11:59.750 --> 04:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
ross connolly i'm the deputy state
 
04:12:01.670 --> 04:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
director for americans for prosperity in
 
04:12:02.870 --> 04:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:12:04.710 --> 04:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
and i'm here today to voice our
 
04:12:07.830 --> 04:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
opposition to sb 92 as it's currently
 
04:12:07.840 --> 04:12:09.269 align:start position:0%
opposition to sb 92 as it's currently
written

04:12:09.269 --> 04:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:12:11.429 --> 04:12:11.439 align:start position:0%
this bill will unnecessarily limit
 
04:12:13.750 --> 04:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
judicial discretion in ways that won't
 
04:12:16.070 --> 04:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
benefit public safety and it will
 
04:12:18.630 --> 04:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
increase jail populations
 
04:12:20.469 --> 04:12:20.479 align:start position:0%
as chief justice william rehnquist
 
04:12:23.110 --> 04:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
stated in our society liberty is the
 
04:12:25.590 --> 04:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
norm and detention prior to trial or
 
04:12:28.389 --> 04:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
without trial is the carefully limited
 
04:12:28.399 --> 04:12:29.830 align:start position:0%
without trial is the carefully limited
exception

04:12:29.830 --> 04:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
exception
 
04:12:31.110 --> 04:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
this bill is moving new hampshire
 
04:12:33.269 --> 04:12:33.279 align:start position:0%
further towards the opposite and this
 
04:12:35.590 --> 04:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
will harm poor and minority communities
 
04:12:37.750 --> 04:12:37.760 align:start position:0%
the most there are ways to strike a
 
04:12:40.389 --> 04:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
balance to protect public safety but
 
04:12:42.309 --> 04:12:42.319 align:start position:0%
this is a machete when a scalpel is
 
04:12:42.319 --> 04:12:43.429 align:start position:0%
this is a machete when a scalpel is
needed

04:12:43.429 --> 04:12:43.439 align:start position:0%
needed
 
04:12:45.670 --> 04:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
and there's quite a few uh issues that
 
04:12:48.150 --> 04:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
we have with this bill and out of the
 
04:12:50.550 --> 04:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
interest of time uh i just want to
 
04:12:53.910 --> 04:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
highlight a couple so on page 2 lines
 
04:12:53.920 --> 04:12:55.910 align:start position:0%
highlight a couple so on page 2 lines
31-32

04:12:55.910 --> 04:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
31-32
 
04:12:57.910 --> 04:12:57.920 align:start position:0%
it's good the amended language improve
 
04:12:57.920 --> 04:12:58.630 align:start position:0%
it's good the amended language improve
this

04:12:58.630 --> 04:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:12:58.640 --> 04:12:59.830 align:start position:0%
this
provision

04:12:59.830 --> 04:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
provision
 
04:13:01.590 --> 04:13:01.600 align:start position:0%
with the timeline but it is still
 
04:13:04.149 --> 04:13:04.159 align:start position:0%
problematic uh first the language is
 
04:13:06.710 --> 04:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
contradictory and will cause confusion
 
04:13:08.389 --> 04:13:08.399 align:start position:0%
it says there is a presumption that
 
04:13:10.469 --> 04:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
release won't reasonably assure
 
04:13:12.710 --> 04:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
appearance but then it also says the
 
04:13:15.670 --> 04:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
person shall be detained which isn't a
 
04:13:17.910 --> 04:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
presumption it's a requirement
 
04:13:19.990 --> 04:13:20.000 align:start position:0%
second it should be under the discretion
 
04:13:22.070 --> 04:13:22.080 align:start position:0%
of the judge to determine whether
 
04:13:24.469 --> 04:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
pre-trial detention is appropriate a
 
04:13:26.710 --> 04:13:26.720 align:start position:0%
presumption here with a statement on the
 
04:13:29.189 --> 04:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
record for why release is okay would be
 
04:13:30.870 --> 04:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
a much better route
 
04:13:32.870 --> 04:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
failure to appear is also a product of
 
04:13:35.030 --> 04:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
poverty in many cases and doesn't
 
04:13:37.590 --> 04:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily indicate a person's risk to
 
04:13:40.229 --> 04:13:40.239 align:start position:0%
the public or that they will be a flight
 
04:13:42.630 --> 04:13:42.640 align:start position:0%
risk now if they weren't a flight risk
 
04:13:44.710 --> 04:13:44.720 align:start position:0%
three three years ago
 
04:13:47.110 --> 04:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
common reasons for not appearing are bad
 
04:13:50.309 --> 04:13:50.319 align:start position:0%
or no transportation obligations at work
 
04:13:53.670 --> 04:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
forgetting or child issues a de facto
 
04:13:55.670 --> 04:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
detention will only exacerbate these
 
04:13:57.990 --> 04:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
issues and make people fall deeper into
 
04:14:00.309 --> 04:14:00.319 align:start position:0%
poverty and cause a greater likelihood
 
04:14:02.870 --> 04:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
of later criminal activity
 
04:14:06.389 --> 04:14:06.399 align:start position:0%
and then on page 3 lines 4 through 14
 
04:14:08.790 --> 04:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
requiring automatic pre-trial detention
 
04:14:10.469 --> 04:14:10.479 align:start position:0%
for anyone accused of a class a
 
04:14:13.750 --> 04:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor a third felony or a dui
 
04:14:14.710 --> 04:14:14.720 align:start position:0%
is a
 
04:14:16.710 --> 04:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
a terrible provision that will not
 
04:14:19.030 --> 04:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
improve public safety and will only
 
04:14:20.870 --> 04:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
further exacerbate the issues we
 
04:14:20.880 --> 04:14:22.870 align:start position:0%
further exacerbate the issues we
discussed

04:14:22.870 --> 04:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
04:14:22.880 --> 04:14:23.670 align:start position:0%
discussed
a

04:14:23.670 --> 04:14:23.680 align:start position:0%
a
 
04:14:25.750 --> 04:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
presumption is is fine but taking
 
04:14:28.149 --> 04:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
judicial discretion away in this manner
 
04:14:30.790 --> 04:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
is absolutely unnecessary unnecessary
 
04:14:32.950 --> 04:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
and will set new hampshire back and it
 
04:14:36.229 --> 04:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
flies in the face of of due process and
 
04:14:39.110 --> 04:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
then lastly on page 3 lines 15 through
 
04:14:39.120 --> 04:14:40.070 align:start position:0%
then lastly on page 3 lines 15 through
18

04:14:40.070 --> 04:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
18
 
04:14:42.710 --> 04:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
uh this provision to implement a
 
04:14:44.070 --> 04:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
requirement that there is some
 
04:14:46.790 --> 04:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
presumption that the person is a danger
 
04:14:48.469 --> 04:14:48.479 align:start position:0%
anytime a defendant requests a
 
04:14:50.790 --> 04:14:50.800 align:start position:0%
subsequent bail hearing once again
 
04:14:53.510 --> 04:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
disregards due process and doesn't even
 
04:14:55.990 --> 04:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
make much sense what triggers this
 
04:14:56.000 --> 04:14:57.189 align:start position:0%
make much sense what triggers this
presumption

04:14:57.189 --> 04:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
presumption
 
04:14:59.590 --> 04:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
just asking for a hearing should not be
 
04:14:59.600 --> 04:15:00.950 align:start position:0%
just asking for a hearing should not be
punished

04:15:00.950 --> 04:15:00.960 align:start position:0%
punished
 
04:15:03.429 --> 04:15:03.439 align:start position:0%
and it's for these structural issues
 
04:15:05.269 --> 04:15:05.279 align:start position:0%
along with some others
 
04:15:07.110 --> 04:15:07.120 align:start position:0%
with this legislation that we urge the
 
04:15:10.469 --> 04:15:10.479 align:start position:0%
committee to move sb 92 in expedient to
 
04:15:13.110 --> 04:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
legislate and i'd be happy to take any
 
04:15:13.120 --> 04:15:20.149 align:start position:0%
legislate and i'd be happy to take any
questions

04:15:20.149 --> 04:15:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:21.670 --> 04:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony the chair
 
04:15:23.269 --> 04:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
and i recognize representative tanta
 
04:15:39.349 --> 04:15:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:43.750 --> 04:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:47.510 --> 04:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
do you believe mr conley do you believe
 
04:15:50.710 --> 04:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
that a police officer walking into a
 
04:15:50.720 --> 04:15:51.990 align:start position:0%
that a police officer walking into a
room

04:15:51.990 --> 04:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
room
 
04:15:54.870 --> 04:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
and seeing a woman's face all bloody
 
04:15:57.750 --> 04:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't constitute them knowing what's
 
04:16:00.469 --> 04:16:00.479 align:start position:0%
going on
 
04:16:01.750 --> 04:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
04:16:04.469 --> 04:16:04.479 align:start position:0%
representative i i think uh a little
 
04:16:06.710 --> 04:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
confused by the question but
 
04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
really our our main opposition with this
 
04:16:11.189 --> 04:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
bill are those uh
 
04:16:13.269 --> 04:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
points that i i highlighted
 
04:16:14.550 --> 04:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
we do believe that there are
 
04:16:16.630 --> 04:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
improvements that can be made to to the
 
04:16:19.349 --> 04:16:19.359 align:start position:0%
current bail system uh and we're happy
 
04:16:20.870 --> 04:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
to to help provide those to the
 
04:16:23.429 --> 04:16:23.439 align:start position:0%
committee and and be of assistance uh
 
04:16:24.870 --> 04:16:24.880 align:start position:0%
for this legislation or further
 
04:16:27.349 --> 04:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
legislation uh but
 
04:16:30.710 --> 04:16:30.720 align:start position:0%
the the the issues regarding due process
 
04:16:33.269 --> 04:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
are are pretty severe uh in our regard
 
04:16:36.870 --> 04:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
in the current version of this bill
 
04:16:38.389 --> 04:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
second question
 
04:16:40.309 --> 04:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
president david should recognize for a
 
04:16:43.189 --> 04:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
follow-up question thank you
 
04:16:45.590 --> 04:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
um mr connolly
 
04:16:48.229 --> 04:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
would would this not be
 
04:16:50.950 --> 04:16:50.960 align:start position:0%
how would we say that it was not
 
04:16:50.960 --> 04:16:51.830 align:start position:0%
how would we say that it was not
um

04:16:51.830 --> 04:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:16:51.840 --> 04:16:53.349 align:start position:0%
um
dangerous

04:16:53.349 --> 04:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
dangerous
 
04:16:54.830 --> 04:16:54.840 align:start position:0%
for everybody
 
04:16:59.189 --> 04:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
involved to see this person
 
04:17:01.750 --> 04:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
excuse me how could the police say that
 
04:17:05.110 --> 04:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:06.710 --> 04:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh thanks thank you for the question
 
04:17:09.750 --> 04:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
representative i i think uh there
 
04:17:12.710 --> 04:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
certainly for for dangerous criminals
 
04:17:14.870 --> 04:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
things of that sort there there uh
 
04:17:16.790 --> 04:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
should be special provisions and again
 
04:17:18.790 --> 04:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's not our main disagreement
 
04:17:21.429 --> 04:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
with this bill our main disagreement is
 
04:17:21.439 --> 04:17:22.469 align:start position:0%
with this bill our main disagreement is
around

04:17:22.469 --> 04:17:22.479 align:start position:0%
around
 
04:17:24.630 --> 04:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh those those sections that i i
 
04:17:26.070 --> 04:17:26.080 align:start position:0%
highlight uh
 
04:17:27.830 --> 04:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
in my testimony
 
04:17:33.590 --> 04:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:35.110 --> 04:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
representative true you're recognized
 
04:17:36.870 --> 04:17:36.880 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you mr chair and
 
04:17:40.550 --> 04:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:43.269 --> 04:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
i i i made the wrong copy of the bill so
 
04:17:46.950 --> 04:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
when you refer to second line two page
 
04:17:48.790 --> 04:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh line 31
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
i don't have numbers on mine could you
 
04:17:54.309 --> 04:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
for my benefit could you tell me the
 
04:17:56.870 --> 04:17:56.880 align:start position:0%
worst part of the bill
 
04:17:59.429 --> 04:17:59.439 align:start position:0%
and and slowly tell me where that is in
 
04:18:01.269 --> 04:18:01.279 align:start position:0%
the bill so i can follow along with your
 
04:18:01.279 --> 04:18:03.429 align:start position:0%
the bill so i can follow along with your
disagreement

04:18:03.429 --> 04:18:03.439 align:start position:0%
disagreement
 
04:18:04.830 --> 04:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh
 
04:18:08.389 --> 04:18:08.399 align:start position:0%
so it's on uh page two on on both the
 
04:18:11.349 --> 04:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
amended version and the uh original
 
04:18:11.359 --> 04:18:12.630 align:start position:0%
amended version and the uh original
version

04:18:12.630 --> 04:18:12.640 align:start position:0%

04:18:14.560 --> 04:18:16.790 align:start position:0%
uh it's under
section

04:18:16.790 --> 04:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:18:18.630 --> 04:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
two starting with if the court
 
04:18:21.189 --> 04:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
determines by a preponderance and ends
 
04:18:23.510 --> 04:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
with and the person shall be
 
04:18:26.389 --> 04:18:26.399 align:start position:0%
detained in pre-trial detention
 
04:18:29.750 --> 04:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
and then on the third page
 
04:18:32.309 --> 04:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
it's under section c starting with
 
04:18:34.790 --> 04:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
failure of a person to abide by previous
 
04:18:36.229 --> 04:18:36.239 align:start position:0%
bail conditions
 
04:18:37.750 --> 04:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
and ending with
 
04:18:40.229 --> 04:18:40.239 align:start position:0%
uh the court may consider any relevant
 
04:18:42.070 --> 04:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
factors in its
 
04:18:44.630 --> 04:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
making in making its determination
 
04:18:47.269 --> 04:18:47.279 align:start position:0%
and then the section directly below that
 
04:18:49.269 --> 04:18:49.279 align:start position:0%

04:19:04.630 --> 04:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:06.790 --> 04:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised i want to thank
 
04:19:08.550 --> 04:19:08.560 align:start position:0%
the witness for testimony
 
04:19:13.110 --> 04:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:29.189 --> 04:19:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:32.070 --> 04:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me
 
04:19:35.030 --> 04:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:37.110 --> 04:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much chip um thank
 
04:19:38.790 --> 04:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
you chair and members of this committee
 
04:19:41.510 --> 04:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
for hearing my testimony today my name
 
04:19:43.189 --> 04:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
is joseph lascaux and i will be
 
04:19:44.710 --> 04:19:44.720 align:start position:0%
representing the american civil
 
04:19:49.670 --> 04:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
liberties union in opposition to sb 92
 
04:19:51.590 --> 04:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
the aclu strongly disagrees with the
 
04:19:53.990 --> 04:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
proposed bail provisions as it reflects
 
04:19:55.830 --> 04:19:55.840 align:start position:0%
it is reflective of only a single
 
04:19:57.670 --> 04:19:57.680 align:start position:0%
perspective and disregards the concerns
 
04:19:59.590 --> 04:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
raised by other stakeholders of the bail
 
04:19:59.600 --> 04:20:00.870 align:start position:0%
raised by other stakeholders of the bail
commission

04:20:00.870 --> 04:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
commission
 
04:20:02.309 --> 04:20:02.319 align:start position:0%
this bill does not reflect the
 
04:20:04.070 --> 04:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
recommendations that were put forward by
 
04:20:06.550 --> 04:20:06.560 align:start position:0%
the bail commission nor was it previewed
 
04:20:08.229 --> 04:20:08.239 align:start position:0%
with the majority of the bail commission
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
stakeholders including the aclu
 
04:20:12.950 --> 04:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
the bail system was never intended or
 
04:20:15.189 --> 04:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
designed to be punitive however that is
 
04:20:17.429 --> 04:20:17.439 align:start position:0%
exactly what sb 92 does
 
04:20:18.950 --> 04:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
unless you're sentenced to serve time in
 
04:20:20.710 --> 04:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
jail you're supposed to be treated and
 
04:20:22.710 --> 04:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
presumed innocent until proven guilty in
 
04:20:23.990 --> 04:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
a court of law
 
04:20:26.229 --> 04:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
however reality is that's just not the
 
04:20:26.239 --> 04:20:27.510 align:start position:0%
however reality is that's just not the
case

04:20:27.510 --> 04:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:20:29.269 --> 04:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
jail is not an environment where people
 
04:20:31.510 --> 04:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
should have to sit just because they are
 
04:20:31.520 --> 04:20:32.389 align:start position:0%
should have to sit just because they are
poor

04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
poor
 
04:20:33.590 --> 04:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
new hampshire can't be a place that
 
04:20:35.910 --> 04:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
accepts or condones this practice
 
04:20:37.830 --> 04:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
and i do want to
 
04:20:40.710 --> 04:20:40.720 align:start position:0%
take time to acknowledge and recognize
 
04:20:43.110 --> 04:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
that our concerns must be balanced with
 
04:20:45.429 --> 04:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
community safety and that is why i want
 
04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
to re-highlight the fact that our
 
04:20:49.189 --> 04:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
current bail system provides our courts
 
04:20:51.269 --> 04:20:51.279 align:start position:0%
and bail commissioners the authority and
 
04:20:53.510 --> 04:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
means by which to detain someone pending
 
04:20:55.830 --> 04:20:55.840 align:start position:0%
the resolution of their case they have
 
04:20:58.309 --> 04:20:58.319 align:start position:0%
the ability to do this and just as the
 
04:20:59.590 --> 04:20:59.600 align:start position:0%
burden is on the state to prove
 
04:21:00.950 --> 04:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
someone's guilt the burden should be on
 
04:21:01.990 --> 04:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
the state to prove someone's
 
04:21:02.000 --> 04:21:03.269 align:start position:0%
the state to prove someone's
dangerousness

04:21:03.269 --> 04:21:03.279 align:start position:0%
dangerousness
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
um we heard testimony today that you
 
04:21:07.750 --> 04:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
know we should be using common sense and
 
04:21:10.309 --> 04:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
i i think it's common sense you know and
 
04:21:12.550 --> 04:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
i'll use myself as an example if i'm
 
04:21:15.269 --> 04:21:15.279 align:start position:0%
arrested for um for an offense that i
 
04:21:17.830 --> 04:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
haven't been convicted of i can't prove
 
04:21:19.269 --> 04:21:19.279 align:start position:0%
that i'm not something if i'm not what
 
04:21:21.990 --> 04:21:22.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not um
 
04:21:22.000 --> 04:21:22.950 align:start position:0%
i'm not um
so

04:21:22.950 --> 04:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:21:26.149 --> 04:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
i i i that that's just a a big concern
 
04:21:28.710 --> 04:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
um sb 92 does take away the ability for
 
04:21:30.790 --> 04:21:30.800 align:start position:0%
cases to be evaluated on a unique and
 
04:21:32.469 --> 04:21:32.479 align:start position:0%
individual basis
 
04:21:35.670 --> 04:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
and we hear about uh
 
04:21:38.469 --> 04:21:38.479 align:start position:0%
these horrible egregious
 
04:21:38.479 --> 04:21:40.070 align:start position:0%
these horrible egregious
cases

04:21:40.070 --> 04:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
cases
 
04:21:42.309 --> 04:21:42.319 align:start position:0%
because negativity has been something
 
04:21:44.950 --> 04:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
that uh is sensationalized by the media
 
04:21:47.590 --> 04:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
however we don't talk about the
 
04:21:49.510 --> 04:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
positive cases when people do use the
 
04:21:53.189 --> 04:21:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:55.269 --> 04:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
in closing i just want to say this
 
04:21:56.710 --> 04:21:56.720 align:start position:0%
no one gets a death sentence to be
 
04:21:59.189 --> 04:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
served in county jail however from 2000
 
04:22:01.990 --> 04:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
to 2016 new hampshire had 35 deaths in
 
04:22:05.030 --> 04:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:08.630 --> 04:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
7 2016 alone our affiliate represented
 
04:22:11.110 --> 04:22:11.120 align:start position:0%
one of those lives uh a pre-trial
 
04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
detainee someone who was sitting in jail
 
04:22:14.469 --> 04:22:14.479 align:start position:0%
only because he couldn't come up with a
 
04:22:16.710 --> 04:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars and ended up paying the
 
04:22:18.870 --> 04:22:18.880 align:start position:0%
ultimate price with his life
 
04:22:21.910 --> 04:22:21.920 align:start position:0%

i personally believe a human life is
 
04:22:27.189 --> 04:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
worth more than a hundred dollars so i'm
 
04:22:29.429 --> 04:22:29.439 align:start position:0%
asking how many lies is this legislator
 
04:22:31.110 --> 04:22:31.120 align:start position:0%
comfortable with allowing to pass away
 
04:22:32.389 --> 04:22:32.399 align:start position:0%
while waiting to exercise their
 
04:22:34.389 --> 04:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
constitutional given right i have to sit
 
04:22:35.269 --> 04:22:35.279 align:start position:0%
in a cell because of their

socio-economic status
 
04:22:38.950 --> 04:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
if the answer is none then i ask that
 
04:22:42.309 --> 04:22:42.319 align:start position:0%
this committee vote itl on the on sb 92
 
04:22:44.149 --> 04:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
and redirect our attention to utilizing
 
04:22:45.910 --> 04:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
the bail system and the way that it was
 
04:22:47.590 --> 04:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
designed to be used
 
04:22:49.510 --> 04:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to take any and all questions
 
04:22:52.630 --> 04:22:52.640 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman i i just have a
 
04:23:30.950 --> 04:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
question um mr lacrosse
 
04:23:33.990 --> 04:23:34.000 align:start position:0%
could you tell me the person that was
 
04:23:36.229 --> 04:23:36.239 align:start position:0%
represented in that jail
 
04:23:38.229 --> 04:23:38.239 align:start position:0%
if he refused
 
04:23:40.469 --> 04:23:40.479 align:start position:0%
fired his attorneys one right after the
 
04:23:40.479 --> 04:23:42.950 align:start position:0%

other

04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
04:23:45.429 --> 04:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
um that is a great question i honestly
 
04:23:47.510 --> 04:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
do not know the answer to that because
 
04:23:49.830 --> 04:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
this happened before i was working for
 
04:23:52.070 --> 04:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
the aclu um
 
04:23:53.990 --> 04:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
but to my knowledge
 
04:23:56.469 --> 04:23:56.479 align:start position:0%
we represented this individual
 
04:23:58.630 --> 04:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
in his situation
 
04:23:59.340 --> 04:23:59.350 align:start position:0%

you really
you

04:24:14.710 --> 04:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:24:17.189 --> 04:24:17.199 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a fairly egregious
 
04:24:17.199 --> 04:24:18.149 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a fairly egregious
case

04:24:18.149 --> 04:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
case
 
04:24:19.990 --> 04:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
it was due to a hundred dollar bail that
 
04:24:23.750 --> 04:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:26.469 --> 04:24:26.479 align:start position:0%
did the aclu or any of the contributors
 
04:24:28.870 --> 04:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
say so you offer to pay that hundred
 
04:24:31.030 --> 04:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
dollar bill i'm just if it's so
 
04:24:31.040 --> 04:24:36.070 align:start position:0%
dollar bill i'm just if it's so
egregious

04:24:36.070 --> 04:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:37.510 --> 04:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
before you i'm not sure if the witness
 
04:24:38.950 --> 04:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
can answer that question i don't think
 
04:24:38.960 --> 04:24:39.990 align:start position:0%
can answer that question i don't think
he

04:24:39.990 --> 04:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
he
 
04:24:41.990 --> 04:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
speaks to me so you don't have to pass
 
04:24:42.000 --> 04:24:44.630 align:start position:0%
speaks to me so you don't have to pass
it

04:24:44.630 --> 04:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:47.990 --> 04:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
no i i i i don't but what i did want to
 
04:24:49.429 --> 04:24:49.439 align:start position:0%
say um
 
04:24:52.309 --> 04:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
about that is one um to my knowledge we
 
04:24:54.870 --> 04:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
weren't aware of his case that he was
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
sitting in county jail until after he
 
04:24:59.110 --> 04:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
passed away um
 
04:25:02.149 --> 04:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
but two also i think that
 
04:25:05.030 --> 04:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
if you don't have the means
 
04:25:06.630 --> 04:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
to come up with a hundred dollar bail
 
04:25:09.030 --> 04:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be next to impossible for you
 
04:25:10.950 --> 04:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
to get a hold of someone to come bail
 
04:25:12.229 --> 04:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
you out because how are you gonna make a
 
04:25:14.229 --> 04:25:14.239 align:start position:0%
phone call how how are you gonna reach
 
04:25:17.830 --> 04:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
out of a county jail to and to to anyone
 
04:25:27.990 --> 04:25:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.590 --> 04:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
yes when you're in county jail you are
 
04:25:32.070 --> 04:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
charged for your phone calls
 
04:25:35.110 --> 04:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
that that go out um and i and i and i
 
04:25:36.630 --> 04:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
can say from personal experience it's
 
04:25:42.710 --> 04:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%

thank you mr chairman thank you sir for
 
04:25:49.750 --> 04:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
taking the question this still
 
04:25:52.870 --> 04:25:52.880 align:start position:0%
contemplates a 72-hour
 
04:25:54.550 --> 04:25:54.560 align:start position:0%
holding period
 
04:25:58.070 --> 04:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
um is there any significance to that or
 
04:25:59.030 --> 04:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
do you
 
04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
you speak to what that
 
04:26:00.880 --> 04:26:08.790 align:start position:0%
you speak to what that
amount

04:26:08.790 --> 04:26:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:09.990 --> 04:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for the
 
04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
question yes i can um
 
04:26:16.389 --> 04:26:16.399 align:start position:0%
70 to a 72 hour time period
 
04:26:19.110 --> 04:26:19.120 align:start position:0%
in a county jail is
 
04:26:21.030 --> 04:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
a is that's a long time i i guess the
 
04:26:22.870 --> 04:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
only way that i can um
 
04:26:24.870 --> 04:26:24.880 align:start position:0%
try to accurately uh
 
04:26:24.880 --> 04:26:25.670 align:start position:0%
try to accurately uh
um

04:26:25.670 --> 04:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:27.429 --> 04:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
you know give an analogy is like is for
 
04:26:28.469 --> 04:26:28.479 align:start position:0%
anyone to think about the worst
 
04:26:29.990 --> 04:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
situation that they have been in in
 
04:26:31.269 --> 04:26:31.279 align:start position:0%
their life and then just imagine it
 
04:26:34.469 --> 04:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
lasting for 72 hours straight um
 
04:26:37.510 --> 04:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's that's how it is and in 72
 
04:26:39.189 --> 04:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
hours if you are a person who's waiting
 
04:26:40.389 --> 04:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
pre-trial you haven't been convicted of
 
04:26:42.950 --> 04:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
a crime during that 72 hours you can
 
04:26:44.469 --> 04:26:44.479 align:start position:0%
lose your job
 
04:26:46.950 --> 04:26:46.960 align:start position:0%
you can lose your housing
 
04:26:48.950 --> 04:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
you have dependents people who have
 
04:26:50.870 --> 04:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
dependence on them people who are who
 
04:26:53.349 --> 04:26:53.359 align:start position:0%
are who are you know their life is
 
04:26:56.070 --> 04:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
depending on that individual that 72
 
04:26:59.269 --> 04:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
hours can have significant impact on
 
04:27:02.550 --> 04:27:02.560 align:start position:0%
people's um and that that i think is a
 
04:27:05.590 --> 04:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
concern that can't be ignored because
 
04:27:08.469 --> 04:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
that will that creates more problems in
 
04:27:09.670 --> 04:27:09.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
04:27:13.750 --> 04:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:17.750 --> 04:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
70s you know and and even more and i can
 
04:27:20.229 --> 04:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
this is this part is on on my personal
 
04:27:22.550 --> 04:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
experience but
 
04:27:26.070 --> 04:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
county jails have been used as a means
 
04:27:27.510 --> 04:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
04:27:29.110 --> 04:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
get individuals to either plea out
 
04:27:29.120 --> 04:27:30.309 align:start position:0%
get individuals to either plea out
quicker

04:27:30.309 --> 04:27:30.319 align:start position:0%
quicker
 
04:27:30.319 --> 04:27:31.269 align:start position:0%
quicker
um

04:27:31.269 --> 04:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:31.279 --> 04:27:32.389 align:start position:0%
um
and

04:27:32.389 --> 04:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:36.389 --> 04:27:36.399 align:start position:0%
that 72 hour period uh really does put
 
04:27:38.070 --> 04:27:38.080 align:start position:0%
put down people people don't they don't
 
04:27:39.670 --> 04:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
they don't want to be there they they
 
04:27:39.680 --> 04:27:40.550 align:start position:0%
they don't want to be there they they
are

04:27:40.550 --> 04:27:40.560 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:27:43.990 --> 04:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
trying to get out of the facility and
 
04:27:46.870 --> 04:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
that i i don't think that that is um
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
right to have people um
 
04:27:51.990 --> 04:27:52.000 align:start position:0%
feel pressured into making decisions
 
04:27:53.750 --> 04:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
just because they they want to have a
 
04:27:55.510 --> 04:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
better quality
 
04:27:56.870 --> 04:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
of life in the living environment
 
04:27:59.189 --> 04:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
they're in
 
04:28:04.950 --> 04:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:06.389 --> 04:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you are the at
 
04:28:11.269 --> 04:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
least the second person today who's a
 
04:28:13.510 --> 04:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
member of the bail commission uh who's
 
04:28:16.149 --> 04:28:16.159 align:start position:0%
come to testify in front of us against
 
04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:28:19.030 --> 04:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
what i'm wondering about is what the
 
04:28:21.030 --> 04:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
status of the bail commission actually
 
04:28:22.950 --> 04:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
is at this time
 
04:28:25.990 --> 04:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
so are there additional meetings taking
 
04:28:26.000 --> 04:28:26.950 align:start position:0%
so are there additional meetings taking
place

04:28:26.950 --> 04:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
place
 
04:28:29.429 --> 04:28:29.439 align:start position:0%
are you reviewing legislation
 
04:28:30.950 --> 04:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
it sounds like there was not an
 
04:28:33.269 --> 04:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
opportunity to review this legislation
 
04:28:35.910 --> 04:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm just wondering
 
04:28:37.830 --> 04:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
where we stand right now in terms of the
 
04:28:40.149 --> 04:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
bail commission which i understand is
 
04:28:46.070 --> 04:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:48.389 --> 04:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
yes thank you um
 
04:28:50.550 --> 04:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um i the so the
 
04:28:52.550 --> 04:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
aclu was the representative uh was
 
04:28:55.110 --> 04:28:55.120 align:start position:0%
represented on the bail commission i
 
04:28:57.429 --> 04:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
myself was not a was not the
 
04:28:59.990 --> 04:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative or the member um
 
04:29:01.510 --> 04:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
what the status of the bail commission
 
04:29:03.910 --> 04:29:03.920 align:start position:0%
currently is i do not know the exact
 
04:29:07.830 --> 04:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
status for you um representative muse um
 
04:29:10.149 --> 04:29:10.159 align:start position:0%
i think i i i'm hoping that someone else
 
04:29:11.990 --> 04:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
on the line will be able to give you a
 
04:29:13.990 --> 04:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
more in-depth answer as to what its
 
04:29:16.550 --> 04:29:16.560 align:start position:0%
status is currently is but i do not i
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
don't know if it is
 
04:29:19.439 --> 04:29:20.469 align:start position:0%
don't know if it is
still

04:29:20.469 --> 04:29:20.479 align:start position:0%
still
 
04:29:23.349 --> 04:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
together reviewing legislation or not
 
04:29:40.389 --> 04:29:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:41.990 --> 04:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:29:43.189 --> 04:29:43.199 align:start position:0%
since you're in the room you're hard to
 
04:29:44.870 --> 04:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
hear but i think i
 
04:29:47.670 --> 04:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
i guess i did hear my name so
 
04:29:49.269 --> 04:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
this is probably a pretty basic question
 
04:29:49.279 --> 04:29:50.229 align:start position:0%
this is probably a pretty basic question
mr

04:29:50.229 --> 04:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
mr
 
04:29:52.309 --> 04:29:52.319 align:start position:0%
cause but the the rationale for this is
 
04:29:52.319 --> 04:29:53.189 align:start position:0%
cause but the the rationale for this is
that

04:29:53.189 --> 04:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:29:55.429 --> 04:29:55.439 align:start position:0%
some of these offenders uh
 
04:29:57.110 --> 04:29:57.120 align:start position:0%
suspects are in fact actually are
 
04:29:59.590 --> 04:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
dangerous um which obviously
 
04:30:01.830 --> 04:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
so if if somebody eventually goes to
 
04:30:05.030 --> 04:30:05.040 align:start position:0%
trial it's found to be dangerous and is
 
04:30:06.950 --> 04:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
sentenced um doesn't the
 
04:30:09.110 --> 04:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
time that they spent waiting
 
04:30:11.269 --> 04:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
to be bailed out doesn't that count for
 
04:30:12.790 --> 04:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
their sentence on when and if they're
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:18.000 --> 04:30:19.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:30:19.110 --> 04:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:20.710 --> 04:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
so representative i'm just gonna i'm
 
04:30:22.070 --> 04:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
just gonna repeat this back just to make
 
04:30:23.910 --> 04:30:23.920 align:start position:0%
sure i understand the questions that i'm
 
04:30:26.309 --> 04:30:26.319 align:start position:0%
being asked are you asking are you
 
04:30:30.309 --> 04:30:30.319 align:start position:0%
asking me if um a person who has been
 
04:30:32.149 --> 04:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
charged with an offense if their
 
04:30:34.950 --> 04:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
pre-trial time counts towards their
 
04:30:37.269 --> 04:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
sentence if they get convicted
 
04:30:37.279 --> 04:30:38.550 align:start position:0%
sentence if they get convicted
yes

04:30:38.550 --> 04:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:30:41.990 --> 04:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes so that pre-trial time does count
 
04:30:44.870 --> 04:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
towards a sentence if they get convicted
 
04:30:47.110 --> 04:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
and but but that's the point it's if
 
04:30:49.510 --> 04:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
they get convicted um
 
04:30:51.990 --> 04:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
and you you don't know that until they
 
04:30:54.550 --> 04:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
have their their day in court
 
04:30:56.790 --> 04:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
great thank you just thought i just
 
04:30:58.149 --> 04:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
thought i'd ask even though it's a very
 
04:31:00.389 --> 04:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
basic very very basic question thank you
 
04:31:00.399 --> 04:31:05.670 align:start position:0%
basic very very basic question thank you
absolutely

04:31:05.670 --> 04:31:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:07.670 --> 04:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands raised
 
04:31:08.790 --> 04:31:08.800 align:start position:0%
joseph thank you again for your
 
04:31:08.800 --> 04:31:11.510 align:start position:0%
joseph thank you again for your
testimony

04:31:11.510 --> 04:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:31:15.590 --> 04:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:16.950 --> 04:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
if there's any members of the public who
 
04:31:18.710 --> 04:31:18.720 align:start position:0%
wish to testify that are in attendance
 
04:31:21.750 --> 04:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
that have not testified already
 
04:31:41.429 --> 04:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:44.229 --> 04:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised
 
04:31:45.910 --> 04:31:45.920 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
04:31:49.429 --> 04:31:49.439 align:start position:0%
we will close the public hearing
 
04:31:53.349 --> 04:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:56.870 --> 04:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
and mr chair on the on sb 92 there were
 
04:31:59.910 --> 04:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
47 people who signed in in support of
 
04:32:00.790 --> 04:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
04:32:03.110 --> 04:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
and 81 people who signed in in
 
04:32:03.120 --> 04:32:09.030 align:start position:0%
and 81 people who signed in in
opposition

04:32:09.030 --> 04:32:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:09.040 --> 04:32:16.229 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

04:32:16.229 --> 04:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:23.030 --> 04:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:25.910 --> 04:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
mr chairman could you find out
 
04:32:30.070 --> 04:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
where that bail commissioner report went
 
04:32:31.910 --> 04:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
i was under the
 
04:32:33.429 --> 04:32:33.439 align:start position:0%
assumption that
 
04:32:35.830 --> 04:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
that commission would
 
04:32:38.710 --> 04:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
put it into legislation
 
04:32:40.389 --> 04:32:40.399 align:start position:0%
and i thought that was the only way it
 
04:32:48.710 --> 04:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:51.590 --> 04:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
the good news is that the vice chair is
 
04:32:53.030 --> 04:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
a member of that commission what i
 
04:32:53.040 --> 04:32:58.469 align:start position:0%
a member of that commission what i
understand

04:32:58.469 --> 04:32:58.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:02.389 --> 04:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
could he tell us where it went
 
04:33:04.390 --> 04:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
so far as i know
 
04:33:07.670 --> 04:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
i haven't been reappointed to it
 
04:33:10.709 --> 04:33:10.719 align:start position:0%
the commission still exists
 
04:33:12.869 --> 04:33:12.879 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:33:15.990 --> 04:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
but i haven't been meeting
 
04:33:19.590 --> 04:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
oh it's gotta be started up again
 
04:33:23.269 --> 04:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
further question to to the um
 
04:33:26.230 --> 04:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:29.269 --> 04:33:29.279 align:start position:0%
did it was this put in any of this put
 
04:33:34.789 --> 04:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:37.590 --> 04:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
i can determine what's in this bill was
 
04:33:39.269 --> 04:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
not subject to the commission's
 
04:33:39.279 --> 04:33:40.789 align:start position:0%
not subject to the commission's
discussion

04:33:40.789 --> 04:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
04:33:45.830 --> 04:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:48.869 --> 04:33:48.879 align:start position:0%
when he told you that they had
 
04:33:51.429 --> 04:33:51.439 align:start position:0%
some proposals none of which are in this
 
04:33:51.439 --> 04:33:52.040 align:start position:0%
some proposals none of which are in this
bill

04:33:52.040 --> 04:33:52.050 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:33:52.050 --> 04:33:55.670 align:start position:0%
bill
[Music]

04:33:55.670 --> 04:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:58.310 --> 04:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
would it be in another bill i mean i
 
04:34:00.551 --> 04:34:00.561 align:start position:0%
don't mr cher
 
04:34:00.561 --> 04:34:01.510 align:start position:0%
don't mr cher
said

04:34:01.510 --> 04:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
said
 
04:34:04.150 --> 04:34:04.160 align:start position:0%
it wasn't right to do anything now
 
04:34:06.709 --> 04:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
because it's only been seven months
 
04:34:13.910 --> 04:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:18.709 --> 04:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:23.830 --> 04:34:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:26.709 --> 04:34:26.719 align:start position:0%
so i'm just going off of peer review so
 
04:34:29.590 --> 04:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
i asked no one to take this
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
i know the difference
 
04:34:34.390 --> 04:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
bill passed last turn
 
04:34:34.400 --> 04:34:35.349 align:start position:0%
bill passed last turn
and

04:34:35.349 --> 04:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:37.189 --> 04:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
it was fast
 
04:34:50.070 --> 04:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:52.830 --> 04:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
i think it passed in our
 
04:34:55.029 --> 04:34:55.039 align:start position:0%
community so i don't know the effective
 
04:34:57.349 --> 04:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
date of that
 
04:34:59.590 --> 04:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that senate bill was the
 
04:35:02.551 --> 04:35:02.561 align:start position:0%
byproduct of the commission's work
 
04:35:05.269 --> 04:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:05.279 --> 04:35:06.709 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:35:06.709 --> 04:35:06.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:35:06.719 --> 04:35:19.029 align:start position:0%
but
when

04:35:19.029 --> 04:35:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:23.590 --> 04:35:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
no one else seemed to know about the
 
04:35:27.910 --> 04:35:27.920 align:start position:0%
billiard dog
 
04:35:30.230 --> 04:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
it was saying
 
04:35:32.789 --> 04:35:32.799 align:start position:0%
what was the past that we were doing and
 
04:35:36.390 --> 04:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
that's why he wanted to build change
 
04:35:37.990 --> 04:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
in 92
 
04:35:40.551 --> 04:35:40.561 align:start position:0%
and i i'm just curious to see where it
 
04:35:40.561 --> 04:35:48.070 align:start position:0%
and i i'm just curious to see where it
went

04:35:48.070 --> 04:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:52.150 --> 04:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:55.590 --> 04:35:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:59.990 --> 04:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:17.029 --> 04:36:17.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:19.990 --> 04:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
another one of those omnibus
 
04:36:20.000 --> 04:36:26.629 align:start position:0%
another one of those omnibus
yes

04:36:26.629 --> 04:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:26.639 --> 04:36:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
god

04:36:27.830 --> 04:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
god
 
04:36:34.230 --> 04:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:34.240 --> 04:36:35.750 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:36:35.750 --> 04:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:36:37.910 --> 04:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
i know what jeff bradley was trying to
 
04:36:37.920 --> 04:36:38.869 align:start position:0%
i know what jeff bradley was trying to
do

04:36:38.869 --> 04:36:38.879 align:start position:0%
do
 
04:36:38.879 --> 04:36:40.390 align:start position:0%
do
but

04:36:40.390 --> 04:36:40.400 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:36:44.949 --> 04:36:44.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:46.470 --> 04:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
just not
 
04:36:48.310 --> 04:36:48.320 align:start position:0%
the thing you're supposed to do you're
 
04:36:50.390 --> 04:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to have some subject
 
04:36:50.400 --> 04:36:51.590 align:start position:0%
supposed to have some subject
close

04:36:51.590 --> 04:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
close
 
04:36:53.510 --> 04:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
and put things together that are close
 
04:36:54.629 --> 04:36:54.639 align:start position:0%
to each other
 
04:36:54.639 --> 04:36:55.910 align:start position:0%
to each other
but

04:36:55.910 --> 04:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:37:03.830 --> 04:37:03.840 align:start position:0%

the question i have for the sheriff
 
04:39:04.230 --> 04:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
is i don't believe
 
04:39:06.390 --> 04:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
anybody to testified
 
04:39:09.189 --> 04:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
testified on section one or the last
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
section at all the only one that even
 
04:39:13.349 --> 04:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned it was philosophy
 
04:39:15.670 --> 04:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
that means you have two separate bills
 
04:39:18.830 --> 04:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:21.830 --> 04:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a fair question
 
04:39:25.349 --> 04:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
it is it's not a reasonable way to do it
 
04:39:28.230 --> 04:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the whole idea of the open
 
04:39:30.789 --> 04:39:30.799 align:start position:0%

since here
 
04:39:37.029 --> 04:39:37.039 align:start position:0%
if you had a chance to step testify on
 
04:39:37.039 --> 04:39:38.230 align:start position:0%

05:06:47.590 --> 05:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
05:06:50.470 --> 05:06:50.480 align:start position:0%
and they are still required by law and
 
05:06:52.868 --> 05:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
statute to participate so this is really
 
05:06:54.628 --> 05:06:54.638 align:start position:0%
just cleaning up
 
05:06:57.430 --> 05:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
the membership so that we can continue
 
05:07:00.948 --> 05:07:00.958 align:start position:0%
to have effective meetings with a quorum
 
05:07:00.958 --> 05:07:02.310 align:start position:0%
to have effective meetings with a quorum
and

05:07:02.310 --> 05:07:02.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:07:04.070 --> 05:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
i'm open to any questions that you may
 
05:07:05.750 --> 05:07:05.760 align:start position:0%
have but like i said this particular
 
05:07:07.750 --> 05:07:07.760 align:start position:0%
section is just a technical
 
05:07:09.030 --> 05:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
05:07:09.040 --> 05:07:16.708 align:start position:0%
part of the
bill

05:07:16.708 --> 05:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:18.708 --> 05:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised i want to thank
 
05:07:21.030 --> 05:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
up the representative
 
05:07:23.030 --> 05:07:23.040 align:start position:0%

05:07:24.788 --> 05:07:24.798 align:start position:0%
and thank you ma'am for taking my
 
05:07:24.798 --> 05:07:26.628 align:start position:0%
and thank you ma'am for taking my
question

05:07:26.628 --> 05:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:07:26.638 --> 05:07:28.230 align:start position:0%
question
uh

05:07:28.230 --> 05:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:07:29.910 --> 05:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
you're talking about part five of the
 
05:07:31.750 --> 05:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
bill we're talking about increasing
 
05:07:31.760 --> 05:07:32.788 align:start position:0%
bill we're talking about increasing
penalties

05:07:32.788 --> 05:07:32.798 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
05:07:35.270 --> 05:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
that's not a cleanup
 
05:07:35.280 --> 05:07:36.070 align:start position:0%
that's not a cleanup
um

05:07:36.070 --> 05:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:38.550 --> 05:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
sir the only part i was speaking to is
 
05:07:40.868 --> 05:07:40.878 align:start position:0%
part five section two
 
05:07:44.230 --> 05:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
like i said i i have no um background or
 
05:07:46.948 --> 05:07:46.958 align:start position:0%
information on any other section
 
05:07:49.190 --> 05:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
of this particular piece of legislation
 
05:07:51.670 --> 05:07:51.680 align:start position:0%
i'm not here to discuss the service dog
 
05:07:54.550 --> 05:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
issue in any way shape or form
 
05:07:56.390 --> 05:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
because this is an omnibus piece of
 
05:07:58.470 --> 05:07:58.480 align:start position:0%
legislation as you know there's many
 
05:08:00.470 --> 05:08:00.480 align:start position:0%
different things put together i'm not
 
05:08:03.110 --> 05:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
sure necessarily that this um this
 
05:08:05.430 --> 05:08:05.440 align:start position:0%
technical change is
 
05:08:07.190 --> 05:08:07.200 align:start position:0%
is best served in this piece of
 
05:08:09.270 --> 05:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
legislation but here we are
 
05:08:10.170 --> 05:08:10.180 align:start position:0%
and um
 
05:08:10.180 --> 05:08:11.910 align:start position:0%
and um
[Music]

05:08:11.910 --> 05:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
05:08:13.990 --> 05:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
and so i can't speak to the service dog
 
05:08:17.030 --> 05:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
issue at all i must read that mr chair
 
05:08:18.470 --> 05:08:18.480 align:start position:0%

05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:48.708 --> 05:08:48.718 align:start position:0%

take classes often the trial can take a
 
05:10:03.110 --> 05:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
long time to occur this would speed up
 
05:10:05.750 --> 05:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
the time to get their license back after

um
 
05:10:16.390 --> 05:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
paying their penalty
 
05:10:17.990 --> 05:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
and getting them back into their cars so
 
05:10:20.150 --> 05:10:20.160 align:start position:0%

go section by section if you want i can
 
05:10:26.868 --> 05:10:26.878 align:start position:0%
intro speak to all four sections if

05:10:35.270 --> 05:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh moving on to
 
05:10:37.990 --> 05:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
section two from senator ward
 
05:10:39.910 --> 05:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
this would provide exemptions from
 
05:10:41.990 --> 05:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
prosecution for victims of human
 
05:10:44.310 --> 05:10:44.320 align:start position:0%

victims of trafficking 18 years of age
 
05:10:49.270 --> 05:10:49.280 align:start position:0%
who is a direct victim of human
 
05:10:51.510 --> 05:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
trafficking they would not be subject to
 
05:10:53.350 --> 05:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
juvenile delinquency proceedings under
 
05:10:55.350 --> 05:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
rsa 160b
 
05:10:58.628 --> 05:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
for any otherwise chargeable offense
 
05:11:01.110 --> 05:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
including indecent exposure prostitution
 
05:11:03.990 --> 05:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
trafficking of persons or chargeables
 
05:11:06.868 --> 05:11:06.878 align:start position:0%
attempt conspiracy criminal solicitation
 
05:11:09.110 --> 05:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
being an accessory to or aiding and
 
05:11:10.948 --> 05:11:10.958 align:start position:0%
abetting to any of these
 
05:11:13.590 --> 05:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
offenses the bill also gives courts
 
05:11:15.750 --> 05:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
guidance on how to handle these cases
 
05:11:17.350 --> 05:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
senator ward worked closely with the
 
05:11:20.230 --> 05:11:20.240 align:start position:0%
coalition against domestic and sexual uh
 
05:11:21.750 --> 05:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
coalition against sexual and domestic
 
05:11:23.670 --> 05:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
violence and the new hampshire voters
 
05:11:25.830 --> 05:11:25.840 align:start position:0%
against human trafficking on this
 
05:11:27.830 --> 05:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
version of the bill
 
05:11:29.670 --> 05:11:29.680 align:start position:0%
and it's to apply only to the very
 
05:11:31.990 --> 05:11:32.000 align:start position:0%
specific offenses that are a direct
 
05:11:34.390 --> 05:11:34.400 align:start position:0%
result of being trafficked it does not
 
05:11:34.400 --> 05:11:35.350 align:start position:0%
result of being trafficked it does not
apply

05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
apply
 
05:11:35.360 --> 05:11:36.230 align:start position:0%
apply
to

05:11:36.230 --> 05:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:11:38.070 --> 05:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
any violent crimes or threats of
 
05:11:40.150 --> 05:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
violence those should be handled
 
05:11:42.868 --> 05:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
differently those are serious crimes
 
05:11:44.788 --> 05:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
and being a victim of domestic violence
 
05:11:47.110 --> 05:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
does not excuse you from prosecution
 
05:11:48.708 --> 05:11:48.718 align:start position:0%
under them
 
05:11:51.190 --> 05:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
but we think this is a good way to make
 
05:11:53.110 --> 05:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
sure that these victims are not
 
05:11:55.190 --> 05:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise victimized by the criminal
 
05:11:57.030 --> 05:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
justice system and appreciate your
 
05:11:58.830 --> 05:11:58.840 align:start position:0%
consideration of part
 
05:12:01.110 --> 05:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
two i'm moving on to part three from
 
05:12:03.590 --> 05:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
senator french this is a very uh simple
 
05:12:05.750 --> 05:12:05.760 align:start position:0%
bill a consequence of americans living
 
05:12:09.030 --> 05:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
longer it takes the uh guardianship by
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
grandparents currently in our laws and
 
05:12:13.910 --> 05:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
extends it to also deal with great and
 
05:12:15.750 --> 05:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
great great grandparents these are
 
05:12:18.070 --> 05:12:18.080 align:start position:0%
obviously rare cases but
 
05:12:20.390 --> 05:12:20.400 align:start position:0%
when possible for guardianship of young
 
05:12:20.400 --> 05:12:21.750 align:start position:0%
when possible for guardianship of young
children

05:12:21.750 --> 05:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
children
 
05:12:24.070 --> 05:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
05:12:25.910 --> 05:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
preference in our law to keep it in the
 
05:12:28.948 --> 05:12:28.958 align:start position:0%
family if possible this would allow that
 
05:12:28.958 --> 05:12:30.390 align:start position:0%
family if possible this would allow that
for

05:12:30.390 --> 05:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:12:33.030 --> 05:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
these families across generations
 
05:12:34.550 --> 05:12:34.560 align:start position:0%

05:12:56.470 --> 05:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
about reporting crimes due to fear of
 
05:12:59.030 --> 05:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
prosecution for their own activity this
 
05:13:00.550 --> 05:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
bill would open it up and give these
 
05:13:02.868 --> 05:13:02.878 align:start position:0%
women and men a safe path to call the
 
05:13:04.708 --> 05:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
police to seek help to seek medical
 
05:13:04.718 --> 05:13:05.830 align:start position:0%
police to seek help to seek medical
attention

05:13:05.830 --> 05:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
attention
 
05:13:08.550 --> 05:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
to report other more serious crimes
 
05:13:10.708 --> 05:13:10.718 align:start position:0%

and i want to thank you in advance for
 
05:14:19.590 --> 05:14:19.600 align:start position:0%
taking my question

part four
 
05:14:24.788 --> 05:14:24.798 align:start position:0%
when the effective date is
 
05:14:29.030 --> 05:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
january 1st 2021 but
 
05:14:29.040 --> 05:14:30.948 align:start position:0%
january 1st 2021 but
is

05:14:30.948 --> 05:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:14:34.708 --> 05:14:34.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:35.750 --> 05:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
similar to
 
05:14:44.070 --> 05:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:45.590 --> 05:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
i can check on that for you which house
 
05:14:48.310 --> 05:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
bill was at again
 
05:14:48.320 --> 05:14:49.830 align:start position:0%
bill was at again
123.

05:14:49.830 --> 05:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
123.
 
05:14:52.230 --> 05:14:52.240 align:start position:0%
how's bill 123 let me check on that
 
05:14:54.150 --> 05:14:54.160 align:start position:0%
and obviously as as bills move along
 
05:14:55.670 --> 05:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
through the process sometimes effective
 
05:14:58.868 --> 05:14:58.878 align:start position:0%
dates have to be moved back so
 
05:15:01.110 --> 05:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
and just to clarify that that bill
 
05:15:03.430 --> 05:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
passed by
 
05:15:05.190 --> 05:15:05.200 align:start position:0%
it's now in the
 
05:15:06.550 --> 05:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
initiating committee they already have
 
05:15:08.628 --> 05:15:08.638 align:start position:0%
the hearing on it but the committee made
 
05:15:10.708 --> 05:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
a recommendation i just i don't want us
 
05:15:12.708 --> 05:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
05:15:15.190 --> 05:15:15.200 align:start position:0%
get to our efforts
 
05:15:17.270 --> 05:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
uh if you may report backwards if that
 
05:15:20.070 --> 05:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
bill uh hosts the 123
 
05:15:22.150 --> 05:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
test as amended
 
05:15:24.230 --> 05:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
where they pass in the senate
 
05:15:26.868 --> 05:15:26.878 align:start position:0%
um we would obviously
 
05:15:29.190 --> 05:15:29.200 align:start position:0%
strike part four
 
05:15:31.270 --> 05:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
yeah as i understand it the judiciary
 
05:15:33.030 --> 05:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
committee held the hearing yesterday has
 
05:15:35.590 --> 05:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
not yet acted on that i can check with
 
05:15:38.310 --> 05:15:38.320 align:start position:0%
senator carson and see um
 
05:15:39.670 --> 05:15:39.680 align:start position:0%
what the judiciary the spirit of the
 
05:15:41.910 --> 05:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
judiciary committee is on that bill uh
 
05:15:52.150 --> 05:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:54.788 --> 05:15:54.798 align:start position:0%
did you recognize representative for her
 
05:15:54.798 --> 05:15:56.628 align:start position:0%
did you recognize representative for her
question

05:15:56.628 --> 05:15:56.638 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:15:59.110 --> 05:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
yes mr chair i just wanted to also uh
 
05:16:01.750 --> 05:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
just start by pointing out that uh hb
 
05:16:05.430 --> 05:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
123 the effective date uh as it appears
 
05:16:07.510 --> 05:16:07.520 align:start position:0%
in on the gen court website the the
 
05:16:08.708 --> 05:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
amended bill
 
05:16:14.390 --> 05:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:17.750 --> 05:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
my question uh for mr bossie is
 
05:16:17.760 --> 05:16:18.948 align:start position:0%
my question uh for mr bossie is
um

05:16:18.948 --> 05:16:18.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:20.230 --> 05:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
can you
 
05:16:22.310 --> 05:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
let people who may not be familiar with
 
05:16:24.788 --> 05:16:24.798 align:start position:0%
the processes of the senate in the house
 
05:16:26.470 --> 05:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
know why
 
05:16:28.708 --> 05:16:28.718 align:start position:0%
a mirror version of a bill that we just
 
05:16:28.718 --> 05:16:30.070 align:start position:0%
a mirror version of a bill that we just
passed

05:16:30.070 --> 05:16:30.080 align:start position:0%
passed
 
05:16:31.990 --> 05:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
earlier in the month
 
05:16:33.430 --> 05:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
in the house
 
05:16:36.150 --> 05:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
is appearing in a senate omnibus bill
 
05:16:38.230 --> 05:16:38.240 align:start position:0%
and i'm speaking specifically of section
 
05:16:41.750 --> 05:16:41.760 align:start position:0%
4 and hb 123.
 
05:16:43.510 --> 05:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh well representative as you know any
 
05:16:45.510 --> 05:16:45.520 align:start position:0%
any representative in any senator can
 
05:16:48.788 --> 05:16:48.798 align:start position:0%
introduce a bill um in normal times
 
05:16:51.110 --> 05:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
there's often coordination through ols
 
05:16:54.150 --> 05:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
to try to winnow down uh similar bills
 
05:16:56.470 --> 05:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
across chambers and with people working
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
remotely sometimes that doesn't happen
 
05:17:01.350 --> 05:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
and this year in particular we've seen a
 
05:17:03.670 --> 05:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
lot of duplicates uh sometimes even
 
05:17:05.510 --> 05:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
within the same chamber you'll have two
 
05:17:07.590 --> 05:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
or three bills with very similar subject
 
05:17:07.600 --> 05:17:08.948 align:start position:0%
or three bills with very similar subject
matter

05:17:08.948 --> 05:17:08.958 align:start position:0%
matter
 
05:17:10.788 --> 05:17:10.798 align:start position:0%
and i think in several of your
 
05:17:12.788 --> 05:17:12.798 align:start position:0%
committees you've seen that happen where
 
05:17:15.110 --> 05:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
um there'll be several bills that
 
05:17:17.270 --> 05:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
probably are getting at the same thing
 
05:17:19.190 --> 05:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh and individual representatives or
 
05:17:20.788 --> 05:17:20.798 align:start position:0%
senators had slightly different ways of
 
05:17:23.670 --> 05:17:23.680 align:start position:0%
going about it so this was an idea that
 
05:17:25.430 --> 05:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
the house had and pushed forward this
 
05:17:27.030 --> 05:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
was an idea the senate had and pushed
 
05:17:28.948 --> 05:17:28.958 align:start position:0%
forward they crossed in the night
 
05:17:31.190 --> 05:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
they're now in the opposite chambers and
 
05:17:32.708 --> 05:17:32.718 align:start position:0%
uh they seem destined for a conference
 
05:17:35.430 --> 05:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
committee at some point um either
 
05:17:37.590 --> 05:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
and it's just a matter of deciding which
 
05:17:39.350 --> 05:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
vehicle is going to be the one that uh
 
05:17:42.550 --> 05:17:42.560 align:start position:0%
the general court sends to the governor
 
05:17:44.070 --> 05:17:44.080 align:start position:0%
but i don't think there was any specific
 
05:17:46.230 --> 05:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
intention to have duplicates that's just
 
05:17:48.070 --> 05:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
the way the legislative process cooked
 
05:17:48.080 --> 05:17:51.830 align:start position:0%
the way the legislative process cooked
out

05:17:51.830 --> 05:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:53.350 --> 05:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative recognized for a
 
05:17:53.360 --> 05:17:54.550 align:start position:0%
representative recognized for a
follow-up

05:17:54.550 --> 05:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:17:55.590 --> 05:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:17:55.600 --> 05:17:57.110 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

05:17:57.110 --> 05:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:58.948 --> 05:17:58.958 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that this was one of
 
05:18:00.708 --> 05:18:00.718 align:start position:0%
the bills that
 
05:18:03.510 --> 05:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
was passed last year in the house and uh
 
05:18:06.310 --> 05:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:08.788 --> 05:18:08.798 align:start position:0%
was tabled in the senate uh because of
 
05:18:08.798 --> 05:18:09.750 align:start position:0%
was tabled in the senate uh because of
covet

05:18:09.750 --> 05:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
covet
 
05:18:09.760 --> 05:18:10.948 align:start position:0%
covet
um

05:18:10.948 --> 05:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:12.550 --> 05:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i'm curious about
 
05:18:15.590 --> 05:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
is given the amount of elapsed time
 
05:18:17.270 --> 05:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
and given the fact that the senate has
 
05:18:19.110 --> 05:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
office staff that we don't have
 
05:18:20.948 --> 05:18:20.958 align:start position:0%
necessarily in the house
 
05:18:22.868 --> 05:18:22.878 align:start position:0%
how is it possible for a representative
 
05:18:24.550 --> 05:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
not to be contacted
 
05:18:27.270 --> 05:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh on a on a bill like this and looking
 
05:18:29.830 --> 05:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
at the language of the of of section
 
05:18:33.270 --> 05:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
four and the language of hb 123
 
05:18:33.280 --> 05:18:34.390 align:start position:0%
four and the language of hb 123
um

05:18:34.390 --> 05:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:36.708 --> 05:18:36.718 align:start position:0%
they are identical
 
05:18:36.718 --> 05:18:37.510 align:start position:0%
they are identical
which

05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:18:40.708 --> 05:18:40.718 align:start position:0%
is doesn't indicate that two people had
 
05:18:43.670 --> 05:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
an independent thought at the same time
 
05:18:45.510 --> 05:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
so i'm just curious if you'd like to
 
05:18:48.230 --> 05:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
comment on that
 
05:18:50.150 --> 05:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
i couldn't comment on what senators were
 
05:18:51.990 --> 05:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
thinking i think a lot of the bills that
 
05:18:53.750 --> 05:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
were um
 
05:18:56.708 --> 05:18:56.718 align:start position:0%
stalled before the finish line last year
 
05:18:58.150 --> 05:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
came back
 
05:19:00.070 --> 05:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
and and different people went to
 
05:19:02.230 --> 05:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
representatives and senators and uh
 
05:19:04.390 --> 05:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
frankly the coordination with people not
 
05:19:06.788 --> 05:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
being in the building at the same time
 
05:19:08.868 --> 05:19:08.878 align:start position:0%
uh during filing periods in november and
 
05:19:08.878 --> 05:19:09.910 align:start position:0%
uh during filing periods in november and
december

05:19:09.910 --> 05:19:09.920 align:start position:0%
december
 
05:19:11.430 --> 05:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh probably meant we had more
 
05:19:13.510 --> 05:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
duplication than we used to have uh and
 
05:19:16.948 --> 05:19:16.958 align:start position:0%
that's because bill's crossed chambers
 
05:19:18.948 --> 05:19:18.958 align:start position:0%
you know we get to the point that uh the
 
05:19:20.788 --> 05:19:20.798 align:start position:0%
house and the senate will eventually
 
05:19:24.070 --> 05:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
decide you know which bill goes forward
 
05:19:38.150 --> 05:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:39.830 --> 05:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
there was two versions of the
 
05:19:39.840 --> 05:19:41.510 align:start position:0%
there was two versions of the
phillymatic

05:19:41.510 --> 05:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
phillymatic
 
05:19:43.030 --> 05:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
if the house version gives a center
 
05:19:43.040 --> 05:19:44.310 align:start position:0%
if the house version gives a center
question

05:19:44.310 --> 05:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:19:45.510 --> 05:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
okay it's
 
05:19:47.590 --> 05:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
in my short time here
 
05:19:48.788 --> 05:19:48.798 align:start position:0%
so it's not
 
05:19:50.390 --> 05:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's just tough for the witness to say
 
05:19:52.628 --> 05:19:52.638 align:start position:0%
what the senators would think
 
05:19:54.230 --> 05:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
i don't think that it's
 
05:19:56.550 --> 05:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
if they cloned or copied uh
 
05:20:00.070 --> 05:20:00.080 align:start position:0%
hp 123 that's a credit to
 
05:20:02.788 --> 05:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
credit for the quality of hp 123. and i
 
05:20:08.390 --> 05:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:15.030 --> 05:20:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:17.030 --> 05:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chair and thank you for taking
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
my question back to senator french
 
05:20:21.990 --> 05:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
because i did um testify in front of the
 
05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
senate yesterday with this bill and he
 
05:20:27.110 --> 05:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
had some tough questions for me so i
 
05:20:29.350 --> 05:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
would like you to ask him
 
05:20:29.360 --> 05:20:30.150 align:start position:0%
would like you to ask him
what

05:20:30.150 --> 05:20:30.160 align:start position:0%
what
 
05:20:32.788 --> 05:20:32.798 align:start position:0%
he has the problem with if he was going
 
05:20:34.708 --> 05:20:34.718 align:start position:0%
to take the exact same language and put
 
05:20:36.948 --> 05:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
in this omnibus bill if you could
 
05:20:39.990 --> 05:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
um get more information on exactly what
 
05:20:43.670 --> 05:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
his concerns are because i'm very now
 
05:20:45.990 --> 05:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
confused myself since i've been
 
05:20:49.030 --> 05:20:49.040 align:start position:0%
introducing this exact same legislation
 
05:20:50.830 --> 05:20:50.840 align:start position:0%
two years in a
 
05:20:53.190 --> 05:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
row i will check with senator french on
 
05:21:08.150 --> 05:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:10.470 --> 05:21:10.480 align:start position:0%
anyone else any members have any
 
05:21:16.310 --> 05:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:18.070 --> 05:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
representatives do you have a follow-up
 
05:21:18.080 --> 05:21:21.270 align:start position:0%
representatives do you have a follow-up
question

05:21:21.270 --> 05:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:27.750 --> 05:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:29.110 --> 05:21:29.120 align:start position:0%

uh if i could just speak real quickly i
 
05:22:05.590 --> 05:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
was very confused when testifying before
 
05:22:08.390 --> 05:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
the senate yesterday and senator frank
 
05:22:10.390 --> 05:22:10.400 align:start position:0%

05:22:14.070 --> 05:22:14.080 align:start position:0%

i'll have to play it back and watch it
 
05:22:25.670 --> 05:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:36.708 --> 05:22:36.718 align:start position:0%

the committee my name is pamela kyleck
 
05:22:42.948 --> 05:22:42.958 align:start position:0%
and i am the public policy specialist at
 
05:22:44.310 --> 05:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire coalition against

domestic and sexual violence i am here
 
05:22:49.750 --> 05:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
in support of sb 122
 
05:22:52.230 --> 05:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
specifically parts two and four which
 
05:22:54.150 --> 05:22:54.160 align:start position:0%
relate to exemptions from prosecution
 
05:22:56.070 --> 05:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
for victims of human trafficking and
 
05:22:57.910 --> 05:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
granting immunity from prosecution for
 
05:23:00.150 --> 05:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
victims of sexual assault the coalition
 
05:23:02.150 --> 05:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
did not initiate the bill but worked
 
05:23:03.910 --> 05:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
with the sponsors and senate judiciary
 
05:23:05.910 --> 05:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
committee to amend these two provisions
 
05:23:07.990 --> 05:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
and we support the bill as amended thank
 
05:23:09.510 --> 05:23:09.520 align:start position:0%
you so much for this opportunity to
 
05:23:11.270 --> 05:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
testify today
 
05:23:13.990 --> 05:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
just briefly on part two new hampshire's
 
05:23:15.350 --> 05:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
human trafficking statute has
 
05:23:17.030 --> 05:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
successfully worked to ensure that
 
05:23:18.868 --> 05:23:18.878 align:start position:0%
victims are able to vacate certain
 
05:23:21.030 --> 05:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
convictions for charges brought against
 
05:23:22.628 --> 05:23:22.638 align:start position:0%
them as a direct result of being
 
05:23:24.628 --> 05:23:24.638 align:start position:0%
trafficked while also upholding
 
05:23:26.390 --> 05:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
important safeguards to ensure that
 
05:23:28.230 --> 05:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
traffickers can be prosecuted for their
 
05:23:30.550 --> 05:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
crimes as amended this bill maintains
 
05:23:32.230 --> 05:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
that standard and will ensure that human
 
05:23:33.830 --> 05:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
trafficking cases can be effectively
 
05:23:36.150 --> 05:23:36.160 align:start position:0%
prosecuted while also recognizing the
 
05:23:38.390 --> 05:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
complex and nuanced reality experienced
 
05:23:40.550 --> 05:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
by human trafficking victims
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
in terms of part 4
 
05:23:45.110 --> 05:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
as you noted the last speaker noted
 
05:23:48.230 --> 05:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
section 4 is identical to hb123 a bill
 
05:23:50.070 --> 05:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
that your committee previously supported
 
05:23:51.830 --> 05:23:51.840 align:start position:0%
and helped pass the house we
 
05:23:53.670 --> 05:23:53.680 align:start position:0%
fundamentally believe that the fear of
 
05:23:55.430 --> 05:23:55.440 align:start position:0%
being arrested should never prohibit a
 
05:23:57.190 --> 05:23:57.200 align:start position:0%
victim from reporting that they have
 
05:23:59.030 --> 05:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
been sexually assaulted and this
 
05:24:00.788 --> 05:24:00.798 align:start position:0%
protection should apply to individuals
 
05:24:02.788 --> 05:24:02.798 align:start position:0%
who engage in prostitution
 
05:24:04.550 --> 05:24:04.560 align:start position:0%
who are particularly vulnerable to
 
05:24:06.070 --> 05:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
sexual violence
 
05:24:08.070 --> 05:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
most importantly through the passage of
 
05:24:09.830 --> 05:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
this bill new hampshire will be aligned
 
05:24:11.670 --> 05:24:11.680 align:start position:0%
with federal policy and ensure
 
05:24:13.270 --> 05:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
compliance with the violence against
 
05:24:15.590 --> 05:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
women's act or vawa which prohibits
 
05:24:17.670 --> 05:24:17.680 align:start position:0%
states from requiring a victim of sexual
 
05:24:19.510 --> 05:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
assault to participate in the criminal
 
05:24:21.670 --> 05:24:21.680 align:start position:0%
justice system or cooperating with law
 
05:24:23.190 --> 05:24:23.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement in order to receive a
 
05:24:26.150 --> 05:24:26.160 align:start position:0%
forensic medical exam or other
 
05:24:27.910 --> 05:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
services that they're entitled to by the
 
05:24:31.510 --> 05:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
state in conclusion sb122 is aligned
 
05:24:33.030 --> 05:24:33.040 align:start position:0%
with our state efforts to support
 
05:24:34.628 --> 05:24:34.638 align:start position:0%
victims of both human trafficking and
 
05:24:36.708 --> 05:24:36.718 align:start position:0%
sexual assault and we urge the committee
 
05:24:38.470 --> 05:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
to support this bill
 
05:24:40.070 --> 05:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and i'd be happy to
 
05:24:45.910 --> 05:24:45.920 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you for your testimony
 
05:24:50.868 --> 05:24:50.878 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised the witness is
 
05:24:50.878 --> 05:25:10.070 align:start position:0%
seeing no hands raised the witness is
excused

05:25:10.070 --> 05:25:10.080 align:start position:0%

i've looked at both
 
05:26:01.270 --> 05:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
the current vacator bill in new
 
05:26:03.830 --> 05:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire hb 189
 
05:26:03.840 --> 05:26:04.948 align:start position:0%
hampshire hb 189
and

05:26:04.948 --> 05:26:04.958 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:26:07.910 --> 05:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
i think that this new bill puts new
 
05:26:09.670 --> 05:26:09.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire um
 
05:26:11.990 --> 05:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
in line with a more modernization of
 
05:26:14.470 --> 05:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
vacator bills and makes it useful with
 
05:26:15.830 --> 05:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
the for the lived experience of
 
05:26:15.840 --> 05:26:17.910 align:start position:0%
the for the lived experience of
survivors

05:26:17.910 --> 05:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
survivors
 
05:26:19.430 --> 05:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
as we know human trafficking is very
 
05:26:22.070 --> 05:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
complex crime it takes numerous forms
 
05:26:23.990 --> 05:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
and many survivors don't fit into a neat
 
05:26:24.000 --> 05:26:25.030 align:start position:0%
and many survivors don't fit into a neat
story

05:26:25.030 --> 05:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
story
 
05:26:27.590 --> 05:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
that we would maybe read in a textbook
 
05:26:29.590 --> 05:26:29.600 align:start position:0%
i consulted with the polaris project
 
05:26:31.990 --> 05:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
which is a leading federal organization
 
05:26:33.750 --> 05:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
on human trafficking
 
05:26:33.760 --> 05:26:34.628 align:start position:0%
on human trafficking
they

05:26:34.628 --> 05:26:34.638 align:start position:0%
they
 
05:26:37.030 --> 05:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
they run the national hotline they do
 
05:26:39.350 --> 05:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
extensive research in human trafficking
 
05:26:41.350 --> 05:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
and about a year ago they came up with a
 
05:26:43.750 --> 05:26:43.760 align:start position:0%
report card for vacator bills
 
05:26:45.590 --> 05:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
but right now they're about 29 states
 
05:26:47.270 --> 05:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
that have these bills and they decided
 
05:26:49.110 --> 05:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
to rate those bills and help to bring
 
05:26:51.110 --> 05:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
all of this bills into a more modern way
 
05:26:52.868 --> 05:26:52.878 align:start position:0%
some of them are quite old including new
 
05:26:55.030 --> 05:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
york's the first in the nation
 
05:26:56.230 --> 05:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
who's going through the same process
 
05:26:57.350 --> 05:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
right now that we're talking about now
 
05:26:59.670 --> 05:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
in part two um and unfortunately new
 
05:27:01.510 --> 05:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
hammer new hampshire's score with
 
05:27:04.230 --> 05:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
polaris was only 44 out of a hundred
 
05:27:07.270 --> 05:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
rendering it almost useless uh for the
 
05:27:09.270 --> 05:27:09.280 align:start position:0%
majority of survivors
 
05:27:11.190 --> 05:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire survivors of course
 
05:27:15.030 --> 05:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
deserve a 100 out of 100.
 
05:27:16.628 --> 05:27:16.638 align:start position:0%
two of the most important aspects that
 
05:27:19.270 --> 05:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
needed to be addressed are to
 
05:27:22.470 --> 05:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
increase the eligible offenses
 
05:27:24.230 --> 05:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
that are available to be vacated and to
 
05:27:26.868 --> 05:27:26.878 align:start position:0%
have people victims of all ages qualify
 
05:27:28.948 --> 05:27:28.958 align:start position:0%
to vacate their convictions
 
05:27:30.548 --> 05:27:30.558 align:start position:0%
and just to close i'll tell a quick
 
05:27:32.628 --> 05:27:32.638 align:start position:0%
story about one of my clients which is
 
05:27:35.350 --> 05:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
really typical of the many many people
 
05:27:37.590 --> 05:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
i've worked with who have been survivors
 
05:27:39.990 --> 05:27:40.000 align:start position:0%
of trafficking over the years um very
 
05:27:42.948 --> 05:27:42.958 align:start position:0%
typical story uh so just her name was
 
05:27:44.470 --> 05:27:44.480 align:start position:0%
jessica and she was trafficked into
 
05:27:47.270 --> 05:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
prostitution at the age of 23 by a man
 
05:27:48.948 --> 05:27:48.958 align:start position:0%
who posed as her boyfriend and then
 
05:27:51.030 --> 05:27:51.040 align:start position:0%
maintained control over her for five
 
05:27:55.430 --> 05:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
years by using threats against her child
 
05:27:57.510 --> 05:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
eventually she escaped and once she did
 
05:27:59.750 --> 05:27:59.760 align:start position:0%
escape she had ten convictions for
 
05:28:02.310 --> 05:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
prostitution and two for shoplifting her
 
05:28:04.070 --> 05:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
trafficker induced her to occasionally
 
05:28:06.470 --> 05:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
shop with items he used to make drugs
 
05:28:10.150 --> 05:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
to avoid detection of the pharmacies etc
 
05:28:11.590 --> 05:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
with the help of social workers in her
 
05:28:13.430 --> 05:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
religious community jessica escaped and
 
05:28:15.350 --> 05:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
secured her child's safety
 
05:28:16.948 --> 05:28:16.958 align:start position:0%
and she really wanted to rebuild her
 
05:28:18.708 --> 05:28:18.718 align:start position:0%
life and she wanted to join the
 
05:28:20.390 --> 05:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
regulated work market she wanted to work
 
05:28:22.548 --> 05:28:22.558 align:start position:0%
in her money and her dream was to become
 
05:28:24.230 --> 05:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
a home health aide or a school crossing
 
05:28:25.430 --> 05:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
guard those are the things she really
 
05:28:27.670 --> 05:28:27.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to help others and give back
 
05:28:29.670 --> 05:28:29.680 align:start position:0%
but both these fields
 
05:28:31.830 --> 05:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
had job openings but she found quickly
 
05:28:33.510 --> 05:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
that with her record she could not get a
 
05:28:35.510 --> 05:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
job in almost any field that she was
 
05:28:37.750 --> 05:28:37.760 align:start position:0%
interested in or any field that that at
 
05:28:40.150 --> 05:28:40.160 align:start position:0%
all with this criminal record
 
05:28:42.548 --> 05:28:42.558 align:start position:0%
she was able to vacate her conviction
 
05:28:44.470 --> 05:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
convictions and she was able to get a
 
05:28:46.548 --> 05:28:46.558 align:start position:0%
dream job in one of these fields
 
05:28:46.558 --> 05:28:47.510 align:start position:0%
dream job in one of these fields
um

05:28:47.510 --> 05:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:49.750 --> 05:28:49.760 align:start position:0%
i i tell this story to explain exactly
 
05:28:51.110 --> 05:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
how this law works and how it's
 
05:28:53.110 --> 05:28:53.120 align:start position:0%
extremely important without vacating
 
05:28:54.708 --> 05:28:54.718 align:start position:0%
this and she was an adult when she was
 
05:28:56.628 --> 05:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
trafficked a young adult if she wasn't
 
05:28:58.948 --> 05:28:58.958 align:start position:0%
able to vacate these she she would have
 
05:29:01.270 --> 05:29:01.280 align:start position:0%
wound up in an unregulated work market
 
05:29:02.708 --> 05:29:02.718 align:start position:0%
she would never been able to realize her
 
05:29:05.270 --> 05:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
dreams or heal from her ordeal so really
 
05:29:07.270 --> 05:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
express support for this
 
05:29:08.548 --> 05:29:08.558 align:start position:0%
part two
 
05:29:08.558 --> 05:29:09.670 align:start position:0%
part two
um

05:29:09.670 --> 05:29:09.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:29:11.510 --> 05:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
finally i want to also express my
 
05:29:13.430 --> 05:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
support for part four
 
05:29:16.070 --> 05:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
as we have discussed here today this uh
 
05:29:17.910 --> 05:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
this part has been discussed in other
 
05:29:19.990 --> 05:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
hearings so i won't elaborate but i
 
05:29:22.548 --> 05:29:22.558 align:start position:0%
strongly support in my many years of
 
05:29:24.788 --> 05:29:24.798 align:start position:0%
um of working as a social worker with
 
05:29:26.470 --> 05:29:26.480 align:start position:0%
these survivors that
 
05:29:28.948 --> 05:29:28.958 align:start position:0%
they are afraid to come forward they are
 
05:29:31.350 --> 05:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
afraid to to report some of the most
 
05:29:32.948 --> 05:29:32.958 align:start position:0%
horrific crimes that are taking place in
 
05:29:34.310 --> 05:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
our society and
 
05:29:35.590 --> 05:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
it is really
 
05:29:37.030 --> 05:29:37.040 align:start position:0%
on us
 
05:29:38.708 --> 05:29:38.718 align:start position:0%
to create an environment where people
 
05:29:40.788 --> 05:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
who want to report these criminals who
 
05:29:43.190 --> 05:29:43.200 align:start position:0%
pose as the clients of sex workers to
 
05:29:45.430 --> 05:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
come forward and get these guys off the
 
05:29:47.750 --> 05:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
street so i really support uh part four
 
05:29:48.948 --> 05:29:48.958 align:start position:0%
even though i understand we have all
 
05:29:50.788 --> 05:29:50.798 align:start position:0%
discussed it before
 
05:29:54.450 --> 05:29:54.460 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:54.460 --> 05:29:57.110 align:start position:0%

their criminal record which continues to
 
05:31:57.430 --> 05:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
settle them
 
05:32:00.150 --> 05:32:00.160 align:start position:0%
with this insurmountable burden even
 
05:32:01.670 --> 05:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
after they leave
 
05:32:01.680 --> 05:32:03.190 align:start position:0%
after they leave
um

05:32:03.190 --> 05:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:32:04.708 --> 05:32:04.718 align:start position:0%
even after they're able to escape from
 
05:32:07.430 --> 05:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
their traffickers in fact i was just
 
05:32:09.670 --> 05:32:09.680 align:start position:0%
called two days ago
 
05:32:11.910 --> 05:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
by a former client of mine who i helped
 
05:32:14.310 --> 05:32:14.320 align:start position:0%
to vacate numerous convictions uh in a
 
05:32:16.390 --> 05:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
few different different jurisdictions
 
05:32:18.708 --> 05:32:18.718 align:start position:0%
and she is about to complete her
 
05:32:20.548 --> 05:32:20.558 align:start position:0%
paralegal certificate
 
05:32:22.948 --> 05:32:22.958 align:start position:0%
and she would not have been able to do
 
05:32:25.510 --> 05:32:25.520 align:start position:0%
so and to work as a paralegal
 
05:32:27.030 --> 05:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
if she had still been saddled with a
 
05:32:31.750 --> 05:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
criminal record so i urge you to um
 
05:32:34.150 --> 05:32:34.160 align:start position:0%
to support this bill i'm happy to answer
 
05:32:36.788 --> 05:32:36.798 align:start position:0%
any questions uh technical questions as
 
05:32:38.868 --> 05:32:38.878 align:start position:0%
it relates to vacation motions i want to
 
05:32:40.230 --> 05:32:40.240 align:start position:0%
make very clear
 
05:32:42.230 --> 05:32:42.240 align:start position:0%
that these motions are
 
05:32:45.510 --> 05:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty high burden for the person
 
05:32:47.510 --> 05:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
coming forward to show that they are a
 
05:32:49.830 --> 05:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
victim and to show that the convictions
 
05:32:53.430 --> 05:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
arose as a result of being trafficked so
 
05:32:57.670 --> 05:32:57.680 align:start position:0%
it is certainly by no means is it um
 
05:32:59.910 --> 05:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
you know just a wide open door for
 
05:33:02.708 --> 05:33:02.718 align:start position:0%
people to erase their records it is
 
05:33:05.510 --> 05:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
quite it is quite a high burden
 
05:33:07.750 --> 05:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
um but we should really allow everyone
 
05:33:10.628 --> 05:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
that meets the standard to be able to to
 
05:33:12.470 --> 05:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
vacate their convictions thank you so
 
05:33:22.150 --> 05:33:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:23.750 --> 05:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative you're recognized for
 
05:33:25.430 --> 05:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
your question
 
05:33:27.430 --> 05:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
yes so thank you for taking my question
 
05:33:28.390 --> 05:33:28.400 align:start position:0%
just a
 
05:33:32.230 --> 05:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
a a quick hypothetical i'm i'm wondering
 
05:33:32.240 --> 05:33:33.670 align:start position:0%
a a quick hypothetical i'm i'm wondering
if

05:33:33.670 --> 05:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
if
 
05:33:35.510 --> 05:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
if a person who's a victim of human
 
05:33:35.520 --> 05:33:36.628 align:start position:0%
if a person who's a victim of human
trafficking

05:33:36.628 --> 05:33:36.638 align:start position:0%
trafficking
 
05:33:36.638 --> 05:33:38.070 align:start position:0%
trafficking
um

05:33:38.070 --> 05:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:33:40.230 --> 05:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
kills the person who's responsible for
 
05:33:42.548 --> 05:33:42.558 align:start position:0%
trafficking her um
 
05:33:43.750 --> 05:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
05:33:45.350 --> 05:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
vacated under the bill that we're
 
05:33:47.830 --> 05:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
considering now
 
05:33:50.310 --> 05:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
you know that's a really important
 
05:33:51.990 --> 05:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
question that were
 
05:33:53.590 --> 05:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
you know in and
 
05:33:55.670 --> 05:33:55.680 align:start position:0%
i am located in new york that we are
 
05:33:58.470 --> 05:33:58.480 align:start position:0%
also grappling with in our quest to
 
05:34:01.110 --> 05:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
expand our current vacation statute and
 
05:34:03.350 --> 05:34:03.360 align:start position:0%
the answer is
 
05:34:06.150 --> 05:34:06.160 align:start position:0%
potential excuse me potentially but with
 
05:34:10.390 --> 05:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
a very very large caveat right that all
 
05:34:14.070 --> 05:34:14.080 align:start position:0%
this does is allow that conversation
 
05:34:17.110 --> 05:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
via the the litigation to occur
 
05:34:20.470 --> 05:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
it is certainly by no means a stamp of
 
05:34:24.150 --> 05:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
approval to vacate that conviction it
 
05:34:28.628 --> 05:34:28.638 align:start position:0%
simply allows a court right a prosecutor
 
05:34:31.350 --> 05:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
to hear the facts a judge to hear the
 
05:34:34.548 --> 05:34:34.558 align:start position:0%
facts and to make a determination
 
05:34:36.470 --> 05:34:36.480 align:start position:0%
based on a particular set of
 
05:34:39.670 --> 05:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
circumstances so again look at it as a
 
05:34:40.868 --> 05:34:40.878 align:start position:0%
way of
 
05:34:43.190 --> 05:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
being able to just have that
 
05:34:45.750 --> 05:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
conversation in a court of law it is
 
05:34:48.708 --> 05:34:48.718 align:start position:0%
certainly not dictating what the outcome
 
05:34:51.430 --> 05:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:52.470 --> 05:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:35:00.310 --> 05:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:03.270 --> 05:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
see you know for the hands raised
 
05:35:04.788 --> 05:35:04.798 align:start position:0%
with us
 
05:35:16.548 --> 05:35:16.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:16.558 --> 05:35:17.590 align:start position:0%

05:35:24.868 --> 05:35:24.878 align:start position:0%
hello can you hear me

yes
 
05:35:28.628 --> 05:35:28.638 align:start position:0%
excellent again my name for the record
 
05:35:31.430 --> 05:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
is ryan donnelly i am an advocacy
 
05:35:33.350 --> 05:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
coordinator with granite state
 
05:35:35.030 --> 05:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
independent living
 
05:35:37.990 --> 05:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
gsil is a statewide non-profit
 
05:35:40.868 --> 05:35:40.878 align:start position:0%
organization that advocates and provides
 
05:35:43.350 --> 05:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
services for seniors and people with
 
05:35:45.670 --> 05:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
disabilities who wish to remain
 
05:35:47.430 --> 05:35:47.440 align:start position:0%
independent in their homes and
 
05:35:49.670 --> 05:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
communities and i'm speaking to you
 
05:35:54.150 --> 05:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
today in support of sb 122 specifically
 
05:35:57.670 --> 05:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
on part 5 section 1 of the bill which
 
05:36:00.470 --> 05:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
enhances the penalties against those who
 
05:36:04.548 --> 05:36:04.558 align:start position:0%
willfully cause harm to a service animal
 
05:36:06.788 --> 05:36:06.798 align:start position:0%
i'm also speaking to you today as
 
05:36:08.628 --> 05:36:08.638 align:start position:0%
someone who has owned and used service
 
05:36:10.390 --> 05:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
animals in the past
 
05:36:12.948 --> 05:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
i know firsthand the importance of the
 
05:36:15.750 --> 05:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
work they do as do many of gsil's
 
05:36:18.070 --> 05:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
consumers and staff who have also
 
05:36:20.310 --> 05:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
benefited from the use of service
 
05:36:22.310 --> 05:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
animals in their lives
 
05:36:24.070 --> 05:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
these dogs are not just lovable
 
05:36:26.788 --> 05:36:26.798 align:start position:0%
companions they are instruments that can
 
05:36:29.110 --> 05:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
allow people with disabilities to live
 
05:36:32.070 --> 05:36:32.080 align:start position:0%
fuller more independent lives and live
 
05:36:33.750 --> 05:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
out in their community
 
05:36:35.830 --> 05:36:35.840 align:start position:0%
if anything were to happen to a service
 
05:36:38.230 --> 05:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
dog that made them unable to perform
 
05:36:41.110 --> 05:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
their tasks that impacts not only the
 
05:36:43.670 --> 05:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
animal but also places a tremendous
 
05:36:46.868 --> 05:36:46.878 align:start position:0%
hardship on their owner
 
05:36:48.868 --> 05:36:48.878 align:start position:0%
in light of this and in light of
 
05:36:51.030 --> 05:36:51.040 align:start position:0%
learning that service animals are
 
05:36:54.070 --> 05:36:54.080 align:start position:0%
offered no enhanced protections under
 
05:36:56.230 --> 05:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
current state law to reflect the
 
05:36:58.628 --> 05:36:58.638 align:start position:0%
important work that they do we ask that
 
05:37:00.708 --> 05:37:00.718 align:start position:0%
this will be brought forward
 
05:37:05.110 --> 05:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
under part 5 section 1 of sb 122
 
05:37:07.350 --> 05:37:07.360 align:start position:0%
a person who willfully causes physical
 
05:37:10.868 --> 05:37:10.878 align:start position:0%
injury to a service animal or willfully
 
05:37:14.548 --> 05:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
allows his or her own animal to do so
 
05:37:17.270 --> 05:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
will be charged with a class b felony
 
05:37:19.670 --> 05:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
if the injury to the service animal is
 
05:37:22.230 --> 05:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
severe enough that the service animal is
 
05:37:25.510 --> 05:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
found by a traitor or veterinarian to be
 
05:37:28.070 --> 05:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
incapable of returning to work that
 
05:37:30.628 --> 05:37:30.638 align:start position:0%
charge will be increased to a class a
 
05:37:33.990 --> 05:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
felony by enhancing these penalties
 
05:37:36.628 --> 05:37:36.638 align:start position:0%
this bill will protect a resource
 
05:37:39.110 --> 05:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
for people with disabilities that is not
 
05:37:41.430 --> 05:37:41.440 align:start position:0%
only important for their independence
 
05:37:44.070 --> 05:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
but also quite expensive with the total
 
05:37:46.628 --> 05:37:46.638 align:start position:0%
cost of creating averaging to around
 
05:37:49.510 --> 05:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars
 
05:37:52.070 --> 05:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
while it's true that a service animal is
 
05:37:54.628 --> 05:37:54.638 align:start position:0%
not required to be certified or
 
05:37:56.310 --> 05:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
professionally trained
 
05:37:58.708 --> 05:37:58.718 align:start position:0%
most dogs are obtained through a
 
05:38:01.670 --> 05:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
reputable organization that specializes
 
05:38:04.868 --> 05:38:04.878 align:start position:0%
in training these animals alternatively
 
05:38:07.510 --> 05:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
folks can find a professional trainer to
 
05:38:09.990 --> 05:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
train a dog who has the temperament and
 
05:38:12.948 --> 05:38:12.958 align:start position:0%
aptitude to be a service animal
 
05:38:15.750 --> 05:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
such dogs are usually trained to the
 
05:38:17.990 --> 05:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
standards of the international
 
05:38:20.628 --> 05:38:20.638 align:start position:0%
assistance dogs association
 
05:38:23.270 --> 05:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
on the flip side dogs who are poorly
 
05:38:25.830 --> 05:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
behaved in public and are not trained to
 
05:38:28.150 --> 05:38:28.160 align:start position:0%
assist their owner do not meet the
 
05:38:31.190 --> 05:38:31.200 align:start position:0%
definition of a service animal under the
 
05:38:33.750 --> 05:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
americans with disabilities act and thus
 
05:38:36.230 --> 05:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
are not afforded the same protections
 
05:38:38.708 --> 05:38:38.718 align:start position:0%
and considerations
 
05:38:40.948 --> 05:38:40.958 align:start position:0%
with this in mind i hope the members of
 
05:38:43.910 --> 05:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
this committee will choose to support sb
 
05:38:46.788 --> 05:38:46.798 align:start position:0%
122. thank you for the opportunity to
 
05:38:49.350 --> 05:38:49.360 align:start position:0%
testify before you today and for all the
 
05:38:51.910 --> 05:38:51.920 align:start position:0%
hard work you perform on behalf of new
 
05:39:02.150 --> 05:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:03.110 --> 05:39:03.120 align:start position:0%
through you're recognized for my
 
05:39:05.510 --> 05:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you mr chair and thank
 
05:39:07.190 --> 05:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question
 
05:39:09.910 --> 05:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
can you tell me is there a uh a legal
 
05:39:11.830 --> 05:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
definition of what
 
05:39:13.910 --> 05:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
a service animal is
 
05:39:16.150 --> 05:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
there is a legal definition and that
 
05:39:19.430 --> 05:39:19.440 align:start position:0%
definition is found in the americans
 
05:39:21.350 --> 05:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
with disabilities act
 
05:39:21.360 --> 05:39:22.868 align:start position:0%
with disabilities act
um

05:39:22.868 --> 05:39:22.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:24.788 --> 05:39:24.798 align:start position:0%
essentially a
 
05:39:26.948 --> 05:39:26.958 align:start position:0%
service animal again
 
05:39:29.990 --> 05:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
they don't need to be professionally
 
05:39:31.510 --> 05:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
trained or
 
05:39:31.520 --> 05:39:32.390 align:start position:0%
trained or
certified

05:39:32.390 --> 05:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
certified
 
05:39:33.590 --> 05:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
in any way
 
05:39:36.230 --> 05:39:36.240 align:start position:0%
but the basic requirement is that a
 
05:39:38.310 --> 05:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
service animal has to
 
05:39:38.320 --> 05:39:39.590 align:start position:0%
service animal has to
perform

05:39:39.590 --> 05:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
perform
 
05:39:41.350 --> 05:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
some kind of task
 
05:39:42.948 --> 05:39:42.958 align:start position:0%
to assist
 
05:39:45.750 --> 05:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
a person who has a disability
 
05:39:47.830 --> 05:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
something like say
 
05:39:49.350 --> 05:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
picking something up
 
05:39:52.708 --> 05:39:52.718 align:start position:0%
that a person has dropped or helping to
 
05:39:54.390 --> 05:39:54.400 align:start position:0%

sometimes
 
05:40:52.070 --> 05:40:52.080 align:start position:0%

or
 
05:41:01.430 --> 05:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
some kind of emotional trauma that that
 
05:41:02.548 --> 05:41:02.558 align:start position:0%
makes them
 
05:41:04.948 --> 05:41:04.958 align:start position:0%
unable to uh perform their work in

public
 
05:41:09.270 --> 05:41:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh but again i i can't i can't speak to
 
05:41:12.548 --> 05:41:12.558 align:start position:0%
any uh specific cases
 
05:41:20.310 --> 05:41:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:21.910 --> 05:41:21.920 align:start position:0%
representative welch you recognize my
 
05:41:21.920 --> 05:41:23.670 align:start position:0%
representative welch you recognize my
question

05:41:23.670 --> 05:41:23.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:41:25.030 --> 05:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
yes uh
 
05:41:28.150 --> 05:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
i'm aware that some people have
 
05:41:31.030 --> 05:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
or i usually call it a therapy animal
 
05:41:33.190 --> 05:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
would that be in the same class as a
 
05:41:36.628 --> 05:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:38.788 --> 05:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
a therapy animal like a
 
05:41:44.708 --> 05:41:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:44.718 --> 05:41:46.390 align:start position:0%
 
i

05:41:46.390 --> 05:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:41:49.110 --> 05:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
i will admit i'm not certain
 
05:41:50.470 --> 05:41:50.480 align:start position:0%
if that
 
05:41:52.548 --> 05:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
falls under the same
 
05:41:52.558 --> 05:41:53.910 align:start position:0%
falls under the same
definition

05:41:53.910 --> 05:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
definition
 
05:41:56.230 --> 05:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
as service animal when we think of
 
05:41:58.150 --> 05:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
service animals we
 
05:42:00.150 --> 05:42:00.160 align:start position:0%
think of
 
05:42:03.510 --> 05:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
an animal that that accomplishes a
 
05:42:06.390 --> 05:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
physical attack physical uh
 
05:42:08.788 --> 05:42:08.798 align:start position:0%
act task to
 
05:42:11.830 --> 05:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
assist somebody with a disability again
 
05:42:11.840 --> 05:42:12.708 align:start position:0%
assist somebody with a disability again
uh

05:42:12.708 --> 05:42:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:42:15.590 --> 05:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
say i drop my keys on the ground but i'm
 
05:42:17.830 --> 05:42:17.840 align:start position:0%

animal
 
05:42:23.190 --> 05:42:23.200 align:start position:0%
uh could pick those up for me or if i
 
05:42:24.230 --> 05:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
need help
 
05:42:26.390 --> 05:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
getting into a building
 
05:42:29.990 --> 05:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:32.310 --> 05:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
a rope handle and open the door for me
 
05:42:36.070 --> 05:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
something like that but a support animal
 
05:42:36.080 --> 05:42:37.510 align:start position:0%
something like that but a support animal
whose

05:42:37.510 --> 05:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
whose
 
05:42:39.990 --> 05:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
only function is to
 
05:42:41.350 --> 05:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
just provide
 
05:42:41.360 --> 05:42:42.390 align:start position:0%
just provide
comfort

05:42:42.390 --> 05:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
comfort
 
05:42:44.708 --> 05:42:44.718 align:start position:0%
for an individual i i don't know that
 
05:42:51.910 --> 05:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:54.390 --> 05:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
you recognize represent representative
 
05:42:57.670 --> 05:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:59.590 --> 05:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chair good to
 
05:43:02.868 --> 05:43:02.878 align:start position:0%
well virtually see you ryan again um and
 
05:43:05.430 --> 05:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
the question is about the the uh
 
05:43:07.990 --> 05:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
the adjective willingly allow because of
 
05:43:10.070 --> 05:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
her animal to cause physical immigrants
 
05:43:11.190 --> 05:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
if you have a
 
05:43:12.708 --> 05:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
someone else's dog attacking your
 
05:43:14.628 --> 05:43:14.638 align:start position:0%
service dog um
 
05:43:15.670 --> 05:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
so it
 
05:43:17.270 --> 05:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
that seems to exclude
 
05:43:20.150 --> 05:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
something that happens a lot where uh
 
05:43:22.390 --> 05:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
you know the working dog is busy working
 
05:43:24.150 --> 05:43:24.160 align:start position:0%
and they have a civilian dog who doesn't
 
05:43:26.390 --> 05:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
understand and you know
 
05:43:28.150 --> 05:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
i think that causes conflict between the
 
05:43:30.390 --> 05:43:30.400 align:start position:0%
dogs especially
 
05:43:34.070 --> 05:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
if the non-service dog is off leash so
 
05:43:35.670 --> 05:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
so that you think that's the intent
 
05:43:37.670 --> 05:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
behind the bill to not prosecute people
 
05:43:39.190 --> 05:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
for those uh
 
05:43:41.110 --> 05:43:41.120 align:start position:0%
for incidents like that or should i
 
05:43:43.670 --> 05:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely i 100 agree with
 
05:43:43.680 --> 05:43:44.628 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely i 100 agree with
that

05:43:44.628 --> 05:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:43:48.548 --> 05:43:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:02.948 --> 05:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:04.548 --> 05:44:04.558 align:start position:0%

05:44:19.590 --> 05:44:19.600 align:start position:0%

it's very interesting watching this from
 
05:48:07.360 --> 05:48:08.830 align:start position:0%
it's very interesting watching this from
afar

05:48:08.830 --> 05:48:08.840 align:start position:0%

so
 
05:49:21.190 --> 05:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
so this so now it's classy felony i
 
05:49:23.430 --> 05:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
don't like this
 
05:49:25.830 --> 05:49:25.840 align:start position:0%

i mean i understand
 
05:49:57.750 --> 05:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's maybe arguably apparently worse to
 
05:49:58.868 --> 05:49:58.878 align:start position:0%
do with a
 
05:50:01.190 --> 05:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
service dog so
 
05:50:04.470 --> 05:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
from a misdemeanor to a class b
 
05:50:06.788 --> 05:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
you know and if the first smith even if
 
05:50:09.190 --> 05:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
the animal is
 
05:50:11.670 --> 05:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
i guess put out a business it becomes a
 
05:50:13.030 --> 05:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
class a
 
05:50:15.030 --> 05:50:15.040 align:start position:0%
this is crazy
 
05:50:20.310 --> 05:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:28.470 --> 05:50:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:29.910 --> 05:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
it should be it should be the same
 
05:50:32.868 --> 05:50:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:34.310 --> 05:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
it should i mean it's what could mean
 
05:50:46.070 --> 05:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:49.190 --> 05:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
all right even with that
 
05:51:07.190 --> 05:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:22.310 --> 05:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:26.150 --> 05:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:27.750 --> 05:51:27.760 align:start position:0%
i knew scott was trying to sign in i
 
05:51:29.990 --> 05:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
can't see him on my screen but there
 
05:51:32.070 --> 05:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
he's on that on the big screen so we're
 
05:51:33.670 --> 05:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
standing that three right
 
05:51:37.750 --> 05:51:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:44.708 --> 05:51:44.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:46.548 --> 05:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
05:51:50.070 --> 05:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
looks a little gray there though
 
05:51:55.430 --> 05:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:20.470 --> 05:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:21.990 --> 05:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
well what i'm just thinking of is
 
05:52:25.350 --> 05:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
thinking a lot with senate bill 40
 
05:52:26.788 --> 05:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
you know we won't do anything with that
 
05:52:29.030 --> 05:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
for now we'll see what happens with
 
05:52:30.868 --> 05:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
i believe it's hb 485 that was
 
05:52:30.878 --> 05:52:32.070 align:start position:0%
i believe it's hb 485 that was
represented

05:52:32.070 --> 05:52:32.080 align:start position:0%
represented
 
05:52:33.590 --> 05:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
and we passed
 
05:52:34.868 --> 05:52:34.878 align:start position:0%
they've already made a positive
 
05:52:34.878 --> 05:52:46.150 align:start position:0%
they've already made a positive
recommendation

05:52:46.150 --> 05:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:47.990 --> 05:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
i just want to remind everyone if we if
 
05:52:49.670 --> 05:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
there's amendments to any of these
 
05:52:51.910 --> 05:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
ominous bills
 
05:52:53.750 --> 05:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
only there has to be one amendment only
 
05:52:55.750 --> 05:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
one amendment can be
 
05:52:58.310 --> 05:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
adopted so we must
 
05:52:59.750 --> 05:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
if there is something that's going to be
 
05:52:59.760 --> 05:53:01.110 align:start position:0%
if there is something that's going to be
passed

05:53:01.110 --> 05:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
passed
 
05:53:02.830 --> 05:53:02.840 align:start position:0%
we must work together
 
05:53:06.070 --> 05:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
on we like working together or not it's
 
05:53:07.350 --> 05:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
the only way to do it there's only one
 
05:53:11.190 --> 05:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:13.350 --> 05:53:13.360 align:start position:0%
if you have an idea for a section
 
05:53:15.670 --> 05:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
you know maybe we
 
05:53:26.868 --> 05:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:29.190 --> 05:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
we'll see what we're doing
 
05:53:44.830 --> 05:53:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:44.840 --> 05:53:46.390 align:start position:0%
 
122

05:53:46.390 --> 05:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
122
 
05:53:47.830 --> 05:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
it has to be amendy because it has the
 
05:53:49.590 --> 05:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
wrong effect
 
05:53:58.230 --> 05:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:58.240 --> 05:54:12.948 align:start position:0%
 
oh

05:54:12.948 --> 05:54:12.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:15.030 --> 05:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
i remember it very well
 
05:54:18.310 --> 05:54:18.320 align:start position:0%
it is to amend the budget last term
 
05:54:19.990 --> 05:54:20.000 align:start position:0%
because the internet crimes against
 
05:54:24.708 --> 05:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:27.190 --> 05:54:27.200 align:start position:0%
it was a half million dollars i
 
05:54:28.868 --> 05:54:28.878 align:start position:0%
believe that that was a very important
 
05:54:31.830 --> 05:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
division to remain intact
 
05:54:34.310 --> 05:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
i put amendments in i had four other
 
05:54:36.230 --> 05:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors and i left some room in case
 
05:54:38.708 --> 05:54:38.718 align:start position:0%
my friends across the aisle
 
05:54:49.510 --> 05:54:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:52.470 --> 05:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
that amendment was essentially cloned
 
05:54:55.590 --> 05:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
they changed one reallocation of money
 
05:54:58.948 --> 05:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
which has nothing to do with the concept
 
05:55:02.390 --> 05:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:04.628 --> 05:55:04.638 align:start position:0%
then the order of business was changed
 
05:55:06.470 --> 05:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
so that even though my event was filed
 
05:55:06.480 --> 05:55:08.390 align:start position:0%
so that even though my event was filed
first

05:55:08.390 --> 05:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:55:15.510 --> 05:55:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:18.150 --> 05:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
and despite my name uh not getting
 
05:55:19.830 --> 05:55:19.840 align:start position:0%
credit for the amendment i still take
 
05:55:21.350 --> 05:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
credit for the passage i raised the
 
05:55:24.150 --> 05:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
agreement i got what i wanted
 
05:55:24.160 --> 05:55:24.948 align:start position:0%
agreement i got what i wanted
so

05:55:24.948 --> 05:55:24.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:55:28.230 --> 05:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
whether hb 123 passes i mean
 
05:55:30.070 --> 05:55:30.080 align:start position:0%
we all deserve credit because we worked
 
05:55:31.670 --> 05:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
on it
 
05:55:33.990 --> 05:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
i'll get it right
 
05:55:35.830 --> 05:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
i think i said something they stole my
 
05:55:35.840 --> 05:55:37.510 align:start position:0%
i think i said something they stole my
participation

05:55:37.510 --> 05:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
participation
 
05:55:37.520 --> 05:55:44.150 align:start position:0%
participation
okay

05:55:44.150 --> 05:55:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:46.150 --> 05:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
for the members at home
 
05:55:48.788 --> 05:55:48.798 align:start position:0%
while we're in the executive session
 
05:55:48.798 --> 05:55:49.750 align:start position:0%
while we're in the executive session
i

05:55:49.750 --> 05:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:55:49.760 --> 05:55:50.470 align:start position:0%
i
i

05:55:50.470 --> 05:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:55:50.480 --> 05:55:58.230 align:start position:0%
i
once

05:55:58.230 --> 05:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:11.910 --> 05:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:13.590 --> 05:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
at this time
 
05:56:15.190 --> 05:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
we are going to open the executive
 
05:56:15.200 --> 05:56:16.390 align:start position:0%
we are going to open the executive
session

05:56:16.390 --> 05:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
session
 
05:56:21.510 --> 05:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:22.948 --> 05:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
representative conley you wish to be
 
05:57:00.830 --> 05:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:03.030 --> 05:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
um and that is
 
05:57:26.548 --> 05:57:26.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:28.310 --> 05:57:28.320 align:start position:0%
brings to light
 
05:57:31.670 --> 05:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
a bigger issue and the people in favor
 
05:57:33.190 --> 05:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
of marijuana
 
05:57:36.150 --> 05:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
are trying to deduct this i think
 
05:57:39.350 --> 05:57:39.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i somehow find an effort
 
05:57:42.310 --> 05:57:42.320 align:start position:0%
to come up with a way to test
 
05:57:45.110 --> 05:57:45.120 align:start position:0%
very quickly persons who are under the
 
05:57:45.120 --> 05:57:46.310 align:start position:0%
very quickly persons who are under the
influence

05:57:46.310 --> 05:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
influence
 
05:57:50.230 --> 05:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:52.310 --> 05:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
tried it by
 
05:57:54.708 --> 05:57:54.718 align:start position:0%
training certain policemen
 
05:57:57.430 --> 05:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
that probably doesn't work
 
05:57:59.430 --> 05:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
i know it's been a different we've got
 
05:58:00.708 --> 05:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
to find it
 
05:58:19.630 --> 05:58:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:19.640 --> 05:58:35.350 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:58:35.350 --> 05:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:35.360 --> 05:58:48.548 align:start position:0%
 
is

05:58:48.548 --> 05:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:52.070 --> 05:58:52.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that this was exactly
 
05:59:07.350 --> 05:59:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
is important and i think
 
05:59:11.910 --> 05:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
i think you all agree
 
05:59:13.670 --> 05:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
someone who's
 
05:59:15.430 --> 05:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
smoking and driving
 
05:59:17.270 --> 05:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
at the same time
 
05:59:20.070 --> 05:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
marijuana that's not
 
05:59:21.670 --> 05:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
you know that's not that's that's
 
05:59:22.948 --> 05:59:22.958 align:start position:0%
illegal and
 
05:59:25.590 --> 05:59:25.600 align:start position:0%
it should be but here my
 
05:59:27.510 --> 05:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
i couldn't get to the least successful
 
05:59:29.030 --> 05:59:29.040 align:start position:0%
to the driver especially if you don't
 
05:59:30.948 --> 05:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
have a trump
 
05:59:30.958 --> 05:59:32.390 align:start position:0%
have a trump
vehicle

05:59:32.390 --> 05:59:32.400 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
05:59:34.230 --> 05:59:34.240 align:start position:0%
my wife and i both don't have a trump
 
05:59:36.390 --> 05:59:36.400 align:start position:0%
vehicles we have so
 
05:59:38.150 --> 05:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
i mean you can be driving i can be
 
05:59:41.350 --> 05:59:41.360 align:start position:0%
driving and someone saying the passion
 
05:59:42.628 --> 05:59:42.638 align:start position:0%
who has
 
05:59:44.070 --> 05:59:44.080 align:start position:0%
a prescription
 
05:59:46.868 --> 05:59:46.878 align:start position:0%
but it's unsealed would have to put that
 
05:59:48.390 --> 05:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not even sure where they would put
 
05:59:48.400 --> 05:59:49.110 align:start position:0%
i'm not even sure where they would put
it

05:59:49.110 --> 05:59:49.120 align:start position:0%
it
 
05:59:51.110 --> 05:59:51.120 align:start position:0%
i think it's somewhat
 
05:59:53.830 --> 05:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
subjective on what the least successful
 
05:59:56.150 --> 05:59:56.160 align:start position:0%
driver is
 
05:59:58.310 --> 05:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
so with that being said i
 
06:00:00.070 --> 06:00:00.080 align:start position:0%
i i know there's a people who draw
 
06:00:02.470 --> 06:00:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's an analogy to alcohol but a
 
06:00:03.830 --> 06:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
bottle of alcohol
 
06:00:06.628 --> 06:00:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:08.070 --> 06:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
it's bigger we're talking about
 
06:00:10.390 --> 06:00:10.400 align:start position:0%
something the size of a penny
 
06:00:12.070 --> 06:00:12.080 align:start position:0%
they can be referred to it has to be put
 
06:00:13.590 --> 06:00:13.600 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
06:00:16.070 --> 06:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
so i don't
 
06:00:17.510 --> 06:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that it's in the passenger's
 
06:00:21.030 --> 06:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
pocket it's not okay to be there again
 
06:00:22.628 --> 06:00:22.638 align:start position:0%
without having a
 
06:00:24.948 --> 06:00:24.958 align:start position:0%
precise clear understanding of how this
 
06:00:28.310 --> 06:00:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:31.430 --> 06:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
i i can't support it i just
 
06:00:33.910 --> 06:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
i think i think that's that's a problem
 
06:00:36.708 --> 06:00:36.718 align:start position:0%
and i i understand that this
 
06:00:38.310 --> 06:00:38.320 align:start position:0%
has written is not being abused i'm not
 
06:00:41.190 --> 06:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
saying the police would abuse it but
 
06:00:44.150 --> 06:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
i know i i know just from reading it i
 
06:00:45.510 --> 06:00:45.520 align:start position:0%
see some
 
06:00:47.590 --> 06:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
problems here we would have to rewrite
 
06:00:49.030 --> 06:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
the whole thing i don't think the policy
 
06:00:52.310 --> 06:00:52.320 align:start position:0%
itself is the problem but
 
06:00:53.990 --> 06:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
it can't be done this way i think we
 
06:00:55.350 --> 06:00:55.360 align:start position:0%
have to separate then at the same time
 
06:00:58.070 --> 06:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
now you have exceptions for bus drivers
 
06:01:01.270 --> 06:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
taxis limousines i mean if i'm driving
 
06:01:02.788 --> 06:01:02.798 align:start position:0%
someone's riding the patch ceiling for
 
06:01:05.030 --> 06:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
all intents and purpose i am the tax
 
06:01:06.948 --> 06:01:06.958 align:start position:0%
and somebody but there's no functional
 
06:01:08.470 --> 06:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
difference i'm driving
 
06:01:10.548 --> 06:01:10.558 align:start position:0%
the person's not you will you'll allow
 
06:01:11.750 --> 06:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
an exception
 
06:01:14.390 --> 06:01:14.400 align:start position:0%
yeah again i'm not
 
06:01:17.670 --> 06:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
i have some concerns with that as well
 
06:01:19.270 --> 06:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
i do i do appreciate there is public
 
06:01:20.788 --> 06:01:20.798 align:start position:0%
safety concerns that we have to be aware
 
06:01:22.230 --> 06:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
of you know i agree with representing
 
06:01:22.240 --> 06:01:24.230 align:start position:0%
of you know i agree with representing
testimony

06:01:24.230 --> 06:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:01:25.750 --> 06:01:25.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully there's a field surprise
 
06:01:27.270 --> 06:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
that's a reliable one that you come up
 
06:01:27.280 --> 06:01:28.390 align:start position:0%
that's a reliable one that you come up
with

06:01:28.390 --> 06:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
with
 
06:01:29.590 --> 06:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
fast because
 
06:01:31.670 --> 06:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
this is a publicity concern this issue's
 
06:01:33.350 --> 06:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
not going away but i just don't feel set
 
06:01:40.390 --> 06:01:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:42.310 --> 06:01:42.320 align:start position:0%
because when i first heard this bill
 
06:01:45.350 --> 06:01:45.360 align:start position:0%
right off the back i just said that idea
 
06:01:47.990 --> 06:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
and what really got me was i'm like i
 
06:01:50.628 --> 06:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
know that we have different laws about
 
06:01:53.510 --> 06:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
marijuana how much you have all those
 
06:01:54.830 --> 06:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
types of
 
06:01:58.948 --> 06:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
things to even drug dealers to actually
 
06:02:01.270 --> 06:02:01.280 align:start position:0%
carry marijuana in the trunks and things
 
06:02:02.548 --> 06:02:02.558 align:start position:0%
of this nature
 
06:02:05.110 --> 06:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
broader than just what they were talking
 
06:02:07.670 --> 06:02:07.680 align:start position:0%
about today i just thought it was
 
06:02:14.150 --> 06:02:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:15.910 --> 06:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
but the way this was
 
06:02:18.470 --> 06:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
worded and sealed and all those types of
 
06:02:20.310 --> 06:02:20.320 align:start position:0%
things i felt that people could have so
 
06:02:34.150 --> 06:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:36.948 --> 06:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
container you know pharmacy label on it
 
06:02:40.150 --> 06:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
but if the seals the brokers open once
 
06:02:42.628 --> 06:02:42.638 align:start position:0%
and that can be in your real consumer in
 
06:02:44.150 --> 06:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
your pocket
 
06:02:44.160 --> 06:02:45.110 align:start position:0%
your pocket
but

06:02:45.110 --> 06:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:02:45.120 --> 06:02:46.310 align:start position:0%
but
the

06:02:46.310 --> 06:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:02:48.310 --> 06:02:48.320 align:start position:0%
marijuana can't
 
06:02:48.320 --> 06:02:50.868 align:start position:0%
marijuana can't
so

06:02:50.868 --> 06:02:50.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:50.878 --> 06:03:03.730 align:start position:0%
 
if

06:03:03.730 --> 06:03:03.740 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:03.740 --> 06:03:04.948 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

06:03:04.948 --> 06:03:04.958 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
06:03:07.110 --> 06:03:07.120 align:start position:0%
again i don't
 
06:03:09.750 --> 06:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
again there was a very short build i i
 
06:03:12.070 --> 06:03:12.080 align:start position:0%
raised a lot of
 
06:03:13.510 --> 06:03:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's an open container there's an open
 
06:03:15.110 --> 06:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
container i mean it's pretty clear when
 
06:03:33.030 --> 06:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:35.910 --> 06:03:35.920 align:start position:0%
open container maybe not labeled
 
06:03:37.910 --> 06:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
but it got their prescription medication
 
06:03:37.920 --> 06:03:39.430 align:start position:0%
but it got their prescription medication
and

06:03:39.430 --> 06:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:03:41.510 --> 06:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
we passed a bill
 
06:03:45.190 --> 06:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
for five years ago so all that people
 
06:03:58.310 --> 06:03:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:14.150 --> 06:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:16.548 --> 06:04:16.558 align:start position:0%
again the goal here is well intended but
 
06:04:16.558 --> 06:04:18.230 align:start position:0%
again the goal here is well intended but
anyway

06:04:18.230 --> 06:04:18.240 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
06:04:22.868 --> 06:04:22.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:25.270 --> 06:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
so you know for
 
06:04:26.948 --> 06:04:26.958 align:start position:0%
seeing no further hands raised that
 
06:04:29.990 --> 06:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
matter would not be the question
 
06:04:31.430 --> 06:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
of the motion of the big speed
 
06:04:34.230 --> 06:04:34.240 align:start position:0%
