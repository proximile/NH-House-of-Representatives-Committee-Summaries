inclusion in the budget representative
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
Maguire is recognized thank you Mr
 
00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
chairman so this morning we got a piece
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
of paper from the
 
00:16:43.389 --> 00:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
LBA that compares um what the governor
 
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
has given us in her budget and but with
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
um numbers that we now have from house
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
ways and means we have sort of
 
00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:55.680 align:start position:0%
unofficial numbers from house Ways and
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
Means as to what we what they think we
 
00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
will get
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
in um in funds for General and education
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
funds Highway funds and so on so so this
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
piece of paper
 
00:17:14.350 --> 00:17:14.360 align:start position:0%
Compares um Governor spending and our
 
00:17:19.470 --> 00:17:19.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue all right um and in
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
particular and the bottom line of this
 
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
is the size of our problem um and that
 
00:17:30.029 --> 00:17:30.039 align:start position:0%
is for the banum we are short
 
00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:32.430 align:start position:0%
is for the banum we are short
732

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:32.440 align:start position:0%
732
 
00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.150 align:start position:0%
732
m948

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
m948
 
00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:39.799 align:start position:0%
th000 so this is a huge problem and and
 
00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:43.240 align:start position:0%
um I I want to point out a couple of Big
 
00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:47.240 align:start position:0%
Ticket differences between um that are
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
in and that are not in this particular
 
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:52.720 align:start position:0%
budget so first of all the governor for
 
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
the current year fiscal year 25 takes
 
00:17:59.870 --> 00:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
$81 million from the rainy day day fund
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's not in the ways in in in our
 
00:18:07.390 --> 00:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
figure so so um if we did that that 732
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
million would be 81 million less the
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
governor also has um 127 million from uh
 
00:18:19.149 --> 00:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
slot machines um as that's a new thing
 
00:18:21.310 --> 00:18:21.320 align:start position:0%
there's a I think there's a related bill
 
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
in ways and means that's not in the ways
 
00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:28.440 align:start position:0%
of means figures so so if we were to
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
take that that would be another you know
 
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
127 million to the good assuming that
 
00:18:38.789 --> 00:18:38.799 align:start position:0%
happens but what's not in the governor's
 
00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
budget are some things that we might
 
00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
consider ourselves committed to and that
 
00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
is the YDC payments $150 million for the
 
00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
banum is not in the governor's budget
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
and the the down payments on the prison
 
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
may or may not you know that that we had
 
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
considered we were going to spend 40
 
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
million a year for 10 years to pay for a
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
$400 million prison those are not in in
 
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
this budget um on that one in particular
 
00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
I've heard that we may end up borrowing
 
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:17.280 align:start position:0%
the money which I think is possibly
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate but but in any case the
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
point is our problem is serious um and
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
um it's in the range of of 700
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
million Mr chairman oh sorry all right
 
00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:36.520 align:start position:0%
represent Edwards and represent thank
 
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you for that
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
summary representative McGuire I I I I'm
 
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
obsessed with keeping track of uh the
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
the commitment that the counties would
 
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:51.640 align:start position:0%
like us to make for the 22.3 million or
 
00:19:53.590 --> 00:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
25 million depending on what the real
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
number is so that would that would be an
 
00:19:58.390 --> 00:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
addition to to the contingencies I think
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
you just laid
 
00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
out representative tki thank you Mr
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm wondering if the document
 
00:20:07.230 --> 00:20:07.240 align:start position:0%
that um representative Maguire was
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
reviewing is available did we get it
 
00:20:13.110 --> 00:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
email to us or um I I think so and and I
 
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
can make copies it's it's a little
 
00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
awkward because one is a legal size and
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
two are regular size but yes I I'll ask
 
00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
this came from Mike Kane so I can ask
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
him to provide it or
 
00:20:29.350 --> 00:20:29.360 align:start position:0%
yeah uh yes as of now it's only been
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
provided to uh you and representative
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
wer the division chairs who were in the
 
00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:34.720 align:start position:0%
meeting this morning but if it's your
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
wish to share it with all the members we
 
00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
can do that yes we'll do
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
that all right who who was next I guess
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
representative rang and then
 
00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:47.799 align:start position:0%
representative ail thank you Mr chair um
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
would it help the the spot we're in you
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
know using Mr uh representative
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
Maguire's figures if there is a I
 
00:20:57.310 --> 00:20:57.320 align:start position:0%
believe there's a bill that was
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
introduced to restore the interest in
 
00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
dividends tax um even if the exemption
 
00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
was increased to only apply to people
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
that have more than $100,000 in
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
dividends and interests would that help
 
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
our Revenue picture if that bill was to
 
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:14.200 align:start position:0%
pass uh we'll see what that will go to
 
00:21:17.269 --> 00:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
to ways of means and if ways of means
 
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
does something with it then they would
 
00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
give us a corrected Revenue estimate
 
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
it's same thing as if the slot machine
 
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
things passes then they may give us a
 
00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.190 align:start position:0%
things passes then they may give us a
corrected

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
corrected
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
Revenue if if they think the U slot
 
00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400 align:start position:0%
machines will produce as much revenue as
 
00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:37.720 align:start position:0%
the governor has in her budget so but at
 
00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
this point probably on Thursday they
 
00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:43.240 align:start position:0%
will the ways and means way it's
 
00:21:46.269 --> 00:21:46.279 align:start position:0%
traditionally done they will present a
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
revenue estimate it will be voted on by
 
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
the house so it becomes the law on us
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
and then it is tabled but if they come
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
later to add more Revenue then they
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
would take it off the table and and make
 
00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
an adjustment
 
00:22:05.390 --> 00:22:05.400 align:start position:0%
but if that doesn't happen we are bound
 
00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:08.360 align:start position:0%
by the numbers that we that we presently
 
00:22:10.029 --> 00:22:10.039 align:start position:0%
have from that from their
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
preliminary that's that's our bottom
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
line we can't spend more than that by
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
the traditions of the house and the
 
00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
law but I I guess but the restoring the
 
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
dividends and interests would be uh
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
contribute to revenue would it not it
 
00:22:29.029 --> 00:22:29.039 align:start position:0%
would okay thank you pass y repres
 
00:22:30.669 --> 00:22:30.679 align:start position:0%
I think I had represent Abel next and
 
00:22:32.470 --> 00:22:32.480 align:start position:0%
then representative Edwards yeah thank
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair I mean you'll be
 
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:37.480 align:start position:0%
Distributing that I know um
 
00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire but does the
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
spending that you have in that uh chart
 
00:22:45.390 --> 00:22:45.400 align:start position:0%
include the spending that is appearing
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
in hb2 at this
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
point yes thank you for the question I
 
00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
believe that it does with possibly one
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
exception and that is um the retirement
 
00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
system for group two change
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that's not yet in the this is
 
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
effectively a surplus statement and I
 
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:10.600 align:start position:0%
think I think that one there's still
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
there haven't been any discussions with
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
the retirement system so they're having
 
00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:17.440 align:start position:0%
trouble figuring out just exactly what's
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
the right number to to put
 
00:23:23.149 --> 00:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
in representative Edwards uh thank you
 
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:25.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and and for representive rung
 
00:23:28.669 --> 00:23:28.679 align:start position:0%
and maybe other new people I I think I
 
00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:32.360 align:start position:0%
think the way Ways and Means uh captures
 
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:35.799 align:start position:0%
um their process is in part they say
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
they only factor in current law so the
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
proposal that that you're thinking of is
 
00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
not current law and so therefore ways
 
00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
and means that would be precluded from
 
00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
considering it in the estimates that
 
00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
receive yes there will be many moving
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
Parts before we're done we have till the
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
end of March to come to conclusions and
 
00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
we'll be
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
working in all our divisions to try to
 
00:24:08.909 --> 00:24:08.919 align:start position:0%
find places where we can make cuts
 
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
and and we'll be looking um with all the
 
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
suggestions to spend more money and and
 
00:24:16.789 --> 00:24:16.799 align:start position:0%
we'll have to try to figure out which
 
00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
ones we can afford and which ones we
 
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
cannot and unless we find places where
 
00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:24.240 align:start position:0%
we can cut in the rest of the budget
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
there's not much chance um the governor
 
00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:29.240 align:start position:0%
took money out of the
 
00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:31.640 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund that would be a last
 
00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
desperate measure if that's the only way
 
00:24:34.750 --> 00:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
we could balance it but there would be
 
00:24:36.549 --> 00:24:36.559 align:start position:0%
enough to make up for the huge
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
difference we've seen so we still you
 
00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
know at best there's 200 million there
 
00:24:44.669 --> 00:24:44.679 align:start position:0%
representative Ms uh M Mr chair Could
 
00:24:50.269 --> 00:24:50.279 align:start position:0%
you um explain um the um the the
 
00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
interface between the education funding
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
committee and our committee I mean will
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
will we be getting
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
um will they be providing us with
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
indications of what they believe should
 
00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:06.159 align:start position:0%
be spent on education funding that we
 
00:25:08.149 --> 00:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
then roll into the budget how is that
 
00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:10.720 align:start position:0%
going to work yes we have we have some
 
00:25:12.789 --> 00:25:12.799 align:start position:0%
of our members from this committee that
 
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:14.960 align:start position:0%
are also serving on that committee so
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
we'll have pretty instant feedback and
 
00:25:18.990 --> 00:25:19.000 align:start position:0%
uh we'll have to see how that all comes
 
00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
out um there's less Federal money and
 
00:25:25.669 --> 00:25:25.679 align:start position:0%
there's fewer students so let see what
 
00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:28.760 align:start position:0%
what the uh net results are I know this
 
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
lot all sorts of people wanting more
 
00:25:32.669 --> 00:25:32.679 align:start position:0%
money included in the in the education
 
00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
fund but whether or not it's available
 
00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
in the revenue that we have remains to
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
be seen those will be some decisions
 
00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
that we will all have to make
 
00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
eventually as they as they bring their
 
00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
input to us so we'll see what happens
 
00:25:49.710 --> 00:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
there'll be some some moving Parts there
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
as well so too early to predict it all
 
00:25:55.590 --> 00:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
right representative bu yeah just more
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
specifics so I'm one of the members of
 
00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:00.480 align:start position:0%
that committee and we have bills in that
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
committee that essentially touch on on
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
every aspect of uh education funding
 
00:26:11.230 --> 00:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
right the the formula the special ed the
 
00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know all kinds of details um swept
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
and things like that so so whatever
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
happens with that committee and what
 
00:26:22.789 --> 00:26:22.799 align:start position:0%
happens on the floor with those
 
00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:25.240 align:start position:0%
bills most of those bills will come back
 
00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
to our division 2 and then uh can
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
incorporated or changed or whatever as a
 
00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:33.880 align:start position:0%
second committee I think one of the
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
biggies and this is something we had in
 
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
and out for 20 years is the donor towns
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
and whether the people that get more
 
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
money in swept get to keep it all in
 
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
that town or whether they turn it into
 
00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480 align:start position:0%
the state to be redistributed to towns
 
00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
that didn't have as much money in there
 
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
swept so those are uh that's something
 
00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:01.279 align:start position:0%
that that's come up again we had it for
 
00:27:03.269 --> 00:27:03.279 align:start position:0%
a few number of years and
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
then people that were from those towns
 
00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
fought it every year and finally went
 
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
back to no more
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
redistributing but now that's come up
 
00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
again and some of those bills increase
 
00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:20.120 align:start position:0%
swept for most of its uh existence it's
 
00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:22.799 align:start position:0%
been at a set figure
 
00:27:30.389 --> 00:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
363 I had most of the numbers I'm not
 
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
sure what year that
 
00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.190 align:start position:0%
sure what year that
was

00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:40.120 align:start position:0%
created it's got to be a good 20 years
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
ago speaking of Education funding we
 
00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:45.880 align:start position:0%
have to go yes all right you have to go
 
00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
to that committee all right thank you
 
00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:52.039 align:start position:0%
all for coming at 1:00 division three
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
meets uh
 
00:27:57.789 --> 00:27:57.799 align:start position:0%
today and they have dhhh commissioner
 
00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:00.039 align:start position:0%
over review Budget Trailer Bill if
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
available so we're also having
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
discussions uh on our morning meeting we
 
00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
also had the um chairman of Public Works
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
because they have have to produce the
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
capital budget capital budget is
 
00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:20.039 align:start position:0%
mainly fix a roof build a
 
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
building PVE a parking lot that sort of
 
00:28:25.870 --> 00:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
thing um those are things that have a
 
00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.870 align:start position:0%
thing um those are things that have a
long

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
long
 
00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:30.880 align:start position:0%
life um lately the information
 
00:28:33.149 --> 00:28:33.159 align:start position:0%
technology pieces have been added in
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
there and so if if they do them maybe we
 
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
don't have them in in the budget we have
 
00:28:40.389 --> 00:28:40.399 align:start position:0%
we'll see that what happens with when we
 
00:28:42.389 --> 00:28:42.399 align:start position:0%
look at our budget whether a lot of that
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
information technology gets put over
 
00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
onto the capital budget rather than the
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
regular budgets but almost every um
 
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
Department we will look at will have an
 
00:28:55.430 --> 00:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
IT line some of it just for the
 
00:28:57.630 --> 00:28:57.640 align:start position:0%
operation of it rather than a new system
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
the new system if it's got a 5-year life
 
00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519 align:start position:0%
or more could go into capital budget but
 
00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
the question I would have for the IT
 
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:09.240 align:start position:0%
people normally in the in the regular
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
economy when you come in and spend a lot
 
00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:15.559 align:start position:0%
of money on a a new program you save
 
00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:18.640 align:start position:0%
money in the operation it becomes more
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
efficient you don't need as many people
 
00:29:22.669 --> 00:29:22.679 align:start position:0%
you don't need as much time so my
 
00:29:24.149 --> 00:29:24.159 align:start position:0%
question will be to the
 
00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:26.919 align:start position:0%
it every time you bring in a new thing
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
how many jobs are saved how much time is
 
00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
saved and so on so that's that's one of
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
the interesting things had to hand up
 
00:29:36.269 --> 00:29:36.279 align:start position:0%
representative Mari thank you would you
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
object if div 2 headed over to Ed
 
00:29:43.310 --> 00:29:43.320 align:start position:0%
funding yes no I have no object yes that
 
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:45.760 align:start position:0%
that would might be a good idea you all
 
00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
adjourned reverse this much I me she's
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
not going to be too surprised I'm going
 
00:29:59.470 --> 00:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
to ask about did you look at the DHHS
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
capital budget it just got two
 
00:30:06.669 --> 00:30:06.679 align:start position:0%
items one is enormous and
 
00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's investing ining to
 
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.230 align:start position:0%
it's investing ining to
developability

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
developability
 
00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:26.950 align:start position:0%
developability
system

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:56.909 align:start position:0%
