00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 align:start position:0%
a work session of the special House
 
00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
special election committee uh special
 
00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 align:start position:0%
committee on Child Care we'll do the
 
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.690 align:start position:0%
 
Paige

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 align:start position:0%
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the
 
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 align:start position:0%
United States of America and to the
 
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 align:start position:0%
Republic for which it stands one nation
 
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 align:start position:0%
under God indivisible with liberty and
 
00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
justice for us okay awesome
 
00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 align:start position:0%
um all right so uh good news is today
 
00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
should be relatively short
 
00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna start
 
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
um one thing I think will go pretty
 
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.469 align:start position:0%
um one thing I think will go pretty
quickly

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
um the background check process the
 
00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
other thing that we need to start taking
 
00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 align:start position:0%
some time on is the licensing process
 
00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
and the reason that's gonna that we will
 
00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
probably not finish all that today
 
00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
because the reason is is that licensing
 
00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.810 align:start position:0%
because the reason is is that licensing
process

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
um touches a lot of things
 
00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 align:start position:0%
um so um the reason I was the last one
 
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 align:start position:0%
getting here uh is I was going through
 
00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
and accumulating all of the licenses and
 
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 align:start position:0%
all of the rsas so I'm the people at
 
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
print services are a huge fan of me
 
00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:55.639 align:start position:0%
um because this is this is double page
 
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
double-sided every RSA that you would in
 
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
theory have to know to open a licensed
 
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
Child Care Center in the state of New
 
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.830 align:start position:0%
Child Care Center in the state of New
Hampshire

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:07.860 align:start position:0%
um so you know it's um as you know
 
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.629 align:start position:0%
um so you know it's um as you know
um

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
with the laws you know one thing touches
 
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 align:start position:0%
one thing and touches another thing it
 
00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
touches another thing um so this is
 
00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
everything that originates from RFA 170
 
00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh which is the governing
 
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 align:start position:0%
um uh governing I'm like leaning forward
 
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 align:start position:0%
here the governing
 
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
um RSA over uh licensed Child Care
 
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.810 align:start position:0%
um RSA over uh licensed Child Care
Centers

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
Centers
 
00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
um so obviously it deals heavily with
 
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 align:start position:0%
things like child safety uh parental
 
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.210 align:start position:0%
things like child safety uh parental
rights

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
rights
 
00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 align:start position:0%
um but in theory you would have to know
 
00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 align:start position:0%
all 288 pages of this uh and then the
 
00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
101 pages of additional regulations uh
 
00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
from Department of Health consumer
 
00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 align:start position:0%
services under h-e-c h4002
 
00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 align:start position:0%
um which of which we added nine pages of
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
regulations of summary regulations last
 
00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
year which amounted to about 37 pages of
 
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 align:start position:0%
actual regulation so in total
 
00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
um 288 plus 101
 
00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:05.699 align:start position:0%
um so you know quick math 389 389 pages
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
in theory that we would expect someone
 
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
opening a licensed Child Care Center to
 
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
read understand and follow
 
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
um so I get a feeling
 
00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 align:start position:0%
um that when we start digging through
 
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
that licensing process
 
00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:21.419 align:start position:0%
um we will hopefully find some ways to
 
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:23.880 align:start position:0%
not cut corners but maybe
 
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
um abbreviate the process
 
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
um so uh we're going to start off with
 
00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
the background check process so the
 
00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
reason the background so the background
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
check process
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
um this is in order to work in a
 
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 align:start position:0%
licensed Child Care Center you obviously
 
00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
need to pass a state background check so
 
00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:43.979 align:start position:0%
there's been two
 
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
um there's there's two major problems
 
00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:48.539 align:start position:0%
that we have so obviously this is we
 
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
have a Workforce problem right of people
 
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
getting into Child Care Centers right
 
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:54.720 align:start position:0%
you can't hire people right here it's
 
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
that for a lot of Industries but it's
 
00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:57.660 align:start position:0%
really bad for child care centers
 
00:06:59.570 --> 00:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
because you have to pass a background
 
00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:01.740 align:start position:0%
check to work there so in order to pass
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
background check right now and we have
 
00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:06.120 align:start position:0%
I've distributed to the members
 
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
um the background check process uh from
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
the state about what to do
 
00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
um but basically you have to schedule a
 
00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:15.539 align:start position:0%
fingerprint appointment
 
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
um which can take anywhere from two to
 
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
three weeks just to get it scheduled
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
um then you have to go to there we have
 
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
a problem in the state I believe there's
 
00:07:25.629 --> 00:07:25.639 align:start position:0%
only five
 
00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.199 align:start position:0%
centers in the state that do the
 
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 align:start position:0%
electronic fingerprinting
 
00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
um so you have to go there and then you
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
have to once that is done then you
 
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:37.620 align:start position:0%
submit your application off uh in paper
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
um with a 28 check to the Department of
 
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services uh where they
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
will then approve or deny you
 
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
um and there was a shortcut that I
 
00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
believe ended on December 7th
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
um where we were granted a waiver it's a
 
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:54.300 align:start position:0%
federal requirement we were granted a
 
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.490 align:start position:0%
federal requirement we were granted a
waiver

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:55.500 align:start position:0%
waiver
 
00:07:57.290 --> 00:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
um that allowed us basically once the
 
00:07:59.330 --> 00:07:59.340 align:start position:0%
applicant was fingerprinted they could
 
00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:01.139 align:start position:0%
have a waiver
 
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
um that allowed them to work in the
 
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
child care center provided they were not
 
00:08:05.749 --> 00:08:05.759 align:start position:0%
left alone with children
 
00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm exploring that waiver my
 
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
understanding is it's no longer in play
 
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
and that if the state would have to pay
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
a 700 000 fine to basically start doing
 
00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:16.919 align:start position:0%
that again so one of the things that I
 
00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:19.979 align:start position:0%
will ask the committee is should we
 
00:08:23.029 --> 00:08:23.039 align:start position:0%
consider paying that fine and getting
 
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
that process going again
 
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm not the chairman yes who are we
 
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:28.620 align:start position:0%
paying the fine to that would be the
 
00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:29.580 align:start position:0%
federal government
 
00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
of them yes not yes people have mixed I
 
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
hear mixed reviews
 
00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
um by the way anybody feel free to chime
 
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
in on this um I'm just kind of brain
 
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
dumping my this process
 
00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
um so there's a couple of things that my
 
00:08:44.449 --> 00:08:44.459 align:start position:0%
understanding is is that we actually
 
00:08:47.329 --> 00:08:47.339 align:start position:0%
make the process longer needlessly
 
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:49.620 align:start position:0%
um I was told that I need to confirm and
 
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to kind of poke around that
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
the electronic fingerprints are not
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
actually necessary
 
00:08:56.509 --> 00:08:56.519 align:start position:0%
um the fingerprinting is necessary the
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
electronic fingerprinting is not
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
necessary and I do know from personal
 
00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
experience one of my jobs that I helped
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
two years ago working for a federal
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
contractor was I did the fingerprint
 
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
downward in HR I did the fingerprinting
 
00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:11.220 align:start position:0%
there's no license in the state of New
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to do fingerprints fun fact
 
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
one of the few things we don't license I
 
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
have the same look when I figured that
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
out it's the same look there's no
 
00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
license it's a Boy Scout merit badge
 
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:22.500 align:start position:0%
though yeah it's a voice it turns out we
 
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
don't require you to have a license to
 
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:09:27.889 --> 00:09:27.899 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
um you know anyone can anyone can
 
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
literally go on Amazon and buy the FBI
 
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:34.740 align:start position:0%
fingerprint cards and an ink pad it's
 
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:37.740 align:start position:0%
thirty four dollars and we used to take
 
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
them so I asked uh someone who shall
 
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
remain nameless at DHHS why don't we
 
00:09:45.949 --> 00:09:45.959 align:start position:0%
take that anymore and they said it's
 
00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:48.889 align:start position:0%
take that anymore and they said it's
inconvenient

00:09:48.889 --> 00:09:48.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
um so uh
 
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
you know obviously there are problems
 
00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:54.899 align:start position:0%
with the issues that there's only five
 
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:57.300 align:start position:0%
of these stations in the state
 
00:09:59.150 --> 00:09:59.160 align:start position:0%
um by the way that distribution is not
 
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:00.350 align:start position:0%
um by the way that distribution is not
Equitable

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
Equitable
 
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
um if you live basically in Sullivan
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
County or the North Country you are
 
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:05.700 align:start position:0%
driving at least an hour hour and a half
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
to get to a fingerprint station which
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
you can only schedule two to three weeks
 
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
out I hope it doesn't snow hope you
 
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:13.380 align:start position:0%
don't miss it because if you don't make
 
00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940 align:start position:0%
it good luck
 
00:10:17.449 --> 00:10:17.459 align:start position:0%
um and then the other thing that I have
 
00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:19.019 align:start position:0%
discovered in my
 
00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:19.790 align:start position:0%
discovered in my
um

00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
exploration of the background check
 
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
process so you go and get your
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
fingerprinting and then you go to the
 
00:10:26.269 --> 00:10:26.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire connections portal and
 
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
they mentioned that here in the they
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
mentioned that here in the this letter
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
from the chief of the license the
 
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:35.040 align:start position:0%
licensing Care Unit
 
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
um I believe that basically you go to
 
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire connections portal and
 
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
you fill out all this information and
 
00:10:41.269 --> 00:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
you have your connections forward and
 
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
you click submit
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
and then nothing happens
 
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
um because they will not take your stuff
 
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:49.620 align:start position:0%
unless it has a wet signature so that's
 
00:10:51.889 --> 00:10:51.899 align:start position:0%
when you have to print it all out in a
 
00:10:53.329 --> 00:10:53.339 align:start position:0%
digital age we have to print it all out
 
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:54.660 align:start position:0%
just like I just made a lot of friends
 
00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
upstairs and Print Services
 
00:10:58.430 --> 00:10:58.440 align:start position:0%
um you have to print it all out put it
 
00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
into an envelope put a stamp on that
 
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
envelope address it send it off with a
 
00:11:05.449 --> 00:11:05.459 align:start position:0%
check for 28 so something that I would
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
think we could consider looking at is
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
there's no reason they have to take a
 
00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:12.480 align:start position:0%
wet signature if somebody has provided
 
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:13.980 align:start position:0%
their driver's license number their
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
social security number you have their
 
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.810 align:start position:0%
social security number you have their
fingerprints

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:17.820 align:start position:0%
fingerprints
 
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
why do they have to sign a piece of
 
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.930 align:start position:0%
why do they have to sign a piece of
paper

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
paper
 
00:11:23.569 --> 00:11:23.579 align:start position:0%
um so what I would like to us to see is
 
00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
exploring as a part of Expediting this
 
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.240 align:start position:0%
process that doesn't involve paying the
 
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:30.540 align:start position:0%
700 fine would be dictating to the
 
00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and services that
 
00:11:34.130 --> 00:11:34.140 align:start position:0%
they may take an electronic signature
 
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:37.560 align:start position:0%
and they may fully automate that process
 
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:39.660 align:start position:0%
um I would also like to explore why we
 
00:11:42.769 --> 00:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
charge 28 bucks I have a moral issue
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
with charging people to get a license to
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
work if the state's going to require the
 
00:11:48.769 --> 00:11:48.779 align:start position:0%
state should foot the bill that's my
 
00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
opinion that may not be universally Fair
 
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.790 align:start position:0%
opinion that may not be universally Fair
shared

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
shared
 
00:11:55.130 --> 00:11:55.140 align:start position:0%
um however uh there's also no reason we
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't take an online payment with a
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
credit card online Secretary of State
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
takes money online there's no reason
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
somebody has to cut a check and then
 
00:12:04.490 --> 00:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
mail it off that's Arcane so these are
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
things that in my experience and
 
00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:08.579 align:start position:0%
exploration of the background check
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
process I found that we could
 
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
expedite the process because what
 
00:12:16.009 --> 00:12:16.019 align:start position:0%
happens is you hire these people
 
00:12:17.150 --> 00:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
right so let's say you have somebody
 
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
who's never worked in child care or
 
00:12:21.110 --> 00:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
something we'll talk about in a minute
 
00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
never worked in um
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire child care
 
00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:28.980 align:start position:0%
is is that you are competing with every
 
00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079 align:start position:0%
other employer in a state that has a 2.1
 
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
unemployment rate and so if you tell
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
somebody hey I'm going to hire you and
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
in three weeks we're going to go get you
 
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:39.180 align:start position:0%
fingerprinted and then after that we're
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
going to send some mail off and then
 
00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
maybe I'll see you in a month and a half
 
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
who knows
 
00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:46.680 align:start position:0%
question yes are you planning on asking
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
or requiring DHHS to come to defend all
 
00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
these things we are not liking they were
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
aware uh today they chose to go to other
 
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
committees I believe I told my committee
 
00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
research I don't researcher I don't know
 
00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:00.720 align:start position:0%
if that's their best idea because what
 
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
will happen is we will start creating
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
ideas on our own and uh and they may not
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
they may not like that so so um anyways
 
00:13:09.769 --> 00:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
I have spoken a lot here but I kind of
 
00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
brain dumped the process and some ideas
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
I've had I'd love to hear from others
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
follow up if I may are they coming if
 
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
not today uh they will be invited to
 
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.790 align:start position:0%
not today uh they will be invited to
every

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:13:22.490 --> 00:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
um every work session vote that we have
 
00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:24.240 align:start position:0%
I have our committee researcher who has
 
00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
excellent reach out to them they were
 
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
aware of today do you also know that
 
00:13:31.129 --> 00:13:31.139 align:start position:0%
there is a DHHS oversight committee and
 
00:13:33.230 --> 00:13:33.240 align:start position:0%
you know the chairman who can if
 
00:13:35.629 --> 00:13:35.639 align:start position:0%
necessary subpoena them to come yeah but
 
00:13:39.829 --> 00:13:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh you know you may uh may may uh may be
 
00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959 align:start position:0%
worthwhile thank you um so it's it's uh
 
00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
obviously it was disappointed they
 
00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
weren't here they were trying to kind of
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
assess out what was happening
 
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
um but you know I don't blame
 
00:13:53.389 --> 00:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of this process is just stuff that
 
00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
the state never went to modernize right
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
like it's not like they invented this
 
00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
yesterday right but it's like what's
 
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:03.720 align:start position:0%
stopping them from doing it if if they
 
00:14:05.449 --> 00:14:05.459 align:start position:0%
need a wet signature and the law is
 
00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:07.019 align:start position:0%
preventing them from taking a digital
 
00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:08.710 align:start position:0%
preventing them from taking a digital
signature

00:14:08.710 --> 00:14:08.720 align:start position:0%
signature
 
00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:11.660 align:start position:0%
we could probably fix that
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
so yes representative Nelson that's not
 
00:14:17.509 --> 00:14:17.519 align:start position:0%
regarding the application process but I
 
00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask you
 
00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
um the 700 000 fine is that and how is
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
that assessed is that because uh one or
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
five or ten or is it per violation how
 
00:14:35.629 --> 00:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
is that assessed so my let me put the
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
asterisk of my understanding right
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
um and I reserve the right to be wrong
 
00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
about this
 
00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
um is that it's basically because we
 
00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be complying with the federal
 
00:14:43.620 --> 00:14:45.170 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be complying with the federal
law

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.180 align:start position:0%
law
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
um so it's basically the Maya culpa we
 
00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
pay to not apply which
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
speaking personally here I I find kind
 
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:55.800 align:start position:0%
of ridiculous it's like so before on
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
December 6th it was safe and then on
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
December 7th it wasn't safe
 
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:03.480 align:start position:0%
um you know no one here I imagine would
 
00:15:05.329 --> 00:15:05.339 align:start position:0%
be advocating for not doing a background
 
00:15:07.129 --> 00:15:07.139 align:start position:0%
check on child care workers anyway am I
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
hold that position I don't think so
 
00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.689 align:start position:0%
hold that position I don't think so
um

00:15:10.689 --> 00:15:10.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
if they're not alone with children and
 
00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:15.540 align:start position:0%
they're in the process of getting a
 
00:15:17.449 --> 00:15:17.459 align:start position:0%
background check
 
00:15:17.459 --> 00:15:18.910 align:start position:0%
background check
right

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
and we were doing it and there wasn't an
 
00:15:21.779 --> 00:15:23.449 align:start position:0%
and we were doing it and there wasn't an
incident

00:15:23.449 --> 00:15:23.459 align:start position:0%
incident
 
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:25.380 align:start position:0%
and we're having a problem hiring people
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
what's the issue
 
00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
so I guess my question is um would it
 
00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
potentially be more than seven hundred
 
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars that we would be fined
 
00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
if we continued to do it my
 
00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:37.620 align:start position:0%
understanding is no my understanding is
 
00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:39.260 align:start position:0%
we pay seven hundred thousand dollars
 
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
you want to get on the microphone we'll
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
just bringing people up we're having
 
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:51.420 align:start position:0%
this this is we're not taking any votes
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
today so this is super informal so feel
 
00:15:55.189 --> 00:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
free to jump in talk over me we're gonna
 
00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
we're gonna do something that they
 
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
good morning how do you do I'm I'm
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
Jackie Cowell I am the executive
 
00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
director of early learning New Hampshire
 
00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:09.180 align:start position:0%
we are a Statewide non-profit
 
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
um and our members are child care
 
00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
providers and we also advocate for the
 
00:16:14.449 --> 00:16:14.459 align:start position:0%
families they serve
 
00:16:17.449 --> 00:16:17.459 align:start position:0%
um with me uh is Marianne barter
 
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:19.380 align:start position:0%
um Marianne is the executive director of
 
00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:21.540 align:start position:0%
Merrimack Valley daycare services we're
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
serving Concord Pittsfield a few other
 
00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:26.459 align:start position:0%
towns and also as the chair of the
 
00:16:27.829 --> 00:16:27.839 align:start position:0%
legislatively enacted New Hampshire
 
00:16:31.009 --> 00:16:31.019 align:start position:0%
Child Care advisory Council so my
 
00:16:32.090 --> 00:16:32.100 align:start position:0%
understanding of the seven hundred
 
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars and we've been
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
advocating very much a lot of what
 
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:37.860 align:start position:0%
you've just been saying
 
00:16:39.769 --> 00:16:39.779 align:start position:0%
um our understanding is the seven
 
00:16:41.269 --> 00:16:41.279 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars is going to
 
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
finally potentially be levied against
 
00:16:45.769 --> 00:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because New Hampshire like
 
00:16:47.749 --> 00:16:47.759 align:start position:0%
every other state and I'm trying to
 
00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:49.500 align:start position:0%
honestly remember what year it started
 
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:51.180 align:start position:0%
where the federal government gave States
 
00:16:54.769 --> 00:16:54.779 align:start position:0%
time to have efficient background check
 
00:16:57.710 --> 00:16:57.720 align:start position:0%
processes in place and we're allowing
 
00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:00.420 align:start position:0%
them to do it differently until
 
00:17:02.449 --> 00:17:02.459 align:start position:0%
recently where they said okay you've had
 
00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:03.779 align:start position:0%
enough years
 
00:17:05.809 --> 00:17:05.819 align:start position:0%
you've been wavering this for years and
 
00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:08.220 align:start position:0%
they've said it to every many states and
 
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has not come up with an
 
00:17:11.449 --> 00:17:11.459 align:start position:0%
efficient system
 
00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:14.339 align:start position:0%
um that allows quit turnaround and so
 
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
we've heard that it will not be more
 
00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:18.020 align:start position:0%
than seven hundred thousand dollars
 
00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
it is also highly likely that New
 
00:17:22.669 --> 00:17:22.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire actually won't be charged it's
 
00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
a threat that many states get uh Vermont
 
00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:28.380 align:start position:0%
got the same similar kind of threat and
 
00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:29.940 align:start position:0%
they have decided to keep their waivers
 
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
because they did not want to have happen
 
00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:34.200 align:start position:0%
what you said uh representative Berry
 
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
um you're going to lose you're going to
 
00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
lose the higher
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
so yeah so I will say from personal
 
00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.470 align:start position:0%
so yeah so I will say from personal
experience

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
um my chocolate certain episode you know
 
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
so maybe maybe you cover me
 
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:51.240 align:start position:0%
um the um we just hired a new teacher uh
 
00:17:54.049 --> 00:17:54.059 align:start position:0%
from New York uh she worked in two New
 
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
York Elementary Schools before moving to
 
00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire where I also
 
00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.909 align:start position:0%
Manchester New Hampshire where I also
live

00:17:58.909 --> 00:17:58.919 align:start position:0%
live
 
00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
um she's going to leave us in September
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
to go work in elementary school we'd
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
love to have her for the summer
 
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:04.980 align:start position:0%
specifically because she has a degree in
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
special education which we have some
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
children in my Center who would love to
 
00:18:12.529 --> 00:18:12.539 align:start position:0%
get her hands on we cannot hire her uh
 
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
we cannot get her here
 
00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:16.200 align:start position:0%
um we we want to hire her we had to send
 
00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
her off to the finger protect process
 
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.020 align:start position:0%
and I want to get her in I want to get
 
00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:20.340 align:start position:0%
her to working with my children some of
 
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:23.460 align:start position:0%
which you have special needs I can't
 
00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
I can't I can't get her
 
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:26.940 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's a pro I know it's not
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
such a problem for me but it's an
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
example of this is somebody who is
 
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
actually working in another state
 
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
in an elementary school a state that is
 
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200 align:start position:0%
by the way more regulated than we are
 
00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
um and I cannot hire her I cannot start
 
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:41.700 align:start position:0%
her at least
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
um so it's a real problem
 
00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the at least I'm not
 
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
crazy about my 700 000 there I know like
 
00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:47.940 align:start position:0%
people like I say these things and
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
people think I'm I'm off my rocker we've
 
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:50.700 align:start position:0%
never spoken before by the way so that
 
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:52.980 align:start position:0%
wasn't planted Mr Page representative
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
page excuse me thanks Mr chair
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
um I can I can get on board with the
 
00:18:59.870 --> 00:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
idea of a waiver I think my only concern
 
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:00.890 align:start position:0%
idea of a waiver I think my only concern
is

00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:03.169 --> 00:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
that we not do that without beginning to
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
address the underlying problem so I
 
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
think you know um
 
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
we want a practical short-term solution
 
00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:11.820 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to keep band-aiding it
 
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
year after year after year what I'm
 
00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
hearing here is that we've known that we
 
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
didn't have a good system in place for
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
many years so while I can support the
 
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
idea of a short-term waiver I'd like to
 
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.000 align:start position:0%
make sure as we do that we're also
 
00:19:28.669 --> 00:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
figuring out what we need to change to
 
00:19:34.250 --> 00:19:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.890 --> 00:19:39.900 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:19:42.409 --> 00:19:42.419 align:start position:0%
the seven hundred thousand dollars is it
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
if the state is found to have one child
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
care center or multiple Child Care
 
00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:50.820 align:start position:0%
Centers my guess is one I'm saying it's
 
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
the process if we continue the process
 
00:19:57.049 --> 00:19:57.059 align:start position:0%
so if we do one or we do all 589 still
 
00:19:59.510 --> 00:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
the same it's still the same
 
00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:02.039 align:start position:0%
um to representative Pages Point
 
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
um you know so I I I agree with you
 
00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:05.820 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly right like we don't want
 
00:20:07.549 --> 00:20:07.559 align:start position:0%
to every year have to pay seven hundred
 
00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:09.240 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to keep doing to fix
 
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:10.620 align:start position:0%
the process right
 
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:13.320 align:start position:0%
um so that's why I brought up part of
 
00:20:15.529 --> 00:20:15.539 align:start position:0%
the fingerprinting process
 
00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
um there's no reason we have to have
 
00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
that bottleneck it is purely convenience
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
um there are people there are people on
 
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
the other side of the walls like to say
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
that want to just go and spend more
 
00:20:28.070 --> 00:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
money and open up more more
 
00:20:30.049 --> 00:20:30.059 align:start position:0%
fingerprinting centers
 
00:20:32.090 --> 00:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
thirty four dollars gets you a
 
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
fingerprint pad and the cards
 
00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:36.600 align:start position:0%
um that anyone can use
 
00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:38.280 align:start position:0%
um an idea that I've had is our
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
licensers who go from
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
Center to Center could carry these
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
fingerprint pads and do it
 
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
um that's an option
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
um the other option would be another
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
option I kicked around in my head would
 
00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
be making while they're while the
 
00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:55.740 align:start position:0%
department or whoever determines that
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
there is a shortage of workers would
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
prioritize these applications
 
00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
um because it's the state background
 
00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
check process the two two prong
 
00:21:05.750 --> 00:21:05.760 align:start position:0%
background check process a federal one
 
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:07.320 align:start position:0%
and a state one
 
00:21:09.169 --> 00:21:09.179 align:start position:0%
um there's no reason to create that
 
00:21:11.690 --> 00:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
bottleneck or at least we could
 
00:21:13.549 --> 00:21:13.559 align:start position:0%
prioritize them if we all agree this is
 
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
an issue right there's no reason that we
 
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't put them at the top at the
 
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
front of the line while there's a
 
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
backlog for that right so we there's
 
00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
legislative ways to kind of like put
 
00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
them to the front of the line we'd
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
obviously want to make sure we were
 
00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:27.780 align:start position:0%
balancing that with the other things
 
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
that they're doing because I know like
 
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500 align:start position:0%
some medical centers right require this
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
background check
 
00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
um so obviously we don't want to not
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
have nurses
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
um but it's that's that's something that
 
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
that I've that I've looked at but
 
00:21:42.289 --> 00:21:42.299 align:start position:0%
another one would be just you know if
 
00:21:43.549 --> 00:21:43.559 align:start position:0%
there's a backlog you got to take the
 
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
fingerprint card and that's it and it'll
 
00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.059 align:start position:0%
inconvenience some state workers and
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's fine but
 
00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
they can take it the FBI took I think I
 
00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
did 50 plus that the FBI took to give
 
00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:57.960 align:start position:0%
people Federal security clearance so
 
00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:01.260 align:start position:0%
it's not like uh it's not like it's
 
00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
it's not like they can't do it they just
 
00:22:05.090 --> 00:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
don't want to
 
00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:07.020 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm sorry if I missed this
 
00:22:09.169 --> 00:22:09.179 align:start position:0%
but did you say that basically anyone
 
00:22:10.909 --> 00:22:10.919 align:start position:0%
can have these fingerprint pads and be
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
approved to
 
00:22:14.810 --> 00:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
there is no license requirement in the
 
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire to take
 
00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
fingerprints so anyone can do it is it
 
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
34 on Amazon
 
00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.270 --> 00:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620 align:start position:0%
how long does it take for Corey to come
 
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:37.130 align:start position:0%
how long does it take for Corey to come
back

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:39.900 align:start position:0%
uh criminal records release that I do
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
not have the answer to that question um
 
00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry hi I'm Marian barter from the
 
00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
child care advisory Council so the
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety
 
00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:52.620 align:start position:0%
efficient and they will get us results
 
00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
back within 24 to 36 hours The Log Jam
 
00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
actually exists at unfortunately at DHHS
 
00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:01.020 align:start position:0%
because they are understaffed so the way
 
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
our system works we get our fingerprints
 
00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
done by the department of safety and
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
then instead of that information going
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
straight to the employer it goes through
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
child care licensing most Industries it
 
00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:14.280 align:start position:0%
would go straight to the employer so
 
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
usually in the medical field or whatever
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
you get your fingerprints done and then
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
the hospital will find out whether
 
00:23:21.409 --> 00:23:21.419 align:start position:0%
you've asked but in our system it has to
 
00:23:26.149 --> 00:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:28.860 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy I'm sorry I was trying to
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
think about different word but okay
 
00:23:33.169 --> 00:23:33.179 align:start position:0%
do you know if that's legislative or is
 
00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
that or is that a gel thank you you're
 
00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
representative Williams you just just
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
run with it you're nailing it
 
00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
so when you talk just make sure your
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:49.260 align:start position:0%
why we use that
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
I we often use an example Rhode Island
 
00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
which has taken the the
 
00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
um decision of whether to hire someone
 
00:23:58.190 --> 00:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
because really what it does is it allows
 
00:23:59.510 --> 00:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
child care licensing to determine who
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
we're going to hire which helps us from
 
00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
a liability standpoint it gives us extra
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
support but the flip side of that is it
 
00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039 align:start position:0%
takes much longer and if you if the
 
00:24:09.409 --> 00:24:09.419 align:start position:0%
burden is on the business person to
 
00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
decide who they're going to employ and
 
00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:12.059 align:start position:0%
who they're not going to employ once
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
that person's found to be employable by
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
the department of safety it's just a
 
00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
much faster process
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
follow us thank you so can I ask you
 
00:24:24.169 --> 00:24:24.179 align:start position:0%
another question please thank you
 
00:24:24.179 --> 00:24:24.830 align:start position:0%
another question please thank you
um

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:28.020 align:start position:0%
in the case of the fingerprint
 
00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
can you run me through that process a
 
00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
person puts their fingerprints on the
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
card from that point on what happens
 
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
I'm not I it's a very confusing process
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
and I and I hate to come out as an
 
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
expert on this but you would first you
 
00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
would make your appointment you would go
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Safety you get your
 
00:24:51.169 --> 00:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
fingerprints done they would say mail
 
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
that information to they would do their
 
00:24:54.169 --> 00:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
background check and mail the
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
information to child care licensing
 
00:24:58.250 --> 00:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
after on my end after I'd had my
 
00:24:59.810 --> 00:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
fingerprints done I would go back to my
 
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
office fill out the required paperwork
 
00:25:05.330 --> 00:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
um that was mentioned sign it have it
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
notarized and then sent child care
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
licensing child care licensing would use
 
00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:11.460 align:start position:0%
that as the prompt to look to see if
 
00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
that person's been cleared to work in
 
00:25:15.590 --> 00:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
the field and unfortunately you are
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
correct about out of state employees
 
00:25:20.510 --> 00:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
because we are at the the mercy of other
 
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
states to tell us if a person is on is
 
00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:25.320 align:start position:0%
employable and if they don't after 45
 
00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:28.200 align:start position:0%
days they're deemed employable so that's
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
the unfortunate thing about hiring out
 
00:25:33.049 --> 00:25:33.059 align:start position:0%
of state employees yeah
 
00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:35.700 align:start position:0%
so I guess I didn't make my question
 
00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
clear and I apologize for that so I put
 
00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
my fingerprints on a card I handed in
 
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:44.520 align:start position:0%
what happens to that card from that
 
00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
moment on is it scanned into a computer
 
00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
and sent out yes the FBI database so
 
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
from the moment
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
one more of course yeah just just just
 
00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
flow with it we're not so for
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
from the moment that that is scanned
 
00:26:02.990 --> 00:26:03.000 align:start position:0%
into the system what is the average
 
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
return rate it used to be quite lengthy
 
00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
now they're trying to get us back to us
 
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
between 7 to 14 days and it has come
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
today child care licensing
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
but I would never receive it I'm sorry
 
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
excuse me I I would never receive
 
00:26:19.669 --> 00:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
anything from the Department of Safety
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
so their process is quite quick but then
 
00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
they communicate with the child care
 
00:26:24.179 --> 00:26:25.370 align:start position:0%
they communicate with the child care
licensing

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:25.380 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
00:26:27.409 --> 00:26:27.419 align:start position:0%
so let's go back to the Department of
 
00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
Safety how long does it take the
 
00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
Department of State to get that
 
00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:32.420 align:start position:0%
Department of State to get that
information

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:32.430 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.370 align:start position:0%
information
[Music]

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.380 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
that's my point thank you yeah if you
 
00:26:41.870 --> 00:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
don't mind it's 48 hours so 48 so the
 
00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:43.740 align:start position:0%
department of safety
 
00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200 align:start position:0%
um once uh it's 48 Hours turn around and
 
00:26:48.409 --> 00:26:48.419 align:start position:0%
the problem is the results of those
 
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
checks don't go back to the employer
 
00:26:53.149 --> 00:26:53.159 align:start position:0%
they do with with hospitals hospitals
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
get them but in child care they can't
 
00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
know it's got to go to licensing correct
 
00:27:00.350 --> 00:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
so if we circumvent licensing we send it
 
00:27:02.570 --> 00:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
to licensing okay they can have it if
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
they want it but we send it to the
 
00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
employer so they're going to get the
 
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:09.240 align:start position:0%
Corey within 24 hours and they're going
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
to get the fingerprints without within
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
48 Hours results so within three days
 
00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
it's the potential is that that child
 
00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
care center could hire that person
 
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
because all the necessary paperwork is
 
00:27:24.649 --> 00:27:24.659 align:start position:0%
in place that's right they can hire them
 
00:27:27.529 --> 00:27:27.539 align:start position:0%
under supervision still so yes and
 
00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:30.419 align:start position:0%
that's not a waiver situation that saves
 
00:27:35.049 --> 00:27:35.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:39.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:47.820 align:start position:0%
that it puts the burden of the
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
employability on the provider themselves
 
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
which I feel comfortable doing that I
 
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
feel like I can decide who I want to
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
hire and who I don't it does take DHHS
 
00:27:57.649 --> 00:27:57.659 align:start position:0%
out of the decision making about whether
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
to employ someone and so that has been a
 
00:28:02.210 --> 00:28:02.220 align:start position:0%
barrier that I think other states have
 
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
struggled with and that would be a that
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
would be a shift in New Hampshire that
 
00:28:08.210 --> 00:28:08.220 align:start position:0%
DHHS is not determining who we can hire
 
00:28:11.450 --> 00:28:11.460 align:start position:0%
well a a middle ground of that
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
um I mean I like the employer making
 
00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.269 align:start position:0%
um I mean I like the employer making
decisions

00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
decisions
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
um a middle ground to that would be
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
if they've gotten the fingerprints
 
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.750 align:start position:0%
if they've gotten the fingerprints
the

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:22.010 align:start position:0%
the
um

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
Corey has um was a new acronym uh the
 
00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
Quarry has sent it to DHHS and the
 
00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:30.539 align:start position:0%
employer the employer looks at and says
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in your background check
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
here that's a problem there's really
 
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
nothing in here I'm going to start
 
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
you're gonna start working with you you
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
can't be left alone with children until
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
you get your stamp from DHHS but you can
 
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:42.480 align:start position:0%
at least start
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
and that saves us seven hundred thousand
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
dollars and would include and speed up
 
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
our background check process
 
00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
it would
 
00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
really quickly um so it's the FBI
 
00:28:55.909 --> 00:28:55.919 align:start position:0%
background check results that come in 48
 
00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:57.419 align:start position:0%
hours from Department through Department
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
of Safety there are other background
 
00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:01.980 align:start position:0%
checks there are other state Registries
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
that folks that licensing and others are
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
doing so there's more coming in terms of
 
00:29:09.289 --> 00:29:09.299 align:start position:0%
findings but it's the FBI national
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
results that come in 48 hours and that's
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
where the employer can decide okay no
 
00:29:16.610 --> 00:29:16.620 align:start position:0%
results I'm going to hire you or not if
 
00:29:19.789 --> 00:29:19.799 align:start position:0%
you're right and the the federal statute
 
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:22.740 align:start position:0%
around the 700 000 that only pertains to
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
the National background check right
 
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
correct so there'd be no there'd be no
 
00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:29.700 align:start position:0%
fine so there's no fine and we get the
 
00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:32.700 align:start position:0%
employer employee potentially spun up in
 
00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:41.090 --> 00:29:41.100 align:start position:0%
just later though because I actually
 
00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:44.039 align:start position:0%
believe the 700 000 would be annual so
 
00:29:45.710 --> 00:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
it would give us a year to it would give
 
00:29:47.570 --> 00:29:47.580 align:start position:0%
us a year it would buy us time and that
 
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
is what the child care advisory Council
 
00:29:50.450 --> 00:29:50.460 align:start position:0%
and early learning New Hampshire
 
00:29:53.210 --> 00:29:53.220 align:start position:0%
recommended to our DHHS Partners sure
 
00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
and just quickly if you don't mind um so
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh Deputy Commissioner assistant
 
00:29:59.810 --> 00:29:59.820 align:start position:0%
commissioner Eddie Edwards from
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety they've really
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
looked into this there is a jet there is
 
00:30:06.169 --> 00:30:06.179 align:start position:0%
a rule and there is a law which states
 
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire how we have to do it so
 
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
those would have to change but it would
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
still meet federal guidelines so we need
 
00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:14.340 align:start position:0%
to change the nice part about changing
 
00:30:15.649 --> 00:30:15.659 align:start position:0%
the laws that just immediately overrides
 
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
the rule so
 
00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:20.360 align:start position:0%
rules are not laws rules are not laws
 
00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
rules are rules laws are laws
 
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.529 align:start position:0%
rules are rules laws are laws
um

00:30:24.529 --> 00:30:24.539 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:26.700 align:start position:0%
okay well hey look at that we actually
 
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:27.830 align:start position:0%
okay well hey look at that we actually
uh

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:30:30.470 --> 00:30:30.480 align:start position:0%
we actually have a does anybody have an
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
idea like kind of preliminary we're
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
obviously not taking both today so when
 
00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:34.140 align:start position:0%
I'm legislation in front of us does
 
00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:35.820 align:start position:0%
anybody have any kind of preliminary
 
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:37.799 align:start position:0%
thoughts about this but personally I
 
00:30:39.649 --> 00:30:39.659 align:start position:0%
think it sounds great
 
00:30:42.289 --> 00:30:42.299 align:start position:0%
um representative mclames
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
do we have anyone in the Senate that we
 
00:30:46.669 --> 00:30:46.679 align:start position:0%
could work with to do an emergency Bill
 
00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:49.140 align:start position:0%
to address this immediately uh I'm I'm
 
00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
more than happy to reach out to our
 
00:30:53.029 --> 00:30:53.039 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the Senate um
 
00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
very timely and it's something that we
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
as a committee that's just chomping at
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
the bit to try to solve problems could
 
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
pretty easily solve if we've got a sunny
 
00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
colleague that we can do a quick bill to
 
00:31:06.889 --> 00:31:06.899 align:start position:0%
get this in I'm I'm more than happy to
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
take a punch at that and if you if you
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
want to be on there with me
 
00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:14.460 align:start position:0%
um I'm more than happy to be happy
 
00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:16.380 align:start position:0%
all right I would I would love to do
 
00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
that and then they'll they'll know that
 
00:31:21.230 --> 00:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
we are for real so we can also go to the
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
speaker's office
 
00:31:24.889 --> 00:31:24.899 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
ask him to uh late drafting late draft
 
00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
for late drafting yeah if everybody if
 
00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:33.419 align:start position:0%
everybody here on the on you know the
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
two teams that exist both teams are
 
00:31:36.529 --> 00:31:36.539 align:start position:0%
saying do it do it do it I don't see why
 
00:31:37.669 --> 00:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
we'd have a problem
 
00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh running that through rules the seven
 
00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:40.500 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars may get people
 
00:31:42.950 --> 00:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
heartburn but I think they can deal with
 
00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:46.440 align:start position:0%
it it's all it's all sounding promising
 
00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
to me I think I just want to hear the
 
00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
DHHS perspective before
 
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
I would sign on to something just so I
 
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
can hear why they are advocating
 
00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
something different send to them because
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
it's inconvenient yeah it's inconvenient
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
I hear that and if that's the only
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:09.140 align:start position:0%
DHHS and at the same time send to the
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
facility so it's just a BCC or a cc to a
 
00:32:15.049 --> 00:32:15.059 align:start position:0%
communication like you know it's 2023
 
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
you can handle it yeah it would be the
 
00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
the CC with the caveat that the worker
 
00:32:22.250 --> 00:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
could start working provided there's
 
00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940 align:start position:0%
nothing in the background check right if
 
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
obviously if there's something that
 
00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:27.179 align:start position:0%
comes back in there you know
 
00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:29.100 align:start position:0%
that the employer would then see right
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
then I guess there's a certain amount of
 
00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
employer discretion
 
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
um but you know if somebody has a you
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
know DUI from 10 years ago that's not
 
00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:38.580 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean you can't work with
 
00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:40.260 align:start position:0%
children obviously if they were just
 
00:32:43.850 --> 00:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
arrested for child neglect yeah I had
 
00:32:45.889 --> 00:32:45.899 align:start position:0%
somebody apply to my child care center
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
that told me they had been a convicted
 
00:32:49.970 --> 00:32:49.980 align:start position:0%
of child neglect I said no absolutely
 
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:52.740 align:start position:0%
not absolutely Mr chairman one of the
 
00:32:54.889 --> 00:32:54.899 align:start position:0%
things I find incentivizes people who
 
00:32:56.870 --> 00:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
don't show up to testify is to let them
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
know that in two weeks we're going ahead
 
00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
on this and would love to hear from them
 
00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
and please come yeah because we're going
 
00:33:05.269 --> 00:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
ahead otherwise I I have no problem
 
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
moving ahead without them in terms of
 
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:10.260 align:start position:0%
not voting in my committees we nod which
 
00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
is a non-vote vote yeah and I think
 
00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
we're not being so is everybody nodding
 
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:19.140 align:start position:0%
um okay nodding nodding not nodding off
 
00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:20.700 align:start position:0%
but nodding
 
00:33:24.409 --> 00:33:24.419 align:start position:0%
um I it had it's it from an employer
 
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:26.100 align:start position:0%
stand point of view putting my employer
 
00:33:29.149 --> 00:33:29.159 align:start position:0%
hat on um it is a critical critical
 
00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:30.360 align:start position:0%
problem because you are commitment yes I
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
representative on you can I just ask a
 
00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:33.720 align:start position:0%
quick question and I apologize if we
 
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
already covered this but
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
um aside from your great succession or
 
00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
suggestion that a simple CC
 
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
um should hopefully alleviate some of
 
00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:43.620 align:start position:0%
concerns trying to get ahead of what
 
00:33:45.769 --> 00:33:45.779 align:start position:0%
DHHS might not like about what we're
 
00:33:47.330 --> 00:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
proposing since they were suggesting a
 
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
different alternative
 
00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
um can we identify some of the other
 
00:33:53.810 --> 00:33:53.820 align:start position:0%
barriers for them um that we can tackle
 
00:33:56.149 --> 00:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
ahead of time I mean not not speaking
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
for them my guess is that they're going
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
to be concerned that they're not giving
 
00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:01.019 align:start position:0%
the final sign off on somebody to work
 
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:03.419 align:start position:0%
there and also maybe from the other
 
00:34:05.930 --> 00:34:05.940 align:start position:0%
things that they're looking at
 
00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
um they may say that they want to wait
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
for those to come back that'd be my
 
00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:11.700 align:start position:0%
guess I won't say about them
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
um my Counterpoint to that preemptively
 
00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
well you were issuing the waivers
 
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:17.580 align:start position:0%
beforehand so what became more dangerous
 
00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:20.520 align:start position:0%
like what my question is on December 7th
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
what happened what was magical about
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
December 7th
 
00:34:26.450 --> 00:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
um other than the other than it's and
 
00:34:29.210 --> 00:34:29.220 align:start position:0%
then it's nine days before my birthday
 
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
I'd like to give you a little background
 
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
of something that in December when this
 
00:34:35.690 --> 00:34:35.700 align:start position:0%
waiver when we first found out the
 
00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
waiver was going to be eliminated the
 
00:34:40.849 --> 00:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
Child Care Advocates and providers I'll
 
00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:42.899 align:start position:0%
talk with the Department talked with the
 
00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:44.820 align:start position:0%
governor's office talked with the
 
00:34:46.669 --> 00:34:46.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and it had been the
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
recommendation of Marianne and I and our
 
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
constituents to do exactly this let's
 
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
change the law let's just have DHHS I
 
00:34:57.890 --> 00:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
mean Department of Safety do the back do
 
00:34:59.810 --> 00:34:59.820 align:start position:0%
the FBI check let's get the results have
 
00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
a go to the employer that was the
 
00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:04.140 align:start position:0%
suggestion and just for you to know the
 
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:05.820 align:start position:0%
governor's office who does want an
 
00:35:08.329 --> 00:35:08.339 align:start position:0%
efficient system he wants it to be
 
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
corrected in system did say well let
 
00:35:14.329 --> 00:35:14.339 align:start position:0%
because DHHS had said let's give us a
 
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
give us a chance to have it be faster
 
00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
and that's how it was left
 
00:35:23.690 --> 00:35:23.700 align:start position:0%
and so far mixed yes open hope in one
 
00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:29.220 align:start position:0%
hand with DHHS 200 people under what
 
00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:32.339 align:start position:0%
they can have I would think they would
 
00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
not mind giving some of their work over
 
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:36.900 align:start position:0%
to another department yes and I think
 
00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:38.579 align:start position:0%
Marianne you might have said it but um
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island does it in three days
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
the whole thing and they don't use their
 
00:35:45.890 --> 00:35:45.900 align:start position:0%
DHHS I uh
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
I hate getting beat by Rhode Island in
 
00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:49.730 align:start position:0%
I hate getting beat by Rhode Island in
anything

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
if it was a game of tic-tac-toe versus
 
00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
Governors I'd be screaming for governor
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
if I'm understanding correctly ultimate
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
ultimoyer and JHS is also getting the
 
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
information ultimately they still have
 
00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
you know their control or discretion
 
00:36:10.130 --> 00:36:10.140 align:start position:0%
um to Nick somebody who is now working
 
00:36:12.349 --> 00:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
so if I'm following this correctly so in
 
00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:13.740 align:start position:0%
other words the person is able to start
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
working sooner and if something
 
00:36:17.810 --> 00:36:17.820 align:start position:0%
problematic shows up the DHHS has an
 
00:36:19.609 --> 00:36:19.619 align:start position:0%
issue with it okay so maybe it's been a
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
week or two weeks that that person's
 
00:36:22.849 --> 00:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
been in there but um but never being
 
00:36:24.109 --> 00:36:24.119 align:start position:0%
left alone with children that would be
 
00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
the caveat never being left alone
 
00:36:27.109 --> 00:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
children which by the way that was the
 
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:28.920 align:start position:0%
waiver you could never be left alone I
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
had a waiver by the way just FYI
 
00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.150 align:start position:0%
had a waiver by the way just FYI
um

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:42.109 align:start position:0%
 
upon

00:36:42.109 --> 00:36:42.119 align:start position:0%
upon
 
00:36:44.510 --> 00:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
the final
 
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
completion of the background check yeah
 
00:36:47.329 --> 00:36:47.339 align:start position:0%
the completion of a background check no
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
you could hire them with the background
 
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:53.460 align:start position:0%
check that you received conditionally
 
00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.550 align:start position:0%
check that you received conditionally
upon

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:55.560 align:start position:0%
upon
 
00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:56.630 align:start position:0%
upon
um

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:00.170 --> 00:37:00.180 align:start position:0%
backup from DHHS yeah yeah and that
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
gives you 90 days some in some cases so
 
00:37:06.589 --> 00:37:06.599 align:start position:0%
now you have an employee who you feel
 
00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:09.720 align:start position:0%
will be great a great fit for 90 days
 
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
and it gives DHHS the opportunity
 
00:37:16.250 --> 00:37:16.260 align:start position:0%
unfortunately to be at a snail's pace
 
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:18.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and hopefully they will hopefully
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
they'll move expeditiously but at least
 
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:22.500 align:start position:0%
at least it will relieve some of the
 
00:37:24.829 --> 00:37:24.839 align:start position:0%
problems of hiring and getting people
 
00:37:26.450 --> 00:37:26.460 align:start position:0%
because from what I I know from my own
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
Center and I know from talking to other
 
00:37:29.089 --> 00:37:29.099 align:start position:0%
child care centers it's like I have
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
capacity my Center's capacity up to 60.
 
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
I can only take 44 right now because of
 
00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
teachers not because of space
 
00:37:38.329 --> 00:37:38.339 align:start position:0%
um if I had space trust me I'd be at 60
 
00:37:40.609 --> 00:37:40.619 align:start position:0%
like that
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
um so all right well it sounds like we
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
have an idea I will work uh with
 
00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams uh I will go
 
00:37:48.290 --> 00:37:48.300 align:start position:0%
over to the speaker's office after we're
 
00:37:51.290 --> 00:37:51.300 align:start position:0%
done here uh and ask what the process is
 
00:37:52.910 --> 00:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
for that if they tell me no we'll start
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
bothering senators and I think we
 
00:37:56.089 --> 00:37:56.099 align:start position:0%
probably both know Senators who would be
 
00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
all in to do this sort of deal
 
00:37:58.980 --> 00:37:59.690 align:start position:0%
all in to do this sort of deal
um

00:37:59.690 --> 00:37:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
look at that do we have any other
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
questions comments concerns about the
 
00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:10.200 align:start position:0%
all right so that was uh that was
 
00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
actually refreshing
 
00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
um now we'll get into this to the uh the
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
slog of it of
 
00:38:21.170 --> 00:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
um how do we find ways to get more child
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
care centers including
 
00:38:24.119 --> 00:38:24.710 align:start position:0%
care centers including
um

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:27.349 --> 00:38:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh at home centers five plus and that
 
00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:29.099 align:start position:0%
bill that I think is coming over for the
 
00:38:31.010 --> 00:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
Senate the 12 the one the basically the
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
hybrid right the 12 person one am I just
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
like making that up in my head you know
 
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
what I'm talking about what
 
00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:38.690 align:start position:0%
what I'm talking about what
yes

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:38:42.470 --> 00:38:42.480 align:start position:0%
um so I want to take a look at
 
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:43.680 align:start position:0%
um just so we're kind of familiar with
 
00:38:45.410 --> 00:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
it we're not going to go like all into
 
00:38:47.569 --> 00:38:47.579 align:start position:0%
this I would highly suggest to the
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
fellow committee members who start
 
00:38:50.210 --> 00:38:50.220 align:start position:0%
taking a look at some of the regulations
 
00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
uh I was doing it last night after
 
00:38:54.650 --> 00:38:54.660 align:start position:0%
writing an amendment for municipal and
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
County government which I'm sure they're
 
00:38:57.650 --> 00:38:57.660 align:start position:0%
going to itl anyways
 
00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
um but uh I got too tired we fell asleep
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
um so I'm what I would before we start
 
00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:05.640 align:start position:0%
this off one fast one pieces of homework
 
00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740 align:start position:0%
is you know go home and find something
 
00:39:10.069 --> 00:39:10.079 align:start position:0%
in here that needs to change I certainly
 
00:39:12.109 --> 00:39:12.119 align:start position:0%
have my ideas they will not be
 
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:13.740 align:start position:0%
universally loved
 
00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:14.880 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:16.430 align:start position:0%
um but
um

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
oh this is RSA 170 and everything that
 
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
touches RSA 170.
 
00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:23.460 align:start position:0%
um so RSA 170 is just
 
00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:25.980 align:start position:0%
RSA 170 is not bad I think it's only 35
 
00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.849 align:start position:0%
RSA 170 is not bad I think it's only 35
pages

00:39:27.849 --> 00:39:27.859 align:start position:0%
pages
 
00:39:30.230 --> 00:39:30.240 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
they asked me why I wanted to print it
 
00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:32.460 align:start position:0%
out and I said well because you got to
 
00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
see it so this is this is double-sided
 
00:39:37.550 --> 00:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
RSA 170. so RSA 170 is the governing the
 
00:39:40.310 --> 00:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
principal statutes governing licensed
 
00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:41.940 align:start position:0%
Child Care Centers obviously they
 
00:39:44.030 --> 00:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
reference other things about child
 
00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:45.780 align:start position:0%
safety child neglect child abuse
 
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:47.460 align:start position:0%
parental rights
 
00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:48.230 align:start position:0%
parental rights
um

00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
he's that might you know focus on focus
 
00:39:54.829 --> 00:39:54.839 align:start position:0%
on 170 um there's 101 pages of
 
00:39:58.430 --> 00:39:58.440 align:start position:0%
regulations and four zero zero two
 
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
um that we need to kind of start parsing
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
through a a big thing for me on a
 
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:05.400 align:start position:0%
personal level is finding ways to
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
expedite the application and approval
 
00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.230 align:start position:0%
expedite the application and approval
process

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:09.240 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.490 align:start position:0%
process
so

00:40:10.490 --> 00:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:13.730 --> 00:40:13.740 align:start position:0%
um speaking from personal experience
 
00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
um Let me let me kind of talk about my
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
child care center and the struggles that
 
00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:19.320 align:start position:0%
me and my wife went through to
 
00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
I don't say start our truck we didn't
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
start when we bought one
 
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
so my wife has worked in child care for
 
00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:26.460 align:start position:0%
17 years
 
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
um I have not but she was very
 
00:40:30.050 --> 00:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
supportive of me in my early career
 
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
Pursuits and I wanted to get back to her
 
00:40:33.050 --> 00:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
so she said I want about chocolate
 
00:40:35.210 --> 00:40:35.220 align:start position:0%
Center said you know what let's do it so
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
we found a child care center that had
 
00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:38.339 align:start position:0%
been pre-ravaged by coven when we go in
 
00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
the details of that but basically when
 
00:40:41.329 --> 00:40:41.339 align:start position:0%
everybody went home they didn't need
 
00:40:43.609 --> 00:40:43.619 align:start position:0%
child care so what happened right
 
00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
um so we buy this existing Center so
 
00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
very important existing center right
 
00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:49.800 align:start position:0%
it's an existing Center
 
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
um it's a pretty re-licensed space right
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
re-licensed existing Center we buy it on
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
February 28th is when we formally took
 
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
possession which was a brilliant move by
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
the previous owner to make me pay rent
 
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
on March 1st did not see that one coming
 
00:41:05.030 --> 00:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
um it's real fun
 
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:05.750 align:start position:0%
um it's real fun
um

00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
and then we went through that we we
 
00:41:10.910 --> 00:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
notify DHHS there but we don't notify
 
00:41:12.170 --> 00:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
change of ownership because the license
 
00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
is not to the owner the license is to
 
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
the LLC the facility we said notify them
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
change of director right
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
because every licensed soccer center has
 
00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:21.839 align:start position:0%
to have a director
 
00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.060 align:start position:0%
so they
 
00:41:25.790 --> 00:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
um they say oh well you have to do a
 
00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:30.900 align:start position:0%
and um in my brain I'm like
 
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
no right
 
00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:35.940 align:start position:0%
um You Don't license the owner you
 
00:41:37.849 --> 00:41:37.859 align:start position:0%
license the center the center must be in
 
00:41:37.859 --> 00:41:39.109 align:start position:0%
license the center the center must be in
compliant

00:41:39.109 --> 00:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
compliant
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
um so we go we're not going to find it
 
00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
right whatever so we go through the
 
00:41:44.990 --> 00:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
process of basically starting all over
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
again right my wife was a site director
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
at a previous spot which the the
 
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
differences between a site director and
 
00:41:54.710 --> 00:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
a director are minute she's easily
 
00:41:56.089 --> 00:41:56.099 align:start position:0%
qualified she was qualified for a site
 
00:41:59.870 --> 00:41:59.880 align:start position:0%
director the the changes I think I think
 
00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
literally the only changes you have to
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
have some sort of background as a
 
00:42:05.329 --> 00:42:05.339 align:start position:0%
director in management I think it's very
 
00:42:06.710 --> 00:42:06.720 align:start position:0%
tiny it's
 
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
laughable by the way it's another
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
regulation we should look at
 
00:42:14.089 --> 00:42:14.099 align:start position:0%
um so we get the um
 
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
we get there we go through the whole
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
process and then they come out and
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
inspect the facility
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
and then another licensor takes over and
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's like well why are you doing this
 
00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
you already have a license so we go
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
through this whole rigm roll right of
 
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
the inspection they're measuring Drop
 
00:42:32.089 --> 00:42:32.099 align:start position:0%
Zones right all the stuff that they've
 
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
already done to a licensed facility
 
00:42:36.349 --> 00:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
um and then they were like No And they
 
00:42:37.609 --> 00:42:37.619 align:start position:0%
actually had to send it up to Legal
 
00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:39.780 align:start position:0%
because they couldn't comprehend that an
 
00:42:42.349 --> 00:42:42.359 align:start position:0%
LLC had bought an LLC they like couldn't
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
comprehend that
 
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.589 align:start position:0%
comprehend that
um so

00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
that's fine all right so we get a
 
00:42:48.829 --> 00:42:48.839 align:start position:0%
license we're happy we're operating or
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
whatever right
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
um we grow it's great we want to expand
 
00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:55.980 align:start position:0%
so we're on a strip mall so we just
 
00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
leased the units that was next to us
 
00:42:59.210 --> 00:42:59.220 align:start position:0%
which had been vacant for four years
 
00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
used to be a dentist office which by the
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
way was great because there was water
 
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
that's right there was water in the
 
00:43:09.829 --> 00:43:09.839 align:start position:0%
rooms like what that was awesome
 
00:43:11.210 --> 00:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
for my classrooms I could have an
 
00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:12.420 align:start position:0%
infinite toddler room which I couldn't
 
00:43:15.530 --> 00:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
have before you you know
 
00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.190 align:start position:0%
have before you you know
um

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
so we go do it we get the we install the
 
00:43:23.930 --> 00:43:23.940 align:start position:0%
changing tables with the water right
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
very easy and we can't get them to come
 
00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
out and inspect it for the life of us we
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
can't and we've we've we're already
 
00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
leasing it right so we're incurring the
 
00:43:32.640 --> 00:43:34.250 align:start position:0%
leasing it right so we're incurring the
cost

00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
um and we're sending emails and we're
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
calling by the way if any of you picked
 
00:43:38.569 --> 00:43:38.579 align:start position:0%
up the phone right now and you called
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
the child care licensing unit no one
 
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
would pick up I promise you no one would
 
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
pick up I actually thought about doing a
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
display of like dialing them up and be
 
00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
like they don't call so we start sending
 
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
emails and requesting the general
 
00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
aligned or a licensor when are you
 
00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.140 align:start position:0%
coming when are you coming when are you
 
00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.089 align:start position:0%
coming when are you coming when are you
coming

00:43:56.089 --> 00:43:56.099 align:start position:0%
coming
 
00:43:57.710 --> 00:43:57.720 align:start position:0%
one of them was a straight up ultimatum
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
we're opening in three days
 
00:44:02.329 --> 00:44:02.339 align:start position:0%
you can come you cannot we're opening in
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
three days because we've already taken
 
00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:06.060 align:start position:0%
people's deposits they're already coming
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
um still no response and I finally had
 
00:44:09.770 --> 00:44:09.780 align:start position:0%
to call our executive counselor
 
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
and be like why can't I get my facility
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
licensed and then all of a sudden we got
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
an inspection
 
00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.050 align:start position:0%
an inspection
um

00:44:18.050 --> 00:44:18.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:20.270 --> 00:44:20.280 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be like that
 
00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:22.160 align:start position:0%
that's problematic for the department
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
but it's also a statement about like
 
00:44:27.650 --> 00:44:27.660 align:start position:0%
process right so clearly the department
 
00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't understand their process and
 
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
felt to me like they didn't understand
 
00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:34.500 align:start position:0%
urgency right somebody's trying to
 
00:44:36.109 --> 00:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
expand infant and toddler care in the
 
00:44:38.569 --> 00:44:38.579 align:start position:0%
state and you're not responsive you're
 
00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
not scheduling it and you're not showing
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
up and you have to basically be
 
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
politically threatened go thank you Mr
 
00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:45.710 align:start position:0%
politically threatened go thank you Mr
chairman

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:48.839 align:start position:0%
um what was the period of time between
 
00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:51.180 align:start position:0%
um you asking and then finally I want to
 
00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:53.220 align:start position:0%
say it was three to four weeks
 
00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:54.599 align:start position:0%
um thank you it was not it was not but
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
but my issue with all this is we need to
 
00:44:59.450 --> 00:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
find a way to get this process
 
00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:01.980 align:start position:0%
streamlined we need to find a way to
 
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
make it
 
00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:04.130 align:start position:0%
make it
um

00:45:04.130 --> 00:45:04.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
easier for people to do and I think
 
00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:08.220 align:start position:0%
another problem is we need to find a way
 
00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
to get the existing child care workers
 
00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
to want to open their own Center
 
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
um because that was something that I
 
00:45:18.890 --> 00:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
discovered a lot of these workers the
 
00:45:21.589 --> 00:45:21.599 align:start position:0%
teachers if you will do not want to run
 
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
their own centers they don't want to be
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
directors and that's a huge problem
 
00:45:27.770 --> 00:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
um most of these businesses they're all
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
small businesses except for a noticeable
 
00:45:31.510 --> 00:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
few most of them over one of them are
 
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
run by women right so they are eligible
 
00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
for loans that I am not eligible for
 
00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:38.930 align:start position:0%
for loans that I am not eligible for
um

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:38.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:41.210 --> 00:45:41.220 align:start position:0%
there's a process for this and the
 
00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
department when you go on there um I
 
00:45:46.970 --> 00:45:46.980 align:start position:0%
sent you I pass it around
 
00:45:49.190 --> 00:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
um you get a
 
00:45:52.130 --> 00:45:52.140 align:start position:0%
four page this is it
 
00:45:53.390 --> 00:45:53.400 align:start position:0%
this is how to open a licensed Child

RC 170.
 
00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:11.460 align:start position:0%
um programs and application materials is
 
00:46:15.349 --> 00:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:16.809 --> 00:46:16.819 align:start position:0%
what's this
 
00:46:19.370 --> 00:46:19.380 align:start position:0%
cclu reviews for completeness returns if
 
00:46:21.589 --> 00:46:21.599 align:start position:0%
not complete any complete applications
 
00:46:22.809 --> 00:46:22.819 align:start position:0%
to refer to license coordinator
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
licensing business are conducted timely

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan is required for
 
00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:31.260 align:start position:0%
non-compliance and no visits the
 
00:46:32.569 --> 00:46:32.579 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan is received and
 
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
approved and prior to issuing a
 
00:46:35.450 --> 00:46:35.460 align:start position:0%
six-month number of new programs worth
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
three license so basically what they do
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
is they come out they inspect you first
 
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
time up you get a six-month license they
 
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
come back in six months they make sure
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
you're doing your job oh I actually have
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
a problem with that I'm not a licensed
 
00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:45.980 align:start position:0%
guy but I don't have a problem with that
 
00:46:49.069 --> 00:46:49.079 align:start position:0%
but I think we can find ways to make
 
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
this process I guess demystify it a
 
00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:53.160 align:start position:0%
little bit I'd like to reduce some
 
00:46:56.089 --> 00:46:56.099 align:start position:0%
regulations in the in the process but I
 
00:46:58.130 --> 00:46:58.140 align:start position:0%
like the committee to not necessarily
 
00:47:00.410 --> 00:47:00.420 align:start position:0%
today because it's a lot but to start
 
00:47:02.210 --> 00:47:02.220 align:start position:0%
finding ways that we can demystify this
 
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
make it easier
 
00:47:05.329 --> 00:47:05.339 align:start position:0%
um this is basically supply and demand
 
00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:07.079 align:start position:0%
right if there's more child careers and
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
whatever like this doesn't benefit me
 
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:10.200 align:start position:0%
financially it's sexually horrible for
 
00:47:12.710 --> 00:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
me to have like competition but if we're
 
00:47:15.890 --> 00:47:15.900 align:start position:0%
going to let the market work we have to
 
00:47:17.870 --> 00:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
try to remove the impediments and we
 
00:47:20.089 --> 00:47:20.099 align:start position:0%
have to try to find a way to demystify
 
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:22.140 align:start position:0%
this process to people who have the
 
00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:26.220 align:start position:0%
passion for it and get them to do the
 
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
business side of it and there's some of
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
that in the RSA to be a director one of
 
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
the things you have to do is you have to
 
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
have a business management class or a
 
00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:39.540 align:start position:0%
certain number of hours of supervision
 
00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640 align:start position:0%
they don't really that doesn't really
 
00:47:43.849 --> 00:47:43.859 align:start position:0%
make sense that's like those are not
 
00:47:43.859 --> 00:47:45.050 align:start position:0%
make sense that's like those are not
equivalent

00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:45.060 align:start position:0%
equivalent
 
00:47:46.670 --> 00:47:46.680 align:start position:0%
um I don't think you really need a
 
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
business class to know how to run child
 
00:47:50.809 --> 00:47:50.819 align:start position:0%
care center it's actually
 
00:47:53.390 --> 00:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
pretty pretty easy I shouldn't say that
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
out loud but it's actually pretty easy
 
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
it's it's payroll rent
 
00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:01.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
any other things in my experience not
 
00:48:06.230 --> 00:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
everyone with a vision knows how to do
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
what you just said yeah yeah and that's
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
and that's part of the problem so like
 
00:48:12.829 --> 00:48:12.839 align:start position:0%
how do we get people into that right so
 
00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
that we can expand this industry get
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
more child care available fill up some
 
00:48:18.890 --> 00:48:18.900 align:start position:0%
of these Child Care deserts that we have
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
which I'm still trying to get the map
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
from them by the way so if anybody has
 
00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:23.880 align:start position:0%
that map and the last map I saw was
 
00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.130 align:start position:0%
that map and the last map I saw was
2019.

00:48:25.130 --> 00:48:25.140 align:start position:0%
2019.
 
00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:26.030 align:start position:0%
2019.
um

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:28.130 --> 00:48:28.140 align:start position:0%
how we got us as a committee start
 
00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
thinking about how do we make that
 
00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:31.910 align:start position:0%
thinking about how do we make that
happen

00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:34.740 align:start position:0%
this isn't necessarily something that I
 
00:48:36.230 --> 00:48:36.240 align:start position:0%
think we think I don't know that this is
 
00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.490 align:start position:0%
think we think I don't know that this is
a

00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
answer but um it sort of relates to a
 
00:48:41.750 --> 00:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
phone call I had last week from um John
 
00:48:44.089 --> 00:48:44.099 align:start position:0%
Nyan who is the president of the Hampton
 
00:48:46.130 --> 00:48:46.140 align:start position:0%
Chamber of Commerce and he's also I've
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
got his exact title but I want to say he
 
00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:50.339 align:start position:0%
might be uh chair of the Statewide
 
00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:53.220 align:start position:0%
Chambers of Commerce and this has sort
 
00:48:54.890 --> 00:48:54.900 align:start position:0%
of been his pet issue but he's taken on
 
00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
because obviously Workforce is a huge
 
00:48:58.309 --> 00:48:58.319 align:start position:0%
problem everywhere but especially on the
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
Seacoast right now
 
00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
um and so he's been working hard on on
 
00:49:05.690 --> 00:49:05.700 align:start position:0%
various programs to basically
 
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
um allow High School seniors
 
00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:11.160 align:start position:0%
um to come out of school already ready
 
00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
to work in licensed trades and he's been
 
00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
pretty successful at that and I think
 
00:49:16.250 --> 00:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
he's really interested in moving that
 
00:49:18.349 --> 00:49:18.359 align:start position:0%
into the child care space as well but
 
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
along those same lines I just wonder if
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
maybe working with the Chambers of
 
00:49:26.210 --> 00:49:26.220 align:start position:0%
Commerce to develop programs where if
 
00:49:27.829 --> 00:49:27.839 align:start position:0%
somebody you know you're I think of the
 
00:49:29.390 --> 00:49:29.400 align:start position:0%
child care teachers in in my kids
 
00:49:30.890 --> 00:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
centers right and they're wonderful
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
people but looking at something like
 
00:49:34.309 --> 00:49:34.319 align:start position:0%
this I think that they would put it
 
00:49:35.450 --> 00:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
right back down and say that's
 
00:49:38.329 --> 00:49:38.339 align:start position:0%
overwhelming I I can't do it but if
 
00:49:40.069 --> 00:49:40.079 align:start position:0%
there's some sort of program similar to
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
what like score offers
 
00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:44.220 align:start position:0%
um or the SBA programs that basically
 
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
say we'll hold your hand and walk you
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
through this combined with maybe us
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
looking legislatively at how we can
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
reduce some of the barriers with
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
regulations maybe that's an option no I
 
00:49:55.370 --> 00:49:55.380 align:start position:0%
like I I'm totally on board with that
 
00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:56.329 align:start position:0%
like I I'm totally on board with that
concept

00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:56.339 align:start position:0%
concept
 
00:49:56.339 --> 00:49:56.990 align:start position:0%
concept
um

00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
just me speaking you know we we offer
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
the state offers and I've brought this
 
00:50:03.050 --> 00:50:03.060 align:start position:0%
up before the state offers certain
 
00:50:04.430 --> 00:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
supplementary trainings for child care
 
00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:06.300 align:start position:0%
workers through they call Pro Solutions
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's the company that administers it
 
00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
those things are a lot of them are some
 
00:50:12.650 --> 00:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
of some of them are voluntary not all of
 
00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
them are mandatory there's no reason we
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't develop something for these
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
teachers because they're supposed to be
 
00:50:19.069 --> 00:50:19.079 align:start position:0%
doing a certain amount of continuing
 
00:50:20.930 --> 00:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
education there's no reason we couldn't
 
00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't want to mandate anything
 
00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:23.700 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not a mandate guy but
 
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
there's no reason we couldn't offer that
 
00:50:26.809 --> 00:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
as part of this Suite of services that
 
00:50:28.849 --> 00:50:28.859 align:start position:0%
we're already offering of like hey like
 
00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:31.319 align:start position:0%
here's how you start a Child Care Center
 
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:33.900 align:start position:0%
or here's how you you know manage
 
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:35.880 align:start position:0%
basically kind of demystify the process
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
I love the idea of
 
00:50:40.609 --> 00:50:40.619 align:start position:0%
basically getting them high school
 
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
getting them ready to go in because a
 
00:50:43.250 --> 00:50:43.260 align:start position:0%
lot of the like my teachers are all very
 
00:50:44.690 --> 00:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
young they wanted to do that from day
 
00:50:46.069 --> 00:50:46.079 align:start position:0%
one right like
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
pop them right on in
 
00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
um you know and they're very passionate
 
00:50:52.069 --> 00:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
about it they love it
 
00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:54.720 align:start position:0%
um I I would love to explore ways to
 
00:50:56.450 --> 00:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
make that happen
 
00:50:58.910 --> 00:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
um I would love to do that and I love
 
00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
the idea of finding a way to get it like
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
high school credit or something like
 
00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:03.410 align:start position:0%
high school credit or something like
that

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:04.010 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
if that's your chosen career field like
 
00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:07.980 align:start position:0%
go there
 
00:51:10.190 --> 00:51:10.200 align:start position:0%
to that um he did offer and actually
 
00:51:11.809 --> 00:51:11.819 align:start position:0%
would love to come up and speak to us at
 
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
some point please invite him please
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
please do I would I would love to get
 
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
them up here and talk about that and
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
find a way to do this because that's a
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
long-term solution I'm sorry I missed
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
you I don't know how long anyways
 
00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:25.859 align:start position:0%
um I think that's a great idea we've had
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
programs like that in my neck of the
 
00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:30.540 align:start position:0%
woods that we have then pulled back on I
 
00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:32.940 align:start position:0%
think the only caution I can put out
 
00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:36.680 align:start position:0%
there on that is unless we also solve
 
00:51:39.710 --> 00:51:39.720 align:start position:0%
the S the career sustainability part of
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
it that we talked about in our last
 
00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
meeting then I think that's
 
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
like sort of a lost cause you know it's
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
great to get someone into a program
 
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
where they're moving right out of high
 
00:51:50.390 --> 00:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
school and something like this but then
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
if on the other end of that they don't
 
00:51:54.290 --> 00:51:54.300 align:start position:0%
see how they can build a life for
 
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
themselves and their families on the
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
wage they're making then I think we're
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
we're wasting our time you know so I
 
00:52:01.549 --> 00:52:01.559 align:start position:0%
think we have to we don't if we don't
 
00:52:03.049 --> 00:52:03.059 align:start position:0%
deal with that part of the issue at the
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
same time I I don't think we're going
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
anywhere all right let me ask you a
 
00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:07.910 align:start position:0%
anywhere all right let me ask you a
question

00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
um why does your community pull back
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
well I would want to invite the director
 
00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:15.300 align:start position:0%
of the program there to to speak to that
 
00:52:17.030 --> 00:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
we are having we're having a lot of
 
00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:18.720 align:start position:0%
issues and we've had a couple different
 
00:52:21.049 --> 00:52:21.059 align:start position:0%
facility closures in my area I know
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
there's another facility that's at risk
 
00:52:25.849 --> 00:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
of closure so do they um do they what is
 
00:52:28.549 --> 00:52:28.559 align:start position:0%
it what's the issue with just a like in
 
00:52:30.650 --> 00:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
a brief nutshell do you know or I think
 
00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:31.849 align:start position:0%
a brief nutshell do you know or I think
it's

00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:31.859 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
hiring is a huge part of it I know that
 
00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:35.280 align:start position:0%
one Center has had a hundred percent
 
00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:37.140 align:start position:0%
turnover it's a I don't know they
 
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
probably they've got maybe three
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
classrooms they've had 100 turnover and
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
their teachers maybe more than once in
 
00:52:45.049 --> 00:52:45.059 align:start position:0%
the last couple years
 
00:52:47.569 --> 00:52:47.579 align:start position:0%
um they're just not able to
 
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
pay people to stay yeah okay
 
00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:52.010 align:start position:0%
pay people to stay yeah okay
um yes

00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
um yes
 
00:52:53.809 --> 00:52:53.819 align:start position:0%
there is actually an official answer to
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
that which is that in 2015 the
 
00:52:59.089 --> 00:52:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
to Early Childhood tracks and those
 
00:53:02.750 --> 00:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
children were
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
um diverted into teacher preparation for
 
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
public schools so in 2015 we within a
 
00:53:11.329 --> 00:53:11.339 align:start position:0%
six-month period we lost our pathway
 
00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
into the field so so one existed and we
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
just shut it down a truly successful one
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
existed I mean I I have 50 staff members
 
00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
30 of those staff came straight out of
 
00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
those programs and systematically just
 
00:53:27.829 --> 00:53:27.839 align:start position:0%
ended in 2015. do you have any documents
 
00:53:29.809 --> 00:53:29.819 align:start position:0%
from that program can you send that to
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
us that would be I think that would be
 
00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:34.210 align:start position:0%
wonderful is my only objection to that
 
00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:34.549 align:start position:0%
wonderful is my only objection to that

um
yes

00:53:37.450 --> 00:53:37.460 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
quickly back to your
 
00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:44.280 align:start position:0%
um discussion about the uh office
 
00:53:47.329 --> 00:53:47.339 align:start position:0%
of professional licensure I had the
 
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
occasion to try to contact them
 
00:53:49.020 --> 00:53:50.569 align:start position:0%
occasion to try to contact them
concerning

00:53:50.569 --> 00:53:50.579 align:start position:0%
concerning
 
00:53:54.109 --> 00:53:54.119 align:start position:0%
a small business in my area
 
00:53:57.710 --> 00:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
I called and they said uh you know press
 
00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:58.910 align:start position:0%
I called and they said uh you know press
one

00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
to get a directory enter the first and
 
00:54:07.030 --> 00:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
sorry it took me a second to click that
 
00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
to click in my brain of course I'm like
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
uh so I knew the first name of somebody
 
00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
so I kept calling I kept calling four
 
00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.569 align:start position:0%
so I kept calling I kept calling four
days

00:54:20.569 --> 00:54:20.579 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
35 phone calls
 
00:54:27.650 --> 00:54:27.660 align:start position:0%
I finally got a person
 
00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:30.480 align:start position:0%
and I said I need to get in touch with
 
00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
somebody in this department can you give
 
00:54:35.930 --> 00:54:35.940 align:start position:0%
me their first and last name and she
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
said and I quote
 
00:54:42.530 --> 00:54:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
how do I get her extension oh I can't
 
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
give that to you oh lovely
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
well how do I speak with the person oh
 
00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
my constituent already wrote a letter
 
00:54:59.270 --> 00:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
and got no response oh well they
 
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:06.530 --> 00:55:06.540 align:start position:0%
so I did find out that they are having a
 
00:55:08.750 --> 00:55:08.760 align:start position:0%
meeting uh next week and I will be there
 
00:55:12.049 --> 00:55:12.059 align:start position:0%
and I got an email from a person who I
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
got her first let last name from the
 
00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.430 align:start position:0%
got her first let last name from the
email

00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
email
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
stating we need to know why you're
 
00:55:21.890 --> 00:55:21.900 align:start position:0%
coming before us
 
00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:25.700 align:start position:0%
lovely said a constituent complaint
 
00:55:28.609 --> 00:55:28.619 align:start position:0%
that wasn't enough I got three emails
 
00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:31.079 align:start position:0%
from three different people
 
00:55:35.930 --> 00:55:35.940 align:start position:0%
more names so that's a big problem for
 
00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
people who are trying to open a child
 
00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
care center to find out what and who
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
where and when we need to work on that
 
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:55:54.290 --> 00:55:54.300 align:start position:0%
House Bill 655 in Eda is redoing oplc
 
00:55:56.750 --> 00:55:56.760 align:start position:0%
this may not be a bad time for a lot
 
00:55:58.549 --> 00:55:58.559 align:start position:0%
more input than some of this have
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:08.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:11.450 --> 00:56:11.460 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind of course um so uh the
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
ctes actually did end because the career
 
00:56:16.549 --> 00:56:16.559 align:start position:0%
was not considered one that could make
 
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
ends meet and so that was one of the
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
reasons the high schools did discontinue
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
it and I have a question if you don't
 
00:56:26.109 --> 00:56:26.119 align:start position:0%
mind um did you say John Lyons
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
so that's you know and to kind of Bring
 
00:56:31.849 --> 00:56:31.859 align:start position:0%
It Back full circle because we are oh
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I am a little confused about
 
00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
that because I have personal experience
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
my daughter actually went through a CTE
 
00:56:40.970 --> 00:56:40.980 align:start position:0%
program at Pinkerton Academy where she
 
00:56:45.170 --> 00:56:45.180 align:start position:0%
obtained her LNA and so that
 
00:56:48.829 --> 00:56:48.839 align:start position:0%
um obviously the hourly wage of an LNA
 
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
would be similar to the
 
00:56:54.290 --> 00:56:54.300 align:start position:0%
wage of somebody who would be a child
 
00:56:56.089 --> 00:56:56.099 align:start position:0%
care worker so how could they have
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
Justified that like what did I don't
 
00:57:01.790 --> 00:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
know that was again in 2015 that that
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
was what was happening they all stopped
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.609 --> 00:57:10.619 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
um it was justified it was really
 
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:15.780 align:start position:0%
a decision that was made on a very low
 
00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
level that got past the commissioner
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
because when the child care advisory
 
00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:21.660 align:start position:0%
Council went back and said this is an
 
00:57:23.870 --> 00:57:23.880 align:start position:0%
enormous mistake and should not be
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
happening they were able to reverse
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
their decision making but by then all of
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
the lab schools had closed so there was
 
00:57:34.309 --> 00:57:34.319 align:start position:0%
no point it was very very frustrating so
 
00:57:37.609 --> 00:57:37.619 align:start position:0%
I believe the last CTE program live
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
um lab school has closed recently it's
 
00:57:43.010 --> 00:57:43.020 align:start position:0%
just been and I I think to bring It full
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
circle and what we ended is because
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
we're at the end of the hour
 
00:57:45.839 --> 00:57:46.549 align:start position:0%
we're at the end of the hour
um

00:57:46.549 --> 00:57:46.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:49.010 --> 00:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
to bring this full circle
 
00:57:51.049 --> 00:57:51.059 align:start position:0%
they need to see that running their own
 
00:57:53.930 --> 00:57:53.940 align:start position:0%
Center is a logical career I don't want
 
00:57:56.750 --> 00:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
to say endpoint but let's say
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
viable oh trust me it's very viable uh
 
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's very viable
 
00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:02.930 align:start position:0%
it's very viable
um

00:58:02.930 --> 00:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:05.030 --> 00:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
we need to kind of open that path up and
 
00:58:06.170 --> 00:58:06.180 align:start position:0%
some of that's going to be a cultural
 
00:58:09.770 --> 00:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
issue honestly of getting people to
 
00:58:11.569 --> 00:58:11.579 align:start position:0%
understand it's it's scary to have
 
00:58:13.069 --> 00:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
employees but yes you can pay them and
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
their money will be there and you'll be
 
00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:15.410 align:start position:0%
their money will be there and you'll be
fine

00:58:15.410 --> 00:58:15.420 align:start position:0%
fine
 
00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:19.260 align:start position:0%
um with that I think um does anybody
 
00:58:20.750 --> 00:58:20.760 align:start position:0%
have anything else because I wanted to
 
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
be about an hour today and uh roll out
 
00:58:25.970 --> 00:58:25.980 align:start position:0%
yep Nelson I'm I'm really bad at taking
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
minutes so I'm really nervous about this
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
whole thing I didn't I'm sorry I did not
 
00:58:31.609 --> 00:58:31.619 align:start position:0%
get your last name and I did not get
 
00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:33.660 align:start position:0%
where you're from I really apologize no
 
00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:35.720 align:start position:0%
because that's fine it's Marianne
 
00:58:38.349 --> 00:58:38.359 align:start position:0%
m-a-r-i-a-n-n-e barter
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
b-a-r-t-e-r okay and I'm the executive
 
00:58:42.230 --> 00:58:42.240 align:start position:0%
director at Merrimack Valley daycare
 
00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
service but I'm the chair of the New
 
00:58:45.650 --> 00:58:45.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Child Care advisory Council
 
00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
you know a little bit about Child Care
 
00:58:50.089 --> 00:58:50.099 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so we're gonna end this
 
00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:51.660 align:start position:0%
up with this got some marching orders
 
00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
here uh I'm gonna go to the speaker's
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
office right now uh and see if we can
 
00:58:58.970 --> 00:58:58.980 align:start position:0%
late file uh a bill I'm the first thing
 
00:59:00.349 --> 00:59:00.359 align:start position:0%
that's fine can we do it right if we
 
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
can't do it uh we'll start I'll let you
 
00:59:05.089 --> 00:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
know representative we'll start um
 
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
bothering some Senators to get a late
 
00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:08.089 align:start position:0%
bothering some Senators to get a late
draft

00:59:08.089 --> 00:59:08.099 align:start position:0%
draft
 
00:59:11.089 --> 00:59:11.099 align:start position:0%
um I will look into where we said it was
 
00:59:13.010 --> 00:59:13.020 align:start position:0%
a license we said it was a law and a
 
00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:13.910 align:start position:0%
a license we said it was a law and a
rule

00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
rule
 
00:59:16.609 --> 00:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
right so I don't really care about the
 
00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
rule too much because we'll override
 
00:59:19.789 --> 00:59:19.799 align:start position:0%
that with the law
 
00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:21.540 align:start position:0%
um but I'll start looking into that
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
where it's appropriate
 
00:59:26.329 --> 00:59:26.339 align:start position:0%
um and we have let's say a nod agreement
 
00:59:26.339 --> 00:59:28.069 align:start position:0%
um and we have let's say a nod agreement
on

00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
um on the background check process
 
00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:30.950 align:start position:0%
um on the background check process
itself

00:59:30.950 --> 00:59:30.960 align:start position:0%
itself
 
00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
um drafting piece of legislation that
 
00:59:38.329 --> 00:59:38.339 align:start position:0%
will allow the query to send the results
 
00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
to the employer and DHHS simultaneously
 
00:59:44.809 --> 00:59:44.819 align:start position:0%
the employer will then have discretion
 
00:59:47.450 --> 00:59:47.460 align:start position:0%
based on the returns to allow the child
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
care worker to work in a supervised
 
00:59:49.680 --> 00:59:51.289 align:start position:0%
care worker to work in a supervised
capacity

00:59:51.289 --> 00:59:51.299 align:start position:0%
capacity
 
00:59:52.730 --> 00:59:52.740 align:start position:0%
um 90 days let me write that down
 
00:59:55.069 --> 00:59:55.079 align:start position:0%
because I will forget that thank you
 
00:59:57.370 --> 00:59:57.380 align:start position:0%
um while DHHS makes its final assessment
 
01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:01.260 align:start position:0%
and then we will uh I will go in and ask
 
01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
for seven hundred thousand dollars
 
01:00:08.809 --> 01:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
and be super super loved uh for that
 
01:00:10.609 --> 01:00:10.619 align:start position:0%
casual just it was a just a little
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
walking around money a little phone to
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
build up money
 
01:00:16.609 --> 01:00:16.619 align:start position:0%
um and um figure out what the appetite
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
is there for that part on the personal
 
01:00:20.270 --> 01:00:20.280 align:start position:0%
level I don't have a problem with it uh
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
if it kills us on late drafting
 
01:00:24.349 --> 01:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
but we'll find out we have some
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
political questions we have to answer
 
01:00:29.270 --> 01:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry a lot of questions I have
 
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:31.260 align:start position:0%
um but but what you were saying before
 
01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:33.900 align:start position:0%
is it's not certain that we would even
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
be fined the seven hundred thousand
 
01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
dollars that we may be fined according
 
01:00:41.210 --> 01:00:41.220 align:start position:0%
to what you were talking about sure okay
 
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:43.380 align:start position:0%
that was also my understanding this FYI
 
01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:46.680 align:start position:0%
is that we may I I I hold I I would love
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
our Congressman to explain why we're
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
paying a 700 000 fine uh to hire child
 
01:00:52.609 --> 01:00:52.619 align:start position:0%
care workers
 
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
um if they want to get in front of us
 
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
and tell us that they're more than
 
01:00:57.049 --> 01:00:57.059 align:start position:0%
welcome to anyways I will go and uh I do
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
have to ask right because it could
 
01:00:59.809 --> 01:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
happen right um figure out what the
 
01:01:01.609 --> 01:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
appetite is there for that
 
01:01:02.930 --> 01:01:02.940 align:start position:0%
um the co-work sound for the Committees
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
we're gonna start looking at these
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
regulations and rules
 
01:01:08.329 --> 01:01:08.339 align:start position:0%
um and uh find some ways to make things
 
01:01:10.190 --> 01:01:10.200 align:start position:0%
a little better and we're going to find
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
a way to kind of expedite these uh
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
getting these new child care centers
 
01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
spun up so it's not a uh send it off two
 
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
months later they might inspect you
 
01:01:22.670 --> 01:01:22.680 align:start position:0%
um so we're gonna take a look at that
 
01:01:23.569 --> 01:01:23.579 align:start position:0%
does anybody else have any questions
 
01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
comments or concerns before I close this
 
01:01:27.289 --> 01:01:27.299 align:start position:0%
up and go for an early learning you guys
 
01:01:29.089 --> 01:01:29.099 align:start position:0%
know how I love lunch all right thank
 
01:01:30.470 --> 01:01:30.480 align:start position:0%
you oh yes representative Williams I'm
 
01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:40.309 align:start position:0%
you oh yes representative Williams I'm
just

01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:42.289 --> 01:01:42.299 align:start position:0%
I'm just a whole bunch of child care uh
 
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
Center employers come and testify in
 
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
front of us for about two months and we
 
01:01:49.789 --> 01:01:49.799 align:start position:0%
compiled a finding list so it's probably
 
01:01:50.809 --> 01:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
similar to some of the things you're
 
01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:53.540 align:start position:0%
experiencing but a much broader depth of
 
01:01:56.450 --> 01:01:56.460 align:start position:0%
potential Solutions so I think it's
 
01:01:58.370 --> 01:01:58.380 align:start position:0%
timely and it may give us a little bit
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
of cliff notes for when we're reviewing
 
01:02:02.030 --> 01:02:02.040 align:start position:0%
this 35 page total and thank you for
 
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
doing yeah thank you for doing that the
 
01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:06.420 align:start position:0%
next time we meet I don't know if we'll
 
01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.400 align:start position:0%
meet in two weeks or three weeks uh once
 
01:02:09.589 --> 01:02:09.599 align:start position:0%
again we don't have legislation although
 
01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:10.980 align:start position:0%
if we get that emergency thing drafted
 
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:12.420 align:start position:0%
I'm going to demand that comes to us so
 
01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
we may have legislation
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:02:17.089 --> 01:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
um I will I will literally lose my mind
 
01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't come to us probably
 
01:02:23.690 --> 01:02:23.700 align:start position:0%
um so um I'll let I gave the community I
 
01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:25.079 align:start position:0%
think you guys had two weeks notice this
 
01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:26.640 align:start position:0%
time I'm gonna try to keep doing that I
 
01:02:28.609 --> 01:02:28.619 align:start position:0%
know we don't meet regularly and I know
 
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
we have two two or three members who
 
01:02:31.549 --> 01:02:31.559 align:start position:0%
have other things at the same time so
 
01:02:33.289 --> 01:02:33.299 align:start position:0%
trying to box it off really early but
 
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:36.180 align:start position:0%
um I'm gonna end this work session thank
 
01:02:37.430 --> 01:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
you guys so much I'm glad we actually
 
01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:39.780 align:start position:0%
got something sort of kind of done and
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:51.839 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
